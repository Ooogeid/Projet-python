1
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:11,010
While We Are Still Seeing Straight
And Enunciating Our Vowels.

2
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,388
Speak For Yourself.

3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,640
We Want You To Know That We
Could Not Be More Proud Of You.

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,392
- Thank You.
- Everyone Please Raise A Glass

5
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,321
To My Friend Jonah Miller,

6
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:24,253
Who Just Sold His First Screenplay!

7
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,029
They Say There's No Heart Left
In Hollywood.

8
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:33,699
But I Say It's Because It's
All Stuffed Into This Guy.

9
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,739
If I Win An Oscar, I'm Going To
Remember To Thank You Guys.

10
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,250
I Sure Hope That You've Been
Thinking About A Lot More

11
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,721
Than Just Your Acceptance Speech.

12
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,466
You Big Hollywood Screenwriter,

13
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:49,173
What's Next?

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,331
We Are Going To Land The Perfect
Actor For The Lead Role.

15
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,011
Owen Anderson.

16
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,642
That's Assuming He's Even
Going To Read The Script.

17
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,391
Stranger Things Have Happened.

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,018
Auggie Riding Off Into
The Sunset With Violet?

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,225
Never Underestimate The
Power Of A Full Moon.

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,338
Crap. I Got To Take This.

21
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:09,228
No Shots Without Me.
I'll Be Back.

22
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,648
My Pumpkin Carriage Has Arrived.

23
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,600
- Why?
- Because In 20 Minutes

24
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:17,868
My Glass Slippers Turn
Into Hospital Booties.

25
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,662
Can't You Go One Night
Without Saving Lives?

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,623
And Tonight, Promise Me
They're Neither Of Yours, Yes?

27
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:27,878
I Really Appreciate You Coming
Here And Waving The White Flag.

28
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,870
Whatever Happened Between You
And Riley Stays There, Okay?

29
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:34,223
- She Knows You're Still My Friend.
- Thank You.

30
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:39,473
Geez Louise.

31
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,395
Am I, Like,
In This Crazy Breakup Fog,

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,361
Or Are You Guys Getting Serious?

33
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:47,316
I Don't Know, But Whatever It Is
I Really Don't Want To Screw It Up.

34
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:48,986
How You Holding Up, Huh?

35
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:53,289
I Know You Always Imagined This Night
With One More On The Guest List, Though.

36
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,922
If Riley Were Here,
She'd Probably Make Some

37
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:58,889
Amazing Heartfelt Toast.

38
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,513
Assuming She'd Actually
Even Be Talking To Me.

39
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,674
Ella's Talking To You, So...

40
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:06,417
Why Don't You Just Sit
Back And Enjoy The Ride?

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,170
Okay, Look, I Have To Say...

42
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:11,714
Ella's Hot.

43
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,273
And She's Fun.

44
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,727
I Always Just Gravitate
To Girls With, Like,

45
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,013
Strong Moral Compasses.

46
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:20,863
But Ella's...

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,059
I Don't Hers Doesn't
Even Have A Needle.

48
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:28,189
Maybe It's Not Meant To Be.

49
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,650
To Moving Forward.

50
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:51,253
- What Is Going On Here?
- Brian Jonston, 35.

51
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,215
- Recovering From Coronary Bypass.
- I Know. He's My Patient.

52
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,842
He Had A Minor Skin Infection
After The Surgery.

53
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,303
So You Treated It With Penicillin?

54
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,653
He's Having An
Anaphylactic Reaction.

55
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,425
He's Allergic.

56
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,753
It Says So Here On His Chart.

57
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,493
Is Everything All Right?

58
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:17,937
It's Fine.

59
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:21,610
Give Him Ten Cc's Of Cipro.

60
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:24,404
Check Him Every 15 Minutes.

61
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,792
I Appreciate What You Did In There.
Smart Move.

62
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,009
Look, It's None Of My Business,

63
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,997
But After Everything That's Happened,
Do You Think It Might Be A Good Idea

64
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,814
- If You Take Some Time Off To Recharge?
- No, I'm Fine.

65
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,574
- It Was Simple Oversight.
- Dr. Mancini, With All Due Respect,

66
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:50,239
Your Patient Almost Died.

67
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,442
The Last Thing I Need Right Now Is
A Lecture From One Of My Students.

68
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,715
Now That Was One Mistake
And No One Needs To Know About It.

69
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,029
Is That Understood?

70
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,000
********************CREDITS*********************

71
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,565
You're A Filmmaker, Not A Rock Star.

72
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,635
Wake Up.

73
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,145
- Where Am I?
- Last Night, While You And David...

74
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,397
Were On Your 12th Tequila Shot,
And Licking Salt

75
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,098
Off Strange Women, I...

76
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,957
Was Working My Butt Off.

77
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,328
I'm On The Cover Of Variety And
The Hollywood Reporter?

78
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:49,465
El, People, Like,
Subscribe To These Magazines.

79
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,743
Even Deadline Hollywood
Gave You A Shout Out.

80
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:52,897
Nice Work.

81
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:55,878
Nikki Finke Was Only
Mildly Sarcastic.

82
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,297
- How Did You Pull This Off?
- What Do You Think I'm doing

83
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,571
On My Blackberry All Day,
Playing Frogger?

84
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:02,635
No, This...
Is My Job.

85
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:06,429
Thank You, Ella.
You Are Incredible.

86
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,084
Beyond Incredible Actually.

87
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,186
Especially Now That I
Scored You A Meeting

88
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,813
- With Owen Anderson. A-list Actor.
- Are You Kidding?

89
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:18,317
No. He Read Your Script.
He Wants To Ask You Some Questions.

90
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,829
How...? I Didn't Even Think
Heller Was Sending It Out Yet.

91
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:21,820
He's Not.

92
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,158
But I Happen To Know That
Owen Was Going To Fiji

93
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,901
He's to Shoot His
New Comedy Tomorrow,

94
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,160
So I Might Have Slipped
It To Him Last Week.

95
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:30,771
Who's Up For Some Roscoe's
Chicken And Waffles?

96
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,630
No One. Jonah Needs To Shower,

97
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,578
Change And Gargle A
Vat Of Listerine...

98
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,013
Before His Meeting
With Owen Anderson.

99
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,713
You Do Realize You're Setting Up

100
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,591
Your Star Client With Someone Who
Couldn't Even Make It Up The Stairs?

101
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,400
So?

102
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,044
Just Saying.

103
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,227
Jonah's On The Cover Of Variety.

104
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:55,938
Congratulations.

105
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,639
Was That Awkward For Anyone Else?

106
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,654
So Not The Cure To My Hangover.

107
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,442
That Is The New Guy That
Moved Into Auggie's Place.

108
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,694
We Traded Zen Chef
For A Poor Man's Van Halen.

109
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,571
Tell Him To Stop.

110
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,321
You Go Get Him, Lor.

111
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,411
You Do Not Bother That Girl
When She's Trying To Sleep In.

112
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,393
Excuse Me! Hi!

113
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,857
- Want To Make A Request?
- Yeah, Shut Up!

114
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,526
Half Of West Hollywood's
Trying To Sleep.

115
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:44,579
Crap, I'm Sorry.

116
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,377
I Didn't Know My Speaker Was On.
I Hate When That Happens.

117
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:49,351
Plus, Had I Known
Everybody Was Listening,

118
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,215
I For Sure Would
Have Played Clapton.

119
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,664
I Don't Know Who You Are,
Or Which Tour Bus You Fell Off,

120
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:58,160
But I Get To Sleep In
One Day A Year.

121
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,919
- And Today Was That Day.
- Do You Always Wake Up This Cranky?

122
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:03,538
Look, From Now On,

123
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:07,009
Can You Please Just Have
A Modicum Of Respect For This Courtyard?

124
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,048
Thank You.

125
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,708
See You At The Pool.

126
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:18,830
She Seemed Nice.

127
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,670
Come In. I Only Have A Few Minutes,

128
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:33,118
- So Make It Quick.
- Thanks Again For Meeting With Me.

129
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:34,953
You Look... Nice.

130
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,706
It's A Far Cry From
Smocks And Sandals.

131
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,545
- Have You Been Interviewing With Schools?
- That's Actually Why I'm Here.

132
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,003
This Late In The Year,
None Of The Schools Are Hiring.

133
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,207
But While I Was Researching,
I Found Out That

134
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,496
Ziggurat Software Has One
Of The Most Progressive

135
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:51,470
Education Foundations In The Country.
I Thought, Since You're Dating The Ceo

136
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,680
You Want Me To Introduce You To Ben.

137
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,751
I Hope I'm Not
Overstepping Boundaries.

138
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,852
But Do You Think He Might Be
Interested In Hearing Some Of My Ideas?

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,368
Sweetheart, Aren't You A First Grade
School Teacher?

140
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:05,486
I Don't Think Ben Needs A Lot Of
Help With His Abc's.

141
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,727
Obviously Not.

142
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,533
But I'd Like To Think That
Some Of The Programs I Started

143
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,076
At 34th Street School Made A
Difference In A Few Lives.

144
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,171
I Think That Ben Might Like...

145
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,106
As Impressive As It Sounds,

146
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,582
I Just Don't Think That You
Have The Qualifications...

147
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,109
Of Someone That Ben
Would Typically Hire.

148
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,228
Maybe Not.

149
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:27,131
But Can't He At Least Be
The One To Decide That?

150
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:28,810
Fine.

151
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:31,414
If He Has The Time,
I'll Give His Assistant Your Number.

152
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:33,637
Thank You.

153
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,490
But Do Me A Favor.

154
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,724
Don't Get Your Hopes Up, Okay?

155
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,235
Please Tell Me You've
Heard From The Sec

156
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,988
About My Sociopathic
Financial Advisor.

157
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,499
It's Not Good News, Amanda.

158
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,117
There's No Way To
Recover Your Losses.

159
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:57,995
What Are You Talking About?

160
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,712
That Bastard Stole $15 Million.

161
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:02,225
It's Got To Be Somewhere.

162
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,376
It Was, But He Spent It.

163
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:06,962
All Of It.

164
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,631
You're Broke, Amanda.

165
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,134
And If You Keep Borrowing
Against Wpk's Assets,

166
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:13,832
Your Business Will Collapse

167
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,763
And Take You Right Down With It.

168
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,761
That'll Be All.

169
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,136
I've Heard Of Vip Passes
To Meet A-listers,

170
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:53,671
I've Never Heard Of Having
To Pass A Height Requirement.

171
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,359
Owen's Pretty
Much A Gigantic Toddler.

172
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:58,198
He Comes Here Whenever He's In Town.

173
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,476
Look Who It Is.

174
00:10:06,294 --> 00:10:09,675
Cruella Simms.
My Pocket-sized Publicist.

175
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,484
You Are Such A Badass.

176
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,363
Put Me Down Now.

177
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,295
Please.

178
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:18,138
And You, You Must Be Jonah.

179
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:19,209
How Are You?

180
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,208
Writer Of One Of The Most
Bitchin' Scripts I've Ever Read.

181
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:27,607
Thank You.

182
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:30,128
I Laughed Out Loud All Night.
Incredible.

183
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:34,967
"Schools For Educational Evolution
And Development." That's Catchy.

184
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:39,263
They're Called Seed Schools For Kids In
L.A.'s Dangerous And Underserviced Districts.

185
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,094
Privately Funded Boarding Schools.

186
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:44,933
That's Like A Lost Lyric
From A John Lennon Song.

187
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,662
I Guess You Could Say
I'm Kind Of An Idealist.

188
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,898
Good. We Need More Of You
Young Visionaries.

189
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,790
People Who Have At Least Set Foot In
A Classroom In The Last Decade Or So.

190
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:55,718
I Swear,
I'm Still Dealing With People

191
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:57,823
Who Think A Tweeis A Birdcall.

192
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,327
Oh, My Goodness.

193
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,535
I Am Late.

194
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,403
Big Segway Polo Match.

195
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:08,115
Wozniack Has Been Trying To
Take Our Title All Year Long.

196
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:11,461
Okay, So You'll Just Let
Me Know About My Idea?

197
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:14,047
Or I Could Just Tell You
I Love It Right Now,

198
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,065
And I Want To Fund Your Project.

199
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:17,607
Are You Serious?

200
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:20,846
You May Not Be The Most Experienced
Person I've Ever Thought Of Hiring,

201
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,681
But Your Presentation Rocked,

202
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,621
And I Didn't Get Where I Am Today
By Not Taking Chances.

203
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,752
The Man's On Fire. Yeah.

204
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:40,287
Man, I Got To Tell You,
My Favorite Part, The Part Where

205
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:43,201
Jacob Ends Up In The
Sauna With Rachel's Dad...

206
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,955
Nothing Funnier Than Man Boobs,
Right?

207
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,084
One Of The Most Uncomfortable
Moments Of My Life.

208
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,721
That Actually Happened To You?

209
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:55,336
Jonah Based His Script On His Life.

210
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:58,800
Dude, No Wonder I Frickin' Loved
It So Much. The Story's Real?

211
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,484
You Didn't Know... It Was...
Except For A Few Creative Liberties,

212
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:02,885
All Real Unfortunately.

213
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,974
Like Jacob's Love Interest-
Much Funnier In The Movie.

214
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,684
What Do You Mean?
I Think Riley's Funny.

215
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,395
Wait, Oh, So Riley Is Rachel, Right?

216
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,747
Jacob's Muse?

217
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,851
Where Is She?
I Would Love To Meet That Girl.

218
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:16,318
You Know, Just For Research.

219
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:18,904
Just One Little Problem...

220
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,864
No, There's No Problem.

221
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,039
You Can Call Her.

222
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,040
Call Her?

223
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,292
Could You Give Us,
Like, One Quick Second?

224
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:34,285
I'll See You At The Next Hole.

225
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,170
Be Right There.

226
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,890
There Is Absolutely No
Way I'm Calling Riley

227
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,845
To Reminisce About A Relationship
That Just Completely Blew Up.

228
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:46,026
Owen Likes The
Dynamic In The Script.

229
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,335
What If He Senses, Like,
The Major Tension Between Us?

230
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,099
No, He Won't, Okay?

231
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,978
Riley Can Play Nice For One Day.

232
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:54,543
That's It. All Right?

233
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:58,238
You Might Have Broken Up, But She
Is A Good Person With A Gigantic Heart.

234
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,895
She Is Gonna Do This.

235
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,826
That Transfer From Johns Hopkins,
He's Waiting For You At Reception.

236
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:10,219
- Excuse Me?
- The Dean Wanted You To Show Him The Ropes.

237
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,583
Been In That Position.

238
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,093
Might As Well Pay It Forward.

239
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:23,305
You're Mansfer From Johns Hopkins?

240
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,178
You Actually Inspire
People To Stay Alive?

241
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,472
- Are You Stalking Me?
- Don't Flatter Yourself.

242
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,621
I Got The Apartment Listing
From The Admin Bulletin Board.

243
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:33,409
So If You're Going To Be Mad,
Be Mad At Whoever Posted It.

244
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:35,144
That Would Have Been Me.

245
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:37,143
- Come On.
- How About We Start Over.

246
00:13:37,268 --> 00:13:38,343
Drew Pragin.

247
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,150
Let's Hope
You're Better At Playing Doctor

248
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,625
Than You Are At Playing Guitar.

249
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,926
I'm Actually Very Good.
Still Don't Know Your Name.

250
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,492
Lauren Yung, Third Year.

251
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,991
This Is Alice Redding, 75.

252
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,705
She's Suffered From An
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.

253
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,665
Not Big On Small Talk, Huh?

254
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,876
She's Recovering From An
Endovascular Stent Graft.

255
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,761
Her Bp's Being Monitored Constantly.

256
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:00,788
- I Figured Out Why You Don't Like Me.
- Not Liking You Would Presuppose...

257
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:03,940
- Actually Having Thought About You.
- You Don't Think I'm Serious Enough.

258
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:05,132
Let Me Guess...

259
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:07,572
You Were The Only Sophomore

260
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,011
In Your Ap Bio Class, Am Right?

261
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:11,927
I Can See You Now...

262
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,051
With Your Braces
And Your Knee-highs.

263
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,556
Taking A Scalpel To Your
Very First Fetal Pig.

264
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,421
It's Kind Of Adorable.

265
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:21,821
Call Me "adorable" Again.
You'll See What I Can Do With A Scalpel.

266
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:24,395
Yes, Or No. Your Idea Of A Movie Night
Is Sneaking Popcorn

267
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,384
Into The Surgery Observation Deck.

268
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:29,701
Right, 'cause Heaven Forbid I
Should Take My Job Seriously.

269
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:32,204
When Was The Last Time You Laughed?

270
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm Not Here To Laugh.

271
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,208
Look, I'm Not Going to
Heal Mrs. Redding heart

272
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,752
By Putting On A Clown Nose And
Telling Knock-knock Jokes.

273
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:42,088
Maybe Not, But It's Not Going To
Kill Her To Make Her Smile Either.

274
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:45,950
Come On.

275
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:49,600
From Vanessa Mancini?

276
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:53,022
<i>"David, If You're Reading This,
It Means I'm Gone,</i>

277
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:57,426
<i>and Michael Needs To Know The Truth</i>
<i>about The Night You And I Spent Together.</i>

278
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:01,497
<i>Shortly After Noah Was Born,</i>
<i>I Ran A Paternity Test.</i>

279
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,626
<i>Michael's Not Noah's Father, David.
You Are.</i>

280
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,384
<i>Vanessa."</i>

281
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,039
Somebody Order Delivery?

282
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,601
Glass Walls. What Am I Thinking?

283
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,198
That Maybe We Could Teach
The Bullpen A Trick Or Two?

284
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,654
I'd Love To, But I'm Starving.

285
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,387
Nice Unicorn Band-aid.

286
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,070
Yeah, Courtesy Of Riley Richmond.

287
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,537
- Did She Bite You?
- Just A Paper Cut.

288
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,410
Thanks For Taking The Meeting. I Hope
It Didn't Waste Too Much Of Your Time.

289
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:56,086
No, Actually, I Hired Her.

290
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,539
You're Kidding Me.

291
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,892
No. She Has This Dream

292
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:02,504
of Building Boarding Schools
In The Inner City.

293
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,004
Honey, Everybody Has Dreams,

294
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,922
But I Think Her Only Real Experience

295
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,757
Is With United Shoes
And Finger Paint.

296
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,338
Well, My Team Needs A Fresh,
Young Perspective.

297
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:11,845
And So She's The Perfect Fit.

298
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,025
Happy To Hear It.

299
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,519
But You Didn't Trek Moo Shu Pork
Through The Beverly Hills Lunch Rush

300
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,710
To Talk About Riley Richmond,
Did You?

301
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,081
Riley Who?

302
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:24,529
Exactly.

303
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,095
I'd Like To Make A Payment
Into My Account Please. $1,500.

304
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,636
According To The University Records,
You're All Paid Up.

305
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:34,529
I Wish.

306
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:36,404
Seriously. Zero Balance.

307
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:41,643
I Checked Online Yesterday

308
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,669
And I Still Had An Outstanding
Balance Of $16,000.

309
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,047
Says There Was A Payment In
That Amount Made This Morning.

310
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,117
Either Our Office
Made A Huge Mistake

311
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,292
Or You've Got Yourself A Guardian
Angel With Some Deep Pockets.

312
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,280
Right.
Thank You.

313
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,799
I'm On My Way Out.

314
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,025
I've Just Come From
The Bursar's Office

315
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,621
And Someone Made An Anonymous
Donation To My Tuition.

316
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:11,014
Congratulations.

317
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:12,551
You Didn't Have To Do That.

318
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:15,810
You Think I Paid Off One
Of My Student's Tuition?

319
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,577
You're Good,
But You're Not That Good.

320
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:21,289
Dr. Mancini, I-i'm Serious.
I Can't Take Your Money.

321
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,669
It Wasn't Mine.

322
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,653
But Since The Bill's
Already Been Paid,

323
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,961
Then There's Really Nothing
You Can Do About It, Is There?

324
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,664
- Who?
- New Transfer From Johns Hopkins.

325
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,992
Fellow Member Of Aoa. Huge Fan.

326
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,175
Means Nothing To Me.

327
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,098
Welcome To Ula.

328
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,856
I'm Glad You Think It's Funny.

329
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:53,415
- What Is It?
- Can You Hear Me?

330
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,616
Where Are You?

331
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,491
I'm At The Malibu
Speed Zone Right Now,

332
00:17:56,952 --> 00:18:00,422
With This Really
Random Question For You.

333
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:02,190
Yeah, What?

334
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,834
Owen Anderson... He, Uh,
He Really Wants To Meet You.

335
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:08,753
- The Actor?
- I Know, It's Crazy, Right?

336
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,933
I'm Meeting Him Here Today
For Living In Reverse,

337
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:15,343
and He's Like, "hey, Man,
I'd Love To Meet Riley

338
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,317
just, You Know, To See What Inspired You
To Create These Characters."

339
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:21,099
So You Want Me To Act Like
Everything's Good Between Us?

340
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,935
I Know I'm The Last Person
You Want To Be Around Right Now.

341
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:25,591
I Get That.

342
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:29,360
It's Just The Five Incredibly
Happy Years We Spent Together...

343
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,068
- That Is What This Movie's About.
- I Know.

344
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:33,903
Do You Think I Can Relieve All
Those Memories Without

345
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,114
Going Through The Emotions
That Went Along With Them?

346
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,824
Why Would I Want To Put
Myself Through That?

347
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,118
I Know, I Know. I'm An Idiot.
I Don't Know Why.

348
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,039
It's The Most Ridiculous Thing
I Could Have Asked You To Do.

349
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,331
I Just... I'm So Caught Up
In The Moment Right Now,

350
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,553
And I'm Still On This High
From Selling My Script.

351
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:51,451
And I Am Sitting Here Sharing My Life
With Owen Freaking Anderson.

352
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:54,966
I Mean, Who Wouldn't Be.
You Wrote It With Him In Mind.

353
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,926
I Know, And Now He's Like,
"hey, Man, Just Call Riley."

354
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:00,055
I'm Like, Sure, Jump Off A Cliff-
Okay, No Problem.

355
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:02,390
Aw, I Wasn't Thinking.

356
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:06,784
This... Was Not Really Fair
Of Me To Ask You. I'm Sorry.

357
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,709
Do Not Disturb.

358
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,169
Read The Sign.

359
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:25,097
It's David...

360
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,367
Come On, Dad, Open The Door.

361
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:43,973
- What The Hell Do You Want?
- I Don't Want To Fight.

362
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,349
- Where's Noah?
- With Vanessa's Sister.

363
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:51,589
He'll Be At The House
Until I'm Off Probation.

364
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:55,711
- Isn't This Your Bat Signal?
- Whoever It's For...

365
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:58,074
They'll Probably Live
Longer Without My Help.

366
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,080
How Many Of These
Have You Had To Drink?

367
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,041
What Are You, My Father Now?

368
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:13,378
Come On, Dad.
You Can't Hide In Here Forever.

369
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,256
Vanessa Killed Sydney.

370
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,006
It's Not Your Fault.

371
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,321
Vanessa found out about my affair.

372
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,389
I Did Everything But Put
The Knife In Her Hand.

373
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,015
I Have...

374
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,310
Destroyed Everything That's
Ever Come Into My Life.

375
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,234
Every Marriage, Every Second Chance.

376
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,233
Even My Relationship With You.

377
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:38,778
And Now The Only Thing
I Have Left Is Noah.

378
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:42,740
And I Can't Look At
Him Without Knowing...

379
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,454
That I'm The Reason...

380
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,620
He'll Grow Up Without A Mother.

381
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,103
Dad, There's Something You
Need To Know About Noah.

382
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:59,924
Before You And Vanessa Ever Met...

383
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:04,846
She And I Got Together.

384
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:08,343
- What Are You Talking About?
- It Was At That Racquetball Tournament.

385
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,725
She Was New In Town.
You Guys Didn't Even Know Each Other.

386
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:13,271
Why Are You Telling Me This?

387
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:25,842
Noah's Not Your Son, Dad.

388
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:27,535
He's Mine.

389
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:31,080
I Know It's A Lot To Process.
I'm Just As Surprised As You Are.

390
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,267
Get Out.

391
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,751
I Have No Intention Of
Taking Him From You.

392
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,316
I Just Want To Be Able To Spend
As Much Time As I Can With Him.

393
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:39,172
You Will Never
Get Close To My Child.

394
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,091
You Will Not Talk To Him.
You Will Not Write To Him.

395
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,177
As Far As He's Concerned,
You Don't Exist.

396
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,055
I'm Not Just Going To Disappear.

397
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:24,715
You Don't Trust Your
Minions To Do That For You?

398
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:28,554
No Big Deal.
Just Bumped Into A File Cabinet.

399
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:31,266
Everything Okay With You?

400
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,477
It's My Heart.

401
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,979
You Actually Have One?

402
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,024
It's Been, Um...
Beating Irregularly.

403
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:42,944
This Morning I Thought I
Was Having A Heart Attack.

404
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:45,158
Grab A Seat.

405
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:58,662
Your Heart Sounds Fine.
Any Other Symptoms?

406
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:01,004
Shortness Of Breath, Dizziness,

407
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,754
- Sweating?
- All Of The Above. Why?

408
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:06,032
Are You Experiencing A
Lot Of Stress Lately?

409
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:09,637
I Want You To Think. Work,
Family Problems, Relationships?

410
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,139
No More Than Anyone Else.

411
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,307
The Truth, Amanda.

412
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,645
That Is The Truth.

413
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:17,674
I Mean, Wpk Is Doing Well.

414
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,148
And Ben Is Wonderful.

415
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,278
Sounds Like You're
Having Panic Attacks.

416
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:27,908
Panic Attacks?
That's Ridiculous.

417
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,450
My-my Life Is Perfect.

418
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:32,040
It's Better Than Perfect.

419
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:34,203
I'm Writing You A
Prescription For Sertraline.

420
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:36,414
- I Don't Need...
- Please,

421
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,498
No Arguing.

422
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:39,917
Now If You Don't Start
Feeling Better Immediately,

423
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,586
I Want You To Call Me.

424
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:45,048
Thank You, Michael.

425
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:46,674
And I'd Appreciate...

426
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:48,593
Keeping This Between Us.

427
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:50,671
I'll Add It To The List.

428
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:18,854
You're Here?

429
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:22,460
You Actually Came.
Thank You.

430
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm Not Here For You.
I'm Here For Jonah.

431
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:27,423
Where Is He?

432
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,884
Owen Dragged On The Racetrack
For A Playdate.

433
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:32,600
Can We Just Get This Over With?

434
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:35,515
Of Course. So You Being Here Right Now
Is That Selfish Thing

435
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,605
That Attracted Jacob To Rachel.

436
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,641
It's What Made You Supercouple
All Those Years

437
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:41,681
And Exactly What Owen
Needs To Hear About.

438
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:43,886
If You Two Can Keep Things Positive,

439
00:24:44,011 --> 00:24:46,442
There Is A Good Chance We Can Cast An
A-lister For The Part.

440
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,962
Hi. I'm Riley.

441
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,239
Jonah Never Said
that you were a goddess.

442
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,370
Man, I Feel Like I Totally Know You.

443
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,664
Tell Me Everything There
Is To Learn About

444
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,916
The Loveable Jacob And Rachel.

445
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:11,332
So, First Time We Meet,
At A Halloween Party,

446
00:25:11,457 --> 00:25:13,377
And We're Both Waiting
In Line For The Bathroom.

447
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:15,304
And Jonah Was Darth Vader...

448
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,432
- And I Was This 600-pound Sumo Wrestler.
- Sumo Wrestler. Huge.

449
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,393
Did You Actually Get
Stuck In That Doorway?

450
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,068
Oh, My God, Yeah.

451
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,522
Not Stuck... Wedged.

452
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:27,844
I'm Talking Bust Out The Crisco,
Major Emergency.

453
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:29,834
Yeah, And Meanwhile,
There's This Long Line

454
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,849
Of Drunk Frat Boys Waiting
To Use The Bathroom,

455
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:33,864
And There I Am In This
Ridiculous Costume,

456
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:35,992
- Like, Totally Blocking The Door.
- She's, Like...

457
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,184
So I Just. I Holster My Lightsaber,

458
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:39,996
I Grab This Big Sumo Belt...

459
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,924
And Just Start Yanking
As Hard As I Could.

460
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,375
Oh, A-and She... You Fell...

461
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,252
Yes, Yeah, That's Right.

462
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,413
Oh, And Say What You Said,
Say What You Said.

463
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,490
I Can't Breathe.

464
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:55,845
That's Classic, Man,
It's So Funny, I Love That.

465
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,219
So Sweet.

466
00:25:57,965 --> 00:26:00,406
Irony Is I Was Actually Planning
On Being A Pirate, But...

467
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,436
Saw The Sumo Outfit...
And Changed My Mind At The Last Second.

468
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:04,812
No Way.

469
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,746
Wait, So You Guys
Almost Didn't Even Meet?

470
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:08,649
Dude, Why Didn't You Put
That in the script?

471
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,068
Characters That Change Their Mind
That's Way Too Confusing

472
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,863
For The Audience, So I Wanted
To Keep It Simple And Clean.

473
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,905
I Don't Think It's
That Unrealistic...

474
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,861
For Rachel To Hesitate
Before Committing...

475
00:26:17,986 --> 00:26:20,369
Her Entire Night To Some Enormous,

476
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,205
Suffocating Costume.

477
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:26,966
Why Don't We Talk About The Graduation
Scene That Happens In Act Two?

478
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,956
Actually, You Know, I Kind Of Want
To Feel Out This Vibe Right Here.

479
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:33,841
What, This?

480
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,676
This Is Nothing.

481
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,744
Riley Just Has This
Teeny Bad Habit...

482
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:41,381
Of Changing Her Mind.

483
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:43,267
He's Referring To Our Engagement.

484
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:45,478
I Didn't Answer Immediately,

485
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,772
Then All Hell Broke Loose,
And We Broke Up.

486
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,823
Dude, Splitsville? No Way.

487
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:56,932
W-where's That Story?

488
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:58,631
Look, They May Have Broken Up,

489
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:00,085
But That Does Not Mean...

490
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,535
That They Didn't Share
A Storybook Love Story.

491
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,736
Storybook?

492
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:04,910
You Slept With Him.

493
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,377
Whoa, What? Dude,

494
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,238
Jacob And Rachel's Destinies...

495
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,257
Are Cosmically Intertwined,
And You Cheated On Her?

496
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,425
No, No, See,
I Didn't Cheat On Her...

497
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,427
Because Riley And I Had
already ended things,

498
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,443
So Technically It Was Over.

499
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:22,807
And Who Was There Waiting?
The Vulture In Versace.

500
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,946
There's That Sense Of Humor
We Were Just Talking About.

501
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,147
You Know What? I'm Done.
I'm Sorry, Owen.

502
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,126
I Like Your Movies, But I Don't
Need To Be Dragged Through This.

503
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,530
Why Don't I Go Talk To Her?

504
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:41,060
Perfect, That's Really Going To
Help Patch Things Up Here, Ella.

505
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,081
I Am So Sorry About...

506
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,374
Why Didn't You Tell Me
That You Guys Broke Up?

507
00:27:47,823 --> 00:27:50,167
Look, Your Story Felt So Real,

508
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,669
And I-i Wanted To...

509
00:27:52,023 --> 00:27:54,253
Get To Know These Characters
A Little Bit Better.

510
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:56,255
But, Honestly, Now I Just Feel...

511
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:58,259
Confused.

512
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:01,804
Sorry, Man.

513
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:16,774
Can You Just Come Back Here
So We Can Straighten Things Out?

514
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:18,076
If I Had Known You Were Behind This,

515
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:20,211
I Would Have Never Come
Anywhere Near Here.

516
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,444
So You're Just Going To Let Jonah's
Career Slip Through His Fingers?

517
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:25,884
My God, How Selfish Are You?

518
00:28:26,648 --> 00:28:27,852
Oh, I'm Selfish?

519
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:31,230
You're The One Who Didn't Even Wait
A Day Before Roping Him Into Bed.

520
00:28:31,355 --> 00:28:33,419
Please, Sweetheart,
Like It Took Convincing.

521
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,835
Honestly,
I Don't Know What He Sees In You.

522
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:38,353
I Guess You Massage
Someone's Ego Enough

523
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:40,772
- And You Eventually Become Attractive.
- Do You Have Any Idea...

524
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:42,674
Why Jonah And I Started Hanging Out?

525
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:45,637
Okay, He Had An Extra
Ticket To A Coen Brothers...

526
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:47,391
Film Festival That You Bailed On.

527
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,807
Like That Wasn't The
Best Day Of Your Life.

528
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:51,354
He Came To Me, Riley,

529
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,712
Just Like He Did Every Other Time
You Slammed The Door In His Face.

530
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:56,214
How Delusional Are You?

531
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:58,116
Do You Really Think
Jonah Finds Comfort

532
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:00,418
In Some Selfish Home Wrecker
Who Hasn't Committed

533
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:03,616
To Anything More Than A Pair Of Shoes
In Her Entire Life?

534
00:29:03,946 --> 00:29:06,391
You Might Be Able To Talk
Movies And Get Him Meetings...

535
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:08,537
But You Will Never Win
Over His Heart.

536
00:29:10,712 --> 00:29:12,597
Jonah's Way Too Good For You.

537
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:28,526
You're Going To Destroy Your Auditory
System By The Time You're 30.

538
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,745
Sorry, What?
Couldn't Hear You.

539
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,877
You're An Idiot, You Know That?

540
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:38,222
- Coming Through.
- Get Away From Me.

541
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:40,611
- Found Her Wandering The Streets.
- Leave Me Alone.

542
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,196
Seriously, This Is So Illegal.

543
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,225
Here We Go.

544
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,464
What's Your Name, Sweetheart?

545
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:48,641
Why, So You Can Call My Parents?

546
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:49,995
I'm Not A Moron.

547
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,664
Honey,
If We Don't Know What Happened,

548
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,535
- We Can't Help You.
- Good, I Don't Want Your Help.

549
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,710
- Just Let Me Go.
- You Need To Calm Down.

550
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:58,337
All Of You People Suck.

551
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,547
- Stop.
- Guys,

552
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,257
Can I Have A Second Here, Please?

553
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:03,648
Alone.

554
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:05,594
You, Too.

555
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:10,768
- Are You Serious?
- This May Be The One Time I Am.

556
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:18,357
All Right, Here's The Thing.

557
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,067
I Don't Really Care What Happened,

558
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,944
But If I Don't Write
Something Down In Your File,

559
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,968
My Boss Freaks Out,
So If It's Cool With You,

560
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm Just Going To Fill
This Out With Some fiction.

561
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:27,605
Fine By Me.

562
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,701
Great.

563
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,948
- What Are You Writing?
- Just That You Crashed

564
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:38,127
On Your Razor Scooter.

565
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,717
My Razor Scooter?

566
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:41,185
What, Am I Nine?

567
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,966
At Least Say I Was Driving A Car...
Going 80.

568
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,958
That's Good. That's Very Good.
That's Way Better Than Mine.

569
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:50,528
And I'll Say Your Car Did What,
Like, A Nasty Flip Off Mulholland?

570
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:52,516
No, I Hit A Giant Tree...

571
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,186
On Alpine, Exploded Both My Airbags.

572
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:58,063
Tell Me You Were
Wearing A Seat Belt.

573
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,438
Yeah, And Now My Ribs Kill.

574
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:04,776
I Think I Got Everything I Needed Here,
Except For A Name.

575
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:08,170
How About, Dumbo?

576
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:10,615
- Dumbo?
- Is That Two Ms Or One?

577
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,702
Two, Right?

578
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,497
Just Put My Real Name...

579
00:31:14,877 --> 00:31:16,189
Caitlin Rogers.

580
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
All Right.

581
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,506
Not Bad.

582
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,549
You Should See Me With Animals.

583
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:32,723
Wendi,
Thank You For Calling Me Back.

584
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,573
Your Voice Mail Sounded Urgent.
Is Everything Okay?

585
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:39,063
Yeah, I'm-i'm Good.
Actually, I'm Really Good.

586
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,233
I Paid Off My Tuition,
So... I'm Done.

587
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:45,059
- Oh, Well, That's Great, Lauren.
- Thank You.

588
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:48,719
But Aren't You Forgettin Something?
I Told You I Never Forget A Debt.

589
00:31:49,412 --> 00:31:52,423
- You Owe Me One Last Job.
- I'll Just Pay You Back.

590
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:53,994
I've Got $1,500.

591
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,872
Too Late, I Already Booked You For
Tonight And I Can't Let This Client Down.

592
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:00,042
Wendi, I'm-i'm Sure You
Can Find Another Girl.

593
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,934
It's A Busy Night.
Everybody's Taken.

594
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,139
I'm-i'm Sorry, But I'm Done.

595
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:06,882
I Can't Do This Anymore.

596
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,267
Lauren, Do I Need To Remind
You What You Have To Lose?

597
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:13,411
One Phone Call
To The Medical Board...

598
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:15,057
And All This Is For Nothing.

599
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,310
Are You Threatening Me?

600
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,230
Do I Need To?

601
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:28,617
One More.

602
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,975
Thank God.

603
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:39,540
I Started To Feel Naked
Without This Thing.

604
00:32:39,862 --> 00:32:41,139
You Know What I'm Good At?

605
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:44,142
Just Taking Something
That's Really Amazing...

606
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:46,588
And Then Screwing It Up Completely.

607
00:32:48,736 --> 00:32:49,428
God.

608
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:53,971
- When Did I Go Wrong With All This?
- When You Started Trusting Me.

609
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:59,852
I Should Not Have Asked You
To Drag Riley Into A Dog And Pony Show.

610
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,928
- This Whole Thing Was A Mistake.
- No, We Both Had To Vent.

611
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:07,443
We Just Chose The Worst Possible
Venue Ever.

612
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:09,524
No, I'm Talking About Us.

613
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:12,156
We... Are A Mistake.

614
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:15,034
You And Riley Are Cut From The Same

615
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:18,233
Snuggly, Fuzzy Cloth, And I'm...

616
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:22,625
Let's Face It,
I'm Industrial-strength Sandpaper.

617
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,942
No, You Guys Have
Five Years Of Fairy Tale.

618
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,132
And What Do I Have,
Five Years Of One-night Engagements?

619
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:33,218
I Can Kick Open Doors
For Your Career All Day Long,

620
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,527
But When It Comes To
Actually Opening Myself Up...

621
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:40,656
And Letting Somebody In, It's...
It's An Entirely Different Story.

622
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,412
And Yes, I Am Selfish, But...

623
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:50,444
It's Just Because I
Don't Want To Get Hurt.

624
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:53,377
No, Jonah, I'm Serious.

625
00:33:53,502 --> 00:33:55,699
Why Do You Think That I
Spend Every Last Ounce...

626
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:57,493
Of Energy That
I Have On My Career...

627
00:33:58,267 --> 00:33:59,453
Or Why I'd Rather Be

628
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,039
At A Business Meeting
Than A Candlelit Dinner?

629
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:06,345
I'm Not As Tough As You Think, Okay?

630
00:34:08,441 --> 00:34:10,130
I Can't Handle Having My Heart Broken.

631
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:15,124
I Want To Rewrite My Script.

632
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:18,555
What?

633
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,116
Owen Totally Responded To The
Authenticity,

634
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,829
But There's One Part
That's Just Complete Fiction

635
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,414
The Ending.
Can We Call Him Right Now?

636
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:31,217
- Yeah, Why?
- I Want To Throw Him A Hail Mary.

637
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:34,113
I'm Gonna Ask Him To Reconsider
If I Change The Ending.

638
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:38,414
That All Sounds Really Great, Jonah,
But You Don't Know How The Story Ends.

639
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:39,997
Actually...

640
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,900
I Wanted To Ask You If I
Could Bounce Some Ideas off you.

641
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:08,313
Where Did That Skeleton Come From?

642
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,275
No Clue, It Was Just Sitting There.

643
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,569
- Scared The Crap Out Of Me.
- Mission Accomplished.

644
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,404
She's A Cautionary Tale.

645
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:17,865
Don't Call Him Over.

646
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,784
- He's Really Cute.
- I Don't Care, Don't Call Him Over.

647
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,494
Come Join Us.

648
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,120
- I Hate You Right Now.
- What?

649
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:28,682
Hey, Drew, This Is Riley,
One Of Your New Neighbors.

650
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,281
This Is Drew, The Thorn That's
Been In My Side All Day.

651
00:35:32,406 --> 00:35:34,173
Welcome. And For The Record,

652
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,810
Lauren Plays Tough,
But She's A Total Softy At Heart.

653
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,181
- Did You Steal That From Ula?
- Sally Sunburn?

654
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,117
No, They Were
Going To Throw Her Away.

655
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,886
I Thought She'd Be A Nice
Addition To The Courtyard.

656
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,980
Who Brought The Skeleton?

657
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,022
That Would Be Me.
I'm Drew.

658
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,779
- I Live Right Above You.
- What Happened?

659
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:55,795
- It's Just A Scratch.
- Everything's Okay?

660
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,152
I'm Gonna Get A Drink.

661
00:36:07,805 --> 00:36:10,282
Now I Have To Add Chef...
To Your Growing List Of Credentials?

662
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:12,879
Hardly.
I'm Guessing You're Not Interested

663
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,715
- In Joining Us For A Burger.
- I'd Love To, But Amanda Would Kill Me

664
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,319
If I Got Ketchup On The Monkey Suit.
No, We're Headed Off To Venice

665
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:23,657
- To A "save The Something" Fund-raiser.
- You Never Stop Working, Do You?

666
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,376
No, I Do Not, And Neither Will You
If I Use You The Right Way.

667
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,207
I'm Taking The Jet To D.C.

668
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:32,732
I Thought Maybe We Could Check
Out That School In Person.

669
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,602
You Free Tomorrow?
Am I Free To Fly Across The Country...

670
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,027
In Your Private Jet?

671
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,446
Yeah, I Just Have To Reschedule
My Lunch With Madonna.

672
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,449
- Is She In Town?
- I'm Kidding.

673
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,536
I Don't Know Madonna.
Wait, Do You?

674
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:47,329
Congratulations, Riley.

675
00:36:48,646 --> 00:36:51,208
I Understand You Made Quite
An Impression On My boyfriend.

676
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,214
I Couldn't Have Done It Without You.
Thanks Again For Making The Introduction.

677
00:36:55,743 --> 00:36:59,117
- My Pleasure.
- Good Night.

678
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:06,967
Resident Hollywood Power Players. How'd
Your Meeting With Owen Anderson Go?

679
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,802
Actually Just Got Off
The Phone With Him.

680
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,506
He Seems Really Interested
In My Ideas For A Rewrite,

681
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:14,231
As Soon As I'm Done
he promised me we'll meet again.

682
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,901
- What Does That Mean?
- Jonah's Going To Change The Ending.

683
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,946
Turns Out Rachel And Jacob
Don't Make It After All.

684
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:34,194
- I'm Sorry, Work's Pulling Me Back.
- Can I See That Phone For A Second?

685
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,604
I Just Want To Call Your Boss And Ask
Him For A Night Alonwith My Girlfriend.

686
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:40,567
I Think The
Long Hours Are Just About Over,

687
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,593
And Then'm All Yours.
All Right, Okay.

688
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,506
- I Didn't Get A Page, But I Should Go.
- I'll Probably get There...

689
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,175
And They Won't Even Need Me,
So Good-bye.

690
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,582
Okay, Well, At Least Let
Me Walk You To The Car.

691
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:53,478
Night.

692
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,910
You Hate Me And You, I Don't Know.

693
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,077
Great, I Think I'm Gonna Call
It A Night.

694
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,343
So, Drew, Are You Into
Cardiology Like Lauren?

695
00:38:23,697 --> 00:38:27,080
I Transferred To Ula For
Their Hematology Program.

696
00:38:27,574 --> 00:38:29,686
Hematology, Like Blood?

697
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,685
Why Would Anyone Want
To Specialize In That?

698
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:36,513
Well, If I Tell You,
You Promise Not To Tell Anybody Else?

699
00:38:40,726 --> 00:38:41,892
I'm A Vampire.

700
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,226
It Was So Much Better
In My Head. Yeah.

701
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:20,773
You Going To Get That?

702
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,742
Oh, My God.

703
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,910
I've Never Seen You
Ignore A Phone Call.

704
00:39:34,636 --> 00:39:36,873
There's A Lot Of
Things You Haven't Seen.

705
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:47,134
This Is How My Star Student's
Been Paying For Med School.

706
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,344
It's Not What It Looks Like.

707
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:51,867
I've Never Done Anything
Like This Before.

708
00:39:52,546 --> 00:39:54,987
Interesting,
Because Wendi Told Me...

709
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:57,090
You Were One Of Her Go-to Girls.

710
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,410
I'm Not Going
To Say Anything About This

711
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:08,447
To Anyone.
I'd Appreciate It If You'd Do The Same.

712
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:11,158
It Won't Leave This Room.

713
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:13,744
Thank You.

714
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,089
That Doesn't Mean I Don't
Expect Something In Return.

715
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,206
Y-you Don't Actually Want To...

716
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,374
It's David.

717
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:22,627
If He Hadn't Interfered In My Life,

718
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:24,521
Noah Would Still Have A Mother.

719
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:28,216
I Don't Understand What
That Has To Do With Me.

720
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,504
David Needs To Know
What It Feels like

721
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,847
To Have All The Happiness
In His Life Ripped Away.

722
00:40:35,085 --> 00:40:36,596
I Want You To Break His Heart.

723
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:39,102
Whatever You Have With Him, End It.

724
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,681
- You Can't Be Serious.
- You Break It Off With Him,

725
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:45,185
Or I Tell The Entire
Medical Community...

726
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,300
That I Got A House Call From Dr.
Lauren Yung.
