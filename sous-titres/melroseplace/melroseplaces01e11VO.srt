1
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:24,220
Riles, it's okay.

2
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,388
No, it's not, jonah.

3
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:26,989
We have no source of income.

4
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:29,592
<i>Lauren:
All my life, all I wanted
was to be a doctor.</i>

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,494
I'm still a little concerned
about your finances.

6
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,095
<i>Lauren:
I can work it out.</i>

7
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:34,697
<i>Ella:
The late nights,
the mystery men...</i>

8
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:36,599
I resent you
interrogating me

9
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,000
Like I'm some
kind of...
Prostitute?

10
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:40,202
<i>Lauren:
If you think you need
to go out</i>

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,704
<i>And take what's not yours,
there's obviously</i>

12
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:42,905
<i>Something missing
in your life.</i>

13
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:44,006
You should know that

14
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:45,775
That little hobby
of mine-- it's over.

15
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:47,043
I ran from the police

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,878
Because of what
happened back home.

17
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:51,113
<i>All I ever wanted to do
was leave.</i>

18
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,015
Ella:
Oh, my god.

19
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,750
My dad killed sydney.
Ella:
What?

20
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:56,452
<i>David:
I found sydney's necklace
in his car.</i>

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,087
<i>She was wearing it
the night she died.</i>

22
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,388
<i>Caleb:
Amanda woodward does not come
all the way</i>

23
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:00,623
<i>Across the country
just to slap us</i>

24
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,959
On the wrist. She's
been asking all kinds

25
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:05,461
Of questions about you.
She's the president of wpk.

26
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:08,097
<i>Caleb:
That woman will get
inside your head and make you</i>

27
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,566
<i>Do things that you never
dreamed that you would do.</i>

28
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:22,211
The object I'm looking for
wasn't checked into evidence.

29
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:24,714
It's not in any of the records.

30
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:26,782
No, all it means
is that sydney gave it

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,284
To someone for safekeeping.

32
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:31,854
I have no idea
who she'd trust it with.

33
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:39,762
But I know where
to start looking.

34
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:44,400
Lauren:
I can't believe
how close we were.

35
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:46,202
David:
I told you they
were decent seats.

36
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,070
Front row
for kings of leon

37
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:50,406
Is beyond decent,
david.

38
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:51,574
Seriously, thank you.

39
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,242
I had an amazing time.

40
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,510
Me, too.

41
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,794
Come upstairs
with me.

42
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:17,733
I'd love to,
but I have rounds...

43
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:19,702
In the morning.

44
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,071
Ridiculously early.

45
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,941
I'm sorry. I know most
of your dates don't...

46
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:29,445
It's okay.

47
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,180
Tonight's totally
different.

48
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,482
You're totally different.

49
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:36,786
Good night.

50
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:41,991
Night.

51
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,166
Jonah:
This is absurd.

52
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,435
Need me to show you
that windsor knot again?

53
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:53,869
No.

54
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:55,571
It's absurd how sexy
I am right now.

55
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,039
That's what I'm just saying.

56
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:58,240
Oh, god.

57
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,109
This is totally how I'm going
to work tomorrow.

58
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:01,210
Just like this.

59
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:03,079
First day,
coming out swinging.

60
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:05,581
So, ella's going
to be your boss?

61
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:06,716
What?

62
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:09,552
Riley, she just put me up
for the I.T. Gig.

63
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:14,123
I knew film school
would come in handy.

64
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:16,726
I know it was nice of her
to land you this job

65
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:20,496
After I lost mine, but you
and ella working together?

66
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:22,531
It's not the most reassuring
thought in the world.

67
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,066
Riles, it's not like
we're sharing

68
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,768
A cubicle together.
I'm the I.T. Guy.

69
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:26,869
Besides, you know

70
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:28,738
The l.A. Job market
sucks right now.

71
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,506
I can't argue
with that.

72
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,842
Apparently, the world doesn't
need any more teachers.

73
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,810
At least, not in the
middle of the semester.

74
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:36,278
If I ran a school,

75
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,314
I would hire you
in a heartbeat.

76
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,216
That's actually a good idea.

77
00:03:40,283 --> 00:03:43,519
The miller academy:
A new approach to learning.

78
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:44,887
See? I told you.

79
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:47,256
This outfit's working
for me already.
Mm-hmm.

80
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:50,059
Riley:
Okay.

81
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:51,994
Embarrassing
confession time.

82
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:53,329
Okay.

83
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:56,665
I have a gigantic
"honey, I'm home" fantasy.

84
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,400
Wow. Really?

85
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:00,302
You mean, like,
the pipe and slippers

86
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,239
And a swell meal waiting
for me when I get home?

87
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:04,907
More like
a lonely housewife

88
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:07,343
Itching to rip
your clothes off.

89
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,919
<i>Michael:
Oh, vanessa, five days away
from you felt more like 50.</i>

90
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:19,989
I missed you, too.

91
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:21,157
I don't think we need

92
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:22,725
To give the neighbors
a peep show though.

93
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:24,527
No?

94
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:25,995
I think the neighbors

95
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:27,830
Should see
what your husband can do

96
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:30,733
After a 17-hour
transatlantic flight.

97
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:39,842
I'm actually more concerned
about your peeping tom son.

98
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:42,778
I caught david
snooping around

99
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:44,647
In the garage
while you were gone.

100
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,148
David knows the rules.

101
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:48,150
Wh-why the unannounced drop-in?

102
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:51,921
I'm sure he just wanted
to see noah.

103
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:53,289
Don't worry about it.

104
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:56,225
I shooed him away with
the restraining order.

105
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:57,726
Well, um...

106
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:59,328
Did he say what he wanted?

107
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:01,030
No. I'm sorry I brought him up.

108
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:02,531
I know how much
it upsets you.

109
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,500
No, no. I'm not upset.

110
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,570
Come on.
Let's go upstairs.

111
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:08,704
All right.

112
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:09,972
That's a great idea, honey.

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,508
Just-just, uh...
Give me one minute.

114
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:32,695
Damn it, david.

Oh, jonah, thank god.

124

I just clicked
on this link david sent me,

125
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,368
And now I have
these pop-ups

126

Of naked women
all over my desktop.

127
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,671
Oh, that sounds like a
random malware installer.

128
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:16,939
That's easy to get rid of.

129
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:17,940
I'm kidding.

130
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,208
I never click
on david's links.

131
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:21,978
And since when
are naked women a bad thing?

132
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,647
Um, I'll let you know as soon
as I read a company handbook.

133
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:26,716
Yeah, I'm not sure
if we have one of those,

134
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:27,950

be surprised

135
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:30,052
If amanda put one out

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,587
Wait, I thought
you worshipped her.

137
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,389
I do, but apparently,
the feeling

138
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:34,590
Is not mutual.

139
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:36,592
Look, I am on such thin ice
right now that I

140
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,628
Should be wearing
a wet suit under my dress.

143
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:43,466
Right this way.

144
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:46,102
Hey, look, el, just
to clarify here,

145
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,771
I mean, even though we're,
you know, working together,

146
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,140
I think we just need
to have some boundaries.

147
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:53,743
We will.

148
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,679
At wpk, there are two types
of worker bees.

149
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:59,081
Those who fill the partners'
pockets with money--

150
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,083
I.E. The publicists,
I.E. Me--

151
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:03,152
And those who light
the partners' money on fire--

152
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,820
I.E. The support staff,
I.E. You.

153
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:07,156
And the two
don't share the same hive.

154
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:08,224
Okay.

155
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,592
(stammers)
just so you know,

156
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,227

all right?

157
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:12,595
Jonah,

158
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:15,097
I promise you, I won't
molest you in the lunchroom.

159
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,366
You must be one
of ella's clients.

160
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:20,603
Uh... Actually...

161
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:22,972
One day, he will be
our biggest earner,

162
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,173
But today,

163
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:25,908
He is our newest employee.

164
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:29,145
Hi. I'm jonah miller.

165
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:30,179
I'm your new
I.T. Guy.

166
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:31,347
Make sure he signs

167
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,848
A confidentiality
agreement.

168
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,183
Of course.

169
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,185
Um, you have nothing
to worry about.

170
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:39,522
Jonah's, like, the most honest
human being I know.

171
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,024
Uh, coming from you,
that's not saying much.

172
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,192
Oh, it's true.

173
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,661
Lying makes me
break out in hives.

174
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,069
I think she liked me.

175
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:54,637
Doubtful.

are you doing?

00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:20,496
I was just going
to slip this under your door.

178
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,098
What is it?

179
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,066
The money I owe you
for posting my bail.

180
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:25,601
I finally saved up

181
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:28,237
Enough in tips,
so now we're even.

182
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:29,605
Thanks.

183
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:31,640
This will be
a big help.

184
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,409
Things are a little
tight right now,

185
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:35,244
And we weren't exactly sure

186
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:36,512
If you were on speaking terms
with us.

187
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,080
'cause what you
did to auggie

188
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,749
Was so completely wrong?

189
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:44,553
You know better than anyone
what would have happened

190
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,722
If the police found out
I knew where auggie was.

191
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:48,090
He was on a surfing trip.Trip.

192
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,492
In mexico.

193
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,727
And he was acting strange,

194
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,395
Like he knew someone
was after him.

195
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:54,797
A real friend

196
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:58,000
Would have never done
what you did.

197
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:00,569
Violet, if auggie didn't do it,

198
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:02,938
Then he has nothing
to worry about.

199
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:04,073
Nothing to worry about?

200
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,674
He was dragged
out of bed

201
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:06,942
By the federales.

202
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,944
Look, even I know

203
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:12,681
Innocent people get arrested
all of the time.

204
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:14,416
I had no choice.

205
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:16,452
I could have got
into a lot of trouble

206
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,287
If they found out
I was withholding information.

207
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:20,456
So, now auggie's
the one in trouble.

208
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:22,525
(sighs)
god.

209
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,560
How do you sleep at night?

210
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:28,998
(door slams shut)

211
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,870
Yeah, I'm on the road
right now, detective.

212
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:36,872
I'll be there in 20.

213
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,781
Nice driving.

214
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:47,116
Get out of my way.

215
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:48,617
We need to talk.
Funny.
I could've sworn

216
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:50,352
That you had a restraining order
against me.

217
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,754
Reaching out to noah
wasn't brotherly love.

218
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,823
It was just your sick attempt
to destroy my family.

219
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,324
You ought to stick
to surgery, dad.

220
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:57,059
Family psychology's not
exactly your specialty.

221
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,228
Oh, yeah, well,
kleptomania seems to be yours.

222
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:00,729
I don't have
time for this.

223
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,164
I know you were in my car.

224
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:03,465
Why? Are the floor
mats missing?

225
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,267
David, this is not a game.

226
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:06,735
Oh, I know.
Very serious.

227
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:09,471
I suggest you go get
your affairs in order

228
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,707
And prepare to go away
for a little while.

229
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:22,218
You know, davey,

230
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:24,386
I am really starting to worry
about your friend lauren.

231
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:26,155
What about her?

232
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:28,157
Well, she seems to be crumbling

233
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:29,992
Under the pressure
of med school.

234
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,493
She keeps it up,

235
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,895
She could flunk out of ula.

236
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:35,364
Lauren has been in the top
of her class since preschool.

237
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,366
Yeah, people always forget...

238
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:39,602
The highest fliers have
the furthest to fall.

239
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,604
So you'd really just destroy
an innocent woman's career

240
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:42,872
To save your own ass?

241
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:45,241
Oh, I've done a lot worse.

242
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,531
Looks like the good doctor's
done very well for himself.

243
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,733
Amanda.

244
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,967
When I saw you in new york,

245
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:14,136
You swore you'd never
set foot in l.A. Again.

246
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:15,638
I missed my old friends.

247
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:16,939
Besides, wpk's

248
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,908
L.A. Office needs major triage

249
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:20,409
Or I'm afraid
it's going to flatline.

250
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:21,644
I still don't get it.

251
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:23,245
After everything
we went through,

252
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:25,114
And you had everything
you wanted in the tropics,

253
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:26,682
Why get back
in the rat race?

254
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,917
I was bored.

255
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,085
Of the sun, sand and peter.

256
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:31,620
I mean, I'm a
city girl, michael.

257
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:34,556
I need to be in the
center of the action.

258
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,659
Like sydney.

259
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:38,961
You must've been devastated
when you found out.

260
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,462
Oh, yeah.

261
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,097
That was a total shock.

262
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,332
Really?

263
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,667
I mean, when she told me

264
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:47,136
That you two had reignited
that old flame,

265
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:50,172
I thought she'd really
gone off the deep end.

266
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,141
I didn't think that she
would actually end up

267
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,475
Floating facedown in it.

268
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,144
I didn't realize
you two talked.

269
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:56,412
Let me guess.

270
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,947
You ran into each other
at a support group

271
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:59,348
For women who fake
their own deaths?

272
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,417
Oh, don't worry.

273
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,953
I didn't come here
to point fingers.

274
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,155
I'm looking for something I
loaned sydney before she died.

275
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,424
It's not worth much,

276
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:09,792
Just a lot of
sentimental value.

277
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,294
Oh, what could possibly
have sentimental value

278
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:13,662
To amanda woodward?

279
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,164
Some kind of medieval
torture device?

280
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,832
After all these years,

281
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,268
You don't think I've
changed, even a little?

282
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,103
Um, I know how much
I've changed, amanda.

283
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:22,972
And let's face it,
people like you and me,

284
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,541
We are who we are.

285
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,977
So, she never mentioned
anything to you?

286
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:29,445
Ask her sister.

287
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:30,980
Jane has all her stuff.
I did.

288
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:33,015
And she's clueless, as usual.

289
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,517
You know, I realized I
should've come to you first.

290
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:38,587
Syd had a habit of confiding
in passionate hearts.

291
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:42,558
Then why don't you
ask my son, david.

292
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,693
At the end, he was closer to her
than I was.

293
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,695
Your son?

294
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:49,665
God help anyone blessed
with those genes.

295
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:53,102
They were together
right before she died.

296
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,104
He lives in west hollywood.

297
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:57,172
I think you know the address.

298
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,319
Table 12's ready.

299
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,957
Violet.

300
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:26,497
Wow. (chuckles)

301
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,198
Look at you.

302
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,467
Levi, what are you
doing here?

303
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,503
What do you think?

304
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,004
I haven't heard a peep from you.

305
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:35,906
I told mom and dad
you were probably fine,

306
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:37,207
But I was worried.

307
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,409
I thought
maybe something happened.

308
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:41,011
You were supposed to call me.

309
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,680
How did you know I worked here?

310
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:43,647
Your twitter.

311
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:45,082
It wasn't a lot
to go by,

312
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,551
But you mentioned
this job once

313
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,886
And I looked the place up.

314
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,721
I figured you'd put it out there
so I could find you.

315
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,222
You're always

316
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,124
Clever like that.

317
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:57,661
Levi, you shouldn't have
come down here.

318
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,697
Why?

319
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:00,964
You find your birth mom?

320
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,366
She taking care of you

321
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,234
With her beverly hills money
and that's it?

322
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,872
Right after I found my mom...

323
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,874
She died.

324
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,242
She was murdered.

325
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,747
Oh, man.

326
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,016
I'm so sorry.

327
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:21,485
After all that time we spent
trying to find her.

328
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:23,487
Now you know why
I disappeared.

329
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:25,255
Why I didn't call.

330
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,758
It's-it's going to be okay.

331
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,827
Dad was pissed about the money
you stole at first,

332
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:32,196
But I paid him back everything.

333
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:35,265
It's time to come home, vi.

334
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:38,402
This is my home now.

335
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:45,976
What about us?

336
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:51,048
I'm sorry, levi, but, uh,

337
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:53,050
Things are different now.

338
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:55,285
I'm different.

339
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,823
(clears throat):
Yeah, of course.

340
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:01,258
You're-you're trying
to start your new life.

341
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:03,260
I-I totally get that.

342
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:09,633
I'll tell everyone back home
you say hi.

343
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,279
I hope you're getting a tan

344
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:24,047
From all this
radiation.

345
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:26,717
Can I interest you
in my leftovers

346
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:27,918
From my lunch at drago?

347
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:29,386
Five months
of hypnotherapy

348
00:15:29,454 --> 00:15:31,789
And this stuff is
like cardboard to me.

349
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:33,757
Thank you. I, uh, zoned

350
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,192
While I was trying
to sort out

351
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,961
This scrambled
I.T. Grid here,

352
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:39,029
And I missed lunch.

353
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:40,964
I had no idea

354
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:42,966
You were such
a nerd whisperer.

355
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:46,270
You guys have one of the most
insane videoconferencing setups

356
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:47,471
I've ever seen.

357
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:50,808
And these crazy snooping tools

358
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,243
That would freak
even dick cheney out.

359
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:55,813
Really?

360
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,283
Speaking of snooping tools,

361
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,552
Sounds like you could

362
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:04,955
<i>Run my name and take a peek at
all e-mails pertaining to moi.</i>

363
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:08,659
I'm just going to assume

364
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:10,761
That was a purely
hypothetical question.

365
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:13,297
Well, you saw how
amanda thinks of me.

366
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,631
She was practically

367
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,300
Gunning for me
before she got here.

368
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,467
If she has a target on my back,

369
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:18,702
I need to know how
to dodge her bullet.

370
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,870
I signed a confidentiality

371
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,638
Agreement, ella.

372
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:23,006
It's a legal document.

373
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:27,444
Jonah, I understand this may be
outside of your comic book

374
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,713
Code of ethics,
but please remember:

375
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,716
That to you this is a day job,

376
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,452
And for me this is
my entire career.

377
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,753
I'm sorry, el.

378
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,455
I mean, if I was wired
to bend the rules like that,

379
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:40,958
I'd be on a beach in
freaking maui right now,

380
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,492
Counting gary sarling's
hush money.

381
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,628
Look, jonah,

382
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,430
I'm not like you.

383
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:48,465
Okay, I'm not some
jack-of-all-trades.

384
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,468
I know how to do one thing
and one thing only,

385
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,470
And that's spin stories.

386
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:55,939
I've been doing it
since I was in pigtails.

387
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:58,942
Why does that not surprise me?

388
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,411
You probably got so many
freebies from the ice cream man.

389
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,747
It was more like survival.

390
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,784
I couldn't let my friends know
that my mom,

391
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:11,622
Who everybody thought was
some high-flying stewardess,

392
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,125
Was really missing
parent-teacher conferences

393
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:17,995
'cause she was lost
in a pharmaceutical haze.

394
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:22,566
I wanted people
to think I was normal.

395
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,736
I wanted people to like me.

396
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:28,805
Wow. I had no idea.

397
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:32,809
Look, jonah, I don't ask you
for a lot of favors,

398
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:35,879
But I'm asking you now.

399
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,349
Help me keep my job.

400
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:47,090
Thanks.

401
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:48,258
Hi, lauren.
Hey.

402
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,260
Hey. You got a minute?

403
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,262
Actually, I have a floor
of patients waiting for me.

404
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,730
I just got one question.

405
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:54,932
Have you done anything

406
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,300
That could land you
in any trouble at work?

407
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,834
What-what kind
of trouble?
I don't know.

408
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,903
Anything that could
get you fired.

409
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:02,973
I'm sorry. What-what
are you asking me?

410
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,841
It's my father.

411
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,410
Something's come
between us.

412
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:08,278
He's going to be
scrutinizing you now a lot.

413
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:10,280
Whatever issues you have
with dr. Mancini,

414
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:13,317
When it comes to work,
he's completely professional.

415
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,018
Lauren, you don't know
what he's capable of.

416
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:16,286
I know fathers
can be difficult.

417
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:18,322
I don't exactly have
the best relationship with mine.

418
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,291
But if there's anything
your father's capable of:

419
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,260
Saving lives and
giving people hope.

420
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:24,361
Lauren, would you just trust me.

421
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:25,462
Just...
David,

422
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,664
After all your half-truths
and the accusations,

423
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,799
What?
Really?

424
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:29,866
Lauren, just...

425
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,201
I gotta get back to work, okay.
Listen.

426
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,370
Hey, my father's going to have
your life under a microscope.

427
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,871
Promise me you're
going to be careful.

428
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,176
Okay.

429
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:53,350
Auggie kirkpatrick's
in custody.

430
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:55,352
Sydney andrews case
is with the d.A.
What?

431
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,354
But I have a new
piece of evidence.

432
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,222
It's-it's a necklace
that belonged to sydney.

433
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,791
I know 'cause I
gave it to her.

434
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:02,359
She was wearing it
the night of the murder.

435
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:03,827
And this evidence
is just surfacing now,

436
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:05,028
Weeks after the crime?

437
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:07,297
I found it in my
father's car.

438
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:09,266
There's blood on it.
Sydney's blood.

439
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:13,537
Did you have permission
to be in dr. Mancini's car?

440
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:15,539
I thought that you weren't
supposed to ask questions

441
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:17,541
You don't want know
the answers to.
If that necklace

442
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,776
Is the result of an illegal
search, it's useless,

443
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:21,445
Completely inadmissible
in court.

444
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:23,480
But that necklace ties my father
to a crime scene.

445
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:24,548
It proves that
you're about

446
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:25,582
To put the wrong person
on trial.

447
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,950
Careful, breck.

448
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,719
You're in the middle
of a police station right now,

449
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:31,655
Dangerously close to admitting
you committed a felony b&e.

450
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,593
I can't believe he's about
to get off on a technicality.

451
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:42,599
I'd have no problem

452
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,167
Taking it to the d.A.

453
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:45,502
Might even be enough

454
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,504
To cast doubt on your friend
auggie's murder charge.

455
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:49,339
Keep your phone on.

456
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,941
You'll be hearing from me.

457
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:57,814
Yung.

458
00:19:57,882 --> 00:19:59,316
I have a question

459
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:01,084
About a patient
you treated yesterday.

460
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:02,452
Patrick baker?

461
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,389
Yeah, um, I saw mr. Baker
during my morning rounds.

462
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,157
Pulmonary arrhythmia.

463
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,925
Do you remember why you thought

464
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:10,761
It was a good idea
to prescribe blood thinners

465
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:12,229
To a patient that was scheduled

466
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,964
To undergo heart surgery
the next day?

467
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:18,201
There was no heart procedure
listed on his chart.

468
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,003
Oh, yes, there was,

469
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:21,505
But you obviously
missed it.

470
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:23,140
Thankfully,
the nurse who was

471
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:24,574
Dispensing medications
last night

472
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,076
Was more careful than you.

473
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:29,479
Dr. Mancini, I can assure you,
there was no...

474
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:30,680
That man

475
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,582
Could have bled out
on my operating table.

476
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:39,056
I don't know what to say.

477
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:41,258
Neither do I, yung.

478
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,660
Except, a mistake like that
can end a career.

479
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:54,571
You got any news for me yet?

480
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:58,375
Come on.

481
00:20:58,443 --> 00:20:59,709
You're not directing a suspense

482
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:00,844
Movie over here.

483
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:02,012
You were right.

484
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,213
You're definitely
on her radar.

485
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:05,015
There's that
whole section

486
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,917
From the quarterly
performance evaluations.

487
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:10,320
"ella simms manages

491
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,995
So, all I have to do
is sign more clients?

492
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:22,232
Done and done.

493
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,366
Good. Are you happy now?

494
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:24,668
Well, not exactly happy,

495
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:25,702
But at least I know

496
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,770
Where to focus my efforts.

497
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:27,838
Well, now that
we're done

498
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:29,005
With the espionage,

499
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:30,440
I'm covering my tracks,
all right?

500
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:32,109
I'm going
to erase my search history,

501
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:34,244
And we are never talking
about this ever again.

502
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:36,880
Jonah, my lips are sealed.

503
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:38,148
Thank you.

504
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:39,516
You're the bestest.

505
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:42,119
Bestest.

Your faucet was leaking.
I fixed it.

How did you get in here?

Bathroom window.

513
00:22:25,263 --> 00:22:27,130
You really got to get
some better security, vi.

514
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:29,099
I'm going
to put a lock on it next.

515
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:30,267
You're going to leave.

516
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:31,735
That's what you're going to do.

517
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,272
Come on.

518
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:36,473
You don't really think

519
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,975
I'm going to go back
to oregon empty-handed?

520
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:44,489
So I guess you lied

521
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:46,391
When you said
we'd always be together?

522
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:47,559
Is it another guy?

523
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:48,727
What is it?

524
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:50,528
You're my brother, levi.

I didn't know what
I was talking about.

You convinced me

531
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:01,039
That being with you
would keep me off meth

532
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:03,008
For good, that I could focus
on cabinetry,

533
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:04,242
I could build a business.

534
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,443
And you were right.

535
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,911
Look what happened
after you left.

536
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:08,880
You're using again?

537
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:09,948
Not if I'm with you.

538
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:11,216
That's why I thought

539
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,518
I could just stay here
for a bit, and I could clean up.

540
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:14,686
The money you owe me--

541
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:16,588
Just, we'll call it first
month's rent.

542
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:19,124
Levi, it's a studio apartment.

543
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,525
There's one bed.

544
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:22,093
It'll be like home.

545
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:25,230
Look, I'm here
to stay, violet.

546
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,766
I'm not going anywhere.

547
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,801
Violet?

548
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:31,136
Is everything okay?

549
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:32,470
Yeah, everything's fine.

550
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:35,073
Did I hear something about
violet owing you money?

551
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:37,242
Oh, there are some nosy
neighbors around here,

552
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:38,977
Aren't they?
Violet:
Riley,

553
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:40,445
This is my brother.

554
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:43,715
Yeah, she owes me money, but
she's gonna pay it off in rent.

555
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:45,283
Look, levi,
I can work extra shifts,

556
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,485
Save up on my tips, and
I'll get it back to you in...

557
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,287
No, that's not how
we're going to do it.

558
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,992
How much does she owe you?

559
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,993
Riley, no.

560
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:56,961
$450.

561
00:23:58,064 --> 00:23:59,631
Here.

562
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:00,899
Take it.

563
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:02,133
And go.

564
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:08,073
I don't know why
you're helping her.

565
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,340
She's a manipulative bitch.

566
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,643
Please leave.

567
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,445
You think
I'm the bad guy?

568
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:16,047
One day you'll figure her out.

569
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:21,619
Are you okay?

570
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:22,821
Riley,

571
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:24,889
He is a total liar.

572
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:30,095
You're not going to tell people
about this,

573
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:31,396
Are you?

574
00:24:31,464 --> 00:24:33,064
Not if you don't want me to.

575
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:36,234
It's just, I would be mortified

576
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:38,770
If auggie heard
about what happened.

577
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:49,881
Don't you just love
living here?

578
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:53,351
Who are you?

579
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:56,521
I'm an old friend
of your father and syd's.

580
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:58,857
Actually, we all
used to live here.

581
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:00,525
Good times.

582
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:02,894
Hey, was there something
in the chlorine back then

583
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:04,696
That made you guys
all so twisted?

584
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:07,732
Actually, I'm not sure
it dissipated.

585
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,501
Stealing art?

586
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:12,971
Isn't that kind of a twisted way
to make a living?

587
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:16,774
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

588
00:25:16,842 --> 00:25:18,776
Well, before syd died,

589
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:21,613
We reconnected,
and she opened up to me.

590
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,181
About a lot.

591
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:26,584
David, I-I gave her something
of mine, a keepsake.

592
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,620
It hasn't shown up
in her belongings.

593
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:31,756
I'm not a lost-and-found.

594
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:34,025
Well, if you don't have
what I'm looking for,

595
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:35,760
Maybe you could help me find it.

596
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:37,962
Look, I'm all for helping
out strangers in need,

597
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,531
But after you walk in here

598
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:41,032
Accusing me
of being some criminal,

599
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,300
I think I'll pass.

600
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:45,236
All right.

601
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:50,842
Just know that as an
upstanding citizen,

602
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,911
I may have to do
whatever it takes

603
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:56,548
To protect the community
from thieves like you.

604
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:10,995
Hey, babe. I got here
as soon as I could.

605
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:12,297
Okay, they're
gonna miss me

606
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,165
In the hospital in,
like, 20 minutes.
Uh-huh.

607
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:16,601
There was an incident at work
today with your father.

608
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:17,802
Okay, he's setting you up.

609
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,970
No, not-not
necessarily.

610
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:20,838
It was something that
I might have missed

611
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:22,006
On a patient's chart,

612
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:23,408
And the paperwork
backs him up.

613
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:24,709
Would he
falsify that?

614
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:25,977
Of course he would.

615
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:27,712
The man committed murder.

616
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,980
He killed sydney.

617
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,415
What?

618
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:31,783
My father had a relationship
with sydney

619
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,017
That went back ten years.

620
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:34,819
He was having an affair with her
right before she died.

621
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,187
Oh, god.

622
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:37,989
Okay, that is motive,
opportunity,

623
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:39,524
And I have a piece of evidence

624
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:41,025
That links him
to the crime scene.

625
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:43,394
So, why don't the police
just arrest him?

626
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,931
Well, there's a problem
with the evidence.

627
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,734
I stole it.

628
00:26:49,802 --> 00:26:51,002
Lauren, do you really think

629
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,471
That the police want to arrest
someone like my father?

630
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:54,839
Someone with money,
connections?

631
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:55,940
I don't know, david.

632
00:26:56,008 --> 00:26:57,442
Maybe the police
just don't want

633
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:58,676
To arrest someone
who's innocent.

634
00:26:58,744 --> 00:26:59,744
Lauren, if you could
consider

635
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:00,945
For one moment

636
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:03,014
That I'm telling you the truth.

637
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:04,182
I have a plan.

638
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,284
I just... I need
your help with it.

639
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:08,886
You're asking me to take
the word of a thief

640
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:10,788
Over a world-renowned
cardiologist.

641
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:12,890
That's what you think
of me? A thief?

642
00:27:14,526 --> 00:27:17,562
David, you know how hard
I've worked to get where I am.

643
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,063
If you're wrong,

644
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:20,265
I'm throwing
it all away.

645
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:21,966
He's already
throwing it away for you.

646
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:25,036
The only way you risk
your career is by doing nothing.

647
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,417
Hey, what's wrong?

648
00:27:39,485 --> 00:27:41,519
Someone's antivirus software
out of date?

649
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:43,855
I, um...

650
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,890
I want to hear exactly
how it went down

651
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,593
Between you and caleb
and my directing credit.

652
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:50,161
On the "boomkat" video?

653
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:51,496
Mm-hmm.

654
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:52,764
I thought we
dealt with that.

655
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:55,366
I went a few rounds with caleb;
he outranked me;

656
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:57,802
And your name fell off
the project.

657
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,938
That's interesting,
'cause I actually heard

658
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:03,241
You thought
it would be a good idea

659
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:04,809
To throw me under the bus.

660
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:06,711
(laughs)
where did you hear that?

661
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,748
Ellasimms
@wpk.Backstabbingliars.Com

662
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,258
Reading that e-mail

663
00:28:20,326 --> 00:28:22,560
Out of context
is totally misleading.

664
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,562
Totally misleading? No.

665
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,131
What's totally misleading
are all the speeches

666
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:30,001
You always gave me about
how you always have my back.

667
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:32,637
Okay, jonah...

668
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:37,742
...You are an artist,

669
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,478
And artists can sometimes
be sensitive.

670
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:41,779
Of course I'm sensitive!

671
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,214
You completely screwed me over!

672
00:28:43,282 --> 00:28:45,283
Okay, I made the wrong call.

673
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,552
I should have fought for you.

674
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:51,522
But I was worried that my job
was on the line, and...

675
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,690
Wait. Is that
all you care about?

676
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,158
All this bogus
cheerleading--

677
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,326
It was all
about you the whole time?

678
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:56,427
What? No!

679
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:57,595
It's about the big picture,

680
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:58,863
Positioning both of us

681
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:00,832
So that we can succeed
far beyond where we are...

682
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,033
Stop! Stop! Stop!

683
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:03,901
I don't believe a word
of it anymore, el.

684
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:05,436
So, as my publicist,

685
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:08,239
My agent, manager,
and so-called friend,

686
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:09,874
You are officially fired.

687
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:12,076
I'm e-mailing amanda,
and I'm done

688
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:13,478
With this place.

689
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:25,501
dr. Mancini, can I talk
to you for a minute?

690
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:28,670
You'll be hearing from me
when I've made my decision.

691
00:29:28,738 --> 00:29:30,572
It's about david.

692
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:33,575
What about my boy?

693
00:29:37,747 --> 00:29:39,948
When I joined your team,

694
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:42,050
You told me
you were concerned about him.

695
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:43,585
You wanted me
to keep you in the loop.

696
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,925
David told me
he broke into your car.

697
00:29:49,993 --> 00:29:51,560
Really?

698
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,330
Dr. Mancini,

699
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:56,999
David's been stealing
for a long time,

700
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:58,534
And not just from you.

701
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:02,771
I'm really worried about him.

702
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,607
I'm worried he's going
to get himself killed.

703
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:09,077
Did he tell you what he took

704
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:10,312
From my car?

705
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,214
You mean the... The necklace?

706
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:14,516
He told me he did it

707
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:17,753
To get back at you
for the restraining order.

708
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:20,022
He's trying to convince me that
you're some kind of monster.

709
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,557
Does he still have the necklace?

710
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:23,091
It's a family heirloom.

711
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,127
It's in his apartment.

712
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:29,231
Look, I'm not trying
to get anyone in trouble here.

713
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:30,999
I just thought...

714
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:32,234
You thought,
by giving me

715
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:33,669
This information,

716
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:36,472
It would have some effect
on your possible dismissal.

717
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,073
Yeah.

718
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:40,976
I like david a lot,

719
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:42,978
But I'm worried
about him.

720
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:44,746
I can't ignore
his dark side anymore.

721
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:48,450
He's taking me out
to dinner tonight,

722
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,519
And I... I want
to say something to him.

723
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:54,089
It would mean a lot to me
if you'd

724
00:30:54,157 --> 00:30:55,357
Reach out
to him, as well.

725
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:57,459
I promise you I'll get
into this immediately.

726
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:12,841
Excuse me, amanda?

727
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:14,209
Better be urgent.

728
00:31:14,277 --> 00:31:15,777
I was wondering
if you heard

729
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:18,080
From the new I.T. Guy,
um, jonah miller.

730
00:31:18,147 --> 00:31:19,882
Oh, he wrote quite
a confessional.

731
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:21,917
I'm not sure why he
thought I would care.

732
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:23,418
If he was so busy,
he shouldn't

733
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,320
Have taken the job
in the first place.

734
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:27,823
Oh, well, just wanted
to let you know that hr

735
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:30,792
Was working on getting
a replacement as we speak.

736
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,194
Do us both a favor,

737
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:34,062
And don't stick your neck
out for anyone this time.

738
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:37,432
By the way, word
in the bullpen

739
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,034
Is that you've been
calling every agent

740
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:40,235
And manager
in hollywood.

741
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:42,070
Well, signing
top-tier talent

742
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:45,040
Is part of my
day-in-and-day-out.

743
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:47,109
My computer has been set up

744
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:49,478
To see anyone who's
accessed my files,

745
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:51,480
I.T. Guy or not.

746
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:53,515
I know exactly why
you've turned up the heat

747
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,651
On all the available talent
in this town, ella.

748
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:59,054
Wow, uh...

749
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:01,857
So, any reason
why my security card

750
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:04,159
Still works
in the parking garage?

751
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:06,295
Well, you're
undeniably cutthroat.

752
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:07,829
You're not afraid
to throw a friend

753
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:09,898
Under the bus
to get what you want.

754
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:12,501
But do this to me again,
and you're finished here.

755
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:14,136
And everywhere else
that matters.

756
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:18,340
Thanks, I guess.

757
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:21,176
And now that I know
exactly what you're capable of,

758
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:24,346
Let's see how much further
you're willing to go.

759
00:32:30,486 --> 00:32:32,554
Oh, my god.

760
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,525
Jonah, you home?

761
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,403
What do you want?

762
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:50,305
You got your money.

763
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:52,074
Who's auggie?

764
00:32:52,141 --> 00:32:54,276
What?
After I left,

765
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:57,112
You and violet were talking
about some guy named auggie.

766
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,814
He's our neighbor.
Is he sleeping with her?

767
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:00,649
If I wait outside long
enough, this guy's gonna

768
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:02,417
Show up at her
door, isn't he?
Why do you care?

769
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:03,418
You're her brother.

770
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:04,486
Adopted brother.

771
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:09,558
Look, she isn't
seeing anyone, okay?

772
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:11,460
It's not about that.
You got the money.

773
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:12,995
Now, please, go.

774
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:14,463
If you don't want

775
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,897
To tell me the truth,

776
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:17,532
I'm going to make you
pay for it.

777
00:33:21,404 --> 00:33:22,904
What are you doing?

778
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:24,239
No, please,
that stuff isn't mine.

779
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:25,340
I know. It's mine.

780
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:26,775
Stop it!

781
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:28,543
I'm calling 911.

782
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:31,747
Put it down, levi!

783
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:33,415
Put it down,

784
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:34,950
Or we're going
to call the cops.

785
00:33:45,895 --> 00:33:46,895
Okay.

786
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:54,202
I've gotten
in enough trouble

787
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,971
Because of you already.

788
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:14,936
I feel so bad.

789
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:16,170
Don't worry about it.

790
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:19,073
I feel bad that you had
to grow up like that.

791
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,374
They were all lies.

792
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:21,509
I swear to god.

793
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:23,110
Nothing he said was true.

794
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:25,580
Jonah:
Oh, my god, my camera.

795
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,381
Riley, what...
What the hell happened?

796
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,749
I can't believe this.

797
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,051
It's not her fault.

798
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,118
I swear.

799
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:33,654
It's okay, violet.

800
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:34,989
I'll talk to you later.

801
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,095
Okay, um...

802
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,364
Help me understand here.
What happened?

803
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:45,833
What, did you and violet have,
like, a cage fight in here?

804
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:47,201
I sort of got
between violet

805
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,604
And her... Brother/boyfriend.

806
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,172
Um, okay.

807
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,240
Why does that not faze me
in the least?

808
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,944
Riley, when are you
going to realize

809
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,179
Every single time
you get involved

810
00:34:58,246 --> 00:34:59,313
With violet,
something bad happens?

811
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,048
She was in trouble.
What was I going to do?

812
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:02,216
Run.

813
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:03,751
Thanks to your
saving violet,

814
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:06,454
Jonah miller videography
is officially out of business.

815
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,889
I am so sorry, jonah.

816
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:10,391
We will get it
all back.

817
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:11,792
Yeah.

818
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,795
Well, at least you still have

819
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,664
The wpk job.

820
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:20,568
This might sound
like the most obvious thing

821
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:24,939
In the world to you,
but ella...

822
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,975
I... I just don't trust her,
and I quit.

823
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,445
Jonah, I know I'm hard on ella,

824
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,280
But she's always
done well for you.

825
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,449
If anything,
that's why I'm so hard on her.

826
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:37,685
Well, from here on,
a wall's going up between us.

827
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:42,123
A figurative wall, 'cause
I can't afford a real one.

828
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,237
Detective.

829
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:31,305
Nice gloves.

830
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:33,007
Keep them where
I can see them.

831
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:35,142
This is my son,
david's place.

832
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,811
I have permission
to be in his apartment.

833
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:38,245
Really?

834
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:38,446
Guess who tipped me off?

835
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:40,281
Off?

836
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,319
That's not mine.

837
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:47,154
Oh, whose
is it, then?

838
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,957
That's okay.

839
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:51,592
Should be more than enough
fingerprints on this

840
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,562
For me to make
the connection.

841
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,197
Michael mancini,
you're under arrest

842
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:57,331
For breaking
and entering.

843
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,966
You have the right
to remain silent.

844
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:00,267
Anything you say
can and will

845
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:02,336
Be used against you
in a court of law.

846
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,240
I know this must
sound stupid to you,

847
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:09,543
But your father
was a hero to me.

848
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:12,113
My father's spent his entire
it dolife deceiving people.

849
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:15,216
I know I said it
once before already,

850
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:18,419
But thank you
for trusting me.

851
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:21,088
Means a lot.

852
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,924
You know, um,
now that I know

853
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,560
What kind of man
your father really is,

854
00:37:26,628 --> 00:37:29,730
I think I'm starting to
understand you a little better.

855
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:32,299
You mean why I'm
so screwed up?

856
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,236
You're not that screwed up.

857
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,406
Ella:
Oh, geez.

858
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:41,609
Please don't tell me
you called me out here

859
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,410
To be the "p" in pda.

860
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,279
I texted you because
I have an announcement to make.

861
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,847
Jonah:
Hey, what's
going on, david?

862
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:57,024
Last night, the police
arrested my father.

863
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:59,293
He was the one
who killed sydney.

864
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,295
We all know that
auggie was innocent,

865
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,264
And now, with the right man
in custody,

866
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:05,299
It's only a matter of time
before he's exonerated.

867
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,834
Ella:
I hope there's
a greeting card

868
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:09,970
For "sorry we all thought you
stabbed the landlord to death."

869
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,238
So, I thought that we could

870
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:12,773
All raise a glass
and celebrate

871
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:15,176
Justice finally
getting a clue.

872
00:38:15,243 --> 00:38:17,111
Oh, no, no. I know
you're going to tell me

873
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:18,712
That's a $500 bottle of tequila,

874
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,815
But it's not
in my raw food cleanse.

875
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:21,982
To justice.

876
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:25,686
Amanda:
Pour one for me.

877
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:29,982
Amanda.

878
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,860
What are you doing here?

879
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:34,094
Just saying a quick good-bye.

880
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:36,030
I'm on a red-eye
to new york tonight.

881
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:37,131
Oh, bummer.

882
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,132
Oh, don't worry.

883
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,533
I'm just going to pack my things

884
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:40,734
And be right back.

885
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:41,869
My friend, jane,

886
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:43,337
Said I can stay in the penthouse

887
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,039
While my bel air home
is being built.

888
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,045
Great.

889
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:54,582
You know, the truth is,
I really missed this place.

890
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:56,584
And I can't wait
to become a part

891
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,802
Of each and every one
of your lives.
