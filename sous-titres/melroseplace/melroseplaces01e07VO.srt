00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,000
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:03,075
She moves in, and Sydney's dead.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,709
Okay, the girl's a little weird,

4
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:06,505
but that doesn't
make her a murderer.

5
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,632
There's a hostess
that just quit at Coal.

6
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,775
If I can put in
a good word for you...

7
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:14,513
We're getting married, guys.

8
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,349
All my life all I wanted
was to be a doctor.

9
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,769
I went on this fancy dinner with
this guy. He offered me $5,000

10
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,042
to have sex with him.

11
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,065
I'm Ella Simms, junior publicist.

12
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,775
Jonah, you are
a hugely-talented filmmaker.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,028
What's a rich boy like
you doing this stuff for?

14
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,075
Look, I need cash, okay?

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,818
David, what happened?

16
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:35,368
I borrowed a buddy
of mine's bike, spun it out.

17
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,276
Your injuries are completely
inconsistent with your story.

18
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:41,636
Anton V wants you to
model for his new line.

19
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:44,585
Ella has a thing for you. - You think
Ella's trying to come between us

20
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:46,376
when you and Auggie are, like...?

21
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,576
Friends?

22
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,547
Oh, God.

23
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,216
You can come to me with anything.

24
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,634
We're not gonna make it

25
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,844
if we just keep secrets
from each other.

26
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:54,929
No more secrets.

27
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,509
Oh, that's beautiful.
Amazing. Oh, this is wonderful.

28
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:19,912
I love it.
It's heaven.

29
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,124
Oh, it's gorgeous.
Work it. That's it.

30
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:24,625
Do I look tired?

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,786
I got, like,
an hour of sleep last night.

32
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:29,808
No. What, pre-photo shoot jitters?

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,509
Your smile could melt
the polar ice caps.

34
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,605
Okay? That lens is
gonna love you today.

35
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,348
Well, it doesn't make me feel

36
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,559
any less guilty for telling
my students

37
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,493
that their teacher
has a case of the sniffles.

38
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,981
So what? You go a couple
of days without a gold star.

39
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,742
Not the end of the world.

40
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,942
A little white lie not gonna hurt you,
especially

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,820
if we're getting ten grand
for you to pose in a pair of jeans.

42
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,563
Oh, my God, isn't your huge
meeting at Paramount today?

43
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:58,391
Why am I the only one
having an anxiety attack?

44
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:01,109
I guess I'm just good
at hiding my nerves.

45
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,998
I mean,
I'm only about to have a sit-down

46
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,626
with a guy whose films have
grossed over a billion dollars.

47
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,671
Do you realize, if Andrew Misher
turns Living in Reverse into a feature,

48
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,276
this could be huge for me.

49
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:13,883
Nothing would make me happier.

50
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,142
But for the record,

51
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:18,012
I don't need to see your
name in the opening credits

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,556
to know that I am
marrying the perfect guy.

53
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:26,515
We wouldn't even be daydreaming
about any opening credits

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,481
if you hadn't talked
me up to that agent.

55
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:45,994
What are you doing?

56
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:48,778
They're back.

57
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:51,212
- The sparrows?
- Yeah. See the eggs?

58
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,255
You know what that means?

59
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:55,007
That you win the bet.

60
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,884
And that I have
the honor of bringing you

61
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,220
- lattes for the next week.
- Lucky me.

62
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,230
What are you guys looking at?

63
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,794
Oh, nothing. We were just, uh...

64
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:06,808
we had a bet whether or not
these sparrows would be back.

65
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,276
Oh, how sweet.

66
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,440
Shouldn't you be in
a classroom right now?

67
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,900
Actually, I'm taking the day off.

68
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,403
I'm sort of working this
shoot for Anton V jeans.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,656
Well, like, as a photo assistant?

70
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,574
Like as a model.

71
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:22,243
No way.

72
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,411
A model?

73
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,496
Guess I'm just used to you in

74
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,142
a ponytail and running shorts.

75
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:29,959
Well, that's sort of
why they hired me.

76
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,211
The campaign is "Real
People Wear Real Denim."

77
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:34,547
Anton saw me at one
of Jonah's jobs, and,

78
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:37,007
I don't know,
wanted to photograph me.

79
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,175
I don't blame him.

80
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,177
I don't know.
All those people

81
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,470
staring at you.

82
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,180
Sounds totally stressful.

83
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,015
Yeah, tell me about it.

84
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,875
I better go. The shoot
is way out in Malibu.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,601
Well, you're going to do great.

86
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,357
So...

87
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,342
I hate to be the neighbor who is,

88
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,487
 like, always
asking for a cup of sugar,

89
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,198
but I just got this new furniture,

90
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,826
and it's in, like, 200 pieces.

91
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,819
Yeah, I could probably
help you out with that.

92
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:10,409
Thank you so much.
I seriously didn't know

93
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:12,576
what I was going to
do if you said no.

94
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,045
Yeah, I, uh... I think
I should be free after work,

95
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,339
so, I guess I could
stop by after that.

96
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,507
Perfect.

97
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:19,717
Okay.

98
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:37,800
Riley? Miss Richmond?

99
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:41,488
- You better have a tardy slip.
- You're here?

100
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,442
WPK wanted me to hold your
hand through your first shoot,

101
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,442
but so far, I've only had to
make excuses for the late model.

102
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,009
There was an accident on PCH.

103
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:51,309
- Where's Anton?
- Driving in from downtown.

104
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,276
No wonder he's running late.

105
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,542
Next time, just leave a
couple hours earlier, okay?

106
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:57,713
This is a big deal, Riley.

107
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,215
You could have missed a lot more
than just the Pledge of Allegiance.

108
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,981
Remember, you look good,
I look good.

109
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,095
Now, come on, let's go.

110
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,908
Look at you.

111
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,411
No scars, no bruising.

112
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:23,072
- Looks like you're gonna live, after all.
- Thanks to you, I'm a new man.

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,115
Just no more fistfights, all right?

114
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,431
- Doctor's orders.
- Can't make any promises.

115
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:37,658
Might want to tend to this one.

116
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:42,299
These people.
God. I've told them,

117
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,922
like, ten times there's
been some mistake.

118
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,971
They keep sending me
these stupid notices.

119
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,575
The bold-faced "Past Due" on that
envelope looks pretty serious.

120
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:55,145
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

121
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,144
It's not like you're
the first person

122
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,108
who's ever fallen behind
on a tuition payment.

123
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,242
Right. This is from the guy
who's never worried

124
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,855
about a bill in his life. Nice.

125
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,658
How much do you need?

126
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,871
It's fine.

127
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,142
They've given me till the end
of semester to pay in full,

128
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,627
and I've already made a lot
of headway, so it's-it's fine.

129
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:19,461
How much?

130
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,034
$20,000.

131
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,304
Let me loan it to you.

132
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:31,181
What?!

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,810
- There's no way.
- Straight up.

134
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,020
No interest.

135
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,689
There's got to be some benefit

136
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,434
in knowing a kid with
a trust fund, right?

137
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,409
That's a really generous offer,

138
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:44,842
but even with a trust fund,

139
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,780
you can afford to spare
that kind of money?

140
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,242
When they're gonna kick the best doctor
I've ever had out of med school, I can.

141
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:52,908
But money and friends...

142
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,581
That can get complicated. I don't...

143
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,457
I'll make sure it doesn't.

144
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,432
Sleep on it.

145
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,562
So Anton is obsessed
with this photographer.

146
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,643
Another one of his genius ideas.

147
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,476
He started using her six months ago

148
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:25,175
after he saw her shots of the
starving children in Africa.

149
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,863
Pretty much he would go to
the edge of the world for her.

150
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,782
And that is basically
where we are now.

151
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,367
I didn't realize there would
be so many people here.

152
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,992
Keep the butterflies to yourself.

153
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,424
Try not to think about the fact

154
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:40,177
that everybody out here is here
braving the elements

155
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,873
because of you.

156
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:42,998
Come on.

157
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,469
Gorgeous hair, sparkling eyes.

158
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,309
You must be my model.

159
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:55,307
Riley Richmond, meet Jo Reynolds.

160
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,601
Oh, my God.

161
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,853
You're Jo Reynolds?
The photojournalist.

162
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,648
The fashion photographer.

163
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,402
What do you say we shoot this thing?

164
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,907
<i>Dark_Chii, edouardn, Just-In,
Luoleilina, SirHill et WoLF971</i>

165
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,614
All right, schoolteacher,

166
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,161
let's start with some test shots.

167
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:25,742
I have to admit,

168
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:27,422
it's a little intimidating
posing for you.

169
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,340
Chin up.

170
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,761
Actually, I studied your "Snapshots
from Darfur" project at NYU.

171
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,055
- It was really powerful.
- Turn to the left.

172
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:36,936
Yeah, Darfur

173
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,352
was mind-blowing and heartbreaking.

174
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,105
Have you ever been to Africa?

175
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:44,565
I wish.

176
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,317
Started teaching right
after graduation, so,

177
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,209
not a lot of time for travel.

178
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,975
Well, isn't
that what summers are for?

179
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,407
There's a whole world
outside of that classroom of yours.

180
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,284
My fiance and I have
a few bills to pay off

181
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,703
before we can even think about
traveling around the world.

182
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,206
Fiance? Aren't you a little young
to commit for the rest of your life?

183
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,961
I'm just going to
change a lens. Take five.

184
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,094
This is never gonna work.
She's a total amateur.

185
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,054
That's why Anton hired her...

186
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:18,599
A real girl for real denim.

187
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:20,684
Oh, come on.

188
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,842
Models are like jeans. You just have
to break them in a little bit.

189
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,075
I see this all the time
with the new girls.

190
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,519
You know, she's just
afraid to lose her inhibitions.

191
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,442
I need hot, I need sexy.

192
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,112
How am I doing?

193
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,376
Is everything okay?

194
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:36,169
You're doing great. I'm just
gonna shake it up a bit,

195
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,105
look for a different look, so, um,

196
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:41,037
keep the jeans, and lose the top.

197
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,726
There you go.
Parking's straight ahead.

198
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,368
Well, sure, Johnny, take your time,
but I got to be honest with you.

199
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,037
Leo's people are all
over me for this role,

200
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,538
so let us know soon, huh?

201
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,620
All right. Hey, take care, Johnny.

202
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,794
You must be the Jonah Miller.

203
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,046
Living in Reverse. I'm Andy.

204
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:32,791
That wasn't...

205
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,675
was that Johnny Depp on the phone?

206
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,551
Welcome to the dream, my friend.

207
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,758
We got a lot to discuss.

208
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:42,683
I am a huge fan of your films.

209
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,253
When I heard
that you watched my short, I was...

210
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,021
I thought they were going to have
to peel me up off the floor.

211
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,852
Good. 'Cause I got to tell you,
I loved it.

212
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:52,234
I completely identified
with that character.

213
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,183
It's like everything
is finally going right,

214
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:55,543
and then bang!

215
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,322
- It all turns upside down.
- Exactly.

216
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,865
So, here's what I think.

217
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,158
Love the title.

218
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,061
Okay. Love the characters.

219
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,705
Not so in love with
the story in reverse.

220
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:09,209
I mean, that's...
it's kind of the point,

221
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,309
'cause it's called
Living In Reverse.

222
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:14,006
Yeah, but who wants to pay ten bucks
to see a movie backwards?

223
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:17,926
Right.

224
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:20,428
Trust me on this one.

225
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:31,398
All right, let's go, hot stuff.
Jo's locked and loaded.

226
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,164
Ella, you have to stop this.

227
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:34,711
I am not taking my shirt off.

228
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,675
Riley, sweetheart,
this is a jeans ad.

229
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,475
A little skin is par for the course.

230
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,376
Does Anton know about this?

231
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,369
He's still on the road, but I just spoke
to him, and he loves the take.

232
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,343
Okay?

233
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,142
Jo knows what she's doing.

234
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:50,959
What happens when my parents Google my
name and they see this on the Internet?

235
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,322
You're an adult, Riley.

236
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,575
How many people do you know
that can throw on a pair of jeans

237
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,275
and get paid ten grand?

238
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,615
Which... not to mention... is, like,

239
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,568
50 wilderness scout
videos in Jonah dollars.

240
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:09,644
Maybe I'm just not cut out for this.

241
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:12,409
Come on, Riley, you're beautiful.

242
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:16,067
And not just denim ad beautiful,
either.

243
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,242
You're one of those girls
who can't walk into a room

244
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,460
without everyone falling
in love with them.

245
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:23,600
It's disgusting, actually.

246
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:26,861
Thanks...

247
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:28,652
I guess.

248
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:31,875
And the camera is the same way.

249
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,421
You know, you'll walk out there,

250
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,209
it'll fall madly in love with you,

251
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,009
everyone will gush and...

252
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,134
it'll be great.

253
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,342
To be totally honest,

254
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,269
you were the last person
I wanted by my side for this.

255
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:54,856
But I'm actually glad you're here.

256
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:57,676
Good.

257
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,743
Now, will you get
your butt out there

258
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:01,571
and try to enjoy
being a diva for once?

259
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:03,365
Please, can you?

260
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:05,001
Think bitch.

261
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,742
Attitude, attitude.

262
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,536
Shake it off. Breathe.

263
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,747
Work the ladies, work the
ladies, work the ladies.

264
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,748
Let's go.

265
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,218
Man, if they ever found out
I was selling these treasure maps...

266
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,774
Yeah, mum's the word.

267
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:27,764
Where are the security codes?

268
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,434
- You're doing the world a favor.
- By increasing the crime rate?

269
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:34,229
By letting these rich bastards know
they can't lie and cheat their way

270
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:35,990
into these million- dollar homes.

271
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:38,358
Hey, this home up on Alpine...

272
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,809
they launder drug money.

273
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:41,278
They're getting what they deserve.

274
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,952
So, we make the lead a woman.

275
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,788
I'm telling you, Cameron Diaz
is going to flip for this thing.

276
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:55,124
We tell the story in
chronological order,

277
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,667
lose all the black and white stuff.

278
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,335
How's that sound?

279
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,376
Andrew Misher's office...

280
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,925
it sounds very different.

281
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,385
Great. Listen, I got to head out,

282
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:07,678
but I love

283
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:08,743
what we're orbiting here.

284
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:10,367
Can't wait for your new take.

285
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:12,476
We'll talk soon, kid.

286
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,527
Andrew Misher's office...

287
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,942
I know that look.

288
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,655
You think you're giving
Andrew Misher Sling Blade,

289
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,617
and he pitches you back
the next Freddy Krueger.

290
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,442
Oh, no, it wasn't so bad.

291
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,109
Right.

292
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,914
I'm Kendra, his development exec.

293
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,843
Sorry I missed your meeting. I had a
five-minute notes call with Michael Bay

294
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,609
that turned into two
hours of arguing.

295
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:41,045
Geez.

296
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,743
Miller, I know. I'm the one

297
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,409
Charlie Kitsis called
to get you in the door.

298
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,763
The door that's about
to hit me on the way out?

299
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,409
It just turns out
that Andrew and I are on...

300
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,100
completely separate
pages with all this.

301
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,376
Andrew's never on anyone's page.

302
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,021
But the good news is,
I actually have

303
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,534
a lot of say in how
we develop the scripts.

304
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,709
Let me guess.

305
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,442
Mine needs a 3-D alien invasion

306
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:09,008
followed with... an apocalypse?

307
00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:13,576
Actually, I wouldn't change a thing.

308
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,042
I want to turn Living in Reverse
into a feature film.

309
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,642
And if you're not busy now, I'd love

310
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,708
to discuss what we can do
to make that happen...

311
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,419
on your terms.

312
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:23,576
Are you punking me?

313
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,209
Is it, like...

314
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,717
Seriously?

315
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,676
So, what's taking her

316
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,558
so long?
Okay, so here's the deal.

317
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,809
Riley's chest has
seen the light of day

318
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,603
about as often
as the latest Usher album.

319
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,309
She's been with...
three guys her entire life,

320
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,109
and her idea of a good time
is hanging out at Whole Foods

321
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,569
trying to convince you

322
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,779
to save the whales.

323
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,442
So, if you want her
to feel comfortable,

324
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,376
you're going to have to appeal
to her sensibilities.

325
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,467
Comfortable is the last thing
I want her to feel.

326
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:57,746
All right. You ready?

327
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,039
You good to lose the shirt?

328
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,676
"Good" is stretching it.

329
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,975
Come on, sweetie.

330
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,209
Riley, this is a jeans ad, you know.
All the models are topless,

331
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:07,923
and I don't come up with this stuff,
so just relax...

332
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,450
deep breath.
It'll be beautiful.

333
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:14,567
Here we go.

334
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,684
There we go. Don't be afraid

335
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,769
to show that body of yours.

336
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,439
No more fake smiles.
We tried that already.

337
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,773
Come on, this is a campaign

338
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,025
about raw emotion.

339
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,818
You're a real woman
with real feelings.

340
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,942
Let it all out.
What do you think

341
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,142
I'm trying to do?
I don't know.

342
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,115
You're still hiding it. Come on.

343
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:35,117
These are the jeans
that the teacher puts on

344
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,327
after the bell rings.

345
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:41,209
She's new at this, remember?
Go easy on her.

346
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,916
I want you to show
me the side of you

347
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,669
that wants to unchain herself
from the classroom,

348
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,837
from the fiance

349
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,275
that's stopping you
from being the person

350
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,967
you really want to be.
I am the person I want to be.

351
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,242
Come on.

352
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:54,595
Nobody really wants

353
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,930
to teach public school
and marry some guy

354
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,641
who can't even pay the bills!

355
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,351
Come on.

356
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,142
You're just afraid of the unknown.

357
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,075
All right, that's it.
You know what? That guy

358
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,476
is someone I love, and that
classroom is my passion.

359
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,567
Even on the hardest days,
at least I know I'm

360
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:10,653
following my heart.
That's a lot more

361
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:12,738
than I can say about you.
Sweetheart,

362
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,975
why don't we go for a walk
and unwind a little bit?

363
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,943
Somebody get her a benzo, ASAP.

364
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,224
Forget it, I quit.

365
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:29,376
You have a minute?

366
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:31,257
Now is not actually a good time.

367
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:33,008
You okay?

368
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,934
Just on my way to
a business meeting.

369
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,975
So, um...

370
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,676
David, if your offer still stands,

371
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,975
I... I'd actually like to
take you up on that loan.

372
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,275
We can organize a payment plan.

373
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,820
Money's yours. Just give me
a couple of days to make it happen.

374
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,776
Thank you... so much.

375
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,634
No worries.

376
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,367
Studying to be an architect?

377
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:08,336
That?

378
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,296
No, it's just some property

379
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:12,142
I'm thinking about acquiring.
Really?

380
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,427
Beverly Hills mansion.
I knew you had money, but...

381
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,920
I'm just looking for now.
Putting my feelers out there

382
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,305
for some investment opportunities.

383
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,975
Since when has flipping
multi-million dollar real estate

384
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,435
been a hobby of yours?

385
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:26,367
Since... forever.

386
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,242
Is something wrong, David?

387
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,657
You in trouble?
'Cause if you are, you can tell me.

388
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,159
Nobody's in any trouble.

389
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:40,618
Now, uh...

390
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:42,901
do you mind?

391
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,934
I got to get ready.

392
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,743
Okay. So...

393
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:53,476
that little paper thingy you signed?

394
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,342
Yeah, that was a contract.

395
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,476
You can't leave.

396
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,342
I didn't sign off
on being humiliated.

397
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,847
If this is what being a model
is about, it's not for me.

398
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:03,433
Okay, look. Anton is on his way,
and if you're not here,

399
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,142
then I get an ass-whipping,

400
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,811
and it turns into a PR nightmare.

401
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:08,938
That is all you care about,
isn't it?

402
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,476
Furthering your career.

403
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:12,108
Hey, I meant what I said

404
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,402
in there, okay?
It's your choice

405
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,042
if you don't want to
believe in yourself.

406
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,698
Since when does believing in myself
require me to abandon all self-respect?

407
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:21,576
Do you think Jonah's self-respect

408
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,869
soars through the roof
every time he shoots

409
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,509
a Dora the Explorer-
themed birthday bash?

410
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:27,332
No! It's called compromise, Riley.

411
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,709
You know what, just stop.
I don't trust you.

412
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,109
I have never trusted you,

413
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:33,875
and I am not having
this conversation with you.

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,925
Well, have fun
having it with your fiancs, then,

415
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,242
when you tell him you blew it today.

416
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,476
I mean, really?

417
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:41,930
Giving up on ten grand

418
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,567
because of a little ego bruise?

419
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,109
Kind of says a lot about the way

420
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,634
things work at home, doesn't it?

421
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,542
You heading out?

422
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,743
Yeah. That killer lunch rush.

423
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:07,975
Just hoping my legs will hold

424
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,342
till I get to the bus stop.

425
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,125
I can take you home if you want.

426
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,627
On your motorcycle?

427
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,005
Only if you appreciate that a Triumph
is so much more than a motorcycle.

428
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,042
Auggie, I... I don't want
to take your helmet.

429
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,242
Are you kidding me?

430
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:20,809
You think I'd ever let
anything happen to you?

431
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,434
Come on. Let's go.

432
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:29,394
I loved how you played with shadows.

433
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:31,209
Well, that whole last sequence,
that was lit

434
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:32,843
by one super-long string
of Christmas lights.

435
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:35,483
What? Yeah.
It wasn't going to work, I didn't think,

436
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,309
'cause the Santa bulbs
kept getting in the way,

437
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:39,988
but it actually...
it, uh, turned out really cool.

438
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,542
Well, look, Jonah,

439
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,376
you're obviously passionate
about your vision,

440
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,008
and as the voice in Andrew's ear,

441
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:48,367
I want to make sure he knows
exactly what that vision is.

442
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:54,210
Thank you so much. I mean,

443
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,318
this movie is pretty much my life.

444
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,576
Movies in general are my life.

445
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:00,809
Hooked the moment I saw

446
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:03,409
Chitty Chitty Bang
Bang at the Ritz Five.

447
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:05,471
Wait. What?

448
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,140
The Ritz Five in Philly?

449
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:08,975
You've been there?

450
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,476
Kendra, that's where I'm from.

451
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,312
- What?
- I'm from Philly.

452
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,772
The Ritz Five is one of my favorite
movie theaters of all time.

453
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,859
- Me, too.
- I've had life-altering experiences

454
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:19,309
in those hallowed walls.
Oh, my...

455
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:21,487
Taxi Driver...
And Rang Bull.

456
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,409
The Scorsese festival. The best...

457
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:26,145
- I go every year at Christmas.
- Me, too.

458
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:27,975
I ca...
This... I can't deal with this.

459
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,843
Like, we've probably
been standing in line

460
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:31,706
ordering popcorn together.

461
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:34,676
I think I would have remembered you.

462
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:37,175
Yeah, I definitely think

463
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,934
I would have remembered you.

464
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,242
You know, I'm having
drinks tonight at Katsuya

465
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,442
with the VP of Paramount.

466
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:48,776
We'll probably be done by 10:00.

467
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:50,433
You want to join me after?

468
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,061
Uh, meet you after your drinks?

469
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,520
To work on our pitch.

470
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,025
T... to work on the pitch.

471
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:01,942
Sounds good, sounds...
yeah, sounds great.

472
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,267
I'll save you a seat at the bar.

473
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,735
What are you doing?

474
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,709
You don't want to buy this house.

475
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,425
My real estate agent stood me up.

476
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,042
I'm actually just on my way out.

477
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,576
Yeah, so what's with
the black gloves?

478
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,109
Lauren, this isn't a good time.
Right.

479
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:32,875
First you get beaten up,
then the blueprints.

480
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,509
The bag... David, what's going on?
You're completely overreacting.

481
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:37,312
Then show me what's in there.
This is ridiculous.

482
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,898
Excuse me.

483
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:48,109
Lauren, get in the car.

484
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,975
We got to get out of here.

485
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,244
Now.

486
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,743
Guess there's no love lost
between you and the speed limit.

487
00:22:58,868 --> 00:22:59,975
I peeked back a few times

488
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,942
to make sure you were
still holding on.

489
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,175
All that adrenaline tired me out.

490
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,218
How about a margarita before
we tackle the furniture?

491
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:10,008
Virgin, obviously.

492
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,765
Sure, why not?

493
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:17,936
You okay?

494
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,981
Yeah, I'm fine.

495
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,008
Hey, hey, what's up?

496
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,737
Nothing, I just...

497
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,275
I totally tanked the shoot,

498
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:30,991
and now I have to
break the news to Jonah

499
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,409
that that extra money we were
counting on doesn't exist.

500
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,745
Hey, it was just one shoot.

501
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,580
Yeah, exactly, one shoot.

502
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,081
Do you know how many video jobs

503
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,875
Jonah's had to sweat through
just so we can make rent?

504
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,908
Do you want to come
over for a minute?

505
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,838
I'll make some tea.

506
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,590
You can shed some of that stress.

507
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,717
No, looks like you're in the
middle of something. I'm okay.

508
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,344
No, no, it's, it's totally fine.

509
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,973
Come over, please.

510
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,342
Is Riley okay?

511
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,309
Yeah, she's just...
she's just had a rough day.

512
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,986
Um, do you mind if
I help you out tomorrow?

513
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,042
No, of course not.

514
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:12,365
Riley obviously needs
you more than I do.

515
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,834
Thanks, Violet.

516
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,576
Ella said
the photographer was trying

517
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:23,476
to strip away my inhibitions.

518
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:24,776
I don't know.

519
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:27,567
Sounds like she took you
for a rough ride out there.

520
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:30,209
I moved where she wanted,

521
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,309
I looked where she wanted,
I did everything she said.

522
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:34,667
I mean...

523
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:38,434
Auggie, I even took my shirt off.

524
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,567
How'd that go?

525
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:43,809
How do you think?

526
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:47,242
I'm a schoolteacher pretending to be
some sort of supermodel.

527
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,776
Yeah, well, you're allowed to want

528
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:50,509
more than one thing in life, Riley.

529
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:54,142
Jonah is going to hate me
for giving up that money.

530
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:56,709
Riley,
I don't know if you know this,

531
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,601
but it's kind of
impossible to hate you.

532
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,634
He'll understand.

533
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:07,380
I just had to get out of there.
She just kept

534
00:25:08,017 --> 00:25:10,758
pushing me to be this reckless,
carefree

535
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,494
kind of person who just throws
caution to the wind.

536
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:20,133
It's like she was trying to make
me question my choices in life.

537
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:29,467
You don't think I'm too young
to get married, do you?

538
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:34,033
I don't think I'm the
right guy to answer that.

539
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,843
You know, um, instead of drinks,

540
00:25:48,968 --> 00:25:51,342
like, if you just want to meet
at your office another day,

541
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,242
my schedule is super loose.

542
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:56,053
Eh, don't worry about it.
Drinks go on the company card.

543
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,442
You got to love a studio gig.

544
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,423
You've seen Autumn Falls, right?

545
00:26:01,548 --> 00:26:02,659
Three times.

546
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:05,479
My ex-boyfriend
wrote and directed it.

547
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,064
Kevin Carlyle is your ex-boyfriend?

548
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:10,916
Andrew plucked him out of
obscurity and made him huge.

549
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,234
You kind of remind me of him.

550
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,809
Thank you.

551
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:22,376
Look, I got to be honest with you,
Kendra.

552
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:25,975
I don't know if I can come tonight.

553
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,709
How come?

554
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:30,809
It's just I...

555
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:33,342
well, I,
I kind of have some plans already.

556
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,367
So, you know...

557
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:39,043
All right, well, if
you happen to free up,

558
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:41,168
You know where I'll be.

559
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,542
Caleb, Muffin, I would hardly
call the shoot a disaster.

560
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,030
Look, I'm sure Jo got
some amazing shots.

561
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,042
Of course I'll work it out.

562
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,703
I always do.

563
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,309
That girl was a waste of my time.

564
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:09,509
So Riley's no Elle Macpherson.

565
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:10,908
Not like you did her any favors,

566
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:12,743
constantly reminding her of that.

567
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:15,075
With amateurs, it's my job
to ruffle their feathers.

568
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,509
Without that little push,

569
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,175
she couldn't even
get off the ground.

570
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,847
Right, and you're the
professional, supposedly.

571
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,975
Maybe you shouldn't
have pushed her so hard.

572
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,434
It's what I do.

573
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,145
Until she's able to tap
into who she really is,

574
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,898
she should stick to the ABC's instead
of selling out for a pair of jeans

575
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,233
and a few thousand bucks.

576
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,875
Selling out?

577
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:39,442
I'm sorry,
weren't you the one who traded in

578
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,785
the refugee camps for a
12-page spread in Vogue?

579
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:48,416
Maybe Riley wasn't the only one
posing out there today.

580
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:18,275
Isn't this bird's nest,
like, the coolest thing ever?

581
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,406
If it wasn't
dive-bombing our doorway.

582
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:26,036
What were you doing out
here... gauging the pH levels?

583
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:27,275
No, I was just taking a break.

584
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,539
I've been trying to put
some furniture together.

585
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,576
Right.

586
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:33,843
I would lend you a hand with that,

587
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:36,109
but, uh, I have a date with Riley

588
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:38,006
when she gets back
from her photo shoot.

589
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,275
I think Riley's back already.

590
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,542
No, I'm pretty sure she's not.

591
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,609
She was going to call
me on her way home.

592
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:46,473
Well, then, maybe your phone's
messed up. She came home

593
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,225
about a half hour ago.
She's probably still at Auggie's.

594
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:51,876
Sh... she went to Auggie's?

595
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:54,231
He was supposed to help me
assemble my furniture,

596
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:56,559
but then she came home
and she was super upset,

597
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:58,075
so he invited her over.

598
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,070
Wait... did something
happen at the shoot?

599
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:01,537
No clue.

600
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,042
You know how the two of them are...

601
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:07,142
like everything's
their little secret.

602
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:09,075
I should let you

603
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,409
get back to your life.
I promise I won't drag you

604
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:12,975
into any more of my meltdowns.

605
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,167
Riley, we all have our moments.

606
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:15,877
We wouldn't be human if we didn't.

607
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,217
Oh, hey, buddy.

608
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:25,762
Come on in.

609
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,609
I heard you had a big meeting
with a producer today.

610
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,942
How was your meeting?

611
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:32,310
Please tell me we have
a reason to celebrate.

612
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,676
Yeah, yeah, it went, uh, went great.

613
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,023
That's awesome.

614
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,067
I am so glad you're home.

615
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,442
I'm starving

616
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,946
and in desperate need
of a champagne buzz.

617
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,324
Oh, I guess that means
your shoot went well?

618
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:50,075
I will tell you all about
it when we get home.

619
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:54,666
I want to borrow
a bike pump from Auggie.

620
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,167
Meet you back at the ranch?

621
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,919
I'll go dig out those veggie burgers

622
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,546
that have been hiding
in the freezer.

623
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,968
Perfect.

624
00:30:03,978 --> 00:30:05,542
Thanks for the tea,

625
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,554
Anytime.

626
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:16,771
What's going on here?

627
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:19,376
What are you talking about?

628
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,476
I'm talking about the hours on end

629
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,320
you spend behind closed
doors with my fiancée.

630
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,476
Riley's shoot didn't go as planned.

631
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:28,492
She just wanted to talk about it.

632
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,743
And look who was more than happy

633
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,453
to throw a strong
shoulder in her direction.

634
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,871
You were in a meeting, she
didn't want to bother you.

635
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:34,330
Seriously,

636
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,498
that's all that happened.

637
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:36,975
Right. So, you're still playing

638
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,501
the "we're just friends" card?

639
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:40,295
I'm not playing any card, Jonah.

640
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,173
We are just friends.

641
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,673
Really?

642
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:45,049
Because I saw security footage

643
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,594
of you guys sitting out
in the courtyard acting

644
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:48,929
like way more

645
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:49,875
than friendly.

646
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,942
You mean the day after Sydney died?

647
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:54,242
I was barely holding it together.

648
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:57,309
Riley was the one person
who would talk to me.

649
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,776
I'm sure it was
the sound of her voice

650
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,774
you found so incredibly consoling.

651
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,652
You're way off base.
I just want you to tell me

652
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:06,975
that you and Riley have not
crossed the line of friendship.

653
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,008
You know, she always jokes
that you're paranoid.

654
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,442
She's not really joking, is she?

655
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,809
Look, Riley and I have already
talked about what happened,

656
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,289
I think maybe it's
time that you fess up.

657
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,834
She kissed me,
not the other way around.

658
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,506
She kissed you?

659
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,875
Wha...

660
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,888
Look, I'm talking about...

661
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,400
She kissed you?

662
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,270
It's not what you think.

663
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:41,734
She was drunk.

664
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,442
She loves you.

665
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:45,602
Trust me.

666
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,676
So, what should we toast?

667
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:11,135
To your bright future

668
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:12,843
as a filmmaker?

669
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:14,931
Or my terribly short
career as a model?

670
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,567
Okay, you are either really
thirsty or really upset.

671
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,612
Why did you go to Auggie?

672
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:34,008
Jonah, you were having
the biggest meeting of your career.

673
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,242
I didn't want to burden you
with my modeling woes.

674
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,342
Right, well,
you could have texted me.

675
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,142
I guess it was just...

676
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:42,126
just easier to go to
Auggie's open door.

677
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,609
What?

678
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:46,075
This isn't about Auggie,

679
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,042
it's about me,

680
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,109
completely blowing it today.

681
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:51,409
Ten grand.

682
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:52,542
Gone.

683
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:53,609
I mean, I... I showed up,

684
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,743
and... I couldn't follow through.

685
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,542
I really wanted

686
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,144
to do this for you,
Jonah, and I couldn't.

687
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,975
I let you down.

688
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,984
No, you didn't.

689
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,175
You didn't let me down.

690
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,642
At least not because
you ran out on some...

691
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:13,824
some photo shoot.

692
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,994
I don't care about the money.

693
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,122
You get that, right?

694
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,442
All I care about

695
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:27,042
is knowing that you're
telling me the truth.

696
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,576
So there's nothing going
on between you two?

697
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,942
Are you... are you

698
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:34,843
seriously still worried

699
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,175
about Auggie and me?

700
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,676
Nothing has ever happened

701
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,642
between you guys?

702
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,376
Your ring is on

703
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,342
my finger.

704
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,843
You are the only guy
I want to be with.

705
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:48,442
You want the truth, that's it.

706
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,153
Right.

707
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:55,157
You sound entirely convinced.

708
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,908
I just gotta get

709
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,309
some air.

710
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:04,625
Whatever you need to do.

711
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:15,075
What, are you stalking me now?

712
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,075
David, this is serious.

713
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:20,409
That must've been thousands
of dollars worth of diamonds.

714
00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:22,442
Not really your problem, is it?

715
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,075
Is it the thrill?

716
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,576
Do you get off on doing this to people?
I see.

717
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,275
First you're my doctor,
now you're my shrink.

718
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,776
David, if you think you need

719
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,609
to go out and take what's not yours,

720
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:34,409
there's obviously something
missing in your life.

721
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:37,609
What would you know about that, huh?

722
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:39,609
That's right.

723
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,109
Miss prim and proper.

724
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:42,109
The ambitious doctor

725
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,109
who's got it all figured out.

726
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:45,975
You wouldn't have any
idea what it's like

727
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,376
to have to bend
the rules just to get by.

728
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,087
You don't think there are times

729
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:52,714
when I feel powerless?

730
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,109
When I just want

731
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,342
to close my eyes and pretend
that I was somebody else?

732
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,975
You know what?

733
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:01,181
It doesn't mean I go out
and victimize people.

734
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,709
They're not victims.

735
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,809
The people that I target...

736
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:08,242
white-collar criminals.

737
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,309
Scum of the Earth.
Just like my father.

738
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:13,275
What does this have to do
with Dr. Mancini?

739
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,609
My dad's not

740
00:35:14,734 --> 00:35:16,476
the miracle worker that you
and your med school buddies

741
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:17,905
put on a pedestal, I'm sorry.

742
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,908
Well, you know what, David?

743
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:22,908
No father's perfect.

744
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:25,997
He never had an interest in
being my father, Laur.

745
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,008
You know, the idea of a... of
trust fund is almost laughable

746
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,542
considering he's done
everything in his power

747
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,337
to forget I even exist.

748
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,709
Well, I'm sorry.

749
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,709
I'm sorry he let you down.

750
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,175
You didn't deserve it.

751
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,179
But stealing?

752
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,142
Come on, David,

753
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,183
that's not how to get back at him.

754
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,242
Maybe you're right.

755
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,142
But it does allow to loan money
to my friends, doesn't it?

756
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,376
David, do you think I want

757
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,709
anything to do with your money

758
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,114
now that I know where
it comes from, huh?

759
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,328
So, where's your moral
compass pointing to now?

760
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:07,830
Police?

761
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,333
My old man?

762
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:14,743
I'm going to do you
the biggest favor of your life.

763
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:16,756
I'm going to keep it between us.

764
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,576
And in return,

765
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:22,054
you're never going to steal again.

766
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,609
Go ahead.

767
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:28,936
Answer it.

768
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:07,473
Still need a hand?

769
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,908
I wasn't expecting you to show up.

770
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:11,809
Yeah, sorry I had to bail earlier.

771
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,142
It's cool. Building

772
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,399
this thing has actually
been kind of therapeutic.

773
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,653
Really? 'Cause that's exactly
what I'm looking for right now.

774
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,990
Are you okay?

775
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:27,442
Yeah, just my sponsor'not
answering his phone.

776
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,342
I'll be fine. I just

777
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,309
think putting
my hands to work would...

778
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:34,333
help clear my mind.

779
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:36,419
Great.

780
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,509
So...

781
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:40,214
what are we making?

782
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,376
My new bed.

783
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:45,094
Your new bed.

784
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:49,942
Let's do this.

785
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:50,893
All right.

786
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,501
Oh, these...

787
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,910
It's your favorite photographer.

788
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,743
I couldn't

789
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:54,843
believe when I looked your address.

790
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:56,874
I used to live in
this very building.

791
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,875
Are you serious?

792
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,421
Right over there.

793
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,841
A lot of memories in this place.

794
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,886
A lot of them I'd rather forget.

795
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,097
I noticed someone still
rides a motorcycle.

796
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:12,234
Is that your fiance's?

797
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,186
Someone else, actually.

798
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:21,142
Listen, I came by to tell you

799
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,642
that you kind of hit
a nerve with me today,

800
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,275
when you told me to go to hell.

801
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,975
Look, you were just doing your job.

802
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,656
I was totally out of my element...

803
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:29,576
No, but you were right.

804
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,509
I told you to set yourself free,

805
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:36,609
and maybe it's time
I take my own advice.

806
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,175
Does that mean you're thinking
about going back to Darfur?

807
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,242
Actually, I was thinking
of heading south for a bit,

808
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,642
to bring some media attention to
the food shortage

809
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,676
in Latin America.

810
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:49,094
Well, you're obvious
the right woman for the job.

811
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:53,609
You have a gift of exposing
things in your photos

812
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,308
that most people are afraid
to look at in real life.

813
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,342
It comes with a big pay cut.

814
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:00,142
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

815
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:02,941
you kind of got through to me, too.

816
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,609
Maybe I have closed myself off.

817
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:11,532
Maybe I need to be
a little more open-minded.

818
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:16,412
You know, when I was your age,
I was engaged.

819
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,376
After I left him,

820
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:20,751
that's when my real life kicked in.

821
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:26,342
How did you know it was
the right thing to do?

822
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,051
I didn't.

823
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:34,309
I almost forgot.

824
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:35,931
Listen,
don't worry about how today ended.

825
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,809
Anton, he saw that last photo.

826
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,603
He said he's never seen such
raw emotion in his whole life.

827
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:43,275
Congratulations.

828
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,900
You are the new face
of Anton V. Jeans.

829
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,652
You're kidding me.

830
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,029
Oh, my God.

831
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,120
Good luck, Riley.

832
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:32,008
You showed.

833
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:33,405
I was scared missed you.

834
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:34,907
What happened to your plans?

835
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:37,042
Just decided

836
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,329
it was an opportunity
I couldn't pass up.

837
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:42,248
Can I buy you a drink?

838
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,342
Sure.
