1
00:00:00,588 --> 00:00:02,138
<...on melrose place...

2
00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:02,635
CAN WE GO-BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS?

3
00:00:01,581 --> 00:00:02,958
NO-IN-THE-INGEGPART.

4
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:05,848
WITH EVREYTHING IT'S
HAPPYING I'M NOT SO SURE

5
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:13,205
What are you doing
with my mom's ring?

6
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:15,359
You could get in, like,
so much trouble

7
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:16,627
if my father caught you.

8
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:19,864
Six months ago, I fell behind
in my tuition payments.

9
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:21,599
I had sex for money.

10
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:23,634
Do you recognize this valve?

11
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:25,136
It's the one Dr. Mancini invented.

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,505
You're trying to tell me that
the valve is leaching toxins

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,773
into the bloodstream?

14
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:30,474
It's a Van de Kamp.
It's worth $19 mil.

15
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:31,442
So this is why

16
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:33,811
Amanda Woodward
slithered back to L.A.

17
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:36,614
<i> If Syd painted over the Van de
Kamp with water-soluble paint,</i>

18
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:38,583
<i>she's a lot smarter than I
thought.</i>

19
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:39,884
I know you're the embezzler.

20
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:41,285
And it appears that you've stolen

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

22
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:43,421
I overheard you

23
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:46,023
<i>talking to Jo-
you set me up.</i>

24
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,394
?T× ?T×

25
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:07,545
What a way to wake up.

26
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:08,813
Alarm clocks ar overrated.

27
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:10,982
So wait. Is this how
I get to wake up

28
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:12,984
for my 6:00 a.m.
call-times every day?

29
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:16,187
Ooh, that early and you are
on your own, my friend.

30
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:18,823
Even if you are Mr. Writer/Director

31
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:19,857
of a major motion picture.

32
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:21,192
Oh, gosh, it's a little daunting

33
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,693
when you put it that way.

34
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:24,562
What? Are you kidding?

35
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,063
You're gonna be amazing.

36
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:27,832
Plus, now you'll
have a whole lot more

37
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:29,867
to brag about at your college mixer

38
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:33,971
than snatching uan incredibly h.

39
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,040
Yeah, well, I wouldn't have to brag

40
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:38,442
Yeah, well, I wouldn't have to brag

41
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:40,344
if you'd just come with me today.

42
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,913
Seriously. Come on.
Call in sick and be my date.

43
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,248
What?! On the day her highness

44
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:46,284
comes parading back
into the office?

45
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:47,451
Not gonna happen

46
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:49,020
comes paShe's got me by
back inthe ovaries, Jonah,

47
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:52,056
and she's not letting 'em go.

48
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,260
As long as I'm around,
she can embezzle all shE wants.

49
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:59,864
Look, big bad Amanda
can huff and puff

50
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:01,966
and plant as much
evidence as she wants.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,302
There's no way she's actually
gonna get away with this.

52
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:05,636
Why not?

53
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,872
She's done a lot worse.

54
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,273
Not to Ella Simms she hasn't.

55
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:11,442
The last place I would want to land

56
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:13,644
is in your crosshairs.

57
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,919
And this is Mmm,
you're a smart for you.

58
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:23,020
What is it?

59
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,222
Two eyes, a nose.

60
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:26,791
It's a total smiley face.

61
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:28,759
It's delicious.

62
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,561
Yeah? But maybe you
should stay away

63
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,063
from food art and stick
to playing doctor.

64
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:35,399
All right.
Well, if that's the case,

65
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:38,569
back to bed. Doctor's orders.

66
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,139
Hmm, well, if I can't find my keys,

67
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:45,009
I mighve to take you
up on that offer.

68
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:48,179
Oh, here they are.

69
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,416
"Aortic heart valve replacement."

70
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:54,685
No wonder you fall asleep studying.

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,089
That's, uh, stupid school stuff.

72
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:00,024
So, uh, today's the big day, huh?

73
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:04,028
Jonah's coming to get his Lego
sculptures out of your hair.

74
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:05,863
Yep, he's moving into
Violet's old place.

75
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:07,865
He says, by the end of the day,

76
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,467
my apartment will be
officially Jonah-free.

77
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:12,370
I will say I'm gonna miss his
killer comic book collection.

78
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:14,238
I'm gonna miss having
something on the walls.

79
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:17,408
He owns all of the
art in that place.

80
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:21,879
I actually may be able to
help you in that department.

81
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:25,182
I found this way
back in the closet.

82
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:28,352
I guess top chef left it behind.

83
00:03:28,387 --> 00:03:30,654
It's not much, but it's a start.

84
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:33,124
"Sydney Andrews."

85
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:34,191
Wow. I gotta be honest.

86
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:36,327
I wasn't a big fan
of her as a person,

87
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:38,195
but I'm kinda loving her art.

88
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,332
Yes, Mr. Lao, I can have
the painting for you

89
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,067
as soon as today.

90
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:47,371
I'll call you the minute
I have it in my hands.

91
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:49,807
Tell me something.

92
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,275
When you tracked Auggie down,

93
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:54,512
how did you get him to tell you
where he left the painting?

94
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:57,014
Did you pay him or did
you sleep with him?

95
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:01,085
Who else is gonna tell
you all those things

96
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,553
you don't want to hear?

97
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:05,556
You're not real. Go away.

98
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,526
You can't get rid
of me that easily.

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,927
Just watch me.

100
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,429
Careful.

101
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:12,830
You're gonna want to be razor sharp

102
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:14,365
when you break into Dr.
Six-Pack's apartment

103
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,566
and search his closet.

104
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,901
Don't you worry, Sydney.

105
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:20,871
I'm not a perpetual scre
w-up like you.

106
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:22,973
I get what I want.

107
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,075
I wouldn't be so cocky.

108
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:38,889
How's the water?

109
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:40,357
Would've been a lot more fun

110
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:42,092
if I had someone to splash.

111
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:45,596
So, tonight's your big
opening I take it.

112
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,231
Coal's never gonna be the same.

113
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,533
When the dinner stops,
the dancing begins.

114
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:50,901
Doors open at 11:00.

115
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:52,436
You coming?

116
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:56,073
I actually wasn't sure
that you'd want me there.

117
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:59,143
Why? I want all my friends there.

118
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,579
Oh, um, right. I'm-I'm sorry.

119
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:05,749
I'm just not used to falling
into the "friends" column.

120
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:09,286
Lauren, what do you expect?

121
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,988
All those times you got paged

122
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,189
to go to the hospital,

123
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:13,757
I can't just forget what
you were really doing.

124
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:16,460
Look, if I had to go
back and do it again,

125
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:20,331
I'd drop out of med school;
do anything but what I did.

126
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,835
I screwed up.

127
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:38,148
I gotta go. I gotta go.

128
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:39,783
Yeah. I got a ton

129
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:41,852
of stuff to do for tonight.
Yeah, yeah.

130
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:44,255
I'll see you there?

131
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:46,090
I'll try.

132
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:48,759
All right.

133
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:12,449
Welcome back, Amanda.

134
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:14,518
We were all wondering
where you disappeared to.

135
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:17,021
Is that why you broke
into these offices

136
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:19,890
in the middle of the night?

137
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,792
Wow. I am flattered

138
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:23,794
that you of all people
think I'm that devious.

139
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:26,297
But really, me?

140
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,665
A cat burglar?

141
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,433
Please.

142
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,834
I found a couture
button by my computer

143
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:32,703
beside a strand of blond hair.

144
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:35,673
I could tell by the split
end it wasn't mine.

145
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:38,542
What do you think you are,
some kind of Prada ninja?

146
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:41,211
Do you really just expect me

147
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:42,846
to sit back and let
my boss frame me

148
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:44,148
for a crime that I didn't commit?

149
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,916
I mean, seriously.

150
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,751
All I've ever been
is fiercely loyal.

151
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,821
All I've ever done is worked
my ass off to make you happy.

152
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,856
I mean, why am I your
crash test dummy?

153
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:54,825
Because you have a
proven track recor

154
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:56,894
I mean, whof veering across
your crash tmoral lines.

155
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:59,363
The perfect profile for
a serial embezzler.

156
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:02,733
My God.

157
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,936
How did I ever look up to such
a desperate, washed-up bitch?

158
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,139
Get out of my building.

159
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,674
You're fired.

160
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:16,517
MELROSE PLACE SEASON FINLE -
English subtitle By:
ISUBS.COIL.US.TO AND ADDIC7ED.COM

161
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,555
Oh, hi.

162
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,657
Sorry, I thought your e
x-roommate might be here.

163
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,959
He's out getting boxes.

164
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,961
Oh. Okay.

165
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,497
Is everything okay?

166
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,466
Just peachy.

167
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,102
If you can forget the fact
that you can now add me

168
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:42,337
to the ranks of L.A.
's hot, young and unemployed.

169
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
Wow, Ella.

170
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,476
I know that job was like your life.

171
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:50,178
That didn't sound right.

172
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:51,346
No, no.

173
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,381
You're right.

174
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,883
It is.

175
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,752
Oh... it was.

176
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:58,787
You know that

177
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:00,689
saying "Everything
happens for a reason"?

178
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:03,391
I think I'll just run with that.

179
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,794
Well, I'm sorry.

180
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:07,963
Yeah.

181
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,737
Where did this come from?

182
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,005
Drew found it in his apartment.

183
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,940
Wow.

184
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:21,309
Sydney painted it. Mm-hmm.

185
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,145
Can I have this?

186
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,413
Actually, I kind of like it.

187
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:27,349
Well, it's just that...

188
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:28,650
now that Sydney's gone, I don't...

189
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,685
I don't really have
anything to remember her by.

190
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,654
Ella, you hated each other.

191
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,623
We werke sisters.

192
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:35,790
Okay?

193
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:37,859
Sisters fight, thatoesn't mean

194
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:40,262
they don't love each other.

195
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:43,999
Go ahead.

196
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,000
Take it.

197
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,468
It obviously means
a lot more to you.

198
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:49,738
Riley, thank you.

199
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:53,008
Then I guess you owe me one.

200
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,476
Yeah.

201
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,255
Hands off my mouse, Pragin.

202
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,291
There you go. Thank you.

203
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,259
So, uh, you going to
get off work early?

204
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:14,329
Ditch them scrubs,
bust a couple moves?

205
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:15,597
Excuse me?

206
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,098
David's club opening's tonight.

207
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:20,168
He flew in a bomb DJ from Miami.

208
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:22,671
Yeah, I'm sure it's going
to be vastly entertaining.

209
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:24,306
But I think David would
probably prefer it

210
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,942
if I steer clear.

211
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,443
I take it your
courtyard confessional

212
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:30,212
didn't go over so
well with him, huh?

213
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:31,580
Don't you have any knoc
k-knock jokes

214
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,348
to try out on your patients?

215
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:35,150
Lauren, seriously.

216
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:37,452
David's not going to give
up on a girl like you.

217
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:38,486
You're one of a kind.

218
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,721
All that stuff you did before

219
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:42,090
is just history
blowing in the wind.

220
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,658
All right?

221
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:46,661
I'd love to stand around and talk
about my love life with you all
day,

222
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:48,363
but I have to prep a surgery.

223
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:49,631
What'd you get, quadruple?

224
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,066
Tell me you didn't
get the quadruple.

225
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,334
Laparoscopic.

226
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:55,370
Yeah, I'm doing it with Dr.
Mancini, actually.

227
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:56,838
We're implanting an M-valve.

228
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:57,872
Whoa, wait.

229
00:09:57,907 --> 00:09:58,940
That can't happen.

230
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,375
You have to stop it.

231
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:03,144
Drew, look, you have
no concrete proof.

232
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,181
Okay? I can't just stop a
surgery based on a theory.

233
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:07,549
Tell that to Kevin
Hartson's family.

234
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,517
I mean, how many more
people have to die

235
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:11,052
before a theory becomes a fact?

236
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:14,856
Say the patient has a fever.

237
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,658
That'll postpone the procedure,
buy us time.

238
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:18,727
You want me to falsify
the pre-op report?

239
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,496
Lauren, a person's
life is at stake here.

240
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,567
If you had some real
evidence... maybe.

241
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:29,571
But I-I can't go along with this.

242
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,673
All right? I'm sorry, Drew.
I gotta go.

243
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,548
Okay, this is definitely yours.

244
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,484
Whoa. Gentle.

245
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,919
Remember when we lost his nose

246
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:46,921
for like... for like ever?

247
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:49,758
It was just agony to see
him suffering so much.

248
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,260
Here.

249
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:53,828
There they are. Ooh!

250
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,565
Oh, my God, I can't
believe you still have it.

251
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,767
Oh.

252
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,568
What were you, turning 19?

253
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,070
I think so, yeah.

254
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,271
"Dear Jonah, I've known you

255
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:05,040
"for barely a semester,
but I have a feeling

256
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:07,909
"this will only be the first
of many birthday cards to come.

257
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:09,878
"To my favorite Darth Vader,

258
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:11,913
"from your favorite sumo wrestler.

259
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,581
Love Riley. 2004"

260
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:15,083
You know it took
me five blank cards

261
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:16,551
to get those film
sprockets just right.

262
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:18,620
Hmm.

263
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:21,456
Uh...

264
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,391
I... I stored it in here

265
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:25,393
so it'd safe from all
the flying debris.

266
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:28,630
Me and Zac's dorm room was like a 2
4-7 disaster zone.

267
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:30,598
You know, speaking of dorms,

268
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,867
what time are you going
to the NYU mixer today?

269
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,502
I'm not sure. Why?
Do you want me to plan it

270
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:35,770
so we're both there
at different times?

271
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:37,605
Don't be ridiculous.

272
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,008
I mean, we're friends, right?

273
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,109
Yeah, we're friends.

274
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:42,377
Of course.

275
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,412
Great. Well, then doesn't
it seem a little silly

276
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:46,047
for us to take two separate cars?

277
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,550
More like environmentally
unconscious.

278
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,386
Should we carpool?

279
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,821
Rocket sled in like an hour?

280
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,622
Sounds like a plan.

281
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,764
i>-  9:00, Tim Mislowski.</i>

282
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:36,965
Wow! What happened to him?

283
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,501
In two years,
he turned into a manatee.

284
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:40,802
Will you stop?

285
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:43,138
None of us look like we
did when we graduated.

286
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:45,173
You're right.

287
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:47,309
Some of us look better.

288
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:51,079
Hey! Zac. Oh! Hey.

289
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:52,647
Of course the ShoWest screenwriter

290
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:54,149
of the year is here. Hi.

291
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,817
How are you? How you been, man?

292
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,319
Not as good as you, Orson Welles.

293
00:12:57,353 --> 00:12:59,020
<i>Mr. Writer and Director of Living
in Reverse.</i>

294
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:00,221
Sick.

295
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:01,556
Thank you.

296
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,390
You must be damn proud, Riles.

297
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,159
Uh, yeah. Definitely.

298
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:05,860
So what's going on with you?
How many billions of dollars

299
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:07,662
<i>has Kensington Squared
made already? Yeah.</i>

300
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:09,364
A hundred and three million,

301
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:10,665
seven hundred twenty-two thousand,

302
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,766
as of last Sunday.

303
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:12,701
Unbelievable. No way.

304
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:13,702
But who's counting.

305
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:16,404
Yotter not be bragging, Zackie.

306
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:17,772
Hi, Riley!

307
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:19,474
You look so amazing. Hi.

308
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:20,675
So do you. Hey, how are you?

309
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,210
You look great. Yeah, doesn't she?

310
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:23,645
Hey.

311
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,980
Wait, are you guys back together?

312
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,249
I know, after our
World War III breakup,

313
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:30,251
a peace treaty seemed unthinkable.

314
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,519
But it happened.

315
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:32,387
Oh.

316
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:33,355
And believe it or not,

317
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:34,322
you guys were my inspiration.

318
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:35,457
Us? Yeah.

319
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:36,725
Seeing you guys at the premiere.

320
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,259
How happy you were together,

321
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:39,894
how-how you've stuck
with each other

322
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,096
for, like, a lifetime.

323
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,031
Made me realize how crazy I was

324
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,333
not to try to make it work
with this awesome girl.

325
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:46,568
Oh. Well, I guess,

326
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:48,970
that means I owe you two
one hell of a wedding gift.

327
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:50,372
When's the big day?

328
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:52,741
Um... actually...

329
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:55,176
Well... um...

330
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,480
We kind of broke up.

331
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,082
What?

332
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:02,417
That's impossible.

333
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:03,752
You guys never even fought.

334
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:06,888
Yeah, well,
it was mostly my fault...

335
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:08,356
Well, no.

336
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,657
No fault. Um...

337
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:12,327
times change,
people change, you know.

338
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:13,895
The important thing is that
we're really happy right now.

339
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,330
So... Yeah.

340
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:22,904
Dr. Mancini, can I talk
to you for a second?

341
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:24,606
No, I'm already late for surgery.

342
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,674
Uh, I-I know this is
coming out of left field,

343
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:28,009
but there's something
you need to know.

344
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:30,612
There's-there's a problem
with the M-valve.

345
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:32,313
What problem? I created that valve.

346
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,349
It has the lowest failure
rate of any cardiac appliance.

347
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,817
That's what I thought, too.

348
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:38,019
I didn't want to say anything
to you until I knew for sure,

349
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:40,221
but it-it appears to
be leaching chemicals

350
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,023
into the bloodstream.

351
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:43,558
It's causing platelet malfunction,

352
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,859
and massive strokes.

353
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:47,896
Those are some pretty
serious accusations.

354
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,132
Dr. Mancini, the antimicrobial
material was a breakthrough,

355
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,101
but it was also toxic.

356
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:54,903
16 people have already died,

357
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,406
all M-valve recipients,
all stroke victims.

358
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,408
I have a toxicology report
from a stroke victim,

359
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,911
an M-valve recipient
who died last week.

360
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,380
His platelet count
was under 25,000.

361
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:07,449
There are any number
of causes for that.

362
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,484
Dr. Mancini, 16 people
have already died.

363
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,586
Do you really want
to take that chance?

364
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,558
Of course not.

365
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:18,026
I'm going to cancel the surgery.

366
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,994
But I want to see your research.

367
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,529
Right away.

368
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:23,598
Absolutely.

369
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,667
Thank you, Dr. Mancini

370
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:29,537
Hey, David.bsolutely.

371
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:31,206
Table 12 is asking
to meet the owner.

372
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,374
I told them you're busy,
but they insisted.

373
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:37,278
All right, don't
worry about it. Okay.

374
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:41,549
There you are.

375
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:42,951
Guess what?

376
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,286
I told my dad-- everything.

377
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,058
Have a seat, son.

378
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:55,663
Finally, my daughter's
dating an adult.

379
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:57,599
Not some bad boy

380
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:00,068
with half his body
covered in tattoos.

381
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:02,136
I told you he was mature, Daddy.

382
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,639
Clearly not afraid
of hard work either.

383
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,074
I know how grueling owning
a restaurant can be.

384
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:07,375
Oh.

385
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:08,943
It's Cindy.

386
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,478
She just got a maltipoo.

387
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:11,779
I'll be right back.

388
00:16:11,814 --> 00:16:13,815
Oh, my God,
what are you naming her?

389
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,850
Well, I should get back to work.

390
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:19,687
David, I just want you to know,
nothing makes me happier

391
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,990
than seeing my little princess
with a smile on her face.

392
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,258
Ah, makes sense.

393
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,360
And you know what?

394
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:28,196
Nothing pisses me off more
than seeing her upset.

395
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,266
Now, I ever hear that
you hurt my baby girl...

396
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,769
swear to God, you're going
to wish you never mer.

397
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:40,341
Good steak.

398
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:03,064
Now who's the Prada ninja?

399
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,466
Do I look like a cat burglar

400
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:08,036
Well, you certainly don't
look like the cable guy.

401
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,438
Not that I have to explain myself,

402
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:11,873
but Jane gave me the master key,

403
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,408
to check on all the pilot lights.

404
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:14,609
Huh.

405
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:16,444
I see.

406
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:18,246
So you have no interest

407
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,082
in the little wall decoration
that used to be in here?

408
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,352
What kind of wall decoration
are you talking about?

409
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:26,187
in theOh, I don't know-
-ation thatjust some old painting,

410
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,789
of a Dutch guy in a goofy hat.

411
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:30,191
It's probably not worth that much.

412
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:31,859
I was thinking I was gonna
sell it on craigslist.

413
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,331
What do you want, Ella?

414
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,269
Hmm.

415
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:47,846
Oh, no.

416
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,948
First, you can start
by clearing my name

417
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,716
in that silly embezzlement mess.

418
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,286
Consider it done.

419
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,156
Then... I can art my
own publicity shingle,

420
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,191
free and clear.

421
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:03,194
Ella Simms and Associates.

422
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,064
What do you think?

423
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:08,066
Sounds promising.

424
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,167
Good luck with that.

425
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:11,202
nna need a little
bit more than luck.

426
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:12,404
I'll need financing--

427
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:14,139
and that's where you come in.

428
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,641
How much do you need?

429
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:19,244
Well, it'll have to
be in Beverly Hills,

430
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:23,448
so, probably a number with
lots and lots of zeroes.

431
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:27,919
Oh, and I'll be taking my most buz
z-worthy clients with me.

432
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:29,688
Fine.

433
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,489
Give me the painting, Ella.

434
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,525
The painting's all yours...

435
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,694
after the paperwork is done.

436
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,567
Remember that?

437
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:43,902
Oh, my God. Yeah.

438
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,637
We were studying for our Che
m-one midterm.

439
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,173
Both came down with that deadly
mushroom pepperoni craving.

440
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,374
Mm-hmm. Whew!

441
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:51,443
Practically flew to Grimaldi's.

442
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:53,311
Didn't you bribe your way
to the front of the line?

443
00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:55,447
Best five buck.

444
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,915
If I remember correctly,

445
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:59,050
we had that pizza for
breakfast as well.

446
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:02,020
Tasted even better in the morning.

447
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:03,321
Oh! There they are.

448
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:05,357
Nice. Milla the Killa
and Zac Attack.

449
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,992
Undefeated beer pong champions,

450
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,361
gods among men.

451
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,829
Dudeey should erect a statue

452
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:12,964
of us in that rec room.

453
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:14,966
You know, you ever wish

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,801
you could turn back the clock,
just go back to freshman year?

455
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:17,902
All the time.

456
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:21,539
Life was so much less complicated.

457
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:23,808
I mean, besides grades,
what was my biggesrry?

458
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:24,943
FigurinG out how to get my roommate

459
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,144
to sleep at her boyfriend's

460
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:28,113
so Jonah and I could have
a night to ourselves.

461
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:29,781
Ooh.

462
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,015
Excuse me. Oh.

463
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,784
Robbie! Zac, what's up, man?

464
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:33,985
What are you doing, dude?

465
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,987
You know, if I did have
a chance to go back,

466
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:39,224
I'd probably do a couple
things differently.

467
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,993
Really? Like what?

468
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:45,463
I would've appreciated what I had,

469
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:47,098
and not been in Really?
Like what?  such a rush

470
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,300
to move things forward.

471
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,936
Riley!

472
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:54,038
Come see Tracy's baby bump.
It's adorable.

473
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,106
Oh, okay.

474
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,414
What?

475
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,082
No shirtless heartthrobs
taped inside?

476
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:05,283
I'm shocked.

477
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:07,185
Why are you in such a good mood,
Pragin, hmm?

478
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:08,520
WHy shouldn't I be?

479
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,088
Confronted Dr. Mancini.

480
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:12,023
And he is postponing all
M-valve procedures

481
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,825
till more tests are done. What?

482
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:16,428
He didn't put up a fight?

483
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:17,462
What can he say?

484
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:18,696
I gave him my data. He gets it.

485
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,031
It's all good.

486
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,065
Drew Pragin?

487
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,567
That's me.

488
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,669
Can you open your locker please?

489
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:27,005
Any particular reason?

490
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,840
Just open it.

491
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:33,411
So you want to see if I'm
a boxers or a briefs man?

492
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:34,612
All right.

493
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,281
But I'm just letting you know,

494
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:39,250
there are some socks in
there that are pretty ripe.

495
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:43,154
: I don't know.

496
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:48,693
Oxycodone?

497
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,763
Those are not mine.

498
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:53,064
I've never seen 'em
before in my life.

499
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:54,365
Dr. Pragin, you'll
have to come with us.

500
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,067
Hey, look, look,
if he says it's not his,

501
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:57,268
it's not his. I'm sorry, ma'am,

502
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:58,736
he has to come with us.
Get your hands off me!

503
00:20:58,771 --> 00:20:59,537
All right?

504
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:00,505
Mancini did this.

505
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:01,773
You see what type of person he is?

506
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:02,874
Let's go!

507
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:05,009
You have to stop the surgery!

508
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,051
Now, we have a full list.

509
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,086
Make sure that we don't
exceed capacity. Uh-huh.

510
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,788
Because... You're not
gonna keep me waiting

511
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,857
outside the velvet rope, are you?

512
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:20,291
Okay, just make sure.

513
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:22,360
Hey, I'm so glad that you came.
Are you kidding me?

514
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:24,629
It's only the opening
of my boyfriend's club.

515
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,764
I wouldn't miss it
for anything. Okay.

516
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,766
Shot, please. Mm-hmm.

517
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:30,802
Sit.

518
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,271
Morgan.

519
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,607
Look, the reason that
I brought you here...

520
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,642
My dad totally loved you.

521
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:38,877
And he hates everyone.

522
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:40,445
Especially my boyfriends.

523
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,380
Look, Morgan, I don't
want to hurur feelings.

524
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:43,615
Okay?

525
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,049
I-I like you. I do.

526
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:48,019
But this whole talk about
me being your boyfriend,

527
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:49,187
it can't be like that.

528
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,991
This is about that
other girl, isn't it?

529
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:55,126
The doctor

530
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,761
who's always on call.

531
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,230
I heard of her big
confession at that party.

532
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:01,299
This has nothing to do with her.

533
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,202
I can't believe I'm going hea
d-to-head with a whore.

534
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:05,169
Don't you call her that.

535
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:07,572
She only Did that to
get through school.

536
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:09,874
Just like you only
robbed my dad's house

537
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:11,142
to buy this restaurant?

538
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:14,112
Look, give me time.

539
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:17,382
I don't mind a little competition.

540
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:25,156
?T× Papa, I can see... ?T×

541
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,492
Biggest shocker of
the night, though?

542
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:30,161
Danny Pinkerton announcing his
gender reassignment surgery.

543
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,429
Not really.

544
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,331
You remember my high
heels kept disappearing,

545
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,833
and you found them
in his dorm room?

546
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,468
Oh, yeah.

547
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:39,170
Mm-hmm.

548
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:40,972
You know, some people would say

549
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:44,175
the biggest surprise of
the day was our breakup.

550
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,345
It's really weird

551
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:51,816
that our relationship became
this big cautionary tale.

552
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,485
Mm-hmm.

553
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:59,357
Anyway, I think this bad
boy's the last of 'em.

554
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:00,525
Are you sure?

555
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,060
Did you check under the bed?

556
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:04,262
I'm pretty sure I
saw your nunchakus.

557
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:05,430
I think I got everything.

558
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,699
I just cannot find my
lucky penny still, so...

559
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,134
Well, if I find it,
I'll drop it by.

560
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,369
Okay.

561
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:13,104
Um, I guess that's...

562
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:17,875
Yeah.

563
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,946
I'll, uh, see you
around the courtyard.

564
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:23,114
Guess so.

565
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:24,282
Okay.

566
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:25,950
Okay.

567
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:50,926
Wow.

568
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,162
Oh, my God, what are we doing?

569
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:56,598
I'm not sure, but...

570
00:23:56,632 --> 00:24:00,435
it just... it feels right.

571
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,373
Riley, let's go back.

572
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:07,876
You said it yourself the
day after we broke up.

573
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,010
What if we just go back

574
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:10,412
to that time before
we were engaged,

575
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:12,914
that time when we just...
we laughed a lot?

576
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,917
What about Ella?

577
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:19,521
She's made me realize so
much about myself, but...

578
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:23,058
I know she's not the person
that I'm meant to be with.

579
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:26,227
I tried to force things
to be a certain way,

580
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:29,531
and it's just... relationships
aren't like screenplays.

581
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,066
You know, you can't
just give 'em a title

582
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,501
and then make up the plot.

583
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,670
Look, I...

584
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,205
I want to forget about the past.

585
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,840
I want to forget about the future.

586
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:40,742
I just... wAnt...

587
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:43,678
to live in the moment...

588
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:46,247
with you.

589
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:53,421
Jonah,

590
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:55,790
things are different now.

591
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:57,792
I know things are different.

592
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:00,228
But, like, things were
different with Zac and Tess,

593
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:01,830
and look what happened to them.

594
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:03,598
You know, they realized

595
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:09,270
how amazing what they had was,
and they just...

596
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:11,306
they didn't want
to throw that away.

597
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,143
<i>What we had was special.</i>

598
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:16,578
It really was...

599
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:19,280
I'll never forget it.

600
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:23,084
But what I want now

601
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,788
it's different than
what I wanted then.

602
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,734
Got it.

603
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:43,605
I'm sorry.

604
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,904
Ready, Doctor. Thank you, Nurse.

605
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:17,705
You can place that there.

606
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:22,544
Do you want this draped?

607
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:23,878
How's our CO2 levels?

608
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:26,081
Ah, looking good.

609
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:28,016
Everything's stable.

610
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,319
Check the echo,
see if we got a good picture.

611
00:26:31,353 --> 00:26:32,554
We got a good picture.

612
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:42,430
Have those sutures
standing by, okay?

613
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:45,100
I've got them right here.

614
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,334
You want the disposable also?

615
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,103
Dr. Mancini?

616
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:50,638
This patient had a temperature
this morning-- 102.

617
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:51,973
I just Checked his temperature.

618
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:53,208
98.7.

619
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:55,677
Scalpel.

620
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:59,481
Retractor. Right here.

621
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:04,819
Stop. What? Huh?

622
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:06,087
I don't know what's going on.

623
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:08,456
You've just contaminated
the operating room, Yung.

624
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:10,024
Get this patient into OR 7.

625
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:12,393
I know about the M-valve.
It's not safe.

626
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:13,695
What does she mean, not safe?

627
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:15,463
Pressure's getting to you, Yung.

628
00:27:15,498 --> 00:27:17,165
You've lost your mind.

629
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:20,835
There's reason to believe
this valve leaches chemicals

630
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,037
that cause platelet malfunction
and massive strokes.

631
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:24,739
She's upset I'm taking
her off my team.

632
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:27,375
That's not true.

633
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,577
I'm trying to save this man's life.

634
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,686
?T× Let's go! Went to the
club to do some dancing... ?T×

635
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,021
You came.

636
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:41,289
How could I not?

637
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:42,624
Andy. Yeah?

638
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:43,558
This girl pays for nothing.

639
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:44,993
You got it. Uh, no, no.

640
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:48,630
Andy, this girl pays for
everything, because tonight,

641
00:27:48,664 --> 00:27:50,698
I am feeling particularly flush.

642
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,634
Why?

643
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:54,202
Something straighten out at work?

644
00:27:54,236 --> 00:27:55,436
Couldn't be straighter.

645
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:56,704
Hmm.

646
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:57,872
Cheers. Cheers.

647
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:58,940
?T× All the way down ?T×

648
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:00,375
?T× I like, I like, I like ?T×

649
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:02,310
?T× I like it like that... ?T×

650
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:03,278
Hey!

651
00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:04,512
Congratulations. Hey.

652
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:05,647
This place is raging, man.

653
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:07,182
We're all so proud of you, David.

654
00:28:07,216 --> 00:28:08,950
Thanks. Aw. That's so sweet.

655
00:28:08,984 --> 00:28:10,785
Hmm.

656
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:11,519
Hi.

657
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:12,720
Hey.

658
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:13,988
So, who's the stud who
owns this place, huh?

659
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:15,256
Congrats, man. Thanks.

660
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,292
This is wild.

661
00:28:17,326 --> 00:28:19,194
Hi. Hey.

662
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:23,798
So, how was your big alumni bash?

663
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:25,567
Did you and Riley make nice

664
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:27,402
in front of alyour college clas?

665
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:28,570
Oh...

666
00:28:28,604 --> 00:28:30,471
Ah, let's... I can't hear a thing.

667
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:31,606
Let's go over here.

668
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,741
Oh. Okay.

669
00:28:35,744 --> 00:28:38,246
I just... I got to
tell you something.

670
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,014
Oh. Okay.

671
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:43,184
I can't pretend like
this didn't happened.

672
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:45,687
Um...

673
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:48,723
today, after the party,

674
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:51,960
Riley and I came home, and...

675
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:54,128
and I kissed her.

676
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:57,732
What?

677
00:28:57,766 --> 00:28:59,100
I'm sorry.

678
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:00,568
I didn't plan it.

679
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:02,170
I didn't...

680
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:03,805
I wasn't thinking about it.

681
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,407
It just... it just kind
of came out of nowhere.

682
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:08,977
Yeah.

683
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:10,645
Like a tsunami.

684
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,180
So, what?

685
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:15,617
You and Riley are moving back in
the same day you're moving out?

686
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:16,751
No.

687
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:18,786
We're not...

688
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:21,956
Riley and I-- we're never
getting back together.

689
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:23,791
It just...

690
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,126
This put a lot of

691
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,161
things into perspective.

692
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:29,197
Yeah, it sure does.

693
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:31,132
Jonah, I told you up front

694
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,301
that I wasn't going
to be your rebound.

695
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:34,836
You weren't.

696
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,504
You're not.

697
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:38,773
Ella,

698
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:40,508
I really care about you a lot.

699
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:42,543
Okay, no, Jonah,
just-just stop, okay?

700
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:46,214
You come off as this-this sweet,
sensitive, honest guy,

701
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:49,150
the type of guy that woulD
never break a girl's heart

702
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,385
in a million years.

703
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:51,486
Ella,

704
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,156
look, I never,
ever meant to hurt you.

705
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,292
I swear.

706
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:03,298
Oh, you know what?

707
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,934
Thank you.

708
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:09,637
Seriously.

709
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:12,240
Because of you, I've realized

710
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:15,677
that maybe monogamy
isn't the end of life

711
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:17,111
as we know it.

712
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:18,746
Maybe I... maybe I can

713
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:20,948
be in a real relationship.

714
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:23,084
Just not with you.

715
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:30,124
Ella.

716
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,661
?T× I like it like that... ?T×

717
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,010
Thank you, Mr. Lao.

718
00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:54,182
Like a dog

719
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:55,249
looking for a bone,

720
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,185
you don't quit till
you get what you want.

721
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:58,486
I am so impressed.

722
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,521
Oh. I bet.

723
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:02,457
You never had much perseverance,

724
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:05,426
except, of course,
in the case of the opposite sex.

725
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:08,296
You know, all that money--

726
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,265
it's not going to bring
you a shred of happiness,

727
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:13,968
especially if you have
no one to share it with

728
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,038
it's notYeah, well,
ring you I'm not big on sharing.

729
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:19,774
I'm perfectly happy on my own.

730
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,576
I told myself the same thing.

731
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,245
Look where I ended up.

732
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:42,497
I just heard from
the hospital. What?

733
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:43,631
You won't fake a fever,

734
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:45,166
but you pull the ultimate
eleventh hour save.

735
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,901
Yeah, well... I didn't
know you had it in you.

736
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:49,103
Oh, yeah. Neither did I.

737
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:50,438
Put me down.

738
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:52,774
I hate to say it, but I trust you.

739
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,976
So I'm not a total idiot after al

740
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,344
Now, let's notit, get carried away.

741
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:57,612
Hmm. Hmm.

742
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:00,114
Hey, I didn't know that
you were going to come.

743
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:05,052
Wouldn't miss it.

744
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:06,487
Well, look at you.

745
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:07,822
Come a long way

746
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:09,957
since breaking and entering
was your bread and butter.

747
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:11,459
Huh? Mm-hmm.

748
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:13,928
David!

749
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,597
Where have you been?

750
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:17,865
I've been looking for you.

751
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,534
Hi.

752
00:32:19,568 --> 00:32:20,468
I'm Morgan.

753
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:21,702
David's girlfriend.

754
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:23,304
Ex-Excuse me? What? You're...?

755
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:26,007
Lauren, that's not
really how it is.

756
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,075
That's not what you said
when we were making love.

757
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,911
That's enough!

758
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:33,948
Lauren, wait.

759
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:34,682
Lauren!

760
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:37,585
Lauren, wait.

761
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:39,220
Shouldn't have expected you to
put your dating life on hold.

762
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:40,321
Okay, I'm not dating anyone,

763
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:41,989
and that girl is not my girlfriend.

764
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:43,424
All right, it's a long story.

765
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:44,659
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure it is, David,

766
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:47,161
but, look, you don't need
to lie to me, all right?

767
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:48,563
I-I get it. You've moved on.

768
00:32:48,597 --> 00:32:50,364
I'm not lying to you.

769
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,266
I've known that girl
maybe three weeks.

770
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:53,468
That's it.

771
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:55,136
And she's been
practically stalking me

772
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,471
since I first met her.

773
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:57,572
It... Wh...?

774
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:58,773
Stalking you?

775
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,608
Since I broke into
her parents' mansion.

776
00:33:00,642 --> 00:33:04,378
Look, it was my swan song.

777
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:07,648
A one-time deal so I would never,
ever have to do it again.

778
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:09,317
And I only slept with that girl

779
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:11,152
because she threatened
to tell her dad.

780
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:12,987
It was a mistake.

781
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:16,724
A mistake.

782
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:19,260
Right.

783
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,466
I'm no better than you are, Lor.

784
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,836
I'm a hypocrite.

785
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:31,305
Here I am holding you
to some high standard,

786
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,875
and I'm worse.

787
00:33:35,777 --> 00:33:38,679
Sounds like we're
both far from perfect.

788
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:44,285
Maybe we're perfect for each other.

789
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:53,594
I love you, Lauren.

790
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,052
Mr. Miller?

791
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,855
Huh? Yeah. That's me.

792
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,156
Pleasure to meet you.

793
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,290
I'm Ari, the PA. Okay.

794
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:21,892
We're right here on stage four.

795
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,427
Screen test's running
right on time.

796
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,195
I got you a coffee, fresh fruit.

797
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,264
If you need anything,
you come to me.

798
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,966
All right, Mr. Miller.

799
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,102
Look, all I need from you
is for you to call me Jonah.

800
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,271
All right? Right. Jonah.

801
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,274
Oh, my God.

802
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,978
Owen's in hair and makeup, and

803
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,313
Mira aka Rachel's right over there.

804
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,681
Oh. Hey.

805
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,803
Good morning.

806
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,905
Yeah, it sure is.

807
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,742
I got to go down to Coal.

808
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,444
But tonight,

809
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,813
what do you say I take
you somewhere specia

810
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,582
and celebrate... us?

811
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,083
I'd love that.

812
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,485
You pick.

813
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,886
Anywhere you want.

814
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,022
Surprise me.

815
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,198
So, I take it Jonah owns
most of the mugs, huh?

816
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,299
It's fine.

817
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,301
I have drank Coffee
out of glass before.

818
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,136
It's not a big deal.

819
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,139
Did I make it too sweet?

820
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,974
Felt like I made it too sweet.

821
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,743
Um, no. Look, Drew,

822
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,613
I need to be honest with you.

823
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,848
Uh-oh.

824
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,649
No good news ever starts this way.

825
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:56,320
Yesterday, at the alumni mixer,

826
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:00,057
Jonah and I kind of got caught
up in the nostalgia, and,

827
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,559
well...

828
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,595
we kissed.

829
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,230
He kissed you?

830
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,699
We kind of kissed each other.

831
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:12,236
But it didn't go anywhere,
and it's not going anywhere.

832
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,538
If anything, that kiss
made me realize now

833
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,007
more than ever that I'm
ready to move on...

834
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,176
with you

835
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,413
more than ever that
I'm o move on...

836
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,082
Now that, uh,

837
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,484
we're being brutally
honest with each other,

838
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,520
I want to give you a chance

839
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,855
to get out of this before
it gets any more serious.

840
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,892
No. Drew, I don't want
to get out of anything.

841
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,094
Me and Jonah-- it's over.

842
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,231
I'm just not a person
to get attached to.

843
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,600
Why would you say that?

844
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,836
Drew, what's going on?

845
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,374
I don't like telling people this,

846
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,843
because I hate being
treated like I'm sick.

847
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,444
And I've been fine

848
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,647
becauthanks to a surgeryated
I had five years ago.

849
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,049
Surgery?

850
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,185
I was born with a
congenital heart defect.

851
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,389
They did laparoscopic surgery.

852
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,125
The great news is, no scarring.

853
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,127
The not so great news is...

854
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,429
they gave me a new valve.

855
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,034
Mancini's valve.

856
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,237
What are you saying?

857
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,910
I don't know how
long I have to live.

858
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,126
Good morning.

859
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,332
Look, I don't know

860
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,068
what your daughter told you,
but I'm not her boyfriend.

861
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,269
You're right.

862
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,471
'Cause I don't let my
daughter date thieves.

863
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,274
But she told me she saw
you stealing the ring,

864
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:00,077
and that you seduced her
into keeping her mouth shut.

865
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,079
Okay, that's not what happened. No?

866
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,416
Do you know who I am?

867
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,051
Huh?

868
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,053
I'm somebody you don't
want to steal from.

869
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,255
All right, sir, I'm sorry.

870
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,757
I'll pay you back.

871
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,459
All right, it'll take me some time,

872
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,327
but I can pay you back.

873
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:19,830
I got a better idea.

874
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,432
You got past my security system,

875
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:26,803
which takes a certain degree of
skill and some serious balls,

876
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:30,741
so, from now on, kid,
you're gonna be working for me.

877
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,309
No. I'm through with that life.

878
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,579
I'll pay you back,
but I'm not a criminal anymore.

879
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,748
Really?

880
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,518
Well, you might want to
rethink that, because...

881
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,488
I'd hate to see anything
happen to such a pretty doctor.

882
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:47,624
You stay the hell away from her.

883
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,826
You're not going to touch her.

884
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,562
Your first job's tonight.

885
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,232
I'm gonna call you
with the details.

886
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,394
Amanda, hello.

887
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,763
I just came by to
pick up the check.

888
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:29,166
Oh, for that silly
company of yours?

889
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,634
I changed my mind.

890
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:34,504
Did you forget a little
thing called a contract

891
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,506
that we signed yesterday?

892
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,342
Well, I'm afraid you never
read the fine print.

893
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,645
It's null and void
at my discretion.

894
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,846
Oh, don't worry.

895
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,048
I'm sure another firm
will gobble you up...

896
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,284
if they're in the
market for embezzlers.

897
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,262
Actually, I did
read the fine print.

898
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,235
You know, it was so
hard to understand

899
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,304
that I thought maybe
a few photos of you

900
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,874
and your new art collector
friend might help me out.

901
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,008
I'll download them

902
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,276
for you right now.

903
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,911
They're on my server, which, well,

904
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,246
normally would be a problem,

905
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,616
but this is, like,
the fastest 3G you can get. Oh.

906
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,153
And look, there you are,
caught red-handed.

907
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,722
You know, you should have paid
that PI what you promised him.

908
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,091
He was more than happy
to do me a favor.

909
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:33,396
Even you wouldn't do
something this stupid.

910
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,699
I already did.

911
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:40,403
P and K are putting me in
charge of the L.A. offices

912
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,006
until they get back
here from New York.

913
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,941
Well, you can tell my partners

914
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,777
that I am the majority shareholder.

915
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,345
Oh, you can tell them yourself

916
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,080
when they're visiting you in jail.

917
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,550
FBI.

918
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,118
Amanda Woodward

919
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,655
you're under arrest
for the possession,

920
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,423
transportation and
sale of stolen art.

921
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,095
Oh.

922
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,965
You say

923
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,302
you modeled your career after me,
studied my every move.

924
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,174
Then you know this war
is just the beginning.

925
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,009
Let's go, ma'am.

926
