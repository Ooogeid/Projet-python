1
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,217
You going to come downtown

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,083
and help teach the Pledge of
Allegiance to my first graders?

3
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:16,784
Will you marry me?

4
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,251
She needs a better publicist.

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,418
She needs me.

6
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:22,184
Jonah, you are a hugely talented filmmaker.

7
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:24,017
Ella has a thing for you. You
think she's pushing your career

8
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:26,017
out of the goodness of her heart?

9
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,451
You think Ella's the one trying to come between us

10
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:30,251
when you and Auggie are like...
Friends?

11
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:32,067
All my life, all I wanted was to be a doctor.

12
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,384
Now the university is telling me

13
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,518
that I have to pay in full by the end of the semester

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,683
or they're going to kick me out.

15
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:39,017
I went on this fancy dinner with this guy.

16
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:41,384
He offered me $5,000 to have sex with him.

17
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:43,384
You know, there's a, uh,

18
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,583
a hostess that just quit at Coal.

19
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:46,550
I could put in a good word for you.

20
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,583
Hey.

21
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:48,850
Wow.

22
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:51,151
That's where I lived till I was 13.

23
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,117
My mom was dying,

24
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:53,750
she called the dad I never met,

25
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:55,051
told him he had to step up.

26
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:57,017
Look at you... Patek watch, the Prada.

27
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:58,550
You're getting your money somewhere.

28
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,284
If you were happy, you wouldn't have called me.

29
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:02,418
You definitely wouldn't have been sleeping with me.

30
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:04,151
You're my mom.

31
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:05,384
Violet, I never had a baby.

32
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,317
* Yo, yo

33
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:16,451
* Say when you're ready, girl

34
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:18,784
* When time you want it, come get it *

35
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,251
* Let-let me set it, girl

36
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:21,950
* Take care of you like a medic *

37
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:23,884
* Cah, when you press it up

38
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,418
* Press it up

39
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,084
* See the way you wiggle it, girl *

40
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:30,251
* You make me stress it out so that I cannot *

41
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:32,117
Mother...!

42
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,284
* Say the way you moving it, girl *

43
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:36,451
Morning.

44
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:37,617
You want coffee?

45
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,384
I want sleep and another set of opposable thumbs.

46
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:41,317
* Move that body 'cause you do this every day *

47
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,984
See you tonight.

48
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:45,151
* We do this every day * Every day *

49
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,583
* Let me see you get crazy, don't worry about nothing *

50
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:49,151
* Just keep it strong 'cause you don't play *

51
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:51,750
* My girl, 'cause we don't play *

52
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:53,617
* Say when the rhythm and bounce, girl *

53
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,084
* You keep perfect time

54
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:56,317
* And you are much on my mind

55
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,351
* When you whine, when you whine *

56
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,884
* Girl, your body keep looking so fine *

57
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,950
* And you don't stop running through my mind *

58
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,784
* Said I want to press it upon yours *

59
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:05,484
* So you can press it upon mine *

60
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:06,917
* Girl, when you press it up

61
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,550
* See the way you wiggle it, girl *

62
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,583
* You make me stress it out

63
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:12,850
* So that I cannot wait to caress it *

64
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:14,151
* When-when you press it up

65
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:15,583
* Say the way you moving it, girl *

66
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:16,917
* I cannot get enough

67
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,717
* When you feel me push it

68
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,117
* Press it up...

69
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:24,017
* ... Riley Richmond is in my hands *

70
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,750
* I got Riley Richmond

71
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:28,351
Hey! Pavarotti.

72
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:30,817
You might want to get your tuners checked.

73
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,217
* I got Riley Richmond

74
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:35,817
* In my hand

75
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,717
* Oh, I got Riley Richmond... *

76
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,583
Oh! Oh! It's cold! Riley!

77
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:42,750
Oh! Riley, turn it off! Ha, ha.

78
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:43,817
Riley!

79
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,917
* In the zone and give you the most love *

80
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,184
* Give you the most love, most love *

81
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:51,418
* Listen me, girl, if you hear what me say *

82
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:54,750
* You feel wine pon the head like you deh in my bed *

83
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:56,251
* Then, girl, if you accept the leg *

84
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:57,418
* And no bother worry, no fret

85
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:00,084
* I'm gonna give you this thing, girl *

86
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:01,784
* That you will never regret

87
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,084
* Cah, when you press it up

88
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,217
* See the way you wiggle it, girl... *

89
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:12,117
What are you doing here?

90
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,518
You know the rules!

91
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,884
You call before you stop by.

92
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:18,717
I was just dropping off Noah's birthday present.

93
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,418
That's assuming he still likes cars.

94
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,384
But what would I know? It's
not like you let me talk to him.

95
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:25,151
I promise I'll give him your number

96
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,617
if he ever wants a deal on oxy.

97
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,317
Enough, Michael. Hancock Park isn't interested.

98
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,117
But aren't you?

99
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,984
My dad turned his back on everybody in his life.

100
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:34,384
Who's to say you're not next?

101
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:36,950
Go.

102
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,650
Hey.

103
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:41,351
Vanessa is the best thing that ever happened to me.

104
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,817
Oh, I'm sure that life's just
roses now that Syd's gone, huh?

105
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:47,984
Is that why you killed her, tidy things up?

106
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:48,884
The police cleared me.

107
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,284
But I guess if you don't have a real job,

108
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,884
you have plenty of time

109
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,884
to sit around dreaming up ludicrous theories.

110
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,317
The night that Sydney died, she told me

111
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:56,717
she was going to go to the medical board

112
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,950
and tell them that you faked her death 12 years ago.

113
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,217
I know you were naive enough

114
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,817
to believe that Syd had real feelings for you.

115
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,317
But you're not that gullible.

116
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:09,251
Syd's story adds up. She was going to out you.

117
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:11,518
You had all the motive in the world to want her dead.

118
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,884
No one on the board would buy the fiction

119
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,418
that Syd rattled off in her pill-popping delirium.

120
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,550
Neither should you.

121
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:26,917
Oh, my God, Syd. Who did this to you?

122
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,683
Someone from my past.

123
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,017
Blood pressure falling.

124
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:31,351
They said they'd kill my husband.

125
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,984
Give me four pints of type O negative.

126
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:35,184
Let me die.

127
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:37,017
He'll be safe.

128
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,451
You could lose your license.

129
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:56,917
You're worth it.

130
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:01,384
What's wrong, Dad? Hmm?

131
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:02,683
Scared your perfect plan had a few loopholes?

132
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:04,850
Syd did her time for faking her death,

133
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:07,117
and I was not a part of it.

134
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,583
Yeah, I don't buy it.

135
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:11,217
And I'm going to do whatever it takes

136
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,717
to prove that you killed her.

137
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,850
Have a nice day.

138
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:21,650
<font color="#ffff00">Captioning sponsored by</font>
<font color="#ffff00">PARAMOUNT TELEVISION</font>

139
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,784
What are you doing here?

140
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:32,017
This is where they put my desk. Your turn.

141
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:35,151
Our client, Kavi DeKnight, he walked off the set

142
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,217
of Boomkat's new music video this morning.

143
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,917
Yeah. I am already on it.

144
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,217
Uh, if you were on it,

145
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:42,418
then TMZ wouldn't have caught Kavi sprinting past MOCA

146
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:44,084
screaming like a madman.

147
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:45,850
What did Kavi expect? Taryn's a live grenade.

148
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:47,750
She thinks everyone's stalking her.

149
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:49,051
Meanwhile,

150
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,184
Kavi's credibility as a director

151
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,917
is quickly becoming a PR Hindenburg.

152
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,418
Caleb, relax.

153
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,451
This thing spins like a top.

154
00:05:57,484 --> 00:05:59,984
Kavi had a bad burrito and went home.

155
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:01,117
Done.

156
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,351
Let craft service take the hit.

157
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:04,617
No. No. It's too late.

158
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,484
The label doesn't find another director

159
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:07,683
for the Boomkat video,

160
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,518
then the L.A. Times runs a story

161
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,550
that says Kavi is a visionary without balls.

162
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,051
WPK cannot lose him as a client.

163
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:20,817
Get me Joel Devins from Columbia Records.

164
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,284
Why are you calling the cute A&R guy?

165
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:27,217
Because I got his boy band on
the cover of Spin last month.

166
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:28,317
Excuse me.

167
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,550
So, if I can sell him on the director,

168
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,051
he can sell the label.

169
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,484
Who are you pitching him?

170
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,683
Only the hottest up-and-coming
director in Hollywood.

171
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:46,750
Seriously, stop.

172
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,984
My bride-to-be on the quest for her dress-to-be.

173
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,317
This just had to be immortalized.

174
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,650
That's it. I'm done.

175
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,351
Oh, it's so good.

176
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:56,251
What's wrong, hon?

177
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:58,817
Too much sequinsy frilly laciness?

178
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,650
Too much sameness.

179
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,151
Guess I'm not really the "glossy magazine wedding"

180
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:04,184
kind of bride.

181
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:07,484
Hey, Riley, your Facebook status still says "In a relationship."

182
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:09,683
It's probably safe to change that to "engaged."

183
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:12,084
Facebook's not really the way

184
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,650
I want to tell the world I'm engaged.

185
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,683
Meaning?

186
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:18,384
Meaning it's kind of impersonal.

187
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,518
All right, but you have told people, right?

188
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:25,017
Like your college roommates?

189
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:28,017
Like your best friends?

190
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:29,750
Like Andrea and Catherine

191
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,583
who you text every time you get

192
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,518
a new pair of underwear?

193
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,917
It's not like I'm hiding it from them.

194
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,151
Okay, but your parents know, right?

195
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,817
Riles, please tell me right now that both your parents

196
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,750
know we're getting married.

197
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,117
Not exactly.

198
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:56,683
Did the fact that it was 3:00 a.m. East Coast time

199
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:57,884
stop me from calling my family

200
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,750
and sharing the happiest news of my life?

201
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:05,484
Everyone who matters to me
knows that I'm getting married.

202
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,518
And if I wasn't $200 short
of announcing it in skywriting,

203
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,084
all of L.A. county would know, too.

204
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:13,184
I don't think there's anything wrong

205
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:15,117
with telling people my own way.

206
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:18,583
Okay, so far, your own way is not telling them.

207
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,484
What's going on, Riley?

208
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:26,184
Should I have saved the receipt for that ring?

209
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,817
Wow.

210
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,583
Did someone forget to put down the toilet seat?

211
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:33,384
This really isn't the best time.

212
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:36,484
Actually, there's never a bad
time for your big break.

213
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:37,884
Jonah...

214
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,784
I scored you your dream job.

215
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,051
You, my friend,

216
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:44,284
are directing Boomkat's new music video

217
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,850
down at Disney Concert Hall.

218
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:48,784
How is that remotely feasible?

219
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,583
I'll explain it to you on the way.

220
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:53,151
You have T minus seven hours left of sunlight

221
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:54,950
so...

222
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:56,717
we have to go.

223
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,950
Now.

224
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:00,683
Let's get out of here.

225
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,867
You realize he's the best cardiac surgeon

226
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,401
this side of Mayo. Everybody
wants that spot you're after.

227
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:29,668
Yeah, I know. That's why

228
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:31,867
I'm hoping to accidentally cross paths with him.

229
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,668
Then you better turn around.

230
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,301
How do I look?

231
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,301
Serious, professional, no-nonsense...?

232
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:39,067
Gorgeous.

233
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,701
I need someone to unlock my office.

234
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,067
I've misplaced my keycard.

235
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,534
Sure.

236
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:49,601
Hi, Dr. Mancini. I'm Lauren Yung, third year.

237
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:51,134
Oh, nice to meet you.

238
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:54,200
I just wanted to introduce myself to you

239
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:56,501
and to let you know that I'm
up for a spot on your team.

240
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,833
That's excellent. I'll see you in the interview.

241
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,833
Great.

242
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,534
Y-You know, not-not that it matters or anything,

243
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,200
but I actually know David.

244
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:07,601
Hm. Small world.

245
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,701
How well do you know David?

246
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,200
We live in the same building.

247
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:12,734
We've all kind of bonded recently

248
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:14,867
because our landlord was killed, so...

249
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,734
Yeah, I heard about that.

250
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,167
Real tragedy.

251
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,833
These instructions come in three languages,

252
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:31,867
none of them English.

253
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,967
Sweetheart, one of your, um, colleagues

254
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,933
from the hospital is here.

255
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,601
Okay.

256
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:41,867
Sydney.

257
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,200
You look like you've seen a ghost.

258
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,701
You shouldn't be here.

259
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,234
If the police find out you're still alive...

260
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:52,334
They know, Michael.

261
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,867
I just finished

262
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,701
serving six years at Valley State Prison.

263
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,067
You found a wife,

264
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,833
had a kid,

265
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:05,701
moved into a house straight out of a magazine.

266
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:07,334
And what was I doing?

267
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:08,734
Oh, right.

268
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,000
Wearing a prison jumpsuit

269
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:12,634
and trying to avoid my cell mate's razor blade.

270
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:14,367
I was doing you a favor.

271
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,467
You were an accomplice, Michael.

272
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,334
Faking my death was a felony.

273
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,701
But I kept your name out of it.

274
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:21,800
I protected you.

275
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:27,234
There's a reason that you risked everything for me

276
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,301
the night of my accident.

277
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:32,668
Michael, you and I, we are the same person.

278
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,701
We want what we want,

279
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,401
and we get it.

280
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,167
That's just who we are.

281
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,967
* All I do is think of you, it feels like I'm... *

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,034
The label already signed off on the treatment,

283
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,900
so you have to follow their storyboards.

284
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:54,100
Okay.

285
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:55,267
This is sick, El.

286
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,501
How did you score this?

287
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:58,167
I told them you were a younger,

288
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,567
hipper version of Kavi DeKnight,

289
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:01,867
and if anyone could imitate his work, it's you.

290
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,134
I've never met him.

291
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,534
You follow him on Twitter... same diff.

292
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,467
And besides, after they heard about the buzz

293
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,534
around Living in Reverse, you were a shoo-in.

294
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,134
There is no buzz.

295
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,067
There is now.

296
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,401
Ugh! Caleb, my watchdog.

297
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,067
Why don't you go find Taryn, make friends,

298
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,833
do whatever you people do... but, Jonah, don't blow it.

299
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,134
Talk to me.

300
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,267
Okay. Um...

301
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,534
Hey, can someone tell me where the lead singer is?

302
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:29,668
Violet. Hey.

303
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:31,634
Hey. Wardrobe malfunction.

304
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,334
You mind fastening me up?

305
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,867
I forgot how hard this dress was to put on.

306
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,134
No. Of course.

307
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,100
Half of my dresses require me, Jonah

308
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,267
and a pair of needle-nose pliers.

309
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,401
I guess designers just alw

310
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,000
we've got an extra set of hands nearby.

311
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:46,434
That's what's great about this place.

312
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:49,200
A girlfriend's just a knock away.

313
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:50,800
There.

314
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,701
That is a really gorgeous dress.

315
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,301
Thank you.

316
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:11,434
Excuse me.

317
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,100
Are you here about the apartment?

318
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,867
Where'd you get it?

319
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,534
Just a mall in Corvallis.

320
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm kind of wearing it for someone.

321
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:28,100
Really? That didn't take long.

322
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,668
Who's the lucky guy?

323
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:32,367
Just a guy from work.

324
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:34,534
I was thinking about getting him something.

325
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,701
You know, that says I'm into him.

326
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:37,933
Any ideas?

327
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,933
Well, I have to admit, I'm a little rusty

328
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:42,401
in the new crush department,
but I'm pretty sure there are

329
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:44,967
other ways of showing a guy
you're into him besides a gift.

330
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,833
Yeah, but if I get him something,

331
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:50,100
every time he sees it, he'll think of me.

332
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:52,634
Right.

333
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:54,334
What about a mix CD?

334
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,668
When Jonah and I were moving out here,

335
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:59,067
I made him this mix of video game songs.

336
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,701
He listened to it nonstop from Manhattan to L.A.

337
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,567
It was torture.

338
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:06,501
But it madhim really happy.

339
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:09,534
Guess that's why you guys
have been together forever.

340
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,267
Who the hell are you?

341
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:26,567
Uh... hi. I'm Jonah.

342
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,067
Jonah Miller. I'm your new director.

343
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,800
Says who? Whoa!

344
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,067
Um... hold on.

345
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,734
Security!

346
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,167
Look...

347
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:45,434
Now when you say the original
director walked out the set

348
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:46,735
did you actually mean it was more of a run

349
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:48,067
followed by a duck-and-cover?

350
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,501
So Taryn's a little paranoid.

351
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,434
A little? She's packing heat, El!

352
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,934
Oh, please!

353
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,301
She had a bad run-in with a stalker,

354
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,800
and now she's got trust issues.

355
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,267
The gun's her security blanket. I doubt it's even loaded.

356
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:01,101
Yeah, well, guess who's not sticking around to find out.

357
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,334
Jonah,

358
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,434
come on!

359
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:04,501
With your people skills,

360
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,201
she's like putty in your hands.

361
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:09,034
Yeah, maybe the kind they make
C-4 explosives with, sure.

362
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,067
Gosh, El, seriously!

363
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,167
What did you get me into here?

364
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,401
I'm a director, not a hostage negotiator.

365
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,501
Look, if I didn't think you could do it,

366
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,633
I wouldn't be risking my entire career for you.

367
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,134
What? What's wrong with your career?

368
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,167
You know it must be tragic when I can't even sugarcoat it.

369
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:30,700
I can't drop the ball in front of my new boss, okay?

370
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:33,633
You won't, though... you're, like, the superhero of spin.

371
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:34,867
You'll be fine.

372
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,800
You don't have to convince me I'm good.

373
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,034
I'm great.

374
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,867
It's just that my new boss is dead set

375
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,267
on turning my office into his
very own private cigar lounge.

376
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,900
I never realized there was a guy on this planet

377
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:47,633
that actually intimidated you.

378
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:51,401
Well, maybe I didn't want to lose your respect.

379
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,534
Look... the bottom line

380
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:55,367
is that I hired you

381
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,468
because I believe in you.

382
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:03,167
I never thought I would actually say this, but...

383
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:05,034
let me see what I can do

384
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,501
about getting the .45 away from the crazy chick

385
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:09,501
in the bus.

386
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,900
Thank you!

387
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:20,167
Do you ever leave this place?

388
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:21,633
Hey.

389
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,667
It's a little early for happy hour, isn't it?

390
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,401
I'm surprisingly not here for my mid-morning Cosmo.

391
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,568
I'm actually headed to the farmer's market.

392
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,700
Can I pick your brain for a recipe?

393
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,934
Don't tell me I'm losing my running buddy

394
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,767
to an apron and oven mitts.

395
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,334
Not in this lifetime.

396
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:38,301
But I was thinking I'd surprise Jonah

397
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,667
with a special dinner.

398
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,367
You? In the kitchen?

399
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:44,434
I thought your culinary skills
peaked with grilled cheese.

400
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:45,700
Yeah, well, Jonah and I kind of got off

401
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:46,900
to a weird start this morning.

402
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,900
I want to make the effort

403
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,034
to say I'm sorry.

404
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:53,301
You know, your fianc?..

405
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:55,934
snagged himself quite a catch.

406
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:01,000
He better hold on to you.

407
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:05,201
This from the guy who refuses to settle down

408
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,101
before he surfs every big wave on the planet?

409
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:12,633
Filet mignon with a caramel-Merlot sauce.

410
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,334
Works every time.

411
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:17,501
It sounds... complicated.

412
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:20,367
Relationships are complicated;

413
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:23,301
cooking comes with instructions.

414
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,401
Taryn?

415
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:34,468
Uh, it's Jonah.

416
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,733
Can I come in?

417
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:41,967
Hey, uh, I have my ID badge.

418
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,034
My hands will be clearly visible

419
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,534
at all times here.

420
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:49,667
I'm approaching with caution.

421
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:54,900
Wow. This is... this is nice digs.

422
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,600
So, security double-secured the perimeter

423
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,501
and we're ready for you.

424
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:00,800
I'm really not looking forward to wearing

425
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,067
this space suit all day.

426
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,700
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

427
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:04,934
It looks great; you look fantastic.

428
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:07,234
I'm afraid we're gonna have to leave

429
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,468
your little friend behind.

430
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:10,900
My .45 goes everywhere with me.

431
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,767
Except for court and airplanes.

432
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,034
Okay, well, you're gonna have to
add film sets to that list also.

433
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:18,733
Way too many people out there with lives and stuff.

434
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:22,034
Look, I had this fan, okay?

435
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,501
My number one fan.

436
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,167
She brought me flowers. She came off really sweet.

437
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,534
Psycho pulled out a switchblade

438
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,334
and almost took my head off.

439
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, my gosh, that's... that's scary stuff.

440
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:37,633
You know, you think you know
somebody and you let them in,

441
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,067
and then they
cut your heart out.

442
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:42,501
I hear that.

443
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:44,534
Look, Taryn,

444
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:47,900
we all have our issues.

445
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,401
I got mine.

446
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:50,568
Believe me, I got mine.

447
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,434
But we can't let them get the best of us though.

448
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:56,600
The longer you hold on to that gun,

449
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:59,267
the longer you're holding on to your fear.

450
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,067
You can't live like that.

451
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:08,468
Why don't you just admit it scares the crap out of you?

452
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:09,834
It scares the crap out of me.

453
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,034
So do you.

454
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,301
You scare the crap out of me.

455
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:13,234
Happy?

456
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:14,367
Yeah.

457
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:16,234
What do you say the gun sits this one out?

458
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,967
It was loaded.

459
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,167
Always.

460
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:31,501
* Every time I look at you, it's feeling like *

461
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:35,134
* There's something about you drawing nearer *

462
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,633
* Drawing nearer *

463
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,000
* And you can see it in my eyes *

464
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:40,501
* My feelings go
beyond the sky, baby *

465
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:43,600
* We're soaring away...

466
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:44,667
Cut!

467
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,434
Cut! That sucked.

468
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:47,600
It looked fine to me.

469
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:49,700
Exactly, fine blows.

470
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,667
Jonah, sweetheart, we already dodged a bullet here.

471
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,867
Get this thing on film before your artist

472
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,101
starts itching for her hardware again.

473
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,700
Just trust me, all right?

474
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,101
Taryn, darling, will you rip off that costume for me?

475
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,201
What? Serious?

476
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,201
Yes. Yeah, gladly.

477
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:03,434
Okay. Thanks.

478
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:04,967
Guys!

479
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,667
Guys, forget the choreography. I just, uh,

480
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,468
I want you guys to freestyle,
follow Taryn's lead, all right?

481
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,667
And get into your street clothes.

482
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,767
Jonah?

483
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,767
I want to go handheld on this one, all right?

484
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,568
Um, wide angle, low, real low

485
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,700
and, uh...
Okay, Jonah,

486
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,501
spit out the LSD.

487
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:20,034
The label approved the storyboards.

488
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,134
You can't change anything.

489
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,934
Ella, this video is flat.

490
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,301
Taryn looks like the Tin Man

491
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:26,101
who's in serious need of some WD-40.

492
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:27,434
Okay, I don't care.

493
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:28,900
You have to shoot this as scripted.

494
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,134
Stop wasting time.

495
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:33,167
Wait, you recommended me
because you trust me, right?

496
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:36,967
Trust me.

497
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,000
Dr. Anaman.

498
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,900
Calling Dr. Anaman.

499
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,633
David...

500
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,834
What are you doing in here?

501
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,400
Why are you in your dad's office?

502
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:13,067
I was just seeing if he was available for lunch.

503
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:15,567
I guess he's, uh, on rounds.

504
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,834
Actually, I'm kind of glad you're here.

505
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:25,101
Need a volunteer for a practice exam?

506
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,368
Not exactly.

507
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,934
I'm one of 50 interns jockeying for a spot

508
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:30,134
on your dad's surgical team.

509
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,500
Good luck with that.

510
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:33,134
I never thought I could be working with the guy

511
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,334
who invented the transcatheter aortic valve.

512
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:36,934
So, I was...

513
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,567
I was hoping you could put in a good word.

514
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,734
Look, Lauren, here's an insider tip.

515
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,134
You don't want to be on his team.

516
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,301
What...?

517
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:43,834
I-I don't?

518
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:46,567
No, he goes through interns
like he goes through ex-wives.

519
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,533
He's hard on people.

520
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,001
I mean, brutal almost.

521
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,368
No, brutal is watching you
and Ella drinking by the pool

522
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,467
while I'm on the couch studying
my neuroanatomy note cards.

523
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,167
You know how hard I worked for this.

524
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:57,901
Lauren, I'm not saying you didn't work hard.

525
00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:00,134
I'm just saying you don't know my dad.

526
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,567
Do you have any idea how
much attitude I've taken

527
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,967
from doctors along the way, David?

528
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:07,901
Especially arrogant male doctors?

529
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:09,201
Look, I'm sorry. Trust me on this, okay?

530
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:10,800
I'm saving you the headache.

531
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:12,834
It's just... it's best to stay
out of his way altogether.

532
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:16,334
* I'll be in the sky

533
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:18,034
Order on table six.

534
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,433
* Oh, all right

535
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:21,034
Pretty intense back here.

536
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:24,201
It's a lot mellower than it was about an hour ago.

537
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:27,901
You know, I never really thanked
you for getting me this job.

538
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:29,500
That was so cool of you.

539
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,500
I just wanted to let you know

540
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:34,400
how much it meant to me.

541
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:38,067
I know the beach is practically your second home,

542
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:41,567
so why not block those UV rays in style?

543
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,667
Tony, take over.

544
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:49,400
Violet, those are $200 sunglasses.

545
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:51,234
Thank you, really, but I can't take those.

546
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:53,867
Auggie, this is the least I can do.

547
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,167
You don't owe me anything.

548
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,400
Right.

549
00:23:57,433 --> 00:24:00,001
Okay, yeah. Well, no big deal.

550
00:24:00,034 --> 00:24:02,600
I, uh, I can totally get my money back for them.

551
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:05,867
I just saw them and automatically thought of you.

552
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:07,700
That was sweet.

553
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:09,134
It was nothing.

554
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:11,368
Anyway, see ya.

555
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,001
* I'll be there

556
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,234
* I'll be there.

557
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:20,334
* This feels so right

558
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:23,101
* It's like we're flying

559
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:24,867
* And I don't want to come down *

560
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:26,700
Awesome, guys, that lift was awesome.

561
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:29,001
* We are all just human beings

562
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,268
Taryn, come towards me now.

563
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:32,001
* Across the ocean Come towards me. Perfect.

564
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,500
* Overseas

565
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:36,600
* When you die, what will you leave? *

566
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:38,567
Riley.

567
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,867
Bad timing. Jonah's on his last shots

568
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,368
and we're running out of sunlight.

569
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,967
I'm just saying hi to my fianc?

570
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:47,301
Last I heard, that engagement was a little lopsided.

571
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:48,433
That's really none of your business.

572
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:51,001
No, but Jonah delivering his video on time

573
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:52,533
is my business.

574
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:54,167
Look, just do us both a favor;

575
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,268
don't distract him with any
of your domestic issues, please?

576
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,301
Cut! All right, print that!

577
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:01,467
I want one more reset. Quickly.

578
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,101
Jonah, this is like a big deal.

579
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:05,800
You must be a kid in a candy store.

580
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,767
I don't want to sound like a jerk here, Riley, but I really,

581
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,934
I, just super busy, okay? I know.

582
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,134
Look, I was thinking about this morning...

583
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,368
Okay, that can wait, and this shoot can't.

584
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,368
I'm not here to start things up with you again.

585
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,368
I just wanted to...

586
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,567
Then later, please?

587
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,934
I just don't have the time.

588
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:19,201
I'm fighting the sunlight right now. Guys!

589
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:20,634
We're rolling. Of course.

590
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,567
Playback!

591
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,167
* Every time I look at you

592
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:25,734
* It's feeling like there's something about you *

593
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,600
* Driving me away...

594
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,467
High recommendations from the chief.

595
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,533
Test scores in the 95th percentile.

596
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,467
Looks like somebody knows what she's doing.

597
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,533
Thank you. I pretty much wanted to be a doctor

598
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,400
since I got my first Fisher-Price stethoscope.

599
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:42,734
Mm. Then why does

600
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,001
the admission's office have you red-flagged?

601
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:47,634
Um...

602
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,201
my dad lost his job and missed
a few tuition payments.

603
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:51,667
So what happens if the school

604
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,500
decides to throw you out of the program?

605
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,433
I don't have time to train a new intern.

606
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:56,634
No, of course not.

607
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:59,334
But I can assure you I'm doing everything I can

608
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:00,667
to catch up with those payments.

609
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,301
Your optimism's adorable, Yung,

610
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:05,334
but you do realize that being on my team means

611
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:07,934
there's no time to pick up
that extra shift at Starbucks.

612
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,867
Dr. Mancini, I... I promise you
I have something worked out.

613
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,934
I'll let you know.

614
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:17,134
Oh, did... did David find you?

615
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,934
David?

616
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:20,901
Yeah, he came by here

617
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:23,567
to grab some lunch, but you were out.

618
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,368
David was here? In my office?

619
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,101
Yeah, yeah, when I dropped off my application.

620
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:31,101
Hmm, I must have just missed him.

621
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:32,934
Okay.

622
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,700
Hey.

623
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,400
Checking up on the chef.

624
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,400
I, uh, I didn't see Jonah's car out back,

625
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:53,334
and I don't smell any food cooking in the kitchen.

626
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:55,700
That's because the dinner's off.

627
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:01,101
Guess I won't be earning my way

628
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:03,067
onto Jonah's good side after all.

629
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:05,167
Must have been some fight this morning.

630
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:07,700
I think I had it coming.

631
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:13,301
I haven't told anyone we're engaged.

632
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,667
Why keep that a secret?

633
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,967
I don't know.

634
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,034
I guess I just didn't want to deal

635
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,334
with all the phone calls and fanfare.

636
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:23,234
Right.

637
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,567
And I'm supposed to believe that?

638
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,001
I'm, like, the worst fiancee in the world.

639
00:27:28,034 --> 00:27:30,500
Riley, it's okay.

640
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,667
No, it's not, Auggie.

641
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,201
I wish I could just jump onto a surfboard whenever

642
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:39,268
there's a problem, but I can't.

643
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:44,334
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

644
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:45,500
No, you're right.

645
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,867
Not letting anyone down...

646
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:50,567
one of the perks of being single.

647
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,234
Look, you and Jonah are gonna work through this.

648
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:56,134
Why should we have to work through anything?

649
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:58,167
Isn't this supposed to be the easy part?

650
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,134
Engaged and in love without a care

651
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:02,067
in the world?

652
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,500
What are you doing? You don't drink.

653
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:11,368
I know, but you look like you could really use it.

654
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:17,101
You hungry?

655
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,800
* And I don't want to come down *

656
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:28,101
* We are all just human beings

657
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:31,734
* Across the ocean, overseas *

658
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:35,067
* When you die, what will you leave? *

659
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:39,001
* I know for me it's my belief. *

660
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,067
Cut!

661
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:42,734
That's a wrap, everyone.

662
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,500
Thank you so much.

663
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:47,167
Whoo!

664
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:50,001
Hey.

665
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:51,368
Hey.

666
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,234
You're really good with that camera.

667
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:55,567
Thank you very much.

668
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,867
You, uh, you rocked up there.

669
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,901
So, you're coming to the loft party, right?

670
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:00,967
Uh, I don't know.

671
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:02,067
That's the first I've heard of it.

672
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:03,500
Oh. Well, apparently,

673
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,634
there's a stripper pole in one of the bedrooms.

674
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,700
So, I was thinking you could grab that camera

675
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:12,934
and direct me in something a little more private.

676
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,334
That sounds like a very interesting project,

677
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:20,533
but... I'm gonna have to pass.

678
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,500
So I guess it's true:

679
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,533
once gun-shy, always gun-shy.

680
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,667
Pow.

681
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,400
Bye.

682
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:32,500
What, you're not into rock stars?

683
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:35,134
Guess schoolteacher's more your speed.

684
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:38,167
It's been a long day, Ella.

685
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:40,368
You're not seriously going home
to your bride-in-waiting?

686
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,433
Yeah, I treated her like crap today, El.

687
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:44,767
None of this means anything

688
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,368
unless I have someone to share it with.

689
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
You were brilliant today, Jonah.

690
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,268
When you focus and you execute,

691
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:51,700
you're unstoppable.

692
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:53,067
Why would you let anyone come in the way of that?

693
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:55,101
Because I'm not like you, El.

694
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:57,567
I can't just turn off my emotions, okay?

695
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,433
When I said I wasn't thinking about Riley,

696
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:00,667
she was still on my mind.

697
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,334
She's always with me.

698
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,101
Well, then I hope she likes bar
mitzvahs and birthday parties.

699
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:08,067
Because if you don't start putting your career first,

700
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:10,700
that's all you're gonna have to share with her.

701
00:30:10,734 --> 00:30:12,934
Think about it.

702
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:23,800
Did I really finish this?

703
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:27,734
Well, in your defense, you were drinking for two.

704
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:31,268
Oh, I wish I could say it's helping making things easier.

705
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:34,334
Riley, there's nothing easy about being in a relationship.

706
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,967
And the longer you're in one, the harder it can be.

707
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:42,234
I screwed up, Auggie.

708
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:45,533
No one's asking you to have every answer.

709
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,734
But Jonah just wanted one answer,

710
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,967
and it took me an entire day to give it to him.

711
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,067
I should've been more sure.

712
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,700
You can't help how you feel.

713
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,101
That's the problem.

714
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:07,433
I don't even know how I feel.

715
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:13,268
I think you do know how you feel.

716
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:15,934
That's why you're scared.

717
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:25,433
Oh, God.

718
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,067
Riley... No, I'm drunk.

719
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:29,634
Like really, really drunk.

720
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:30,901
Riley, it's okay.

721
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,834
My mind's kind of spinning.

722
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,234
This whole room's kind of spinning.

723
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:38,800
I, um, I should probably go lie down

724
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,634
before I humiliate myself any more.

725
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,500
Riley, don't kill yourself over this, all right?

726
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,834
It's fine.

727
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,800
We're fine.

728
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:48,834
Good night.

729
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:52,533
Good night.

730
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,934
Oh.

731
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:22,001
You want to play this game?

732
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,433
I'll play.

733
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:24,600
I thought that we called first, Dad.

734
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:25,834
Isn't that the rule?

735
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:28,634
What'd you, uh, you crawl through the window?

736
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,467
Oh, save it.

737
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,433
You don't think I know you were in my office today?

738
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:33,734
What did you take?

739
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:34,734
Nothing.

740
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:36,334
But whatever you think it was

741
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:37,901
must've been pretty damn incriminating

742
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:39,767
for you to slither back to your old haunts to find it.

743
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,634
Oh, yeah, you, uh,

744
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,234
you were sneaking in and out of here for months

745
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:45,533
while you were banging Sydney.

746
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,101
You don't think I know you broke into my house

747
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,234
and stole a $2 million painting?

748
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,934
A painting?

749
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:53,667
Dad, I thought I was too much of a failure

750
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,834
to appreciate fine art.

751
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,234
That's why you're showing up on my doorstep

752
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:57,901
accusing me of murder.

753
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,734
Takes the spotlight off you, doesn't it?

754
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:02,167
Whatever lets you sleep at night.

755
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:06,767
You think you've got it all figured out, don't you, Davey?

756
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,067
Your angst and your spats with the law.

757
00:33:11,101 --> 00:33:12,967
Blame it all on your abandonment issues.

758
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,734
It's not just me that you abandoned.

759
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,400
You abandoned Mom.

760
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:20,967
We barely knew each other.

761
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:23,101
She called you from her deathbed.

762
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,467
She needed you.

763
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:31,301
The greatest doctor of all
time, and what do you do?

764
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:33,834
You just stand by and watch her die.

765
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:38,467
You want me in your life?

766
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,901
You got it, kiddo.

767
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,834
I am going to make it priority one

768
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:44,134
to know everything about you...
your friends, your hobbies...

769
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,567
Oh, and I'll make up for lost time.

770
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,934
You can bet on that.

771
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:51,934
Enjoy the painting.

772
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:14,533
Hello? Hello, Michael.

773
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,934
I told you, never call me here.

774
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,167
Not until you've paid

775
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:19,268
in full.

776
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:21,167
I gave you your life back.

777
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,268
It's not my fault you got caught
faking your own death.

778
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:24,800
It was your idea.

779
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:26,368
That could have been you
in that jail cell, Michael.

780
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
I was the one who kept you out of it.

781
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:30,134
And I showed you my appreciation
with my checkbook.

782
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,734
If I recall, you showed me
a lot more than your checkbook.

783
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:34,600
Sydney, get a grip.

784
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:35,934
I can't be dragged out of my life

785
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,934
every time you decide to have a meltdown.

786
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,500
You're not going to have much of a life

787
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:40,767
after I tell the medical board

788
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,467
what you did that night.

789
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,533
They'll never believe you.

790
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:47,101
Daddy?

791
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:48,201
I can't sleep.

792
00:34:48,234 --> 00:34:49,634
Go back to bed. I'll be right in.

793
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,101
Don't let your family down.

794
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,567
We both know that Michael Mancini's a nobody

795
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,467
without the "D-R" in front of his name.

796
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,767
Leticia?

797
00:34:58,768 --> 00:34:59,768
I bet she's got some place to go.

798
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:18,667
I'm so sorry, Jonah.

799
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,434
My issues aren't with you.

800
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:22,700
They're with me.

801
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:26,633
I've only dated three guys.

802
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:30,934
My second longest relationship was six months.

803
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:32,401
Why would you want to marry someone

804
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:33,633
who doesn't know what she's doing?

805
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,867
Like I know what I'm doing?

806
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,434
Do you know how intimidating it
is to be around you sometimes?

807
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:44,767
I'm pretty much the least intimidating person I know.

808
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,700
You didn't see yourself on set today

809
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:48,767
in the midst of that giant production?

810
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,401
You were fearless.

811
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:53,534
You could have let it terrify you

812
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,067
and you could have run away, but you didn't.

813
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,934
That's how you are.

814
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:02,234
You don't question and hesitate and worry.

815
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:04,534
You just trust yourself and dive right in.

816
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:11,468
Jonah, I want to dive in with you.

817
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,334
Does that mean you're calling your parents?

818
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:16,867
Done.

819
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,434
My mom is already planning
an East Coast bridal shower

820
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,867
and my dad said, "Congratulations there, buddy."

821
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:27,201
And I changed my Facebook status.

822
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:28,700
And...

823
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,700
even found that extra 200 bucks

824
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:34,067
if you want to follow through
with the skywriting thing.

825
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:37,900
Hmm.

826
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:41,434
Look, you can come to me with anything.

827
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:43,900
We're not going to make it

828
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,501
if we just keep secrets from each other.

829
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:47,501
All right?

830
00:36:47,534 --> 00:36:48,934
I know.

831
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:54,468
I promise. No more secrets.

832
00:37:00,267 --> 00:37:02,201
That's Catherine and Andrea calling me back.

833
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:04,201
Hello?

834
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah.

835
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:09,000
I know. I'm engaged!

836
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:12,900
You seen the dailies yet?

837
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,167
Yep.

838
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:16,234
Told you Jonah would knock it out of the park.

839
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,367
Who's Jonah? Jonah Miller.

840
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:19,600
Our director.

841
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:22,767
Oh, no. Kavi DeKnight directed this video.

842
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,767
Are you serious?

843
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,267
Kavi loves the way that Jonah shot his storyboards.

844
00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:29,667
He wants to put his name back on the project.

845
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,367
I want to keep him hot.

846
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,234
And you're going along with this?

847
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:34,834
Yeah, it was my idea.

848
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:36,367
And the record company loves it.

849
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:39,234
Having Kavi's name on the video means more airplay.

850
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:40,967
Now, if promoting our star

851
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,800
means undercutting some baby-faced newbie,

852
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:44,600
that's Hollywood.

853
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,867
Nice work, Caleb.

854
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:00,000
There you are.

855
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:01,900
Dr. Mancini. Hey.

856
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,900
I've been thinking about you.

857
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:06,733
You know, I think you're too valuable to pass up.

858
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:10,134
Welcome to my team.

859
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,568
Are you serious?

860
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah. I talked to David.

861
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:15,834
He said nobody works harder than Lauren Yung.

862
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:18,700
Now, rotations start next week.

863
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:21,167
Now, I'm still a little concerned about your finances.

864
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,667
You sure you can work that out?

865
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,534
I can work it out.

866
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,101
I... I mean, I swear to you,

867
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:28,733
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

868
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,867
I'm sure you will.

869
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,067
* And when the fires came

870
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,468
* The smell of cinders and rain... *

871
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:44,568
Oh.

872
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,034
Lovebirds need me to make a Gelson's run

873
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:48,067
for some champagne and strawberries?

874
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:49,334
If that's your Ella way of asking

875
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,767
if Riley and I figured things out...

876
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:54,267
Yes, we did.

877
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:56,434
Fantastic.

878
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:57,900
Thank you.

879
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:02,800
Look, I may have been

880
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,301
a little hard on you today at the shoot.

881
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:06,700
Oh, my... No.

882
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:08,667
You were just being my agent, manager, and publicist.

883
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,134
It's cool.

884
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:12,934
Well, as your three-pronged career consultant,

885
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,267
I have to be the bearer of bad news.

886
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:17,867
Um, you're still getting paid for the music video,

887
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,301
but Kavi is taking the credit.

888
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:21,633
What?

889
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:26,234
He can't do that, though. That's...

890
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:28,401
That's like, above and beyond plagiarism.

891
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,568
I know, okay? Believe me, I know.

892
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,301
Even with my job hanging by a thread,

893
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:35,067
I fought my boss really hard on this.

894
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:37,667
This sucks. So now...

895
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,800
now I have to sue him?

896
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,468
Not unless you want your first Variety headline

897
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,867
to be a credit arbitration lawsuit.

898
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,000
I can't believe this.

899
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:51,301
Hey. It's okay.

900
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:54,900
You're way too good for music videos, anyway.

901
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,367
Oh, yeah, sure.

902
00:39:56,401 --> 00:39:58,934
Next stop, feature-land.

903
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:00,534
Yeah...

904
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:03,767
Oh, yeah. Big bucks.

905
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,134
Hey.

906
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,633
Thanks again for fighting for me today.

907
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,101
Of course.

908
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:18,501
* For home again, for home again *

909
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:22,900
* When I run in the dark

910
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,667
* Daniel

911
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,000
* To a place that's worst...

912
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:30,201
Hey, you.

913
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:33,568
Hey.

914
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,401
How did the interview go?

915
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,034
I made the team.

916
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:39,834
Congratulations.

917
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:42,267
Yeah. Thanks to you.

918
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:44,834
Your dad told me you put in
a good word after all.

919
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:46,367
I appreciate it.

920
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,234
Good night.

921
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:54,367
Night.
