- Or... not ever?

172
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,111
You should know, snagging a girl
like Lauren.

173
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:13,948
- How'd you pull that off?
- What do you mean, how?

174
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:15,249
Oh, my God. The ladies
practically line up

175
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:16,551
for David Breck.

176
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:20,922
No, Drew's right.
Lauren's got standards.

177
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:22,223
I mean,
why shouldn't she?

178
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:26,127
You know, now that we're
stepping things up,

179
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:28,997
I got to show her I'm not
just some slacker who just...

180
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,632
Plays hoops all day?
Yeah, something like that.

181
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:35,536
Hey, you know what? Lauren's
been a little stressed lately.

182
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,772
Has anything unusual been
going on at the hospital?

183
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:40,742
Um, aside from demanding
professors, dying patients

184
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:43,945
- and eternal lack of sleep?
- Sky hoop.

185
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,681
Nope.
No added stress at all.

186
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:54,389
- Oh, my God, Sydney.
- Where? - Oh!

187
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,959
(knocking at door)

188
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:01,896
Come in.
Oh, just in time.

189
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,700
Would you latch this?
Well, you're looking chipper.

190
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:08,569
Believe me, the last
place I want to be

191
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:11,939
is at a third-rate film festival
in Santa Barbara.

192
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:16,711
Now, third rate or not,
it is Santa Barbara, not Boise.

193
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:17,912
I mean, you look
a little too casual.

194
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:19,280
You did bring a change
of clothes, right?

195
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:25,219
Actually, I can't make it.
You're breaking up with me.

196
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:28,823
Amanda...
I can't wait to hear this.

197
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:33,561
At the end of the day,
we want different things.

198
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:35,463
Oh, Is that so?

199
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,366
You're this beautiful,
sophisticated woman

200
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,802
who oozes power, and I'm
basically an overgrown geek

201
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:46,808
who doesn't want to grow up,
let alone get married.

202
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:50,344
- Who wants to get married?
- I told you I wasn't interested in that.

203
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,779
When is long-distance,

204
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:55,349
it was fine, but now we...
we live in the same city,

205
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:59,554
we see each other all the time,
and it's become so... adult.

206
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,126
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't apologize.

207
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:09,697
I mean, in the end, you 
were nothing more to me than a toy.

208
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:12,967
- A toy?
- That's a new one.

209
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:16,204
They're fun for a while,
but it's only a matter of time

210
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:17,905
before they start
to bore you.

211
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:26,614
I really do care
about you very much.

212
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:28,683
And I never meant
to hurt you.

213
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:32,820
Oh, you give yourself
way too much credit.

214
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:34,188
Good-bye, Ben.

215
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:50,972
Mason. David Breck.
We talked on the phone.

216
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:55,776
- Yes. Mr. Breck. How you doing?
- Good. Excited.

217
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:57,311
So, you really want
to buy this place?

218
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:58,613
Absolutely. It's
been a dream of mine

219
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,815
- for a long time.
- Well, dreams are great.

220
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,683
Let's talk about
reality.
All right.

221
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:05,153
- What's your offer?
- Well, we both know

222
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:07,488
the restaurant business
hasn't been booming.

223
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:10,758
So I can do $1.5 million cash.

224
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,693
$1.5?
Mm-hmm.

225
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:15,363
The guy who owns
Gidot, offered $2.2.

226
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:19,734
The deal closetomorrow afternoo.
That's a lot of money.

227
00:11:19,768 --> 00:11:22,603
Yeah. This place is worth
every penny of it.

228
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,705
You beat that offer
by tomorrow,

229
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,641
it's all yours.

230
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:30,645
Thanks.

231
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,752
Can't go wrong
with a stuffed hippo, right?

232
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:39,453
(chuckles)
Kids love hippos.

233
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:43,591
Hippos are fabulous.
Okay.

234
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:48,930
- Now do the...
- Yeah, that.

235
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:50,431
(uneasy laugh)
Harder than it looks, right?

236
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:54,202
I'm sorry. I'm just a little out of practice
on the whole holding-of-the-hands thing.

237
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:56,671
I just thought you
would want to...

238
00:11:56,705 --> 00:12:01,075
- This is what I want.
- Jonah, are you sure

239
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:05,279
that Sammy is a...
The Evite said birthday.

240
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:07,181
It did not specify
human or canine.

241
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:09,283
ELLA:
Well, if I knew there
was going to be drool

242
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,352
everywhere, I wouldn't
have worn my Balenciaga.

243
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:14,722
Look who's here. Sammy,
it's my hottest new client.

244
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:16,857
- How are you, Charlie?
- Good to see you.

245
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:20,361
- Hi. Charlie Kitsis.
- Hi. Ella Simms. WPK.

246
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:26,067
And you must be Sammy!
Oh, happy birthday, Sammy.

247
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,669
You do not look
a day over one.

248
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:32,306
- Has he had work done?
- Funny.

249
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:34,208
You're with WPK?

250
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,577
Our boy wonder hired himself
a publicist already.

251
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,179
I haven't hired a publicist.

252
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:41,115
No, Ella's just my--
you know, girlfriend.

253
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,750
Well done, pal.

254
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:45,753
Excuse me. Enjoy the party.
Thank you.

255
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:48,556
Sorry. I don't know
why I said that.

256
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,724
That was--
that was weird.

257
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,392
Why don't you go
get me a drink.

258
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:52,593
Preferably something
in a glass,

259
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:55,096
- Not a doggie dish, okay?
- I'm on it. Okay.

260
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,068
- And some hand sanitizer.
- Ooh! Hello.

261
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:06,707
(door opening)
I need to talk to you.

262
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:09,243
Yeah, I'm actually going to be
late for class, David. Sorry.

263
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,246
Look, Lauren,
I can feel you drifting
away from me, all right?

264
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:15,583
I've been trying to figure out why,
and I... I think

265
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:18,619
that maybe you can tell that
I'm hiding something from you.

266
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:23,624
- Are you stealing again?
- No. I told you I've given all that up.

267
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:28,729
A couple days ago,
I got a letter from Vanessa.

268
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:33,010
- Dr. Mancini's wife?
- It was written before she died.

269
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:41,509
Before they were married...
we kind of got together.

270
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:46,414
I don't know how else to say it,
but Noah's my son.

271
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:55,122
- Look, I know it's a shock.
- I'm not running from it.

272
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:57,058
I want to be there for him.
I want to be there for you...

273
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:01,662
- David, I can't.
- Can't what?

274
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:03,030
Lauren.

275
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:12,840
I can't be with you
anymore, David.

276
00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:19,447
- What? Why, 'cause I have a kid?
- No.

277
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:23,684
Um... no. Actually, I'm...
I'm really happy for you.

278
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:28,756
- I know how much you love Noah.
- Then what's this about?

279
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,291
Lauren, what the hell's
going on?

280
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:33,461
We're just different people.

281
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:38,432
On different paths.

282
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:45,172
I'm sorry.
I got to go.

283
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,570
Hey.
Just healed the sickmended the,

284
00:14:59,604 --> 00:15:01,005
fondled the sleeping.

285
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:06,643
Looks like my day is done.
No visible blockage.

286
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,345
She should be able
to hear me.

287
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,414
Yeah, too well, Drew.

288
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:14,084
Wow, I am way late
for my day job.

289
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,652
Time for Drew Pragin,
med student,

290
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,521
to turn to Drew Pragin,
man for hire.

291
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,290
- Yes, I sell my body for sex.
- Don't judge me.

292
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:25,662
What Hey, hey, hey,
are you okay? dge me.

293
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,898
- What's... going on?
- Nothing.

294
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:30,367
Look, if...
you need a break or you want me

295
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:32,703
to cover one of your shifts,
I can help you out.

296
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,438
(sighs)

297
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:37,574
Thank you. I'm okay.

298
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:49,586
(car approaching)

299
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:59,396
Hey, bud.

300
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,832
Sorry about what
happened on that Yacht

301
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,335
with you and Hassan.
My cousin hates being shown up.

302
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,906
- Ancient history.
- I want to talk about the future.

303
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,175
I know of a score... big.

304
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,011
Diamond ring, seven carats.
Worth at least a mill.

305
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,146
Are you working
jewelry shops now?

306
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:18,615
It's a house in the Palisades.
Real shady dude.

307
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,250
Security guy
tipped me off.

308
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:23,120
You talking that much cash,
it's gonna take some time, bro.

309
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,755
Listen, I don't
have a lot of time

310
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,890
You talking that much cash,
it's I need the money tomorrow.

311
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:28,926
You got to help me out.

312
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:33,897
(sighs)

313
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:36,733
You bring me that rock,
I'll see what I can do.

314
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,402
All right?

315
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:47,845
♪ For he's a jolly good puppy,
for he's a jolly good puppy ♪

316
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,716
♪ For he's a jolly good puppy,
that nobody can deny. ♪

317
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,654
Okay, promise me we never
host a doggie birthday.

318
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:01,391
For the dog that we
don't own together?

319
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:04,161
- You don't want a dog?
- No, No, No.

320
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:06,196
You see, dogs and I
don't really match up.

321
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,598
What do you mean?
All the hair everywhere,

322
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:10,567
the throw up,
the humping of the leg.

323
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:13,337
It's like living with
a frat boy on all fours.

324
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:14,872
- I'm sor...
- Oh, but, of course,

325
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:18,208
- if you... want to...
- No, it's cool.

326
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:19,710
Um... guess
I shouldn't bring up

327
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:21,445
my whole hamster
idea now, though.

328
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,013
I swear, all these people--

329
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:26,950
<i>it's like they jumped
off the cover of Variety.</i>

330
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:29,486
It's Michael Hoover,
Abby Douglas's agent,

331
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,955
- 12 o'clock high.
- It's time to mingle.

332
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,658
All right, I can get
my schmooze on. Lead the way.

333
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:36,793
Uh-uh. I suggest we do the
divide-and-conquer strategy.

334
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:38,795
You take the east link,
I take the west.

335
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,130
(whispers):
We'll meet in the middle.

336
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:43,133
- Okay, the, uh, the flank thing...
- I can do that. Yes.

337
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:46,170
- Promise me you won't stray too far.
- Okay.

338
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:50,607
- Hey, Drew!
- What...? - My...

339
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:51,909
- Jonah. 
- Wow.

340
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:54,711
Since when do you moonlight
as a rock star?

341
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:57,881
Oh, man, I always wanted
to play to a crowd that howls.

342
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,717
Barking not so much.
(chuckles)

343
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:02,586
I went to high school
with these guys.

344
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,254
We could have been huge,

345
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:06,957
except for the slight
lack of talent.

346
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,926
Wait, what are you talk...?
You guys rocked.

347
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,561
I actually saw a Yorkie
slam-dancing

348
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,129
with a couple
of Pekingese earlier.

349
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:14,965
And I saw you
with your girlfriend.

350
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:18,869
- You are on fire, big boy.
- Hotshot screenwriter,

351
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:21,038
- hot agent.
- Does it get any better?

352
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:25,142
- I think hotshot's a bit of a stretch.
- And Ella...

353
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:27,978
I don't think you could quite 
call it girlfriend just yet.

354
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:29,546
Jonah.

355
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:31,782
Listen, I want you
to meet Kyle Teller.

356
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:33,684
He's a VP at Sony.
He's got an assignment.

357
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:35,919
It's a Seth Rogan project,
and you're perfect for it.

358
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:38,255
- Okay, Right now.
- Awesome.

359
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,356
Did he just say Seth Rogan?

360
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,124
Why are yotalking to me? Go.

361
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:49,666
- He did. - Oh, my gosh.
- Hey. - Hi.

362
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,169
Right on time.
Come on in.

363
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,238
Um, so I did
a little research.

364
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:57,941
Once we submit the school
charter to the state,

365
00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:59,810
we can apply for 501-C3 status

366
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:02,613
Then I think it's best
if we do a two-tieredhool
strategy, um...state,

367
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:03,747
Whoa.

368
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,016
Let's just slo .

369
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:11,288
(chuckles)
- I'm sorry. - No, don't apologize.

370
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,289
I admire your energy

371
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:17,060
and your ability to focus,
given the circumstances.

372
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:21,999
- I'm sorry? - Maybe we can acknowledge
the elephant in the room,

373
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,800
we can both relax a little.

374
00:19:23,835 --> 00:19:28,905
Oh, I meanst night in the limo.

375
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,441
If you can put it out
of your head, great,

376
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:36,613
but... it's pretty much all
I've been thinking about

377
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:39,082
but...  
Right.

378
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:41,118
Well, we kind of covered that.

379
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:43,954
Sort of a non-starter.

380
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:48,191
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we did.

381
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,233
- I broke up with Amanda.
- What?

382
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,168
She's great,

383
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:00,704
but not what you would
call a warm person,

384
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:04,007
and that's-- that's who I need.

385
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,043
I need someone who cares
about other people

386
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:10,947
- and not just herself.
- Oh, I-ow what it's like to be confused

387
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:13,016
about what kind of person
is right for you.

388
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:16,753
- I'm not confused.
- I think people

389
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:19,022
spend way too much time
analyzing their choices

390
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:23,026
instead of going
with their instincts
right in the moment.

391
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,505
My patience only stretches so thin.
Where is the painting?

392
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,608
Well, I can't have
that Breck kid come home

393
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,209
and find a blank space
on his wall,

394
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,612
so I photographed it.
A copy's being made.

395
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:48,881
I'll swap them and get you
the original later.

396
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,918
You know, the dimensions
are exactly the same.

397
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,686
If Syd painted over
the Van De amp

398
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:57,357
with water soluble paint,
she's a lot smarter than I thought.

399
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:00,627
Or she's just another hack artist
who likes to finger-paint.

400
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:05,865
- We'll find out soon.
- Don't you want to see

401
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:10,169
 what other little surprise
I have for you?

402
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:23,049
Your hunches
always that dead on?

403
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:28,788
(photographs rustling)
(knocking)

404
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:32,158
- Hey.
- Hi. - Got a minute?

405
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,227
I need some advice from
the smartest person I know.

406
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:37,530
- Okay.
- Hey, are you okay?

407
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:41,167
Yeah, I just didn't get
much sleep last night.

408
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,803
Lauren, you once slept
through a 5.3 earthquAke.

409
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:49,075
- What is going on?
- I broke up with David.

410
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:53,479
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry. What happened?

411
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:57,250
He'd better not have
been cheating on you, or I swear...

412
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:59,452
No wasn't.
He wasn't cheating on me.

413
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,821
It was just... You know, I've,
I've been under

414
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,790
so much pressure
lately, with work

415
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,525
and everything,
it-it just got to a point

416
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,394
where I-I had
to make a choice,

417
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:13,267
- and I chose to end it.
- That's hard.

418
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,070
I know how complicated
it gets when work

419
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:18,538
and relationshipshard
get tangled up.

420
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:22,241
Which is kind of why I came over here,
but listen...

421
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:25,645
- No, no, no.
- Tell me. What?

422
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,817
Okay. Ben Brinkley and I...
(gasps)

423
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:34,687
Are having an affair.
Riley!

424
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:36,856
- Have you slept with him?
- No.

425
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,592
- What about Amanda?
- He broke up with her.

426
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:43,896
- Oh, God. For you?
- I don't know. Maybe.

427
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,365
Oh... it's all so
wrong, isn't it?

428
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,535
Look, Riley, you just came out

429
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,637
of a five-year relationship

430
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:55,975
that didn't end well.
Have some fun.

431
00:22:57,244 --> 00:23:02,348
Why not?
(chuckles)

432
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:22,802
- Oh, I bet you have.
I bet you have.

433
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,237
I don't really need
to go into that,

434
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,639
but yes, I have.

435
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,742
- Hey.
- Hi!

436
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,878
I was just looking for you.

437
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,013
Michael Hoover,
meet Jonah Miller.

438
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:35,548
I know that mug from the cover
of the trades last week.

439
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,217
Nice to meet you, Jonah.
Call me, sweetheart.

440
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:41,754
Oh. Bye, baby.
Get home safe.

441
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,289
(chuckles)

442
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:46,259
Okay, I'm just curious.
What was all that?

443
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,828
- What was what?
- You and that guy.

444
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,930
Michael Hoover?

445
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:53,599
He's an agent. We have
a working relationship.

446
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:55,601
Yeah, right.
Define "work."

447
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:59,806
Jonah, if I have to sweet-talk

448
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,242
an agent to lock down
a client, then so be it.

449
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,411
I'm not having sex
with the guy.

450
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,815
No. You were just
pretty much all over him.

451
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:12,652
<i>Wha...? No. I was
flirting with him.</i>

452
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:14,554
Guilty as charged.

453
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,355
So what? Big deal.
Who cares?

454
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,592
<i>I do.
Call me old-fashioned,</i>

455
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,994
but, like,
I'm not a huge fan

456
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,097
of watching my date practically maul
some another guy.

457
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:28,434
Okay. Jonah, listen.
I like you.

458
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,703
Okay? I really,
really like you.

459
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:33,372
But this whole notion
of us together,

460
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:34,674
and dinner with placemats
and holding hands?

461
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,275
I don't know.
It's just...

462
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,077
I've never done
that before, okay?

463
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:43,082
And to be quite frank,
it seems
a little suffocating.

464
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:48,020
Well, then maybe you should
get some oxygen.

465
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,258
Good idea.

466
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,894
I'm gonna go get
another ride home.

467
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:58,764
- Ella, I... - No, Jonah. Is this
what couples do?

468
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,667
They-they suffocate each other
and stress each other out?

469
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,002
Because if
that's the case,

470
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:05,738
then I guess couplehood
is not for me.

471
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:53,152
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?

472
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:01,143
What are you doing
with my mom's ring?

473
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:03,246
Listen, your dad asked
me to steal this ring.

474
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,881
He wants to claim it
on insurance.

475
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:07,583
Everybody wins...
except the insurance company,

476
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:09,051
but they're a bunch of
crooks, anyway, so...

477
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:13,256
(wry chuckle)
You're smooth.

478
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,592
But my Dad would never waste
his money on insurance.

479
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:19,362
- Want to know why?
- Why?

480
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:22,598
'Cause he knows
that no one in their right mind

481
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:29,672
would ever think
of stealing from him. He's really mean.

482
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:33,476
You could get in, like, so much
trouble if my father caught you.

483
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,613
Okay. Well, why
don't we just, uh,
take that back

484
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,582
and then we'll just act like
none of this never happened?

485
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,484
I have a better idea.

486
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:44,554
I let you walk out of here
with this ring in your pocket,

487
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:48,424
and my dad never
finds out who took it.

488
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:53,162
And?
What's the catch?

489
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:58,768
You're really cute,
you know that?

490
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:00,469
So are you.

491
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,574
(door opens)

492
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:05,975
What is that?

493
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:07,143
(groans)

494
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:11,013
That'd be my dad.
Go. The window. Wait.

495
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:16,786
Forgot something.
I'll take an IOU, okay?

496
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,333
Jonah, you missed
a wild afterparty.

497
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,802
These two Lhasa Apsos
got into the liquor.

498
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:36,639
Long story short,
don't ever go in that pool.

499
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:38,741
(sighing):
I wasn't much
in the partying mood

500
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:42,511
after Ella and I had a
a Thrilla-in-Manila-size throwdown.

501
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:45,381
What happened?

502
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:50,753
So, I went and talked
to that guy from Sony.

503
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:53,756
He flat-out tells me,
like, I have a serious shot

504
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,690
at getting this writing gig.

505
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:56,892
Nice.
Yeah. With Seth Rogen.

506
00:27:56,927 --> 00:28:00,296
- Big deal? Huge deal.
- Right. So, I'm stoked.

507
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,732
I'm on cloud nine.
I just want to find Ella

508
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:06,168
and tell her and celebrate.
I finally find her,

509
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:08,504
and she's in the back
of the party with some guy,

510
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:13,209
- like, all over him.
- Totally flirtin with him.

511
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:15,511
Can I give you some,
uh, unsolicited advice?

512
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:16,779
And you don't have
to answer that,

513
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:18,314
'cause I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

514
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:24,787
"Different"
doesn't even describe it.

515
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:26,622
Mm. Yeah. From the looks of it,

516
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:29,025
she seems, uh,
pretty unpredictable,

517
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:30,993
untamable, the
type of chick

518
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:33,829
who refuses to fit
into anyone's mold.

519
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:37,066
Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.
And, unless I'm wrong,

520
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,201
you had a pretty well-defined
thing going with Riley.

521
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:40,536
Living together,

522
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,105
totally committed and
totally comfortable.

523
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,941
And?
And look where that got you.

524
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:48,711
See, with a girl like Ella,

525
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:51,213
you have to let go of
all preconceptions.

526
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:54,116
If you stop trying to make
her into someone she's not,

527
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:57,186
you may end up liking the
person she already is.

528
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,564
Heading out?

529
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:12,401
Yeah. Um,
I was just leaving.

530
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:16,405
To meet with Ben?
So, how is it,

531
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,375
working together?
Are you finding it stimulating?

532
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:22,445
It's fine.

533
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,747
Oh. I like what you're
trying to do with this place.

534
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:29,518
It's very, uh, youthful.
Um, thank you.

535
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,887
Anyway, I have
some information

536
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:33,522
that might interest
you and Ben.

537
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:37,727
- Great.
- What is it?

538
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,832
I love what the light
does to your hair.

539
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:52,575
Amanda... I'm...
I would have never done

540
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:55,177
anything like this
if I didn't think...

541
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:58,214
- Ben told me you two had broken up.
- We did.

542
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,850
Probably hours before
your little couch tango.

543
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,919
I bet he still had the
scent of my perfume on him.

544
00:30:03,954 --> 00:30:07,323
What a nice way to thank me
for getting you that job.

545
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:11,093
- Oh, Amanda, I'm sorry.
- You should be sorry.

546
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:12,862
You crossed a line.

547
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:15,364
I consider this a
personal affront.

548
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,633
And that's not something
I take lightly.

549
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,844
Oh, God...

550
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:38,655
- So? - "So"?

551
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:40,256
So?

552
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,559
They're photos
of two people kissing.

553
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:46,496
Two single, unattached people.
Ben, you know what this means.

554
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,732
Yeah. Means I should learn
to keep my drapes shut.

555
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,701
And that this shirt
makes me look paunchy.

556
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:54,637
Well, I'm glad you can be
so cavalier about this.

557
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:57,240
- I feel horrible.
- Why?

558
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,008
I can't believe I
was stupid enwugh

559
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:00,877
to convince myself
that this was okay.

560
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:04,113
I can't stand being someone
who goes after a man

561
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,915
and hurts another
woman in the process

562
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,217
You mean manda,nd being someone
my ex-girlfriend?after a man

563
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:12,488
Ex or not, I hurt her.
The very person who got me this job.

564
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:15,358
Look, Riley,

565
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:18,861
it's sweet
that you're being
so considerate,

566
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:21,197
but trust me, Amanda
will get over this.

567
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:24,534
Underneath that makeup
is a thin layer of
galvanized steel.

568
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:28,371
Let's just get past this.

569
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:32,008
- No. I'm sorry. 
- I can't.

570
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:36,245
Just feels too weird now.
Well, that's unfortunate.

571
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,782
Look, Ben, I really appreciate
everything you've done,

572
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:41,818
but maybe
there's somebody else

573
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:42,986
in your company
that I could work for.

574
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,955
I think that we would both
feel more comfortable.

575
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,326
No, Riley. I'm sorry,
but that's not the way I work.

576
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:55,632
I'm strictly hands-on.

577
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,106
Well, then, I guess I'll have to
find other sources of funding.

578
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,841
You're kidding.

579
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,609
And let all this good
work go to waste?

580
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:10,947
Nothing's going to waste.
One way or another,

581
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:13,683
I will make this school happen,

582
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:17,020
even if I have to raise
every penny by myself.

583
00:32:21,158 --> 00:32:23,259
(knocking at door)

584
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:35,338
Hello, Drew.

585
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:38,574
I thought, uh...
I thought this might help you

586
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:39,976
with your pent-up aggression.

587
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,878
Who said I have
pent-up aggression?

588
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:45,481
You're right. You don't have
pent-up aggression

589
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:49,152
It is right out there for
the whole world to see.

590
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:53,056
Kidding. You seemed
a little bummed at the hospital.

591
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,524
And throwing darts at my face,

592
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,760
well, if that doesn't
make you smile, what will?

593
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:02,565
Very thoughtful, thank you.

594
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,733
And knowing how
competitive you are,

595
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:04,901
you'll probably
kick David's butt

596
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:10,573
every time you play.
David and I broke up.

597
00:33:14,044 --> 00:33:17,914
- Wow.
- I, uh...

598
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:18,948
I didn't know that.

599
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:20,616
(grunts softly)

600
00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:21,584
That explains

601
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:26,889
- why you've been so...
- Yeah.

602
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:30,359
- All right, let's resort to plan B.
- Come on.

603
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:32,161
Where are we going?

604
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:36,799
I am not going to let you mope
around your apartment all night.

605
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:38,334
I am going to take you out

606
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:40,136
for a much-needed refreshment,
alcohol requireD.

607
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,838
- No.
- Hey.

608
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:42,772
Hey.

609
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:45,208
- Hi.
- Hey. Sorry.

610
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,410
I, uh, just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

611
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,245
Oh, she's going
to be much better

612
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,680
after she knocks a few back.

613
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:53,683
I didn't say that.
Do you want to join us?

614
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:55,017
No, that's okay.
You two go.

615
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:58,287
No. No, come with us.
Come with us.

616
00:33:58,322 --> 00:33:59,655
You can't leave me alone
with him.

617
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,492
I might actually
make her laugh.

618
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:03,960
Oh, no.
Who wants that?

619
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:08,531
Now, you sit down.
Read.

620
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:09,499
Wait.

621
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:10,833
- And you... - I'm coming.

622
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:14,003
...come help me choose
something to wear.

623
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:16,038
Can I watch?

624
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,004
(sighs softly)

625
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:15,565
(sighs)

626
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:32,748
- Hey.
- Hi.

627
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:34,317
Need a drink?
Can I have a Rum and Coke?

628
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:36,652
- Coming up.
- I guess you...

629
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:39,288
you got David's
mystery text, too, huh?

630
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:42,191
Yeah. He, Said,
"Good news.

631
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:43,693
Come to Coal.
Bring Ella."

632
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:48,631
- Guess he thinks we're a couple.
- He's always been a little slow.

633
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:52,368
Look, Jonah, I'm sorry, okay?
I tried.

634
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:54,470
But if it means
giving up who I am,

635
00:35:54,504 --> 00:35:56,239
then I guess I'm not
couple material.

636
00:35:56,273 --> 00:36:00,543
No his and hers towels.
No one drink, two straws.

637
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:01,711
No.

638
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,052
Guess a, uh, tandem bicycle's
totally out of the question?

639
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:19,996
Look...
To be honest with you,

640
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,432
I didn't exactly have
the best role model

641
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:25,534
when it came to relationships.

642
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:30,239
The closest I got
to seeing couplehood is

643
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:32,575
my mom giving some guy
a doughnut and a coffee

644
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,810
as he was leaving
the morning after.

645
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:37,413
And, you know, for me,

646
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:40,082
I'm on the other side
of the spectrum.

647
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,218
Like, I don't know how
not to be a couple.

648
00:36:42,252 --> 00:36:46,322
It's not that I'm against
the idea of somebody serious

649
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:48,391
being there, and,

650
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:50,993
well, I'd like that
"someone serious" to be you.

651
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:54,931
It's just...
Well, it's going to take some adjusting.

652
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,700
- Yeah.
- From both of us?

653
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:06,275
So...

654
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:12,581
- have you ever done it
in the MINI Cooper? - No.

655
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:14,784
I can't say that I have.

656
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:18,788
Well, then get ready
to do some adjusting.

657
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,190
(chuckles)

658
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:45,181
- Fantastic.
- You want your drink?

659
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:47,383
- Three margaritas, please.
- Is that cool?

660
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:48,417
Yeah.

661
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:50,286
But then what are you
guys going to drink?

662
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,221
- Finally, she's loosening up.
- Very funny.

663
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:53,556
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

664
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,225
Hey, Jonah, Ella.

665
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:58,160
Nice to see you guys
without the wagging tails.

666
00:37:58,161 --> 00:38:00,529
I was at this
A-list Hollywood party today

667
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:01,931
Nice to see yoand you should've
without the waggseen these two.

668
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:04,233
The thick of
all the glitz and glamour.

669
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:06,035
Yeah.

670
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:08,671
(sighs)

671
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:11,807
Um, do you have
any idea why David

672
00:38:11,842 --> 00:38:13,075
invited us down here?

673
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:17,079
No. Um, I'm not on
David's guest list tonight.

674
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:18,714
We're not seeing
each other anymore.

675
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:20,483
- What?
- What?

676
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:22,151
Why? You guys were
so happy together.

677
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:24,587
Well, it's just complicated.

678
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:26,555
JONAH: Okay.
DREW: How about a toast?

679
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,859
Okay.
Uh, to... new jobs...

680
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:33,029
new friends, and a new tenant

681
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,397
who can outdrink
all you amateurs.

682
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:37,266
(forced laugh) In your
wildest dreams, frat boy.

683
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:40,302
Nuh-uh.

684
00:38:40,337 --> 00:38:41,904
Your money's no good.

685
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:45,341
- Hey, man.
- What's up, Dave? - Hey.

686
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,877
So is this why you
texted us all down here?

687
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:50,146
So you could slip us cocktails
and then take advantage of us?

688
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,981
Something like that.

689
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:55,084
You guys are looking at
the future owner of Coal.

690
00:38:55,118 --> 00:38:58,254
- What?
- Oh, my God, congratulations.

691
00:38:58,288 --> 00:38:59,889
- That's amazing.
- Well done, David.

692
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,892
David, I like a comped drink
as much as the next girl,

693
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:06,762
but this place is pretty steep,
even for a trust fund baby.

694
00:39:06,797 --> 00:39:10,132
- How did you pull this off?
- Yeah, David. How?

695
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:14,303
- Well, I busted open the piggy bank.
- Spent every last penny.

696
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:16,472
And since it's only
a matter of time before

697
00:39:16,506 --> 00:39:19,108
Mason Davis hands the keys
over to me, tonight's on me.

698
00:39:19,142 --> 00:39:22,545
- That includes all of you.
- Cheers to you, man.

699
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,313
Thank you.

700
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,121
(sighs softly)

701
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:33,322
Miss me?

702
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:43,666
What are you doing here?

703
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,036
I saw your plates
when you were driving away.

704
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:52,374
I'm ready for my
IOU, David Breck.

705
00:39:59,116 --> 00:40:13,796
Let's go inside.
After you.
