1
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:02,768
Voila.
Oh, yes.

2
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,434
Thank you for the prescription, Dr. Feelgood.

3
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,768
Make sure you take it with food.

4
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,267
Hey, emergency at the hospital?

5
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,234
No. You see this? I'm not on call.

6
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:22,267
Glad to see you're finally
moving up from wine spritzers.

7
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:26,034
Ah, I am so psyched.

8
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:28,100
I can finally text with a full keyboard.

9
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:30,401
Very fancy.
Now that I'm working

10
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:32,200
at Coal, I need to be reachable

11
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:34,034
at, like, all times.

12
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,267
I hope Auggie's

13
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:37,334
not giving you too much of a hard time.

14
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,534
Hey, can I get your digits?

15
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,334
Yeah, sure.

16
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,933
Don't...

17
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,200
Water a little bit chilly?
Huh?

18
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:46,800
Those goose bumps are planetary.

19
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,634
Oh, I was shooting in the Valley
today where it was a punishing

20
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,167
hundred and five.

21
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,334
What's the latest Jonah Miller production?

22
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:57,034
Shooting Wilderness Scouts
planting trees in Balboa Park.

23
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,234
I'll send you a link.

24
00:02:58,267 --> 00:02:59,800
Hmm, that's okay.

25
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,900
Agriculture falls squarely in my no-click zone.

26
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:04,401
But I have a hookup for you.

27
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,167
Passes to a premiere. Hmm?

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,634
Kensington Squared,
the new Abby Douglas rom-com?

29
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:11,734
I'm already going.
Really?

30
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:14,067
Yeah, I got tickets from
the guy who wrote the film.

31
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,501
You know Zac McGalvan?

32
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:17,134
Yeah, we were roommates in film school.

33
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,034
Legends on the NYU beer pong circuit.

34
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,334
And now you get to watch

35
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,701
him walk the red carpet
with Abby Douglas? Ouch.

36
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,100
Too bad you have
to work the event.

37
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,933
You probably won't have time
to hang out with us.

38
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:29,034
Riley, the red carpet's not
the teacher's lounge.

39
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:32,100
But maybe we'll see each other
at the after-party.

40
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:33,800
If you're on the list.

41
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:41,668
Filter's clogged. The heater's broken.
What is this place

42
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,234
coming to, huh?
I'll have the pool boy
here in the morning.

43
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,967
Who are you?

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,701
My name's Jane Andrews.

45
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,034
I'm Sydney's sister.

46
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:51,200
I've inherited this building.

47
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:53,401
I'll be your new landlord.

48
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:59,601
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

49
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,200
I'm sorry about your sister.

50
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:22,668
But, um...

51
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:25,367
Well, since you are the new landlord,

52
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:27,634
I wanted to talk to you about
moving into this apartment

53
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,267
as soon as it's available.

54
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,867
You must be Ella.

55
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,234
My sister mentioned

56
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,000
your social grace.

57
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,501
Oh.

58
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:39,501
I didn't know you two talked.

59
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:40,833
Yeah, Syd called me right around the time

60
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:42,467
the two of you had your falling out.

61
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,634
I could tell you were

62
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:44,967
pretty angry with her.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,067
And how exactly could you "tell"?

64
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,900
Oh, Syd sent me your e-mails.

65
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,601
You know, the ones where you made those

66
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:55,367
crazy threats against her.

67
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:58,134
Uh, are you...

68
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,267
insinuating that I had something
to do with Syd's death?

69
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,367
No, of course not.

70
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,100
I know you loved her, deep down.

71
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:08,267
I have nothing to hide, Jane.

72
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:10,000
I didn't murder Sydney.

73
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,000
Why would you?

74
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,167
I mean, you have way too much going for you.

75
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,301
Syd said your career's really taken off.

76
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,434
Isn't...

77
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,567
Abby Douglas a client of yours?

78
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,200
Why do you ask?

79
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,601
I just think she's so adorable.

80
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:27,367
Doesn't she have a movie coming out?

81
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:30,134
I saw something on TV about a premiere.

82
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,634
Kensington Squared.
You want tickets?

83
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:32,668
I'll get you a pair.

84
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,601
Actually, what I want is...

85
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,301
God, I probably shouldn't

86
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:38,833
even ask, but what the hell.

87
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:42,034
It would be a dream to see Abby Douglas

88
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,867
walk the red carpet in one of my dresses

89
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,601
Didn't your boutique burn down

90
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:49,367
and your entire collection with it?

91
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,634
It did.

92
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,434
But I'm ready for a comeback.

93
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,100
And I know that whatever
Abby Douglas wears will be

94
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,501
the talk of the fashion world
the next day.
You know what, Jane?

95
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,768
You're giving me a little
bit of short notice here...

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,768
I know. I get it.

97
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,567
An important publicist like you,

98
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,200
I mean, you've got a reputation to protect.

99
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:05,067
Don't worry.

100
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,401
All those e-mails that you sent my sister,

101
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,734
I'll do my best to keep them
away from the police.

102
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,567
Where are we with the Kensington premiere?

103
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:28,100
I'm working on the last sample right now.

104
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:31,234
Tempura'd cod with julienned bell peppers

105
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,067
and a tartar sauce.

106
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,034
This isn't on our menu.

107
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,000
I know, but I thought since,

108
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:40,100
you know, the movie
takes place in England...
You thought?

109
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,067
If I promote you, it's to run the kitchen,

110
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,601
not dream up new dishes.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes, Chef.

112
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:54,234
Well, which knife do you use
to cut the tension in here?

113
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,034
I'd need a Ginsu for that.

114
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,267
What's up?

115
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,401
We got a new landlord.
I was going to fill you in

116
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,501
on the drama, but it looks like you've had your take.

117
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,134
Yeah, Marcello put me in charge of the kitchen

118
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,334
for this premiere party, and four of our servers quit.

119
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,833
I can help you out.

120
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:10,334
You?

121
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:11,467
David...

122
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,467
You've never had a job in your life.

123
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:16,501
And picking up trash on the side
of the road doesn't count.

124
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:17,701
Dude, come on, man.

125
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,234
Let me help you.

126
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:25,067
Okay, look...

127
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,567
I know I wasn't the best friend

128
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:28,034
once Syd and I started hanging out.

129
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,867
I wish I could have done things
different, okay? Believe me.

130
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,301
Mike, drop the heat on those filets.

131
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:38,200
Excuse me?

132
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:41,167
Um, I heard that you guys
are looking for some help.

133
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
For one event.

134
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,867
Nothing full-time.

135
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,501
You won't be in the tip pool.

136
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,000
Sounds good.

137
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,734
What kind of experience do you have?

138
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,501
Um, I've worked all over town.

139
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:52,034
With Patina.

140
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,267
Aug and I go way back.

141
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,234
You can vouch for him, Auggie?

142
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,800
Yeah, yeah, he's good.

143
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,900
Thursday.

144
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,334
Be here at 4:00.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,100
Get started on the garlic... get it roasted up.

146
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,334
Thank you.

147
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,334
Sorry to bother you so late, Ms. Foster.

148
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:15,634
We just had a few questions.

149
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:16,933
No problem.

150
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,634
I like the lamp.
Thanks.

151
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:21,067
It's vintage.

152
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,267
You moved here two weeks ago?

153
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,134
Yes. And you provided

154
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,267
an Oregon driver's license
with your rental application?

155
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:28,800
That's where I'm from.

156
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,034
Right. Hey, uh,

157
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,768
do you mind if I put some clothes on real quick?

158
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,534
No. Of course.

159
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,000
So what's your guess? Actress?

160
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:43,434
Singer?

161
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:46,100
Future stripper?

162
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,167
Yeah, my money's on all the above.

163
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,067
Ms. Foster?

164
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,067
The window.

165
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,068
We got a runner.

166
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:21,567
Yeah. Yeah, I'm looking forward
to it, too, Toby.

167
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:24,567
Sure, I know where that hotel is.

168
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,401
Don't mind me.

169
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,668
Well, my rounds finish at 5:00,

170
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,534
so I'll meet you there about 6:00.

171
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:35,301
Okay, bye.

172
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,100
If I'm eavesdropping correctly,

173
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:39,434
you just scored yourself another date. Hardly.

174
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:41,167
It's drinks with a fellow intern.

175
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,467
Hot intern?

176
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:43,900
Married woman intern.

177
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,434
Yes, but is she hot?

178
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:50,434
Hey, what do you think of our new landlord?

179
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:53,467
Well, I can certainly see the family resemblance.

180
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:55,167
She's got Syd's fangs.

181
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,000
I just hope she doesn't jack up the rent.

182
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:59,668
I mean, I can barely afford this place as it is.

183
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,167
Even with a roommate

184
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,933
who fronts it for me every now and then.

185
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,933
Lauren,

186
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,067
I thought our domestic bliss

187
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,467
was based on more than my rent subsidies.

188
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,401
It is. Of course it is.

189
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:11,933
I'm just hoping we can stay together

190
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:13,634
till my tuition payments leave the nest.

191
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,000
Nothing.

192
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,867
I love this shot. Look at this.

193
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:32,933
creating a frame within the frame.

194
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,967
Awesome.

195
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,267
Would you look at me right now?

196
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm sitting here editing

197
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,067
merit badge videos while Zac McGalvan,

198
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,967
who came to me freshman year

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,900
begging for help on his first
script, is blowing up.

200
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,601
How did Zac

201
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,267
get his big break, anyways?

202
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,768
He was caddying at the Riviera,

203
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,467
and one of his regulars just happened

204
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,367
to be none other than Charlie Kitsis.

205
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,668
Remember, my references are
iCarly and The Backyardigans.

206
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,668
He's, this big, huge,

207
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,434
powerful  ber-agent.

208
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,800
Zac got him to read his script,

209
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,234
Charlie loved it, got this director,

210
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,701
threw Abby Douglas in it,

211
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,867
bam-- there ya go, Kensington Squared.

212
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,467
All from being at the right golf
course at the right time.
That's it.

213
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:12,534
Wow.

214
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,367
Right. Unbelievable.

215
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,200
You know, I think I'm going to start playing golf.

216
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:17,900
I always wanted to jet around

217
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,301
in one of those little golf carts.

218
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:21,334
I'd be really good if I could play.

219
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:25,267
That's a great shot of Abby.

220
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,301
Who's the photographer?

221
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,401
Who cares?

222
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,301
I was the one with the brains at the shoot

223
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:30,833
that took her out of that floral nightmare

224
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:33,567
and put her into this lovely Burberry scarf.

225
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:35,100
Oh, what would Abby ever do without Ella Simms?

226
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,601
Oh.

227
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,100
I hope you're as equally

228
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:40,967
detailed-obsessed for tomorrow's red carpet.

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,100
A little issue on transpo.

230
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,334
Abby wants to go with the gas-guzzling limo

231
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,634
and I told her to go with the stretch hybrid.

232
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:47,501
She won't budge.

233
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:48,501
Who cares about the ride?

234
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:49,867
What is she wearing?

235
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,800
Ah, we settled on this amazing
frock by Jane Andrews.

236
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,634
We actually have a fitting later today.
Jane who?

237
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:54,768
Andrews.

238
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,668
Never heard of her. Well, everybody else has.

239
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:58,967
She is making a huge splash on the Hollywood scene.

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,234
I loved that Proenza Schouler
she got fitted for last week.

241
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,634
No, no, no.

242
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:05,668
The Andrews is brilliant.

243
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,967
Look, Abby has already seen the
dress, and she adores it.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,734
Ella, if you're having trouble
connecting with A-list designers

245
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:14,800
why don't you have me give you Marc Jacobs's cell?

246
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,067
We're in a capture-the-flag league together.

247
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,067
Caleb.
What?

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,401
Oh, wait, let me guess.

249
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:22,933
Andrews is another one of your
"undiscovered" superstars?

250
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,467
Well, it seemed to work out pretty well

251
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,768
with the music video, didn't it?

252
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,334
Okay.

253
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,601
You better hope that lightning
strikes twice, though.

254
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:31,933
Because you embarrass Abby Douglas,

255
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,367
you embarrass WPK.

256
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,434
Oh, no, no, no.

257
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,833
The only one who will be embarrassed is you... 

258
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,434
when this dress ends up in Vogue's Most Wanted.

259
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:47,401
I don't know. I'm lukewarm.

260
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,200
Look, my chest looks like a landing pad.

261
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:50,301
I'm Abby Douglas,

262
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,534
not Abby Breslin.

263
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,100
What happened to that dress
you found last week?

264
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:56,167
Oh, you look way hotter in this, Ab.

265
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,334
What if you wore a bra?

266
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:00,234
Bras are for breeders.

267
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:04,134
Okay, let's see...

268
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,401
Here, I have an idea.

269
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,467
Oh, good news.

270
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,701
I ran this dress by the editor of W.

271
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,000
She's holding a full page
for you in an upcoming issue.

272
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:12,800
No way. Mm-hmm.

273
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,234
That'll be like my thickest glossy yet.

274
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,234
Okay, all set. You can change.

275
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:20,267
I'm worried about her.

276
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,401
She's just a little nervous.

277
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,067
The dress is perfect for her.

278
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,967
Yeah, that's easy for you
to say, when you're not

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,100
the one being trotted out in
front of 200 flashbulbs.

280
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:32,501
Hmm, I just wouldn't want any
of this to go badly...

281
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,634
for both our sakes.

282
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:36,867
Tell me I'm getting waxed for this thing.

283
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,334
Right after your facial.

284
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,534
I'm so sorry.

285
00:13:58,567 --> 00:13:59,933
I didn't mean to scare you.

286
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,434
What are you doing here?

287
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,301
I just want to talk.

288
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:08,634
I know this is strange, but I need your help.

289
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,933
You were in the courtyard today.

290
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,534
Who are you?

291
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,634
My name's Violet, Violet Foster.

292
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,067
And the thing is, is...

293
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,534
I'm Sydney's daughter.

294
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,467
My God.

295
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:27,301
You look just like her.

296
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,634
I knew something was going on with Syd

297
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,867
right before she left college.

298
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,234
Honey, why are you here?

299
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,067
The police.

300
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:41,734
I came to L.A. to find my mom.

301
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:43,800
But when the cops came,

302
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,601
I got scared.

303
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,567
Violet, why are the police after you?

304
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,534
I'm in trouble.

305
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,367
I came to you because you seem so nice.

306
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:56,067
You're the only family I have.

307
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,867
Of course.

308
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,301
Why don't you sit down?

309
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:13,501
Um, I'll make you a pot of chamomile.

310
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,768
And we can talk about everything.

311
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,100
This is Los Angeles Homicide.

312
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,434
Do you have a question for us?

313
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,301
Yes, Detective. What is it?

314
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,034
I'm calling to report a fugitive.

315
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,467
A fugitive? Do you have a name?

316
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:34,468
Her name is Violet Foster.

317
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:42,633
We love you!
One more, please! One more!

318
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,434
Have a good night.

319
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,934
Thank you.

320
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,967
Here we go. Oh, man.
Why are they taking my picture?

321
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,934
I'm surprised more celebrities
aren't blind. Oh, my gosh.

322
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:04,167
Yeah, well, you know what, you better get used to this,

323
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:06,034
because someday soon, this will all be for your movie.

324
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,900
Oh, yeah, I'd actually have to sell something first.

325
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,434
That would help.
Only a matter of time.

326
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,900
Yeah, the question is, how long
is a matter of time, Riley?

327
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,034
I mean, let's face it:

328
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,800
we didn't just get to L.A., you know.

329
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,633
It's been like a year and a half.

330
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,500
Well, you know what?

331
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:19,867
Maybe it'll take years.

332
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,034
But you've got the talent.

333
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,201
And I will be right here by your side

334
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:24,334
as long as it takes.

335
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:27,267
You always say the right thing.

336
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:29,401
VIPs only. Off the red carpet.

337
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:30,368
Let's go.

338
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:31,667
Sorry. My bad.

339
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,401
Ooh.

340
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,301
I had no idea that the seating arrangements

341
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:45,700
took so many experts.

342
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:49,134
You sure you're old enough
to be playing with lighters?

343
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,967
Well, Auggie was a little shorthanded,

344
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:52,867
so I'm helping out.

345
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,234
Love the bromance, David, but really?

346
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,067
You working hourly? Ha.

347
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,001
Yeah, I owed him a solid.

348
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,401
Or three.

349
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,567
So I hear your starlet's showing up

350
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,633
in a Jane Andrews dress.
Mm-hmm.

351
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,767
Hope you're getting something
sweet out of that deal.

352
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,934
She's our new landlord.

353
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:13,101
Just showing some neighborly
generosity, that's all.

354
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:15,834
Yeah, well, your giving spirit's
starting to make me wonder.

355
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,667
First you throw me an alibi,

356
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,434
and now you roll over for Jane.

357
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,334
This is not the Ella that I know.

358
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,334
Okay... I'll be honest.

359
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:31,134
Jane has a little bit more than
just the keys to the courtyard.

360
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,633
She's got Sydney's private files, her e-mails.

361
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,301
She keeps saying that at any moment

362
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,368
she could embarrass me in front of everyone.

363
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,001
Since when do you care
about being embarrassed?

364
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:40,334
I don't.

365
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:43,134
But I do care about being falsely accused of murder.

366
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,500
Look, the last thing I need right now

367
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:45,900
is to have to defend myself

368
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,633
against a crime I never committed.

369
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,800
Ugh. Chaos is calling.

370
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,034
Well, I'm off to the red carpet.

371
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:56,633
Hey, this place better be popping
by the time I get back.

372
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,134
And don't burn yourself.

373
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,633
(indistinct conversations)

374
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,434
Good evening. May I help you?

375
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:10,867
Hey, can I get a sparkling water, please?

376
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,067
Of course.

377
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,468
Let me get you a real drink.

378
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,633
Oh, no, thank you. It's fine.

379
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,700
Somebody's going to end up
paying for it, right?

380
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm already here.

381
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,001
Excuse me?

382
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:26,800
Money's money.

383
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:29,533
Does it really matter
whose wallet it comes from?

384
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,434
I have no idea what you're talking about.

385
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:37,201
Right.

386
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,234
My mistake.

387
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,867
Mm-hmm.

388
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,967
Do you see him?
No, no, I'm...

389
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,500
I don't know.

390
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,334
I figured he... he would... 

391
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:02,434
Wait, there he is. There he is. Zac. Zac.
Oh, yeah, yeah!

392
00:19:02,468 --> 00:19:05,201
Jonah!

393
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,633
Millah the killah. How are you?

394
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,834
How's it going, man?

395
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:08,900
Awesome.

396
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:10,101
This is huge.

397
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,167
I know, right? Insane.

398
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,234
Insane. I'm so happy for you.

399
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:14,434
Oh, thanks, man.

400
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:15,533
Hey, Riles.

401
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:16,867
Hi. Good to see you.

402
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,533
So, uh, what's going on, dude?

403
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,234
I've spent the last year in this crazy bubble.

404
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:21,301
But what about you?

405
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,401
I...

406
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:23,700
I...

407
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:25,101
you know, I could go on forever.

408
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:26,468
Uh, I finished a new cut

409
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,134
of Living in Reverse a few weeks back.

410
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,201
Dude, you sold that bad boy?

411
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,867
Uh, not exactly.

412
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,867
Jonah just turned down

413
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,101
a six-figure offer from Gary Sarling.

414
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,001
What?

415
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:36,633
Are you serious?

416
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:37,767
It wasn't the right situation.

417
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,934
That is raw.

418
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,201
Dude, I'll be doing Abby Douglas chick flicks

419
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:44,934
for the rest of my life, while
you're up there snagging Oscars.

420
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,234
I don't think so.

421
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,267
Hey, so if I drop anything,

422
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,834
the five-second rule applies, right?

423
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:57,900
Yeah, I'd drop you.

424
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,633
Stampede's about to hit.

425
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,934
I hope my kitchen's ready.

426
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,633
We'll have five apps ready to pass.

427
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,334
Oh, what are you doing here?

428
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:07,700
Kitchen staff only.

429
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:08,934
We were short-staffed, Chef,

430
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:11,001
so I just asked him to help out with the crostini.

431
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,934
Just trying to help out, sir.

432
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,234
Show time, people. Let's move.

433
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,967
David, will you grab that knife
from over there, please?
Yeah.

434
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,201
David.

435
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,800
Thank you.
Yeah.

436
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,067
Hey, Jane!

437
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,368
I can't... you...

438
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:40,867
Really bad rec... here.

439
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,533
What's up?

440
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,368
Abby's called me four times already.

441
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,134
Suddenly it's too tight in the hips,

442
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,167
too loose everywhere else.

443
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,600
Oh, it's okay.

444
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:50,934
It's just a little actor's indecision. It'll pass.

445
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:53,267
Well, I'm going to drive over to the theater.

446
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,700
No, Jane, save your gas.

447
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:55,800
I'll take care of it.

448
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,567
No, it's too important.

449
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,067
I'm headed there now.

450
00:20:59,101 --> 00:21:00,934
And, Ella, I really hope
she's not always this difficult.

451
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,334
Say that again.

452
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:06,734
This isn't the last time
Abby will be photographed

453
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,334
in one of my dresses, Ell.

454
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,767
We're partners now.

455
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:27,101
Oh, no.

456
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:30,500
Your worst putt is always
better than your worst chip.

457
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:31,600
Really?
Hey.

458
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:32,800
Oh... sorry about that.

459
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,633
The on-ramp to the men's room... totally jammed.

460
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:36,967
Um, this is my fiance, Jonah.

461
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,767
Jonah, this is Charlie Kitsis.

462
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,533
Of course. Yeah, I mean, you represent

463
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,067
every bomb director in Hollywood.

464
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,567
Oh, you're a brave man,

465
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,401
marrying a girl who loves golf so much.

466
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:50,434
Yes. Yeah, I like to live on the edge.

467
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:53,267
The links are where I go when
I need a break from the wife.

468
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:54,368
It's added an extra ten years

469
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:55,867
onto my marriage, easy.
Really?

470
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,368
Oh, well, Jonah's more into Mario Golf.

471
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,900
I'll probably be the one hiding out

472
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,101
at Rustic Canyon.

473
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:01,167
Best public course in L.A.

474
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:02,867
I know!
Hey, Charlie!

475
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,934
Hey! Come here for a second, meet
somebody, would ya?

476
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,134
So, since when are you Tiger Woods?

477
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,301
A little Google goes a long way.

478
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,067
You are fantastic.

479
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,767
Um, I'll be right back.

480
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,867
Um, she'll be right back.

481
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,867
Uh...

482
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,567
She's very easily distracted.

483
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,734
Well, she's beautiful.

484
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,867
Don't lose her, speaking as a professional here.

485
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,734
Your woman is the best agent you'll ever have.

486
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:29,934
You mean, because she knows so much about golf?

487
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:32,434
She told me about that backwards film of yours,

488
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:33,500
Living in Reverse.

489
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,468
It sounds very cool.

490
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,967
She told you about...
Thank you.

491
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,134
I'm so sorry. I have to run.
You what?

492
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,001
You're not sticking around?
I can't.

493
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:41,567
There's an after-party.
I can get you guys

494
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,301
on the list for it.
Really?

495
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:45,533
That's really cool of you.
Thank you so much. That's...

496
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:46,600
No, I really can't.

497
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,500
Where could you possible
have to go right now?

498
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,134
Jonah, Violet's in jail.

499
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,067
Riley, come on.

500
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:00,201
Are you seriously going to leave
me here, just like that?

501
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:01,834
Jonah, she's in jail.

502
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,201
Okay, and?

503
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:04,800
Is that a bad thing?

504
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,567
Did you ever consider the possibility

505
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,334
that jail is exactly where that floater belongs?

506
00:23:08,368 --> 00:23:10,834
Okay, I know she's a little different,

507
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,234
but that doesn't mean she's dangerous.

508
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,167
I mean, she was just arrested
because she got spooked.

509
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:17,001
Oh, sure. I mean, innocent people

510
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,201
always run from the cops, right?

511
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:19,700
Riley!

512
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:21,334
This is Charlie Kitsis.

513
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,468
This is huge.

514
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,600
And he likes you. He likes you even more

515
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,867
because you are going to make him very rich.

516
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,067
Okay, now, get back in there
and kick some butt, okay?

517
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:30,067
I'll be home in a few hours.

518
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:31,234
Riley.

519
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:32,734
You're not her mother.

520
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:33,867
She's not even our friend.

521
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,101
She's our neighbor

522
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:37,633
and she's all by herself
in county jail, terrified.

523
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,301
I have to help her, Jonah.

524
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,767
All right. I love you.

525
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,034
Love you, too.

526
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:53,533
If you have nothing to hide,

527
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,334
then why jump out your bathroom window?

528
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:58,101
I'm... scared of the police.

529
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:00,267
I bet.

530
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:03,500
Your fingerprints

531
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:05,101
match the ones we pulled off this lanyard

532
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:06,667
we found at the crime scene.

533
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,368
It was a gift.

534
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:11,934
For approving your rental application?

535
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:19,800
I didn't want her to freak out when I told her.

536
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,201
Told her what?

537
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,700
That I was her daughter.

538
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:30,767
But she did freak out. Didn't she?

539
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,734
Are you kidding?

540
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,401
She was so happy.

541
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:40,167
She gave me the biggest hug.

542
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:43,101
We finally got to know each other.

543
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:45,633
It was the best week of my life.

544
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,934
Till she was murdered.

545
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:50,767
Tell me something, Violet.

546
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,401
You ever been arrested?

547
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:54,468
No, sir.

548
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,700
Then why are you so afraid
of the police?

549
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,401
Unbelievable.

550
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:23,800
Stood up?

551
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,800
Look, I didn't mean to insult you earlier.

552
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,101
I was looking forward to meeting someone.

553
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,067
And she blew me off.

554
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:33,167
So, that's my excuse

555
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,967
for acting like an idiot.

556
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,267
I'm Victor.

557
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:40,600
I'm Lauren.

558
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:41,834
Well...

559
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:46,167
I can't say I've ever asked this before, Lauren,

560
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:49,001
but are you working tonight?

561
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,967
Yeah.

562
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,867
Actually, I am.

563
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,800
Yes, Mr. Mancini, I've been following him.

564
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:13,468
He's really working the event.

565
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,067
Nothing suspicious, but I'll keep on him.

566
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:17,533
Bye.

567
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:21,101
Ask my father if he'd like a tie
or a lawsuit for his birthday.

568
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:22,700
Excuse me?

569
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

570
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,767
You tell my father if he
ever has me followed again,

571
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,201
I'm not only going to come after him,

572
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:33,967
I'm going to come after you. You got it?

573
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:36,001
What are you doing?

574
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:37,500
Auggie, I'm sorry.

575
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:39,167
I was just going to ask
your friend the same thing.

576
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:41,834
Get out of my restaurant

577
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,434
right now, before I call the cops.

578
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,567
Now!

579
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,234
Good friend you got there, Auggie. Nice.

580
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,034
Oh, thank God.

581
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,234
Let's go. Red carpet time.

582
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:04,867
There's a torn seam.

583
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,533
No problem. I'll fix it right now.

584
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,434
I don't want it fixed!

585
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:10,134
I want another dress.

586
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:11,834
You look beautiful.

587
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,533
Look at my arms in this thing.

588
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:16,334
Just cut them off already.
And my shoes? Where are they?

589
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,767
These were like, $1,000, and they hurt.

590
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:22,434
Look, I'm sorry, Elle, but you really need

591
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:24,101
to fix this.

592
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:25,434
Or I'm out of here.

593
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:31,800
Ella, say something.

594
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,468
Honey...

595
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,301
There's a lot riding on this
night. Not just for me.

596
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:39,600
The Proenza.

597
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:40,734
It's in my trunk.

598
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:43,001
Get out of that and I'll be back in a minute.

599
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,301
Ah, I love you!

600
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:49,101
Ella, do you realize what you just did?

601
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,267
My clients always come first.

602
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:55,268
I sure hope it was worth it.

603
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:05,351
Is there a shoe out there?

604
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,484
No.

605
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,351
You just about set?

606
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:16,451
Yeah. Just one last thing, and I'm gone.

607
00:28:16,484 --> 00:28:18,084
What's that?

608
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:22,917
Um, the... the money?

609
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,718
Excuse me?

610
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,484
This was just

611
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:29,618
a friendly encounter
between two consenting adults.

612
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:33,618
No, you asked me if I was working tonight

613
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:35,451
and I... I told you I was.

614
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:39,150
And then we agreed on an amount, so...

615
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,718
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

616
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,284
How dare you do this?
Just pay me.

617
00:28:49,317 --> 00:28:50,517
No, thank you.

618
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:52,618
Hey, give me what you owe me.

619
00:28:55,783 --> 00:28:58,317
I don't owe you a damn thing.

620
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:20,150
Aug.

621
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:21,551
What are you still doing here?

622
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:23,417
Thought you'd be on your third drink by now.

623
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,584
Just wanted to make sure that you're all right.

624
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:29,317
Look, Marcello can't hold you responsible for that.

625
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,984
Yeah, well, he can, and he is.

626
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,451
I am responsible.

627
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:34,750
But then again, I'm not sure
that's a concept you understand.

628
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:36,817
I mean, what did this guy do to you, anyway,

629
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,017
that was worth my career?

630
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:42,883
I hit on his girlfriend last week, and the guy

631
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,783
came after me, all right? The guy's bad news.

632
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,050
Bad news, huh?

633
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,117
Yeah, I'll just explain that to Marcello

634
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,783
and maybe he won't fire me tomorrow.

635
00:29:49,817 --> 00:29:52,417
Screw Marcello. You run this place,

636
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,517
and he knows it.

637
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:55,484
Doesn't matter, David. He's my boss.

638
00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:57,817
See, my world doesn't work like yours.

639
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,817
You've never had to live

640
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,584
with consequences.

641
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:03,050
Look, I was trying to help you.

642
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,284
All right?

643
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:08,017
Didn't you try to help Sydney?

644
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,384
The night she died?

645
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:25,783
How was Charlie Kitsis?

646
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:28,484
One of the biggest sharks in the business.

647
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,883
Who you managed to totally win over.

648
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:35,217
He wants me to show him my film.

649
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,284
Jonah Adam Miller,

650
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:37,718
that's incredible.

651
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,217
Well, then he ditched me
for Ashton Kutcher.

652
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:42,551
But still, him seeing my movie is...

653
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:43,718
it's massive.

654
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,384
It's amazing.

655
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:47,584
You... you are amazing.

656
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:53,783
Is she back there?

657
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:55,950
Yeah, she's in the shower.

658
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,684
In our bathroom?

659
00:30:58,651 --> 00:30:59,684
We have scissors in there.

660
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:01,351
She was scared to be alone.

661
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:02,551
Wait. What happened?

662
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,484
Did you have to, like, bail her out or something?

663
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:06,517
Okay.

664
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:08,351
How much did that cost?
Like, hundreds of dollars?

665
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:11,917
It's a bond. We get it back
when she shows up to court.

666
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,883
Oh, that's great. Good.

667
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,050
'Cause so far, she's showing herself

668
00:31:15,084 --> 00:31:16,284
to be incredibly dependable.

669
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:21,551
Jonah, there's something
you should know about Violet.

670
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,883
I think it might help you understand.

671
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:25,783
Okay.

672
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,584
She's Sydney's daughter.

673
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:31,351
I'm sorry. What?!

674
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:33,883
Yeah. She got to L.A, had a joyful reunion

675
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,050
with her mother, and then

676
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,417
had to go through the trauma of finding her dead.

677
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:40,317
I mean, I'm not surprised she's a little shaken up.

678
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:43,883
Did you just tell me Violet is Sydney's daughter?

679
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:46,117
I'm not a little fuzzy from my two rum and cokes?

680
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,750
They wanted to get to know each other better

681
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,150
before they told people.

682
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:53,351
Riley, in our own little personal slasher flick here,

683
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:54,917
this is the part where the audience stands up

684
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,050
and starts screaming, "Um, hello?

685
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,618
She's the killer!"

686
00:32:04,317 --> 00:32:05,584
I ran from the police

687
00:32:05,618 --> 00:32:08,217
because of what happened back home.

688
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:11,084
My parents who adopted me

689
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:13,050
weren't exactly Brad and Angelina.

690
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:16,351
Did they hurt you?

691
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,551
I didn't sleep, like, ever.

692
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:23,184
I was too worried my door would open.

693
00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:25,917
All I ever wanted to do was leave.

694
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,850
I just couldn't manage to save up enough.

695
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:31,384
Then I tracked down Sydney.

696
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,084
I had to take off.

697
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:37,718
And I took some of their money with me.

698
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,684
That's why you ran from Detective Rodriguez.

699
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:46,050
This is my home now,

700
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:48,251
and even though my mom isn't here,

701
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:51,351
this is the only place I can
sleep without being afraid.

702
00:32:51,384 --> 00:32:53,551
I couldn't let them

703
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:55,817
take me back to the Corvallis police.

704
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:01,284
It's okay, Violet. It's all gonna be okay.

705
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:03,718
Here.

706
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:21,084
Hotel security. I need a word with you, ma'am.

707
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:22,551
I'm sorry. I'm in a rush.

708
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,750
Wait. Did you really think that
you could just walk into a bar

709
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:27,184
at this hotel and solicit customers?

710
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:28,517
I don't know what you're talking about.

711
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,651
Okay, this way, please.
The police should be here soon.

712
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:31,783
Let's go. Walk! Come on.

713
00:33:31,817 --> 00:33:33,017
Look, please, I was just meeting someone.

714
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,384
I've got texts in my phone.

715
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:37,084
I can show them to you if you want. She's with me.

716
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:42,117
Well, no one here had seen her
before, Miss Madison.

717
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,651
No, no, no, I know. It was
a miscommunication on my part.

718
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,184
I apologize.

719
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:53,817
I don't know what just happened, but thank you.

720
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,451
Well, let me take a guess. Craigslist? Chat rooms?

721
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:04,384
No, um, I'm not actually what you think I am.

722
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,917
And...

723
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,618
I think I should just go.

724
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:09,950
Yes, you should go.

725
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:13,150
But just know the only reason
why I helped you out

726
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,184
is because I was once in your shoes.

727
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:19,417
I don't think we're the same size.

728
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:22,618
Okay, the only person you're fooling is yourself,

729
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:23,984
and that always ends up badly.

730
00:34:24,017 --> 00:34:27,517
So, if you ever come back here
to work again, I assure you

731
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,783
hotel security will be the least of your worries.

732
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,317
Do you understand?

733
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:52,950
Shouldn't you be bobbing for olives

734
00:34:52,984 --> 00:34:53,917
in your after-party martini?

735
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,417
Change of plans.

736
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:59,718
I canceled the red carpet
close-ups for Jane's dress.

737
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,618
Won't that be the shot heard
around the courtyard?

738
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:05,184
It doesn't matter.

739
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:08,050
After I spread the word that
Abby Douglas hated her dress,

740
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:11,417
Jane's samples won't be fit to mop floors.

741
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:14,817
Yeah. I don't know if that's gonna be enough

742
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,017
to stop whatever she has planned for you.

743
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,017
Let me take care of it.

744
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,384
You?

745
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:24,850
Yeah. Jane was married to my father.

746
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:26,883
The skeletons won't take long to find.

747
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,783
I'll bury her.

748
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:33,117
Wow.

749
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:36,417
I don't think anyone's ever offered

750
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:38,750
to destroy an enemy of mine before.

751
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:41,817
David...

752
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,451
That's almost...

753
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:44,883
romantic.

754
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:48,451
Or we could say that it's all
about the thrill of victory.

755
00:35:48,484 --> 00:35:50,384
Go with romantic...

756
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,050
Let's go work on that alibi.

757
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:19,317
Word of advice:

758
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,517
blackmail's not the best way

759
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:21,950
to ingratiate yourself to the tenants.

760
00:36:21,984 --> 00:36:25,050
Blackmail?

761
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:28,317
What are you talking about, David?

762
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:30,017
Ella offered to do something nice for me,

763
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,451
and, well, in the end,

764
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:34,117
I guess "nice" just isn't in her.

765
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,384
Jane, I know all about you

766
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:39,484
and your desperate attempts to get ahead.

767
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:41,417
It's sad, really.

768
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:43,251
And after everything that you put into it,

769
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,651
you torched your warehouse and clothing line

770
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:48,618
just so you could collect insurance money?

771
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:51,150
And where did you ever get that idea?

772
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:52,384
From my dad.

773
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:55,317
I came across a certain computer file he has on you.

774
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:56,317
The next time

775
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:58,084
that you divorce a paranoid psychopath,

776
00:36:58,117 --> 00:37:00,750
you might want to change your online passwords.

777
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:04,584
I have nothing to hide.
The fire was electrical.

778
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:07,351
Oh, so it's okay if I call
your insurance company, right?

779
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,017
Or better yet, the FBI?

780
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:16,618
You're making a huge mistake, David.

781
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,317
I still own this building.

782
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:20,417
And there are a lot of things I can do

783
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:21,684
to make your lives miserable.

784
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:29,184
I think we'll take our chances.

785
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:42,651
I just got off the phone with Mason.

786
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:45,184
He agrees with me:

787
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:47,984
you're not ready for a promotion.

788
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:49,384
Chef, I'm sorry

789
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,584
about what happened. I swear, that...

790
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:52,551
No, save your breath.

791
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:55,451
Maybe you'll get another shot
at running the kitchen someday,

792
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:58,117
but I kind of doubt it.

793
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:51,384
Hi, this is Lauren.

794
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:54,451
We met at the hotel the other
night. Do you have a minute?

795
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:56,551
Well, after our conversation last night,

796
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,551
I didn't think there was
anything further to discuss.

797
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,417
I want to talk to you about
future employment opportunities.

798
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,484
Hang on.

799
00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:09,517
Violet is the spawn of Sydney? Shh...

800
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:11,684
Oh, it's too perfect.
Freaky, right?

801
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:14,351
I mean, it makes sense.
The red hair, you know...
the schizo glint in her eye.

802
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:16,917
Did Sydney ever mention
having a child to you guys?
Yeah, she always said

803
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,584
how glad she was that she didn't have a kid

804
00:39:18,618 --> 00:39:20,217
because she'd be afraid the kid would have

805
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:21,618
the same kind of issues she had.

806
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,750
Shh. Coming this way.

807
00:39:23,783 --> 00:39:24,850
Hey, guys.

808
00:39:24,883 --> 00:39:26,150
Hello, Violet.
Hi!

809
00:39:26,184 --> 00:39:28,184
I was actually

810
00:39:28,217 --> 00:39:29,251
looking for you, Riley.

811
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,217
I made these

812
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:31,451
to thank you.
Aw...

813
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:33,451
I hope you like peanut butter.

814
00:39:33,484 --> 00:39:34,651
That's so sweet.

815
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:36,651
I love peanut butter. Thank you, Violet.

816
00:39:36,684 --> 00:39:38,684
Jonah's gonna love these.

817
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:40,284
Yes, definitely. Thank you.

818
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:41,517
You know what, Violet, sweetheart,

819
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:43,584
why don't you actually take the first one?

820
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:45,850
So you can show Jonah that
it isn't laced with cyanide.

821
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,184
Ella, that was... she was
kidding. That was a joke.

822
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:49,950
Of course she is joking.
Obvious...

823
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:51,150
I'll take 'em back.

824
00:39:51,184 --> 00:39:53,451
I'll, uh, I'll try one.

825
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:54,484
Me, too.

826
00:39:58,351 --> 00:39:59,783
Mm, Violet, this is good.

827
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,950
They're good.
Mm... Thanks.

828
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:05,317
Oh, no, no. I have to save my appetite

829
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:06,351
for the farmer's market.

830
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:07,783
David, are you coming with me?

831
00:40:07,817 --> 00:40:08,783
Absolutely.
Fantastic.

832
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:09,883
Good seeing you.

833
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:10,984
Yeah, 'cause we, um...

834
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:12,618
Yeah, thank you.

835
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:15,517
Bye.

836
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,484
By the way,

837
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:19,317
I got the oddest e-mail from Jane.

838
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:20,351
All's forgiven.

839
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,651
Really?
Uh-huh.

840
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,750
That was easy.

841
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:27,050
You know what could have changed her mind?

842
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:28,783
Maybe.

843
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:31,783
Wow. You weren't kidding
about the toxic waste buried

844
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:33,417
in your family history.

845
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:35,584
Just so we're clear...

846
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:36,251
Mm?

847
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:37,651
What you did...

848
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:38,917
amazing.

849
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,783
But last night?

850
00:40:40,817 --> 00:40:43,351
Total one-off.

851
00:40:45,618 --> 00:40:48,184
Why? You can't tell me
you didn't have a good time.

852
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:50,184
Oh, don't flatter yourself, David.

853
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:53,050
I always have a good time.

854
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,184
Rodriguez.

855
00:40:57,217 --> 00:41:00,417
I'm listening...

856
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:02,384
Who is this?

857
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,651
It doesn't matter.

858
00:41:03,684 --> 00:41:05,150
I thought you'd like to know...

859
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:07,850
Ella Simms had every reason
to want Sydney Andrews dead.

860
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,317
And I'll send you proof.

861
