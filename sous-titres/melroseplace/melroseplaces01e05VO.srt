<i>Previously on Melrose Place:</i>

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,501
Oh, my God. Sydney.

3
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:04,968
Did you know her pretty well?
I met her four years ago.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,434
<i>She was the one who convinced
me I could be a real chef.</i>

5
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:08,968
<i>JONAH:
She moves in and a week later
Sydney's dead.</i>

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,100
Coincidence?
Okay, the girl's a little weird.

7
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,934
<i>That doesn't make her
a murderer.</i>

8
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,934
We're getting married, guys.

9
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,934
<i>LAUREN:
All my life all I wanted
was to be a doctor.</i>

10
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,300
I went on this fancy dinner
with this guy.

11
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:20,767
He offered me $5,000
to have sex with him.

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,400
Junior publicist. Simms.

13
00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:28,901
Jonah, you are a hugely
talented filmmaker.

14
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:31,934
<i>AMIR: What's a rich boy like you
doing this stuff for anyway?</i>

15
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,133
Look, I need cash, okay?

16
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,767
<i>AMIR:
Bring me something I can move.</i>

17
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,000
What are you doing?

18
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:39,334
Get out of my restaurant right
now before I call the cops!

19
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,734
What did this guy do to you
anyway that was worth my career?

20
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:43,234
Look, I was trying
to help you.

21
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,400
Didn't you try to help Sydney
the night she died?

22
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:46,634
(phone ringing)

23
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,901
Rodriguez.
JANE:
I thought you'd like to know

24
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:51,834
Ella Simms had every reason
to want Sydney Andrews dead.

25
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,267
* I try it on

26
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,300
* I take it off*

27
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,400
* So what you got?

28
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,801
* Something about
boots and boys *

29
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,133
<i>* Boots and boys *</i>

30
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:04,934
* They bring me so much joy

31
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:06,968
<i>* Bring me joy *</i>

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,434
* I gotta say
I wear 'em both so pretty *

33
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:11,133
* As I walk in the city

34
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:12,701
* Watch out

35
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:15,000
* Boots and boys

36
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,567
<i>* Give me boots and boys *</i>

37
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,267
* Boots and boys

38
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,901
<i>* Boots and boys, boys *</i>

39
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,334
* Oh

40
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,267
* I'm keeping
quite the collection *

41
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,367
* Take nothing less
than perfection... *

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,200
Oh, Lor!

43
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:31,534
Happy birthday, El.

44
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:34,634
<i>Mm, she bakes, saves lives--
what can't the girl do?</i>

45
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,901
You want to make a wish before
we burn down the apartment?

46
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:38,367
Uh, no, no, Lauren.

47
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,267
You know I don't play
the wishing game.

48
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,267
If I want something...

49
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,868
I go out and get it.

50
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,634
Of course you do.
What was I thinking?

51
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,501
Last carb till my party
tomorrow night.

52
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:50,801
Mm, you are still
coming, right?

53
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:51,868
Yeah.

54
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,334
In scrubs and booties
if I have to be.

55
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,367
I love you.

56
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,167
Hey, I'll play with
both hands next time.

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,534
That might help you
a little bit.

58
00:01:58,567 --> 00:01:59,868
(laughs)
You won by a bucket.

59
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,300
Or should I say, a letter.

60
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,400
Auggie and I
play a real game.
Oh, whoa, whoa.

61
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:06,100
Horse is a very real game,
my friend.

62
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,767
And so is my left-handed
reverse layup.

63
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:08,801
ELLA:
Freeze.

64
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:10,534
Both of you.

65
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:12,734
Oh, what, you're
too busy auditioning

66
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,767
for an Old Spice commercial
to RSVP to my party?

67
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,534
No, I just wanted
to do it in person.

68
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:17,834
You got a minute?

69
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,968
Hmm, yeah, why don't you
actually shoot me an e-mail?

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,968
After a soapy shower.

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,968
Uh, game on
for Riles and me.

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,167
I thought she was
going to call you though.

73
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,667
No text, no tweet, no call.

74
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,968
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say she didn't like me.

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,167
DAVID:
Well, I'm in.

76
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,667
And you're going to love
my birthday present.

77
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,868
Don't make promises
you can't keep, David.

78
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:37,501
Oh...

79
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:38,634
look what the
tide washed in.

80
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:41,000
Hey, Aug, what's up?
Hey.

81
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,334
What's up, man?

82
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,234
Perfect timing.

83
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:47,067
I'm gonna go
get that shower.

84
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,501
Please tell me we're confirmed
on rezzies for tomorrow night.

85
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:52,467
Yeah, yeah, I've got a block
of Coal's best tables

86
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,000
with your name
all over them.
Awesome.

87
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,200
Marcello's in New York,

88
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:56,534
so I'll be able to get
you whatever you want.

89
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,167
Mm, my favorite words.

90
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,901
You're the bestest.

91
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:02,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

92
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:03,367
Hey, birthday girl.

93
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,868
I told the doorman

94
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,834
to make sure that your guests
get right past the velvet rope.

95
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,801
Oh, thanks, Violet.

96
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,634
Can't do much else
on a hostess salary.

97
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,033
I'm not exactly being paid
like a rock star.

98
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:18,033
Not yet,
but if there's one thing

99
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,167
that Sydney taught me,

100
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,467
it's that there is
always room to move up.

101
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,400
What do you think you're doing?

102
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:37,400
Disabling your vehicle.

103
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,534
That's what happens

104
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,667
when you don't pay
your parking tickets.

105
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,234
I just moved here
from Denver, I mean,

106
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,868
I thought you had like
a year to pay those things.

107
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:44,334
They're really expensive.

108
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,501
Due date's written
on the ticket

109
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:47,701
and on the
follow-up notices.

110
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,100
(crying)

111
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,234
Hey, you okay?

112
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:56,534
Not really.

113
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,567
(crying):
Oh, God.

114
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,968
I'm a total failure.

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,934
I can't afford the impound fee.

116
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:04,300
I mean, how am I supposed
to take care of my sister now?

117
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,501
There was a rock climbing
incident about a year ago

118
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:08,767
and she hit her head.

119
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,801
And now she has to relearn
how to walk.

120
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,000
And I'm the only one

121
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,667
who can drive her
to physical therapy.

122
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,434
(sobbing)

123
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,501
Look,

124
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:20,033
I'm never supposed to do this.

125
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:24,734
Thank you so much.

126
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,033
(sighs)

127
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,467
Bravo.

128
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:36,167
I know you.

129
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,601
From WPK.

130
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,801
You're... you're Phillip's
client, right?

131
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:41,701
<i>I was Phillip's client.</i>

132
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:42,901
He said I was too demanding.

133
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:43,834
I just don't tolerate

134
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,501
incompetence.
Sydney Andrews.

135
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:46,634
Ella Simms.

136
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,801
Yeah, I've, um,

137
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:48,934
seen you in the lobby.

138
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:51,067
You know, between
my Jamba Juice stops

139
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,934
and picking up the
dry cleaning for my boss.

140
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,501
Something tells me
you'll have your own

141
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:58,067
Jamba Juice delivery boy
one day.

142
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,234
Really?

143
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,267
Well, what makes you say that?

144
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,300
I have an eye for talent.

145
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,100
You have a future, Ella,

146
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,367
once you rethink

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,200
the unique approach
to your hair

148
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:11,300
and get rid of those nails
before you

149
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:14,234
accidentally
impale someone.

150
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,501
You just need to find
a sense of style, sweetheart.

151
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,901
I... like the way I look.

152
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,534
That's the problem.

153
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,701
I can help you.

154
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,400
I can take you to my salon,

155
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:25,100
we can go shopping.

156
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:28,067
What are you,
some Good Samaritan?

157
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
I have been called
a lot of things,

158
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,601
never that.

159
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,767
My art gallery
is short a publicist,

160
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,033
and anyone who can sell

161
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,901
a bogus story to
a Beverly Hills parking officer,

162
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,200
<i>can sell the hell
out of my gallery.</i>

163
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:41,834
It's eas

164
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:45,167
You just set your mind
on what you want and go get it.

165
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,767
If I hadn't learned that,

166
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:49,133
I'd still be commuting
to Beverly Hills from Van Nuys

167
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,467
in a hatchback.

168
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,701
Gotta run.

169
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:53,767
See you at Coal.

170
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:01,000
* How a girl like me can make
you feel when we're alone *

171
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:04,367
* If you're good to me,
you won't be thinking twice *

172
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,934
* When the show's over, you'll
get your million dollar price *

173
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:13,467
* Oh, I had nothing...

174
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,534
Gentlemen.

175
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,734
You must be the, uh,
birthday strippers

176
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,000
my assistant ordered.

177
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,400
We need you to come downtown
for some questioning.

178
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:24,968
Ooh, unfortunately
that's impossible.

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,501
You see, I'm booked solid today.

180
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:27,801
We got a tip that
contradicts your alibi

181
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,234
on the night of
Sydney Andrews' murder.

182
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:33,167
You might want to postpone
your morning meetings.

183
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:39,501
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

184
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:42,033
Ella, I've known you
for seven months now

185
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,801
and you're one
of my closest friends

186
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,100
and, uh, I don't have
a lot of close friends.

187
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,200
I'd do anything for you.

188
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:50,234
And I do mean anything.

189
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,901
So, if you want to start your
next year off with a bang,

190
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,234
you know where I live.

191
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:55,968
I thought this was
supposed to be PG.

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,367
Hey, I try my best.

193
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,701
You're so not speaking
at our wedding.

194
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:00,901
Bye.
See you.

195
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,267
See you after school.
Okay.

196
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,734
Ow!

197
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,434
So, Ella's own
documentary.

198
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,934
That's a pretty big
gift for a birthday.

199
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:10,834
Hey, you know what,
she busts her butt

200
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:12,100
trying to send work my way,

201
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,801
so I figured she deserves
something special.

202
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,467
Hm.

203
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,868
What, like you don't have some
serious bling all wrapped up

204
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:20,567
in a bow for her?
Hardly. Come on,

205
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,400
Ella's a great girl but she has
yet to earn diamond status.

206
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,033
Did you sell a blockbuster

207
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,300
and not tell anybody?
What is this?

208
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,734
Sick, right? This real
estate agent hires me

209
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,968
to shoot these virtual tours
of all these just

210
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,901
out of control mansions
for his Web site.

211
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,234
Check this out.

212
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:40,400
Look at this bedroom.

213
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:44,300
Riley would kill
for that room.

214
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,601
Well, then you just gotta
sell a couple of big movies

215
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,367
and make that happen, bro.

216
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,434
You're so right.
Oh, my gosh.

217
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,300
I'm gonna get
right on that.

218
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:57,901
Hey, Kyra, here are those
olives you asked for.

219
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,334
Thanks.

220
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,767
You okay?

221
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:05,601
Ah, my landlord's stressing me
out about my back rent,

222
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:09,067
my agent's not
returning my calls,

223
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
so I bought a bottle
of wine last night.

224
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,133
I didn't open it.

225
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,934
Listen, Kyra, if you need
a couple days off...

226
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,968
Work is the best place for me.

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,534
Like you said,

228
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:20,901
if I'm in charge of the alcohol,

229
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,767
the alcohol can't be
in charge of me, right?

230
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,667
Hey, guys.

231
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,467
Hey, Violet.
Hey, V.

232
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:27,934
I'm gonna hit the storeroom.

233
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:34,601
Last night I saw Kyra pour

234
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:36,434
three apple martinis
with one hand

235
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:37,968
and pop open a beer
with another.

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,100
It was amazing.

237
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,033
She's a great bartender.

238
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,701
It's good to see
her bounce back

239
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,901
after some rough times.
What do you mean?

240
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:47,667
Let's just say
I try to be there for her.

241
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,834
You like helping people out,
don't you?

242
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:51,634
Well, when you've been
on the receiving end of it,

243
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:56,000
it's, uh, it gives you
a certain perspective.

244
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:01,901
RODRIGUEZ:
You know him?

245
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,033
Who doesn't?

246
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,033
Dante Zaretti.
P.I. to the stars.

247
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,000
Have you ever
used his services?

248
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,033
Half of my clients
are married to cheating,

249
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,601
drug-abusing, tax-evading
celebutards.

250
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:14,501
I have five P.I.'s
on speed dial.

251
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:15,701
That's not a crime.

252
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,133
Why am I here?

253
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,300
We're still trying to account
for your timeline

254
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:19,434
the night
Sydney Andrews died.

255
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,133
Didn't we cover this?
Where were you?

256
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,167
Like I said the first time,

257
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,100
I left Coal at midnight.

258
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,734
And then I went home
and spent the night

259
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,400
molesting my neighbor,
David Breck.

260
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,400
It's okay, he's over 18.

261
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,267
Then why is there
security cam footage

262
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,000
of you in the alley
outside of Coal

263
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,734
talking to Dante Zaretti

264
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,033
at 1:00 a.m.?

265
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:45,701
I don't wear a watch.

266
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,400
I must've lost track of time.

267
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:48,834
Not only does
this picture prove

268
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,968
that your alibi is bogus,
but it also makes me wonder

269
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,033
what you're talking
to a P.I. about.

270
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,567
Okay, look, one of my clients

271
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,901
thinks her husband
is a closet case,

272
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:00,767
so she hired Zaretti
to follow him and he did,

273
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,067
all the way to Kathy Griffin
doing stand-up.

274
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,767
Ella,

275
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:08,234
you might spin stories
for a living,

276
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,868
but you're not selling it to me.

277
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:14,033
Well, I have nothing to sell

278
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,801
because I didn't do it.

279
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:17,968
So...

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,067
either you release me now

281
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,901
or you charge me,

282
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:25,601
which isn't gonna happen
because you have nothing on me.

283
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,868
Here you are.
Thank you.

284
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,534
Well, I have to admit,
I didn't peg you as someone

285
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,634
who wanted to pursue this line
of work on a regular basis.

286
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:49,934
I'm not sure anyone really
pursues this kind of life.

287
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:51,801
Well, you'd be surprised.

288
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,033
We don't all grow up
wanting to be heart surgeons.

289
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,734
You've been looking into me.

290
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,400
Of course.

291
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:59,634
Then you know I'm
having some trouble

292
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,234
paying for medical school.

293
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:02,734
Well, we all have
our reasons.

294
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:05,400
Lauren, the doctor angle
is brilliant.

295
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:07,234
It is, but let's be real.

296
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,334
I need my girls
to be available, and you're not.

297
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,901
I know what
your hours are like.

298
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:13,968
But if-if I could set my
appointments in advance,

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,834
I could arrange my
schedule accordingly.

300
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,667
What do you think
I'm running here,

301
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:20,000
some sort of Sherman Oaks
modeling agency?

302
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,601
No, no. No,
Wendi, no. I...

303
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,300
That night we met,

304
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:29,300
I was with a guy

305
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:32,701
and it got ugly,
and I was scared.

306
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,701
You know what it's like--
you can't tell anyone

307
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:37,133
where you're going,
or who you're meeting.

308
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,667
I need to know there's someone
keeping me safe.

309
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:46,133
Will you give me a chance?

310
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,267
Please?

311
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:55,467
I choose the client,
time and location.

312
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,634
New girls start
at $1,500 an hour.

313
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,000
I take 50 percent.

314
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,133
Are we clear?

315
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,567
Completely.

316
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:03,767
And, Lauren,

317
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:06,701
there is one rule
I insist you live by.

318
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:08,868
You miss an appointment,
no matter the excuse,

319
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,501
you're done.

320
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:15,902
Alright.

321
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:22,300
Dante Zaretti,
Ella Simms from WPK.

322
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,434
Listen, we got
to get our stories straight,

323
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,834
and we got to do it sooner
rather than later.

324
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:28,267
Great. Call me back ASAP.

325
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,367
Ella?

326
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,434
Covering Jasper Barnes
at his photo shoot

327
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,834
at the Bradbury Building,

328
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:35,334
and I told TMZ
to accidentally show up

329
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,167
when Lizzie Stevens
checks herself into Promises.

330
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,367
You up to speed?

331
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,534
Yeah, nice try, Ella.

332
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,934
Hey, you want to tell me

333
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,701
about the incredibly attractive
police raid this morning?

334
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:45,501
They still have zero leads
on the Sydney Andrews murder.

335
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:48,300
Somehow they think I am
gonna shed light on the case.

336
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,400
The LAPD practically dragged
you out of here in shackles.

337
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:53,334
That's not bringing
comfort to anyone.

338
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,767
So, whatever mess you're in,
clean it up immediately

339
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:58,100
before you embarrass
the entire firm.

340
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,801
You embarrassed me.

341
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,267
Oh, well, hello
to you, too, Syd.

342
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,701
I have a conference call
with New York, so...

343
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:13,868
I had another gallery
showing last night,

344
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,100
and only made one sale.

345
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:16,534
No one showed up.

346
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,701
Your publicity blitz was
a complete and utter failure.

347
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,968
Come on. I wrangled more

348
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,734
buyers through those doors
than anybody at this company.

349
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:24,667
Well, they weren't there
last night.

350
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,834
Syd, you are being
unreasonable.

351
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:28,100
<i>I got you write-ups
in the L.A. Times,</i>

352
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,167
<i>The Weekly, even Vanity Fair.</i>

353
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,901
It is not my fault
if nobody likes the art.

354
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,033
We had a deal.

355
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,901
I turn you
into a real publicist,

356
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:36,667
and you promote my gallery.

357
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:39,033
What am I supposed to tell
my artists when they start

358
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,501
pulling their work
off the walls?

359
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:41,667
I don't know.

360
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,000
Paint prettier pictures.

361
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,601
Well, look who's grown out of
her UGGs and into her Manolos.

362
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,400
I gave you style, Ella.

363
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:50,934
I gave you a place to live.

364
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:52,267
I spent your birthdays with you

365
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,133
when your own mother
wouldn't even bother calling.

366
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,667
We were friends.

367
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,834
And this is what
you trade it for.

368
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:59,901
I'm still your friend, Syd.

369
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:03,100
I'm just not at your
beck and call 24-7.

370
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,634
Off to sign a client,
or just have sex with one?

371
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,434
Judging from the size
of your new office,

372
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,300
you've been
working overtime.

373
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:20,834
* Close your eyes
and count to eight... *

374
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,100
Hey, you.

375
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,534
Don't know
if you remember me.

376
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,200
We used to be
best friends?

377
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,767
You're vaguely familiar.

378
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,601
It's Ella, right?

379
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:32,467
Ella actually gets to see you
for 30 seconds a day.

380
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,601
I know. I miss you. I'm sorry.

381
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,734
Seems like the only time
we talk nowadays

382
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,567
is when I'm rescheduling
another missed shopping date.

383
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:42,200
Actually, this is
one shopping excursion

384
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:44,200
that might have been
worth the wait.

385
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:49,067
I was hoping
that you would come with me

386
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,300
to help pick out
my wedding dress.

387
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,300
Riley, I would love that.

388
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,067
Good.

389
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,467
That is a huge relief,
considering

390
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:58,400
I don't know the difference
between satin and chiffon.

391
00:14:58,434 --> 00:14:59,501
Mm. Yeah.

392
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,000
Tomorrow afternoon
I am totally free.

393
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,200
That's perfect.

394
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,968
Okay.
Meet at my apartment at 5:30,

395
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,167
and we'll drive over together?

396
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,300
I'll bring the Kleenex.

397
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,567
If you don't need it, I will.

398
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:15,868
Hey.

399
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:18,501
You look like
you kind of know your way

400
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:20,267
around a bar a little bit.

401
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,901
Uh, I'm just
practicing.

402
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,067
I was thinking about
asking Marcello

403
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,234
if he needed an
extra bartender.

404
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:27,501
Violet, I know you're ambitious,

405
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,267
but you just started
as a hostess.

406
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,434
Normally you got to work
your way up a little bit.

407
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:34,167
I know, and I'm totally
grateful for my job.

408
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,834
It's just that rent alone
eats up my entire paycheck.

409
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,734
I could really use
the extra tips.

410
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,067
Yeah.

411
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,167
Living in L.A. is kind
of like eating at Coal.

412
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,801
It's all good
till you get the bill.

413
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,367
Especially when you live
around people like Ella Simms.

414
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,167
You kind of start wishing you
could dress like them, too.

415
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,367
Well, don't worry.

416
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,734
You don't need
expensive clothes.

417
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,033
You look great.

418
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,868
Looks like pericarditis.

419
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:58,133
(phone ringing)

420
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,767
Could you excuse
me a minute?

421
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,767
This is an emergency.

422
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:02,834
Hello?

423
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:04,968
Lauren, Wendi Mattison.

424
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,801
Wendi, hey, um,
I-I'm glad you called.

425
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,133
Good,

426
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,734
'cause I have a job for you
tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

427
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:11,734
at the Doheny.

428
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:12,667
There'll be a room key for you

429
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:14,467
at the front desk.
(alarm sounding)

430
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,267
Excuse me.
Line is in.

431
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,133
Hello? Lauren?

432
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:20,267
Are you still with me?

433
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,467
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,267
Um, tomorrow at the Doheny.
I'll be there.

435
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,367
Good. Your name will be Nikki.

436
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,234
Nikki Bloom.

437
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:31,601
* You don't want to go home

438
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:35,300
* 'Cause your family's
all wrong... *

439
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:36,567
<i>MAN:
The space is magnificent.</i>

440
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:37,868
<i>You just don't find this kind</i>

441
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,834
of Mediterranean charm
in a home this size.

442
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,934
Now, if you're interested,
I'd move quickly.

443
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,334
The owners
are accepting

444
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,934
offers after the weeke, okay?

445
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,234
Thanks, guys.

446
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,300
Thank you.

447
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,200
Mickey.

448
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:51,501
Hey, man,
here it is.

449
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:53,100
Top-to-bottom, 14-bedroom
tour of the entire estate.

450
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,901
I even got a shot
of that waterfall

451
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:58,667
in the backyard, tracking with
the stones in the foreground.

452
00:16:58,701 --> 00:16:59,901
It's awesome.

453
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,767
Forget about
the damn video, Jonah.

454
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,400
Isn't that what
you hired me for?

455
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:04,534
Apparently not.

456
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,667
The diamond necklace
with the ruby pendant?

457
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:07,934
It's worth $65,000.

458
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:10,133
It was on the master suite
vanity, and now it's gone.

459
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,300
Where is it?

460
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,033
I don't...

461
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,167
Wait. Are you...
You think I stole something?

462
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
You're the only one
who had access to that room.

463
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,400
Okay, I'm not a thief.

464
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:22,434
Is this...
is this your little scam?

465
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:23,868
You sneak into these estates

466
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,300
with your camera,
and you rob them blind?

467
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,434
You've used me before.

468
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:27,667
I run a legitimate business.

469
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,300
So do I, but if my clients

470
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:31,634
find out that I was stupid
enough to let some punk-ass

471
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,734
thief into their home,
bye-bye listings.

472
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,167
Mickey, n...

473
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,234
I swear to you, I don't know
anything about a necklace.

474
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:42,467
Yeah?

475
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:44,467
Let's see what the cops have to say.

476
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,101
Hey.

477
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:05,067
Wow.

478
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:06,534
Wendi sure knows
how to pick 'em.

479
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,535
I'm Nicky.
Hello, it's nice to meet you, beautiful Nicky.

480
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,834
I'm Frank.

481
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:20,534
(laughs)

482
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,801
You let me kiss you.

483
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,300
Yeah, of...
of course...

484
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:29,201
* They say she needs
to slow down *

485
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,433
* The baddest thing
around town *

486
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:36,801
* She's nothing like a girl
you've ever seen before *

487
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:40,767
* Nothing you can compare
to your neighborhood ho *

488
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:43,834
* I'm trying to find the words
to describe this girl *

489
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:46,700
* Without being disrespectful

490
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:49,300
No. Not yet.
* Damn, girl!

491
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,001
* Damn, you's a sexy bitch

492
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:52,767
* A sexy bitch

493
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,268
What's wrong?
* Damn, you's a sexy bitch.

494
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,367
Nothing.

495
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,034
("Starstruck" by Santigold
playing)

496
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,168
I want you to dance for me.

497
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,867
Um,

498
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,834
Frank,

499
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:10,234
dancing's really not...
not my thing.

500
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:13,300
Well, it's my thing,
and I'm paying a lot of money.

501
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,400
Right, and I understand
that completely,

502
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:18,667
but I'm a terrible dancer.

503
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,467
I-I can't dance.

504
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,834
Okay, so, what are you saying?

505
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:24,534
Do I need to talk to Wendi,
get a different girl?

506
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,500
* 'Cause when I
throw you on again *

507
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,333
No. No,

508
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,534
of course not.

509
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,500
* What is the
missing ingredient? *

510
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,801
* I... I see you fade

511
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,801
Stop thinking.

512
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,067
Feel the music.

513
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,134
* I... I see you fade away

514
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:53,034
* I... I see you fade

515
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,867
There you go.

516
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:02,001
* I... I see you fade away

517
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,134
* Under the skin

518
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:07,268
* Is not so easy to swallow

519
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,034
* Don't rub me in

520
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,901
* Divide my dreams
are so hollow *

521
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,867
* What is it you get
I don't get? *

522
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:21,667
* I watch you fumblin' again

523
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,201
* 'Cause dream easy
on your cigarette *

524
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:26,433
* Through it,
ain't through now... *

525
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,567
(sighs)

526
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,767
Wendi never disappoints.

527
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:36,634
You are truly
phenomenal.

528
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,467
Hey.

529
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,934
Hey, I'm just
getting started.

530
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,367
We-we spent an hour...

531
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Having earth-shattering sex.

532
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,001
Why not keep going?

533
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:50,834
I thought

534
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:53,034
Wendi told you, I always keep
the second hour optional.

535
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,400
Right.

536
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,333
Um, do you mind
if I make a phone call then?

537
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,667
Seriously?

538
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,600
You have somewhere
you need to be?

539
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,667
'Cause if you're-you're
too busy...

540
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,634
No.

541
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:15,801
I want to be
wherever you want me to be.

542
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,467
(sighs)

543
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,801
Miss Simms, a
slight problem.

544
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,901
Your credit card's
been denied.

545
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,168
That's my platinum card.

546
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:34,867
Your machine
must be broken.

547
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,034
We called the
credit card company.

548
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,500
Your card appears
to be maxed out.

549
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:39,634
There's an ATM
around the corner.

550
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:40,967
(laughs)

551
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,300
Well, that's impossible.

552
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,700
There's a $20,000 limit
on that card.

553
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,934
How'd you pull
this one off?

554
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:51,967
Are you bored?
Lonely?
I'm still angry.

555
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:54,268
Did you think I would forget
that you told David

556
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,067
I was sleeping with
his father?
You're the one
forgetting the facts.

557
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:59,234
Like how you were also
sleeping with David?

558
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:00,967
You were practically
building a nest

559
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,634
in that family tree.

560
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,801
Just admit it-- it killed you
to see me happy again.

561
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:07,134
Syd, I would be overjoyed

562
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:09,101
to see you happy again.

563
00:22:09,134 --> 00:22:10,134
Then maybe you wouldn't
feel the need

564
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:12,433
to humiliate me in front
of perspective clients.

565
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,001
I'm saving them the hassle.

566
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:16,268
We both know that
you'll kick them to the curb

567
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,767
when you don't need them
anymore.

568
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,600
Just like you did to me.

569
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:20,801
Last I checked,

570
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,201
you were the one who walked out
on our friendship.

571
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:25,001
Sweetheart, I think
you've made it very clear

572
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:27,834
that your definition
of friendship...

573
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:30,934
...vastly different than mine.

574
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,367
Hey. I could
have you arrested.

575
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,367
You're the one with the
maxed out credit card.

576
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,201
If you can't afford this
place, there's a diner

577
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:44,600
just down the street.

578
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,734
(sighs)

579
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:54,667
Before I'm gray, David.

580
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,634
I don't mind being late
to my birthday party,

581
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,333
but I don't want
to be a no-show.

582
00:22:58,367 --> 00:22:59,500
Two seconds, El.

583
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:01,134
I'm just about ready.

584
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:03,801
So... what'd you get me?

585
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,834
Well, that's
a surprise.

586
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:09,101
Oh, please,
there's no such thing.

587
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:11,168
No peeking, El.

588
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:13,268
I'm not peeking.

589
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:28,967
(sighs)

590
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,201
Damn, birthday girl.
You look smokin'.

591
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:36,467
Why, thank you, David.

592
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,867
You make fairly suitable
arm candy yourself.

593
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:42,934
Oh, by the way,
before I descend

594
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:44,834
into a tequila-tinged haze,

595
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:46,834
you know our friend
Detective Rodriguez?

596
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,834
Well, turns out,
he's not really our friend.

597
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,534
He has his handcuffs
in a tizzy

598
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:52,600
over our alibi.

599
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:54,934
<i>So, if anyone asks,</i>

600
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,934
we got home after
2:00 a.m., not midnight.

601
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,101
You got it?

602
00:23:58,134 --> 00:23:59,700
Wait, you said that
they cleared you.

603
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,600
Why is he snooping around?

604
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:04,867
Well, I made the mistake
of flirting with him
out of boredom.

605
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,433
Poor fool actually thinks
he has a chance.

606
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:10,101
But the questioning--
it's just getting so old.

607
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:11,300
So can we just, please,

608
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,500
keep our story
airtight?
El,

609
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:15,600
if I'm gonna be your alibi,

610
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:18,333
I need to know
the real story.

611
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:21,867
Okay.

612
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:23,433
Only if you promise
not to tell a soul.

613
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:24,400
I promise.

614
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:25,567
I mean it, David.

615
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,300
You say anything, and
I will tell everyone

616
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,433
that behind all the Prada,

617
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,101
you're really the
prince of San Berdoo.

618
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,367
Cough it up, El.

619
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,367
What are you hiding?

620
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,867
Okay.

621
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,534
You want to know the truth?

622
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,467
The night Sydney died...

623
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,834
(quietly):
I slept with a client.

624
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:43,201
I'm sorry, what?

625
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:46,934
I slept with a client.

626
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,867
That's it? That's
your big confession?

627
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,567
Well, it is when
their high-profile wife

628
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,067
is also a client.

629
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:55,101
Look, if this hit
the blogosphere,

630
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:56,667
I'd get 15
minutes of fame

631
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,834
and a lifetime of peddling
In-N-Out burgers.

632
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:02,901
Can we please get
our butts on the road?

633
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,600
Very important people
are waiting

634
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:08,168
for an even more
important person. Me.

635
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,134
(loud dance music playing)

636
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:15,234
Just the way the cop
was questioning me--

637
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:16,500
I was so nervous.

638
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:18,433
And I started doing that
twitching thing with my eye.

639
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,001
Now he probably thinks
I'm, like, a serial killer.

640
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:21,201
You told him the truth.

641
00:25:21,234 --> 00:25:22,467
You didn't steal
that necklace.

642
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,467
Where is everybody?

643
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,667
I mean, he could be getting
a search warrant right now.

644
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,234
Next thing we know,
LAPD's busting down our door,

645
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:30,767
rummaging through
all of our stuff.

646
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,201
Yeah, and what are
they going to find,

647
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:33,534
your Doctor Strange
comic collection?

648
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,867
Oh, and they said

649
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,667
they're gonna call
all my past employers.

650
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,734
So, once word gets out that
I'm a suspected criminal,

651
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:40,767
I'm through, Riles.
Okay, Jonah,

652
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:43,268
if you're not up for this party,
don't stay on my account.

653
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,134
I'd much rather be on the couch
with you and a bowl of popcorn.

654
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:49,134
I can't bail on Ella's birthday.

655
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:52,300
It's just going to require some
advanced level intoxication.

656
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,268
Done. Rum and
coke, my treat?

657
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,600
Yeah.
Okay.

658
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:57,700
I'll come find you.
Okay.

659
00:25:57,734 --> 00:25:59,767
(patrons talking and laughing)

660
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:02,201
Can I get a rum and coke
and a red wine, please?

661
00:26:02,234 --> 00:26:04,500
ELLA:
What do we have here?

662
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:06,567
Aw, thank you.

663
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,101
That is so sweet.

664
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,700
(clears throat)

665
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:12,500
Happy birthday.

666
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:14,400
Oh!

667
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,534
A bracelet.

668
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:21,867
It's beautiful.

669
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:23,234
You hate it.

670
00:26:23,268 --> 00:26:24,333
I do not.

671
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,734
If there's one
thing Ella Simms

672
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:26,867
can't lie about,
it's jewelry.

673
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,367
No, it's just
that...

674
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,367
I may have gotten a peek

675
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,734
at that amazing diamond necklace
that was in your desk.

676
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,801
You know, the one
with the ruby pendant.

677
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,333
So you were sneaking around.

678
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,067
I just thought
you were gonna surprise me

679
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,634
with it later,
that's all.

680
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,501
I love this.

681
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,500
Son of a bitch.

682
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,567
I know it sounds
totally insane,

683
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,234
but somebody stole that
necklace, and it wasn't me.

684
00:26:58,268 --> 00:26:59,333
And David saw footage

685
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,367
of exactly where it was.
Okay, so,

686
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,268
what, he burglarized
the place?

687
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,467
That's crazy.

688
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,700
Seriously, Jonah.

689
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:07,400
First Violet, now David.

690
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,567
You're like trapped in your
own Hitchckian thriller.

691
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,101
He seemed really interested
in that house when he saw it.

692
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,134
And the address was right
there in front of him.

693
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:16,300
Jonah, David could buy
ten of those necklaces

694
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,967
with his trust fund.
I know.

695
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,500
It doesn't make
any sense.

696
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:20,867
I mean, maybe he gets off

697
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,333
on the thrill of it
or something.

698
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,300
* You won't be lonely

699
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,433
* Even if the sky
is falling down *

700
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,634
* You'll be my only

701
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,467
* No need to worry...

702
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Oh, my God.

703
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:36,500
Jonah Miller!

704
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:39,967
A birthday video?

705
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,467
How sweet are you.

706
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,634
Get your butt over here!
Go on.

707
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,967
Go to your master.

708
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:48,834
ELLA:
Come on.

709
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,367
That's so sweet.

710
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,567
Riley,

711
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,168
hey.

712
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:58,500
I'm sorry I missed
our shopping date.

713
00:27:58,534 --> 00:27:59,867
Okay. Something came up,
suddenly,

714
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,901
and...
You couldn't have
called to reschedule?

715
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,600
Like you have the
last three times?

716
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:06,001
I lost track of time.

717
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:08,067
Right, because the
only clock is

718
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:09,734
on your nonexistent
cell phone.

719
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,634
Riley, you know
what my life is like.

720
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,500
I have to be
at ten places at once.

721
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:16,101
Okay, and I only needed you
in one.

722
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,500
I promise you,

723
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm going to help you find
the perfect wedding dress.

724
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:22,700
It's not about the dress,
Lauren.

725
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,801
It's us.

726
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,834
We used to do
everything together.

727
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:29,467
Now I feel like you have this
whole other life that I'm not

728
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,867
a part of.

729
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,934
That other life is a hospital
full of sick people.

730
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,934
I get that.

731
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,734
Except I called the hospital

732
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,534
and you weren't there.

733
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:46,300
Here are the limes
that you wanted.

734
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,367
Awesome, V.

735
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,101
Thank you.
I'm sorry to recruit you,

736
00:28:49,134 --> 00:28:50,268
but I am slammed.

737
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,400
Oh, I can tell.

738
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:52,500
Do you need any help?

739
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,034
Yes, actually.
Would you mind stocking

740
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,834
some of those glasses
back there for me?

741
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,667
Easy.
You're a lifesaver.

742
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,034
* Just let it be

743
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:03,600
* Come on, bring your body
next to me *

744
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:08,067
* I'll take you away, hey...

745
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:10,400
So, El, the fact that
you're concocting a way

746
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:12,834
to put this on my reel
and make your ten percent

747
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,867
is exactly why we love you.

748
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,934
Happy birthday.
And that

749
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,433
is why I refer
to Jonah

750
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,467
as the next Spike Jonze.

751
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,234
Thank you,

752
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,268
for the most thoughtful gift
ever.

753
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,433
Total group effort,
though.

754
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,367
It's really from all of us.

755
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,634
Oh, well, then, thank you

756
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,134
to everyone.

757
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:33,967
In this town, true friends

758
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,567
are hard to find,
and I am lucky

759
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,433
to say that I live in a
building full of them.

760
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,201
Cheers!

761
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,500
Mm. How are we not on shots yet?

762
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,234
Good question. My treat.

763
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:48,967
Let's go. Yeah?

764
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,801
(phone chimes)

765
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:52,534
Can I talk to you

766
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,700
for a quick sec, outside?
Jonah. Jonah.

767
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,567
We'll be right back.

768
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,300
Sure, bro.

769
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,901
* No need to worry

770
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:03,867
* Baby, are you down,
down, down, down, down? *

771
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:07,168
* Down

772
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:10,300
* Baby, are you down,
down, down, down, down? *

773
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,901
Hello?

774
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:24,934
I'm looking for my
birthday surprise.

775
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,001
Happy birthday,
Ella.

776
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,201
Zaretti.

777
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,202
Surprise.

778
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,900
Ten voice mails,
six e-mails.

779
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,000
Why are you stalking me?

780
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:41,334
I wanted to talk to you
before the police did.

781
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:43,000
You know, so we could get
our story straight.

782
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:44,868
That night we met,

783
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,634
we were discussing
a mutual client. You got it?

784
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:48,900
Is that the lie you
spun to the cops?

785
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:50,567
Well, I certainly wasn't going
to tell them

786
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,868
you killed Sydney Andrews.
Hey,

787
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,601
I walked into that
courtyard to find

788
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:54,834
a woman facedown

789
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:56,667
in a swimming pool.
Are you delusional?

790
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,267
They are never going
to believe that.

791
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,200
If you're trying to pin this
murder on me, it's not gonna

792
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:01,334
happen. Wait till
the cops

793
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,601
find out that you hired me
to break into her place.

794
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:06,933
Ella. Syd keeps
text-bombing me.

795
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:08,167
I gotta go.
Gotta lose the leash.

796
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,634
I'll call you later.
You're my ride.

797
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,501
Cab it.

798
00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:14,267
Who wants another shot?

799
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,033
Oh, whatever.

800
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:21,134
Oh...

801
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:22,434
it's just a friend.

802
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:30,434
Her name's Sydney Andrews.

803
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,701
She lives on the second floor.

804
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:33,300
So, what am I
looking for, anyway?

805
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:35,868
Proof that she's trying
to hijack my life.

806
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,434
Credit history, medical records,
passwords, pictures,

807
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:39,634
whatever
she has on me.

808
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,434
Sydney wants to ruin my life.

809
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,634
And I want her
to rot behind bars.

810
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:50,033
What really happened,
Zaretti? Huh?

811
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:52,734
She catch you in her apartment,
you panicked,

812
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:54,701
stuck a knife in her?

813
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:57,634
Maybe I better have a little
conversation with the cops

814
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,067
and tell them how
you killed Sydney

815
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,834
and tried to
frame me for it.

816
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:03,200
LAUREN:
Ella?

817
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:04,334
There you are. What...?

818
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,367
Lauren.

819
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:07,701
Hi. Um,

820
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:09,033
this is Mike Smith.

821
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,134
He's-he's a work
colleague.

822
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,367
Pleasure, Lauren.

823
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:14,601
I-I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

824
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:15,601
Oh, God, no.

825
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,834
He was actually,
um, just leaving.

826
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:22,667
Happy birthday.

827
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:27,300
Are you okay?
What was that?

828
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,100
Yeah, no. I'm fine.

829
00:32:29,134 --> 00:32:31,334
He's just some drunken work guy.
No biggie.

830
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,701
Come on, let's get
out of here.
Okay.

831
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,801
Are you kidding?

832
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,234
Would you please just
answer the question.

833
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:39,701
Did you take the
necklace or not?

834
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:41,200
Yeah, man.

835
00:32:41,234 --> 00:32:42,567
Yeah, I'm sorry.

836
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:44,067
I just couldn't resist
the way it brought out my eyes.

837
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:52,033
You think that that was
the same necklace?

838
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,334
She's talking about something

839
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,167
that belonged to a chick
that I hooked up with.

840
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,234
She left it by mistake.

841
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:57,768
Okay? You know what?

842
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,601
I bet if you go
to my place, you'll find

843
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:00,967
one of her earrings
on my pillow.

844
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,167
Wh... Do you think I like
pointing fingers at one

845
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,167
of my best friends here?
I don't know.

846
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,768
My job is on the
line here, David.

847
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:09,401
Unlike you, I
actually have to work

848
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:11,200
for my cash flow.

849
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:13,200
Then why don't you leave the
detective work up to the pros

850
00:33:13,234 --> 00:33:16,367
and go back to working
on your little home videos.

851
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,801
(scoffs)

852
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:19,167
It's pretty obvious why Auggie

853
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,567
wants nothing to do
with you these days.

854
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:22,134
Careful you don't burn through
your trust fund

855
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,367
like you burn through
all the people in your life.

856
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:34,401
I'm going
to get going.

857
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm beat.
Wait a second.

858
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:38,601
Uh, is there another
cash box around here?

859
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,300
Uh, that's everything.

860
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:41,834
Why?

861
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:43,601
'Cause we're $700 short
at the bar.

862
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:47,300
Uh, did you include
the credit cards?

863
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:48,701
Marcello always forgets.

864
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:50,567
No, I ran the numbers
four times.

865
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,634
Well, then
something's off.

866
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,334
I mean, yeah, it
was crazy night,

867
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,567
but not a $700
deficit crazy.

868
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,467
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

869
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Auggie, I swear...

870
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,701
I didn't do that.

871
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:16,933
I-I don't even know how that

872
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,033
got in there.
Really?

873
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:19,701
'Cause it looks like
it just came

874
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:20,900
out of your bag.

875
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,300
AUGGIE:
What is this?

876
00:34:22,334 --> 00:34:23,933
$700.

877
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh, what, you think I'm taking
advantage 'cause the boss is

878
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,834
out of town?

879
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:30,601
Auggie, you know me.

880
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:31,834
I'd never steal.

881
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:33,334
Yeah, but you've stolen before.

882
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:34,933
You told me...

883
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,601
to buy drugs.

884
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:39,134
Okay, that was
over a year ago.

885
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:42,868
Auggie, you have
to trust me.

886
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,768
I did not do this.

887
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:46,734
Look, I don't know
what to think.

888
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:50,967
Let's just talk
about this tomorrow, okay?

889
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,467
Great.

890
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:58,868
So much for trusting each other.

891
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,884
LAUREN:
Riley.

892
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,650
Riley!

893
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:24,917
I should've called.

894
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:27,417
I blew it.
I'm sorry. I know.

895
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,984
I stopped by Radiology
before I checked in at the desk.

896
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:31,917
No cell reception.

897
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,584
It's just, this wasn't
an ordinary shopping trip.
I know.

898
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:39,951
This was the most memorable
shopping trip of your life.

899
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:41,851
Okay, I'm not going to let you
down like that again, Riley.

900
00:35:41,884 --> 00:35:43,517
What I mean is,

901
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,884
I was using this trip

902
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:47,951
as an excuse to ask you
to be my maid of honor.

903
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,784
I don't even know
what to say, Riley.

904
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:01,750
You know what?
You don't have to say anything.

905
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:05,417
It's probably really
selfish of me to ask you.

906
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,151
Why is it selfish of you?

907
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:11,383
I mean, you got showers,
fittings,

908
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,483
bachelorette party...
Yeah, but, Riley...

909
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:14,851
With your schedule
at the hospital

910
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:16,817
and all your studying...

911
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:19,218
you probably don't have time
for silly wedding plans.

912
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:22,717
Excuse me. First of all,
your wedding is

913
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,218
not silly.

914
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:28,483
And secondly, I'm not going
to lose my friend to my job.

915
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:29,884
I don't know what I'd do

916
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,750
without you.

917
00:36:31,784 --> 00:36:34,550
I'm going to find a way
to balance my responsibilities.

918
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:39,483
There's nowhere I'd rather be
than beside you on your big day.

919
00:36:40,984 --> 00:36:43,117
Come here.

920
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:49,951
(knocking on door)

921
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:51,984
David, it's Jonah.

922
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:54,550
Your backstabbing
basketball buddy.

923
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:57,917
Door's open.

924
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,417
Um, so I was wrong.

925
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,851
I was very, very wrong.

926
00:37:10,884 --> 00:37:13,383
Apparently a maid,
kind of found that necklace.

927
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,684
It's actually a funny
story, she was...

928
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:16,717
She was cleaning behind
some furniture and then...

929
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,017
So what you're
saying is that

930
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:20,117
the necklace wasn't
in my apartment.

931
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:22,450
I... I-I'm sorry.

932
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:23,383
I feel like crap, man.

933
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:26,151
Jonah, why would
I steal jewelry?

934
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:29,017
I don't know.
I-I don't know.

935
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:30,817
I... I guess I just
kind of had it

936
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,550
in my head that
this could all be

937
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,218
a facade somehow.

938
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:37,617
Only in my geeked out
imagination

939
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,717
could I be sharing a courtyard
with Thomas Crown.

940
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,417
Jonah, stick with the romcoms.

941
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,483
Okay?

942
00:37:43,517 --> 00:37:44,951
The film noir's killing you.

943
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:46,218
Riley would totally agree.

944
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:50,284
Look, man, what can I do
to make it up to you?

945
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:55,784
Let's settle it on the court.

946
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,984
One-on-one,
loser buys lunch.

947
00:37:58,017 --> 00:37:59,750
You're on.

948
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:02,417
Good.

949
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,717
And I strongly suggest
you bring your jump shot,

950
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,784
'cause I'm starving.

951
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:13,817
Some of these dresses
should be made illegal.

952
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:15,051
Look at this one.

953
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,483
Um, the 1800s called.

954
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:17,884
They want their
sleeves back.

955
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,951
Okay, so my first duty
as your maid of honor

956
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:21,584
is to destroy this.
Oh, give me that.

957
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:23,584
You ruined it.
Vile.

958
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:25,784
(phone ringing)

959
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:27,017
Hello?

960
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:28,284
Hello, Doctor.

961
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:30,151
I heard you enjoyed my patient.

962
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:33,184
It was, um, it-it was
a pretty standard procedure.

963
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:34,483
Standard?

964
00:38:34,517 --> 00:38:37,350
I told him to keep you
as long as he could.

965
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:40,717
Consider this your final exam.

966
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,350
This mean I passed?

967
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:45,051
With flying colors.
I'm going to be

968
00:38:45,084 --> 00:38:46,383
using you again, Lauren.

969
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:48,450
In fact, I'm going to be
using a lot of you.

970
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:50,684
Welcome to the family.

971
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:56,450
Thanks. Bye.

972
00:39:00,017 --> 00:39:01,350
Passed what?

973
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:03,251
Oh, just this
test at work.

974
00:39:03,284 --> 00:39:04,483
Congratulations.

975
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:06,017
Thank you.

976
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,350
(groans):
Oh, my God.

977
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:09,284
They still make
these things in teal?

978
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:22,717
How's Kyra doing?

979
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,917
She still swears
she didn't do anything.

980
00:39:24,951 --> 00:39:26,851
Marcello doesn't
believe her, so...

981
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:28,084
he's letting her go.

982
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,051
She was so cool.

983
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:31,284
I feel bad.

984
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:32,884
So do I.

985
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:35,017
I tried to convince him
to give her a second chance,

986
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:36,251
but he wouldn't budge.

987
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:39,151
So... I guess

988
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:41,350
you'll be looking
for a new bartender.

989
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,417
Do you think Marcello
would give me a chance?

990
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,650
I already talked to him.
He's willing to give you

991
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,584
a couple of hours
on a Tuesday night.

992
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:49,851
No way.

993
00:39:49,884 --> 00:39:51,650
But you have to be great,
'cause he made it clear

994
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:52,817
he's not running a charity.

995
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,717
Thank you so much, Auggie.

996
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,450
I so owe you one.

997
00:39:56,483 --> 00:39:57,483
No, you don't.

998
00:39:57,517 --> 00:39:59,117
Just keep your hand
out of the register

999
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:02,017
and you'll be fine.

1000
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,318
Miss Simms,
how was yoga?

1001
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,417
Oh, God, just move in already.

1002
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,717
Thought you might like to know
we talked to Dante Zaretti

1003
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,017
about your little meeting.

1004
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:24,717
Oh, good.

1005
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,184
Then I'm sure
he explained to you

1006
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,017
that we were discussing
a mutual client.

1007
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,483
Actually, he said
you hired him

1008
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:31,884
to break into
Sydney's apartment.

1009
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:34,517
Except when he got there,
she was already dead.

1010
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,117
Well, that is

1011
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:40,051
one P.I. with a very
vivid imagination.

1012
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:41,750
He says you got there
beforehim that night,

1013
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:42,917
stabbed her, then tried

1014
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:44,951
to make him look
like the killer.

1015
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,450
According to Zaretti,
you're the murderer.

1016
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:49,318
Okay, why does he get to be
Mr. Credibility?

1017
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,383
I mean, he's obviously lying.

1018
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,550
He's just saying that

1019
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,417
because WPK didn't want
to use him anymore.

1020
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,318
Look, Sydney Andrews
made me who I am today.

1021
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,984
Why would I want her dead?

1022
00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:03,884
If we can confirm his story,

1023
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:06,084
you can bet your Burberry
you'll be arrested for murder.

1024
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:10,218
Well, that's one big "if,"
Detective.

1025
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,017
Good luck with that.

1026
00:41:12,051 --> 00:41:14,584
Oh, I'm not so sure I'm
going to need any luck.

1027
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,151
It's gonna feel real good

1028
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,051
when I get to tighten
those handcuffs

1029
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:22,350
around those adorable
little wrists of yours.
