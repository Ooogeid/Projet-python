1
00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:02,001
<i>Previously on Melrose Place...</i>

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,316
I'm Ella.
Junior publicist.

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,797
You are a hugely talented filmmaker.

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,718
I love you, I do, but too much
has happened since we got engaged.

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,512
I should be with someone
who believes in me.

6
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:17,516
I know you weren't meant to be with him.
Tell me you don't feel the same way.

7
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:19,226
You need to leave.

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,228
All my life, all I wanted was
to be a doctor.

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,230
I'm a little concerned
about your finances.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,983
- I can work it out.
- Geez, you've really gone pro.

11
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:28,444
Professional's always best
for the job, right?

12
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:30,934
I've never dated anyone like you.

13
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:33,228
Someone have a little
too much to drink?

14
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:35,284
You slipped me something,
didn't you?

15
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,744
Get her into seven!

16
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,847
- What's wrong?
- It looks like an overdose.

17
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,665
<i>Amanda does not come all the way</i>

18
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,782
across the country just to slap us on
the wrist.

19
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:44,168
She's the president.

20
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,837
Jane said I can stay

21
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,340
in the penthouse, and I can't
wait to become a part

22
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,550
of each and every one of your lives.

23
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:46,915
Morning.

24
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:53,390
Last night...
that really happened, huh?

25
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,466
Yeah. Twice.

26
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,151
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

27
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:07,154
Oh, my gosh.

28
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,521
Yesterday couldn't have
been any more surreal.

29
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:14,091
Within 24 hours, Curtis Heller bought
Living in Reverse.

30
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:17,970
Get ready to join some guilds,
Mr. Miller.

31
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:21,932
Next thing I know is that
I'm this hotel suite,

32
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,519
- with you where we...
- Worked up quite an appetite.

33
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:28,773
So, the suite's
comped by the studio.

34
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,610
All I have to do is call
down and say that Curtiss...

35
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,154
young protege deserves
to have one of everything.

36
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:37,799
Banana French toast.

37
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,768
Followed by

38
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,285
a $20 omelet.

39
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,413
I can't.

40
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,535
I'm sorry, did I just hear Jonah
Miller...

41
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:53,052
turn down
an all-you-can-eat breakfast?

42
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,452
I'd love to spend
the whole morning here.

43
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:01,167
Last night was great.

44
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,725
You are great.

45
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:09,598
But Riley called me,
like, a dozen times.

46
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,107
So I should at least let her know...

47
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,401
I'm not dead on the side of
the road somewhere.

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,239
Oh, yeah, you...
you should definitely...

49
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,366
let her know that you're okay and...

50
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,965
Look, I know the dust
hasn't quite settled yet, but...

51
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:28,426
you might as well be honest with Riley
about how you really spent the night.

52
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,754
You're not gonna lie to her,
are you?

53
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,060
I just don't think she...

54
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:41,846
necessarily needs to hear
all the gory details.

55
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,102
Riley told you the truth last night.

56
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:49,703
Don't you owe her the same?

57
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:52,598
Yes. I-I just...

58
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:57,111
- It's just... it's complicated.
- Is it?

59
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:02,950
Really?

60
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:06,704
She has no idea what she wants.

61
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:09,290
But I,

62
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,875
on the other hand

63
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,744
I know exactly what I want.

64
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,186
All set for today.
I need you to find it.

65
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,114
Your adoring boyfriend
says no BlackBerrys in bed.

66
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,749
House rules.

67
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,585
You know I don't like rules.

68
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,947
You realize you're the only man who
could pry a PDA from my grip...

69
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,125
and keep me laughing
at the same time.

70
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:46,118
I do my best.

71
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,454
I was so worried
the morning bubbly...

72
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,799
might fall by the wayside
once we lived in the same city.

73
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,124
Speaking of which,

74
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,294
I think I saw something
under the bed.

75
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,737
My gosh.

76
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,644
Zanottis.

77
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,975
My gosh, these aren't
even in the stores yet.

78
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,810
They are in Milan.

79
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,025
It's a perfect fit!

80
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,973
I'll wear them to my party tonight.

81
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,830
Well, I have a special surprise...
for you tonight.

82
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,766
It'll show you and everyone else
how much I love you.

83
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,935
A surprise.
Don't torture me.

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,193
I demand a hint.

85
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,206
It's beautiful,

86
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:33,040
rare...

87
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,377
and goes perfectly with
your sparkling eyes.

88
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,537
You know me.

89
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,006
I like things to move fast.

90
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,430
You brought flowers?

91
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,757
Is this part of your training, finding
out what it's like to almost die?

92
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:01,860
If it is, I think I flunked.

93
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:16,667
I found you on a hotel room floor.
You were passed out.

94
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,653
Your lips were blue.

95
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:21,647
You want to tell me what happened?

96
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,051
Some of the interns went
for a drink after our shift.

97
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,569
I was really tired.

98
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,301
I-I had a martini,
and it made mel light-headed.

99
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,632
So, someone had a-a room,

100
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:37,429
and I-I went upstairs,
and I guess I fainted.

101
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:43,869
Why are you lying?

102
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,738
Lauren, I know that you OD'd.

103
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,221
Promise no to get mad at me.

104
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,080
You can tell me anything.

105
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:59,084
I went to meet a guy.

106
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,020
A guy I used to date.

107
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:07,493
He called me yesterday morning
to ask me out, and I said yes.

108
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:14,533
To tell him I couldn't
see him again.

109
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:20,129
I thought he was taking it okay,

110
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:23,345
but I-I don't know, he must have
slipped something in my drink.

111
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,544
Next thing I knew,
we were in that room.

112
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,696
And then?

113
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,549
What did he do?

114
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:32,384
Nothing.

115
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,829
Nothing. I was having a bad
reaction to the drugs,

116
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,756
he got scared, and he left me there.

117
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,213
Who the hell is this guy?

118
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,038
He's just a jerk.
Just a jerk.

119
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,946
We have you scheduled for an EEG.

120
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,663
Listen,
this is kind of embarrassing,

121
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:56,521
and I don't want
anyone else to know,

122
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,576
so can you please just let it go?

123
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,940
It's let go.
You're gonna be okay.

124
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,586
Dark_Chii, Just-In, Psiko,
peluche, WoLF71 présentent...

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,301
If you break that,
you're all gonna chip in and pay for it.

126
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:35,071
- It says "Handle with care."
- Oh, crap.

127
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,213
Don't worry about that-
it's just a priceless antique.

128
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:39,184
I saw that.

129
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,512
We need to talk about my party.

130
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,496
That is, if you can find the energy

131
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:58,495
- fresh off a one-night stand.
- It wasn't a one-night stand.

132
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,499
You keep telling yourself that.
Anyway, we need to hire a new caterer.

133
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,547
I thought we hired the caterers...
from Gwen Stefani's birthday party.

134
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:07,087
And then I fired them.

135
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,478
Told the party planner I
don't care if it's trendy,

136
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:11,383
you don't put cotton
candy on foie gras.

137
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:19,016
I know someone who will be perfect.
Don't worry, your reintroduction

138
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,334
to the A-list will be flawless.

139
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,148
Today happens to be more than impressing
and intimidating L.A.'s power elite.

140
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,775
Now, Ben mentioned that he's
planning something special.

141
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,361
Let's just say he's a
"grand gesture" kind of guy.

142
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,822
I want make sure nothing goes wrong.

143
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,159
Is it possible that he is gonna
slip something sparkly

144
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,994
on that finger of yours?

145
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:41,288
I'm your boss.

146
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:43,665
My personal life is
none of your business.

147
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:45,334
Right.

148
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,961
I trust that everyone in the
building is coming today?

149
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:51,089
Well, my fellow courtyard dwellers

150
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,202
are more of "who's
that" than "who's who."

151
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,310
Inviting them was the
neighborly thing to do.

152
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,514
I want them all there.
Make it happen.

153
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,865
Amanda's party tonight! Be there
or I will hurt you.

154
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:23,542
Oh, my God.
Jonah, thank God you're home.

155
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:30,058
Yeah, I started organizing
your comic books...

156
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:32,627
to keep me from
freaking out all night.

157
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:34,437
I'm sorry. I should've called.

158
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:40,212
- We need to talk.
- You have the right to be furious.

159
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:44,084
Last night...

160
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:49,811
You just have to understand
how incredibly hard that was for me.

161
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:51,270
No, I know.

162
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:54,945
What I said, what I did...

163
00:10:57,477 --> 00:10:59,029
Jonah, I am so sorry.

164
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:06,623
I'm not proud of the way I acted,
either.

165
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,750
How were you supposed to act?

166
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:11,795
Look, I am lost.

167
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,131
I am confused.

168
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:16,871
But the one thing I do know

169
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:20,332
is that the last five years with you
have been the best years of my life.

170
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,902
Before we decided to get married,
we never fought.

171
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:30,247
We never had any issues. We just...

172
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:32,608
laughed a lot.

173
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:38,566
Can't we just go back
to the way it was?

174
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:41,950
Without the engaged part?

175
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:50,405
You're asking me to
commit to a future...

176
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,628
with someone who won't
commit to anything.

177
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,129
I'm not asking you to commit.

178
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:57,174
I am asking you to
live in the moment

179
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,216
with me.

180
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,012
What we have together,

181
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,473
it is too special
to just throw away.

182
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,683
We owe it to ourselves

183
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,113
to try to make it.

184
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:13,997
It's just...

185
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,151
After everything that's happened...

186
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,994
I'm not so sure...

187
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:27,704
So,

188
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,577
since you'whiz kid,

189
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:32,520
I thought, "Who better to
cook for Amanda's party

190
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:35,183
than Coal's best ex-sous-chef?"

191
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:37,755
That's pretty high praise
and pretty short notice.

192
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,550
You will have
a fully loaded kitchen...

193
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,153
an army of servers, and...

194
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,329
I sort of already
told them you'd do it.

195
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:51,019
Then it's a good thing I kept
every recipe Marcello ever shot down.

196
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:53,414
Thank you.

197
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,233
You have no idea how much
I need this gig today.

198
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,151
Oh, please.

199
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,607
It's the least I can do.

200
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:03,188
Especially after believing you were
a knif e-wielding lady killer gone AWOL.

201
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,401
You weren't the only one.

202
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:07,615
- Don't worry about it.
- Good.

203
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,718
Okay, the party's at
her boyfriend's estate.

204
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:11,667
I will text you the detail...

205
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,895
Auggie, sweetheart.

206
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:24,836
Please tell me you did not hit this.

207
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:28,526
I was trying out a new recipe.
Rock shrimp with a tequila lime sauce.

208
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:33,322
Really? Does that dish
come with a side of total BS?

209
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:34,587
I'm fine.

210
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,441
Sometimes I need to use
alcohol in the kitchen.

211
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,281
No. What you need is to
be on your game tonight.

212
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:42,884
Look, just promise me
that you won't mess this up.

213
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,877
You know how much
this means to me, okay?

214
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,520
I'm sober.
I swear.

215
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,797
Don't test me.
Half my clients are in rehab.

216
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:54,624
And do not be late.

217
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:19,912
Man, what's up?
I'm just on my way out.

218
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,105
A quick, random question for you.

219
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,531
Is there any chance I could maybe

220
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:32,333
- crash on your couch tonight?
- You want to stay here?

221
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,806
- Why?
- Just looking for a quiet place,

222
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,293
somewhere I can start working.

223
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,642
Just on my script
and collect my thoughts.

224
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,723
My head's, like,
totally spinning right now.

225
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:48,595
Riley and I called off
the wedding last night.

226
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,086
Yeah, man. Come in.
Uh, sit down.

227
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:55,597
- Thanks.
- What happened?

228
00:14:56,623 --> 00:14:59,264
We had this come-to-Jesus moment
on our way to elope.

229
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,398
And basically, she admitted she
didn't want to get married.

230
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:06,822
Which pretty much felt
like a rusty dagger

231
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,066
through my heart.

232
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,451
So, I ended it, and...

233
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:15,492
then I did something big.

234
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:17,212
Like, a thing...

235
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,344
I would normally not do.

236
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,047
What did you do?

237
00:15:25,878 --> 00:15:26,934
After the fight,

238
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:30,394
one thing kind of lead
to another, and...

239
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,355
Ella and I sort of hooked up.

240
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,398
That didn't take long
for Ella to pounce, did it?

241
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,538
Ella didn't pounce.

242
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:47,529
It was actually me
who did the pouncing.

243
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:50,490
So, this morning,

244
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,078
I came home and I was totally
ready to do the right thing

245
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,079
and tell Riley,
but she just was so sad

246
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,770
and apologetic...

247
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:01,918
I just... I couldn't get it out.

248
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:05,566
Good.

249
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,963
This stays between you,
me, Ella and the wall.

250
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,369
All right?

251
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,560
You can stay here
as long as you want.

252
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,556
You and Riley are going
to figure things out.

253
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,601
Ella's one night, man.
Riley's forever.

254
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,112
I know, I thought about that, too,

255
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:22,310
but forever with Riley

256
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,023
is just a lifetime
of playing it by ear.

257
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,433
Ella knows what she wants. That's...

258
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:31,565
I got to say, refreshing.

259
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,518
Whatever. Either way, listen.
Do not tell Riley.

260
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,229
Think about it. It'll devastate her.

261
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,942
So, what? I'm supposed to carry
this massive secret around...

262
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:47,660
- for the rest of my life?
- Exactly.

263
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,016
Hey. Jonah, It's Ella.

264
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:01,953
I Never Heard Back From
You About The Party Tonight...

265
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:04,850
And, Well, I Was Wondering
If I Was Going To See You.

266
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:07,400
I Know How Much You
Love An Open Bar.

267
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:11,629
So, Call Me Back.

268
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:13,097
Okay. Bye.

269
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:18,986
First The Fig, Then The Duck,
Dab Of Creme Fraiche,

270
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:21,244
Garnish With The Crispy Sage.
You Got It?

271
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:24,918
Oh, My God. We Have Got To
Get You On Top Chef.

272
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:27,229
Then You Can Introduce Me To Padma.

273
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:29,130
You Good?

274
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:31,811
I Don't Need To Get You To
Say The Alphabet Backwards?

275
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:34,928
Go On Finish It Off.
There's More Where That Came From.

276
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:35,947
The Tap.

277
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:41,459
I'm Sorry To Get All Dr. Drew On You,
It's Just After Seeing Caleb...

278
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:44,910
Get Summarily Canned Right In Front Of
Me, I'm Still A Little Shell-shocked.

279
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,565
Don't Worry.
Tonight Will Be Perfect.

280
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:52,654
Good, Because I Think I Spotted A
Guillotine In Amanda's Penthouse.

281
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,407
Watching Heads Roll Is Probably
Up There With Snuffing Out Careers

282
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,875
And Tasering Her
Enemies' Nether Regions.

283
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,244
I Heard She Bathes In
The Blood Of Virgins

284
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:02,513
And Can Kill A Man
With Her Pinky Finger.

285
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:04,499
- Hi. I'm Ben.
- I Know Who You Are.

286
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:07,293
Born In Buffalo,
Bartended Your Way Through Stanford,

287
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,454
Founded Ziggurat Software,
Bought An Nba Team,

288
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,506
And Started A Charitable Foundation.

289
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,372
You're Ben Brinkley.

290
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:16,261
You're Dating My Boss, And You Just
Heard Every Word I Said About Her.

291
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:18,463
You Only Left Out That

292
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:21,098
I'm Fluent In Klingon And Have
A Bona Fide Fear Of Pigeons.

293
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:24,394
Is That A Case
Of Parker 100 Point Wines?

294
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,666
You Know Your Vino.

295
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:28,933
I Just Had A Bi
G-time Geek Moment In My Wine Cellar.

296
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:31,242
Boy, I Could Stay
Down There For Days.

297
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,194
I've Only Seen These.
I've Never Tasted One.

298
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,340
This Would Go Great With
The Wild Mushroom Ragout.

299
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:37,333
- Yeah, It Would.
- There You Are.

300
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,576
I See You've Met My Boyfriend.

301
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,744
Not Formally.

302
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:46,021
Funny, Ella Was Just
Talking About You.

303
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:48,559
Oh, Behind My Back? I Want Details.

304
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,434
Oh, She Was Just Mentioning...

305
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,216
the Countless Ways You
Motivate And Inspire Her.

306
00:18:57,955 --> 00:18:59,137
Very True.

307
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:24,871
I Saw Auggie Kiss You Last Night.

308
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,418
That Was Kind Of A
Shock For Me, Too.

309
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:34,151
You're Not Into Him?

310
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,542
Last Night,
All I Needed Was A Friend,

311
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,803
And He Ended Up Making A Pass At Me.

312
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,723
After Jonah And I Broke Up.

313
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,767
Oh, God, Riley.

314
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,086
I'm Sorry.

315
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,812
I Had No Idea.

316
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,733
And I'm Sorry About What You
Went Through Last Night.

317
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,826
That Must Have Been So Scary.

318
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:58,696
It Was, But I'm Okay.

319
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,867
You Know What Will Make
Us Both Feel Better,

320
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,369
Is Getting Out Of This
Apartment Building.

321
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:09,249
Did You Get Ella's Text?
We Could Go To That Party.

322
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,709
Come On,
What Else Are You Going To Do?

323
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,169
It'll Be Fun.

324
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:14,587
I Promise.

325
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:26,390
The Floral Arrangements

326
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,993
Have Lilies In Them,
Which Is My Least Favorite Flower.

327
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:30,328
I'll Tell The Party Planner.

328
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,330
Give Me Five Minutes And There
Will Not Be A Lily In Sight.

329
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:34,231
No Excuses, Just Quick Thinking.

330
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:36,442
That's A Very Valuable
Asset In Our Line Of Work.

331
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:38,369
Amanda, This Is Your Night,

332
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:40,838
And I Will Do Whatever It
Takes To Help Make It Perfect.

333
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,573
Your Focus And Your Ambition.

334
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,463
You Remind Me A Lot Of Myself.

335
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:47,045
I Don't Know What To Say.

336
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,876
I Mean, You're... You're My Idol.

337
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,876
You Have It All...
A Thriving Career,

338
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,452
An Amazing Man In Your Life.

339
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:57,088
Well, Sometimes Things Have
A Way Of Falling Into Place.

340
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:59,048
Listen, Angeleno Magazine

341
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,192
Is Going To Be Running
A Full Page Of Photos.

342
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:03,260
I'd Better Not See Lilies
In Any One Of Them.

343
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:04,220
Done.

344
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:07,056
And Thank You For Trusting Me.

345
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:08,725
Loyalty Is Rare In This Town.

346
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:10,968
Get Ready To Be Trusted
With A Lot More.

347
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,014
Oh, My Gosh, You Look Amazing!

348
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:26,326
What A Surprise.

349
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,982
Thank You For Inviting Me.

350
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:29,587
Oh, It Was Amanda's Idea.

351
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:31,079
I'm Just The Carrier Pigeon.

352
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:33,937
Well, Uh,
I'm Gonna Go Get Some Food.

353
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:35,503
Of Course You Are.

354
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,976
So, Riley.

355
00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:40,840
Last Time I Saw You, You Were
In A Pretty Tense Standoff

356
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,383
With Jonah At The Gas Station.

357
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,802
Is Everything Okay?

358
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:47,805
Actually, Jonah And I Had A Very
Honest Conversation This Morning.

359
00:21:52,754 --> 00:21:54,145
Jonah. You're Here?

360
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,359
It's Better To Know Where
Things Stand, Isn't It?

361
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,030
What's That Supposed To Mean?

362
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:16,334
Riley Was Just Telling Me That You
Guys Had Quite The Chat This Morning.

363
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,089
Yes, True Story.

364
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:23,069
That's What We Do, Ella. We Talk.

365
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,996
We Communicate.

366
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:28,202
And What Exactly Did
You Communicate About?

367
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:31,827
Well, Things Are Kind Of...

368
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:33,923
Jonah, Can I Talk
To You For A Second?

369
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:35,913
Yeah, About That Computer Thing?

370
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:37,355
No, About Something Else.

371
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,465
So I Take It You Decided
To Recant Your Confession?

372
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,733
Ella, Come On.

373
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:46,120
It's Not That Easy, Okay?

374
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,098
Really? Because It Was Pretty
Easy For You Last Night...

375
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:52,036
To Tell Me That It
Wn't A One-night Stand.

376
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:56,541
Last Night Would Have Never Happened If
I Knew You Were Gonna Play It This Way.

377
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,114
I'm Not Playing Anything.

378
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:01,087
I'm Just Trying To Figure Out
The Right Way To Do This.

379
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:02,608
Really?

380
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:04,921
'cause It Seems To Me Like,
In The Cold Light Of Day,

381
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:06,342
You Don't Know What You Want.

382
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,248
Kinda Like Somebody Else We Know.

383
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,618
Maybe You Two Are
Perfect For Each Other.

384
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:17,047
What Did Ella Want?

385
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,936
She Looks Pretty Ticked Off.

386
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:23,511
You Know Ella, Right?

387
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,862
Told Her I Wasn't
In The Schmoozing Mood,

388
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,064
And She Just...

389
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:30,992
I Don't Know Why I Let David
Talk Me Into Meeting Him Here.

390
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:33,064
Man, Would You Look At This Shack?

391
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:36,752
Must Be Tough To
Wake Up To This View.

392
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:39,885
He Doesn't Just Keep His
Billions Under His Mattress.

393
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:42,458
The Brinkley Foundation Has
Done Some Amazing Work

394
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,172
For Public Schools.

395
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:47,064
What Does This Remind You Of?

396
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:48,845
What?

397
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,073
The Bar, The Pool,
The Fancy Little Food.

398
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,285
I Give Up. What?

399
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:56,238
Come On. Freshman Year,

400
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,673
The Chancellor's House...

401
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:00,276
My God! How'd I Forget...
The Chancellor'soh, My Gosh!

402
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:02,383
Do You Remember How
Crazy That Night Got?

403
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,485
The Open Bar On Our
Starving Student Budget?

404
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:08,417
That Was The First And
Last Time I Tried Cognac.

405
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:10,286
Remember By The End Of The Night,

406
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:12,825
You Were Smoking That
Sherlock Holmes Pipe?

407
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:16,060
What About The Velvet Slippers?

408
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,997
Remember The Velvet Slippers?

409
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:20,249
I Never Did Find
The Shoes I Came In.

410
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,977
- Who is it?
- Delivery.

411
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,048
Come On In.

412
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,762
Do You Know Lauren Yung?

413
00:25:16,343 --> 00:25:19,046
- Wait. Didn't We Meet At Trudy's Party?
- Were You With Lauren Last Night?

414
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,582
Maybe. What's Going On? Is She Okay?

415
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:26,103
- She Almost Died!
- Get Out Of My Studio!

416
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:28,818
Is That The Only Way You Can Get Any,
Drugging Girls?

417
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,987
Dude, Chill! We Both Know
It Doesn't Take A Pill...

418
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,799
To Get A Girl Like
Lauren To Give It Up.

419
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:34,615
Come On, Man.
She's A Whore.

420
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:52,216
I Am A Guy Who Writes Code,
Not Speeches.

421
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,720
But Amanda Woodward Is A
Woman Who Inspires Words:

422
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:59,405
Fearless, Whip-smart,

423
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:02,927
And In Computer Programmer Way Hot.

424
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:10,943
So, This Being Amanda's Official
Welcome Back To Los Angeles,

425
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:15,446
I Would Like To Present
Her With A Little Something.

426
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,787
Baby, Today And Every Day,

427
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:24,665
I'd Like To Be The Guy That
Gives You What's Best In Life.

428
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,720
Look Behind You.

429
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,192
I Don't Know What To Say. Thank You.

430
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:05,427
- Who Signed You Out?
- I Checked My Vitals.

431
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:07,798
I'm Good To Go.
Promise I'll Return The Scrubs.

432
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,311
- What Happened To You?
- Don't Play Dumb.

433
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:24,079
I Don't Know What
You're Talking About.

434
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:25,226
Your Friend.

435
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:27,816
He Showed Up At My Studio,

436
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,897
Defending Your Honor.

437
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:31,399
Which Friend?

438
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:34,151
That Guy I Met At Trudy's Party.

439
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:37,357
And When I Find Out His Name,
I'm Gonna Press Charges.

440
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:39,386
What Did You Tell Him?

441
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:42,034
Quite The Bedside Manner, Doctor.

442
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,078
You Haven't Even Asked How I Am.

443
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,255
- I Have A Bruised Kidney!
- You Drugged Me...

444
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:56,112
And You Left Me For Dead.

445
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:59,162
As Far As I'm Concerned,
You Got What You Deserved.

446
00:28:12,964 --> 00:28:14,216
What Are You Doing?

447
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:17,403
Knife's So Sharp,
Didn't Even Feel It.

448
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,134
Total Waste Of Good Truffles.

449
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:20,903
My God, You've Been Drinking.

450
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,405
I Had A Little Wine.
So What? I'm Fine.

451
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,307
You Are So Not Fine.

452
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:27,830
Violet, I'm...
Let's Go. Let's Go.

453
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:31,981
As Long As You're Around Riley,

454
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:34,016
As Long As You're Living
In The Same Building,

455
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:37,253
You're Gonna Drink.
And One Day It's Gonna Kill You.

456
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:39,925
Violet, Look, I Appreciate
You Being Concerned About Me,

457
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,858
But You Have No Idea What
You're Talking About.

458
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:43,971
Yes, I Do.

459
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:46,828
I Know What It Feels
Like To Be Obsessed.

460
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:48,897
Staying In That Building
After My Mom Died...

461
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:51,228
Was The Worst Mistake
I've Ever Made.

462
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,602
You Can't Blame Your
Problems On Where We Live.

463
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:56,734
It Doesn't Help To Walk Past
The Spot Where My Mom was Murdered.

464
00:28:56,964 --> 00:29:00,529
And It Doesn't Help You Seeing
Riley Across The Courtyard.

465
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:06,507
Let's Leave...
The Both Of Us.

466
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,186
- Let's Get Out Of This City.
- Violet, I-i Can't Just Leave.

467
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:14,454
- My Whole Life Is Here.
- What Life?

468
00:29:14,982 --> 00:29:16,796
You Can Be A Chef Anywhere.

469
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:22,827
Look, I-i Can't Deal
With This Right Now.

470
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:32,269
You Realize This Could Cover
My Rent For A Decade Or More.

471
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,910
More.

472
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:38,534
A Great Deal More.
Have Patience, Ella.

473
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:42,151
It's Only A Matter Of Time
Before You're Weighed Down...

474
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:45,605
With Jewels Of Your Own.
As If You Need Them.

475
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:48,919
That Smile Of Yours
Outshines Any Of This Bling.

476
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:51,126
Thank You.

477
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:53,541
Do You Want Me To Say That
In My Second Language?

478
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:57,399
- Because I Can.
- Okay, Ben, A Little Tip.

479
00:29:57,949 --> 00:30:00,069
Italian Hot.
Spanish Sexy.

480
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:16,956
Amanda, Wait.

481
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,359
Look, I Wanted To Assure You...

482
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:21,938
That Nothing Inappropriate
Was Going On.

483
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:23,363
It Was Just...

484
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:27,658
Ben Sensed That You
Didn't Like The Car...

485
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,326
And Wanted To Know...

486
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,036
If He Should Go With
His Backup Gift.

487
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,028
So, He Asked Me To Try It On Because
He Needed To Know If It Was Too Much.

488
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:38,210
That Was It, Okay? I Promise
You That You Can Trust Me.

489
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,057
Ella, In What Universe
Would You Think...

490
00:30:41,182 --> 00:30:43,549
For One Moment That
I Was Threatened By You?

491
00:30:44,757 --> 00:30:46,802
- I Wasn't Implying That You...
- You Were,

492
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,345
And It's Presumptuous.

493
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,299
I Mean, You're A Junior Publicist

494
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:51,849
With A Barely There Career...

495
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:53,851
A Nobody In This Town.

496
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:57,138
I Know.

497
00:30:57,531 --> 00:30:58,856
I-i'm Sorry.

498
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,477
You May Fancy Yourself My Protege,

499
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:04,445
But Let's Be Honest,
You Don't Measure Up.

500
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,906
You Have Enough Flash
To Catch The Eye Of Ben...

501
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,183
Or Any Other Man For That Matter...

502
00:31:10,449 --> 00:31:12,703
But They Don't Stay Long, Do They?

503
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:16,415
- I... I Wasn't Trying To...
- Oh, Come On.

504
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:19,543
No One Wears A Dress That
Short Without An Endgame.

505
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:22,755
Is Everything Okay Over Here?

506
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,014
Yeah, Of Course.

507
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,425
Ella, Would You See...

508
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,382
If The Party Planner Needs Any Help?

509
00:31:32,154 --> 00:31:34,410
I Was Just Playing
With Ella Back There.

510
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:36,212
You Know You're The
Only Woman I Want.

511
00:31:36,337 --> 00:31:37,546
Yes, I Know That.

512
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,647
And I Know You Hated The Bentley.

513
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:42,595
It Was A Swing And A Miss,
And I'm Sorry.

514
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:45,444
And Does This Make It Any Better?

515
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:49,949
It's Gorgeous.

516
00:31:50,251 --> 00:31:51,992
I Mean, But Honestly,

517
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:55,955
What You Were Saying
This Morning, I...

518
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,738
Oh, Of Course.

519
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,880
What A Bonehead I Am.
All The Hinting.

520
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:06,549
You Thought I Was Going To Propose.

521
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:09,260
Thank God You Didn't.

522
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,014
I Mean, It Would've Been
A Sweet Gesture, But

523
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,681
We're Not Ready To Take That Step,

524
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,754
And We're Both At
The Top Of Our Games.

525
00:32:16,355 --> 00:32:18,269
Why Would I Want Anything More?

526
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:21,420
Amanda, Sometimes It's Hard
To Know Exactly What You Want.

527
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,899
And Why Should You Know?
It's More Fun This Way.

528
00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:26,610
Fasten This, Will You?

529
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:37,632
They Let You Out?

530
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,291
I Let Myself Out.

531
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:41,522
I Feel Fine.

532
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:45,281
How About You? How Are You Feeling?

533
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:46,678
Fine, I Guess.

534
00:32:46,803 --> 00:32:49,518
I'll Tell You Who's Not
Feeling So Fine Is,

535
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:51,199
Is Record Producer Named Rick.

536
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:53,544
So Fine Yeah, I'll Bet.

537
00:32:56,656 --> 00:32:59,042
That Guy, He's A...
He's Quite A Piece Of Work.

538
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,963
He's A Liar, Obviously.

539
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:03,092
And A Druggie, As It Turns Out.

540
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,821
I Bet He Had Some Nice Stoes
To Tell About Me, Huh?

541
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,574
My Fist Shut Him Up Pretty Fast.

542
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:17,870
No One Should Ever Get Away
With Treating You Like That.

543
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:20,706
I Know.

544
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,251
It's Just That No One's Ever
Stood Up For Me Before.

545
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,958
- I Always Handle Things On My Own.
- You're Not On Your Own Anymore.

546
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,341
You're With Me.

547
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:33,458
I Am.

548
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:36,890
I'm With You, David.

549
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,037
Where Are You Taking Me?

550
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:18,007
Do You Remember What Else Happened
At The Chancellor's Party?

551
00:34:18,512 --> 00:34:19,550
In His Library?

552
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,935
I Think I Still Have
Scars From Those Rug Burns.

553
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:26,048
What Do You Say We Reenact History?

554
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:27,249
Wait. What?

555
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:28,818
Like, Right Here?

556
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,414
Yeah, It's The Perfect Way
To Reboot Our Relationship.

557
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:37,159
Okay, I Just Don't Think...
This Is Such A Good Idea.

558
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,837
Just Relax.

559
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:45,201
Look, I Love A Trip Down Memory
Lane Just As Much As You Do,

560
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:46,792
But We...

561
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:54,867
Riley. Wait, 'cause I...
We Need To Talk Aboumething.

562
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,052
Like, Really Talk.

563
00:34:58,282 --> 00:34:59,221
What Is It?

564
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,159
Last Night, After We, You Know,

565
00:35:10,284 --> 00:35:12,109
Called It All Off,

566
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:14,027
I Was Just...

567
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:17,357
I Was Completely Rocked.

568
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:21,459
Like, I Thought It Was Really Over.

569
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:25,622
What Do You Think Now?

570
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:34,757
If There's Any Chance
We Can Go Back To The Way It Was,

571
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:37,176
Like, Any Chance At All,

572
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,387
There's Something You Need To Know.

573
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:48,821
I Slept With Ella Last Night.

574
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:54,985
What?

575
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,115
I'm Sorry.

576
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:02,186
You're Sorry?

577
00:36:03,404 --> 00:36:06,539
I... I Don't Even Know Who You Are.

578
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,131
The Painting
I'm Looking For Isn't Here.

579
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:26,189
Are You Sure You Searched Every
Apartment In The Complex?

580
00:36:26,499 --> 00:36:29,103
Searched And Shot
Film In All But One.

581
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,397
Couldn't Get Into David Appartment,
Because He Was Home And Awake.

582
00:36:33,595 --> 00:36:35,676
Well, I Was Hoping To
Do This From A Distance,

583
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:38,323
But I Guess I'm Going To
Have To Get Closer To Them...

584
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,088
Than I Had Originally Thought.

585
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:49,748
Riley Bolted Out Of
That Party So Fast...

586
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:51,893
That Jasper Barnes...

587
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:54,047
Almost Fell Into The Pool.

588
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,125
I'm Guessing You Told Her.

589
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,597
Good Guess.

590
00:37:00,812 --> 00:37:02,834
You Didn't Think About Finding Me...

591
00:37:03,362 --> 00:37:04,863
And Filling Me In?

592
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:09,017
Did You Really Want To
Hear How Hurt She Was?

593
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:11,770
How The Look On Her Face Made Me...

594
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,821
Feel Like Just A Total
Failure As A Human Being?

595
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:19,008
Why Don't We Go Back To My
Apartment And We Can Talk?

596
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,206
The Last 24 Hours Have Just Been...

597
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:31,130
Pretty Overwhelming.

598
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,960
I Just Need Some Time To Think.

599
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,642
Okay, You Go...

600
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,511
Think, Socrates.

601
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,474
I'll Just Be Over Here On
My Side Of The Courtyard.

602
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:06,095
Are You Okay?

603
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:08,702
I'm So Much More Than Okay.

604
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,467
I'll Be Right Back.

605
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:26,599
Are You All Right?

606
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:35,953
- I Told Her.
- Oh, Man. Oh.

607
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,985
Oh, I'm Sorry. Um...

608
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:44,238
I'll Call My Buddy Travis.

609
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,340
He's Got A, Like, An Air Mattress.

610
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:51,370
Whatever Happened,
You're Staying Here.

611
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,794
Your Friend Needs You.

612
00:39:05,148 --> 00:39:08,320
Dude, You're Going To Be Okay.
You're Going To Be All Right, Man.

613
00:40:35,174 --> 00:40:38,085
<i>"I Know I Should've Said Good-bye In
Person,</i>

614
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,212
<i>but I Always Want To Remember You
Smiling."</i>

615
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:50,197
<i>"All I Want Is For You To Be Happy,
Riley.</i>

616
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,699
<i>Love, Auggie."</i>
