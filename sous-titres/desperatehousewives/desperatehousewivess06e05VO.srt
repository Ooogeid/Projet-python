on Depserate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:05,465
I booked our room at the motel...
I don't want to be alone tonight.

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:08,060
- Neither do I.
- <i>Affairs got serious...</i>

4
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:11,256
If you got hit by a bus,
I'd really miss you.

5
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:15,265
- You're showering alone tonight.
- I love you. There. I said it.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,512
- <i>An ex-lover...</i>
- What are you doing?

7
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:20,432
Letting you know I'm here.
Let's just say he was grateful...

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,938
very grateful.

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,042
<i>spun out of control.</i>

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,861
- You're fired.
- <i>And when a crime was committed...</i>

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,892
- <i>A neighbor was suspected.</i>
- Everybody thinks I'm the perv

12
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,540
- who attacked Julie.
- Just in case someone should try

13
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:36,995
hurt you, do you know
where your we keep the gun?

14
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,458
<i>But it was the victim,</i>

15
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,625
What were you thinking,
dating a married man?

16
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:41,958
<i>Who had secrets.</i>

17
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:43,696
I miss you.

18
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:53,633
<i>It is in our nature to judge
the people around us.</i>

19
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:58,158
<i>We judge the way strangers dress.</i>

20
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,100
<i>The way our neighbors
tend their lawns...</i>

21
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:09,832
<i>And the way our
friends act in public.</i>

22
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,099
<i>Yes, we make these judgments
all the time,</i>

23
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:18,516
<i>never thinking that one day</i>

24
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:20,497
<i>we may be judged...</i>

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,374
<i>ourselves.</i>

26
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:30,893
Girls, what are you doing?

27
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,922
- For Pete's sake.
- My arm.

28
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,549
What did I tell you about
sliding down the staircase?

29
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,306
Not to use the good suitcase?

30
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:40,637
Besides that. Don't do it at all!

31
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:42,880
What are we supposed to do?

32
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,058
You won't let us play
on the roof anymore.

33
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,688
What happened?

34
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:52,482
Don't worry. She's okay.
These two knuckleheads decided

35
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:54,739
to slide down the staircase.

36
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,188
- Why would you let them do that?
- Don't blame me.

37
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:00,073
- I wasn't envn in the room.
- You left the girls unsupervised?

38
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:02,493
They were playing.

39
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,439
- I can't watch 'em every second.
- Why not?

40
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,552
I look after Juanita
when she's at my house

41
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,572
and she goes home without a scratch.

42
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,721
Only 'cause she's indestructible.

43
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:14,022
Honey, do that thing
where you run into the wall.

44
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:15,547
Watch. This is hilarious.

45
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:20,135
You're pretty cavalier considering your
carelessness almost killed my daughter.

46
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,089
I gotta say, Laura,

47
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:29,844
you're kind of a wet blanket
since you quit smoking.

48
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,438
Why don't you try a pipe?

49
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:34,299
And I've got to say, Gaby,

50
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:36,526
I think you're a lousy mother.

51
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:39,446
Did you just say that to my face?

52
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:42,809
Yes, and I'm afraid I won't be bringing
my daughter here anymore.

53
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,869
The safety and well-being
of my child must come first.

54
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,755
Fine. Juanita only had Rachel over
because she felt sorry for her.

55
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,374
It was a pity playdate.

56
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:56,346
And of course this means Rachel won't
be attending Juanita's birthday party.

57
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:00,008
More cake for us!
Beat it!

58
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,150
Let's go, sweetie.

59
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,484
<i>Yes, it's in our nature</i>

60
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,870
<i>to judge those around us.</i>

61
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,351
<i>It's also in our nature...</i>

62
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:13,024
If you had taught your kid
how to tuck and roll on impact,

63
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:15,470
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation!

64
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,027
<i>To blame someone else
for our mistakes.</i>

Welcome home.

80
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,799
I've been so worried about you.

81
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:34,727
Is there someplace we can talk?

82
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,230
We're not doing this anymore.

83
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:40,572
Please.

84
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:42,589
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:43,987
It's over.

86
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:05,698
I am so sorry I'm late.
I have three parties this weekend

87
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:09,470
- and I'm up to my elbows in canapés.
- Why isn't Katherine helping you?

88
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,696
- I had to let her go.
- What?

89
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:15,266
- You're kidding.
- We were working and she went berserk.

90
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:19,355
And then when I fired her,
she intentionally scratched my car.

91
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,831
I flipped her the bird
the other day after she cut me off.

92
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,485
Won't make that mistake again.

93
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:27,283
- I think she needs help.
- I think she's a drama queen.

94
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,887
But if she is in trouble,
and we don't do anything,

95
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,137
it could be
Mary Alice all over again.

96
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:34,163
I don't know.
Susan, what do you think?

97
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,139
She's going through a rough time,

98
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:38,539
but I have trouble
feeling sorry for her.

99
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,919
I get that, after that stunt
at your wedding.

100
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:44,547
True. And did you tell them about
Katherine hitting on Mike?

101
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:46,841
What?
When did that happen?

102
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,302
He did mention it, didn't he?

103
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:56,891
Of course.

104
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,646
We laugh about it all the time.

105
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:03,855
And look. There's Mike now and...

106
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:06,945
I could use a good laugh.
Would you excuse me?

107
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:11,728
Sweetie, can I talk to you a second?

108
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,666
If it was no big deal,
why didn't you just tell me?

109
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,384
Julie was in the hospital.
I didn't tell you because I,

110
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,639
crazy me,
thought it might upset you.

111
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,896
And here's why I'm upset...
'cause now I realize

112
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,083
that Katherine is not hurting.
She's plotting.

113
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,882
- So I'm gonna go over there...
- You do not pour gasoline on this fire.

114
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:30,696
You're right. I wanna
pour gasoline on Katherine.

115
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,601
And if you love me,
you'll give me a match and an alibi.

116
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,725
Let her have her lies. Let her plot.

117
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,851
You got nothing to worry about.

118
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:41,521
You mean everything to me
and Katherine means nothing.

119
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,945
That's sweet.

120
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:48,588
- I'm gonna go tell her you said that.
- Get back here.

121
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,730
Wanna talk about it?

122
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,922
Sure. Let's have a nice father/son
chat about how you're cheatin' on mom.

123
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:07,836
Do you know how stupid I felt?

124
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,201
I got into a huge fight with Julie
'cause I thought she was lying to me,

125
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:14,137
that she was just telling me she
had a boyfriend to blow me off.

126
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:16,014
And I followed her home and...

127
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:18,391
it turns out
she does have a boyfriend,

128
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:19,862
you.

129
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:22,652
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:25,986
And for what it's worth,

131
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:27,275
it's over.

132
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,500
If I ever see
you two together again...

133
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:35,408
I'm gonna tell mom.

134
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,570
You wanna tell your mother?

135
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,460
Come on.
Let's go right now. Come on.

136
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:47,962
What?

137
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:51,644
You think you can dangle
that ax over my head?

138
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:53,092
Then go for it.

139
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,767
So you want mom to know?

140
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:59,140
You want to destroy her life?

141
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:02,853
Your mom finding out that I had
an affair won't destroy her.

142
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,480
Her finding out that you knew
about it? That will.

143
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,773
I'm the bad guy.

144
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:12,445
You think your mom's
the perfect one in this marriage?

145
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,283
There you two are.
They're bringing out a cake for Julie.

146
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:22,455
Everything okay out here?

147
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,749
Just having
a little father/son chat.

148
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,445
That's my boys.

149
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,395
Come on.
They're cuttin' the cake.

150
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,653
Come in!

151
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,449
When you've needed a favor,
have I ever let you down?

152
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:03,365
Last month we needed a sitter for Penny
but you didn't want to miss Oktoberfest.

153
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,875
- And just last Thursday...
- New way in.

154
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:09,168
I got a problem with Roy.
He's been kinda down lately.

155
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,727
What's wrong?

156
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:13,965
He lives on a fixed income and
he can't afford to pay for nice dinners.

157
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:17,046
But when I pay, he sulks.
He says I'm keeping him.

158
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:20,447
At his age, he should be glad
to have something keeping him

159
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:23,051
besides formaldehyde.
You know what I mean?

160
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:25,063
And the favor would be?

161
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:28,299
I was thinking maybe
you and Tom could hire him

162
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,821
for a few hours
a week as a handyman.

163
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:33,901
So he'd have
a little walking around money.

164
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:36,987
I don't know.

165
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,249
Girl talk time.

166
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:43,906
When Roy's spirits are drooping,
the problem is global.

167
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:45,576
You get the picture?

168
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:48,808
Getting the picture isn't the problem.
It's getting rid of it.

169
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:50,835
Come on. Try him for one week.

170
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,359
I'm only hesitant
because he's your boyfriend

171
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:56,257
and I'd hate to risk
straining a good friendship.

172
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:59,802
If I were that good a friend, would I
be putting you in this awkward position?

173
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:02,992
Excellent point.

174
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:05,684
- He's hired.
- Thanks.

175
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:08,759
You'll never know
what you've done for my sex life.

176
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,319
Good.

177
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,946
- I love it that you do that.
- What?

178
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:27,901
When I first brought you here, you
didn't want to set foot in this room.

179
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,312
And now you get sad
every time we have to leave.

180
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:34,440
It's now our place.

181
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:37,974
It's not what I would've chosen
but it's growing on me.

182
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,390
I'm sorry.
I thought you checked out.

183
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:48,237
It's okay. We're just going.
Tip's on the dresser.

184
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:49,815
Thank you, sir.

185
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,698
Excuse me.

186
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:01,030
I seem to have lost
an earring... a little pearl stud.

187
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,365
- I can help you look for it.
- Thank you.

188
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:15,253
No, I told you your gray suit
is at the tailor's.

189
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,077
Where am I now?

190
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,503
At the supermarket
getting us something for dinner.

191
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,850
You already did all the shopping?
Great.

192
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,550
I will just put all this food away
and come straight home.

193
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:32,520
Found it.

194
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,680
It was buried in the sheets.

195
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,687
Thank you very much.
Let me get you a little something.

196
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:42,513
My wallet's here somewhere.

197
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:44,193
That's all right.

198
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,495
I'm sure you're eager
to get home to your husband

199
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:01,309
Thanks for letting me know.

200
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,955
What's wrong?

201
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:07,668
Heidi Bremer just informed me
her kid can't come on Saturday.

202
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:10,922
She and Don are going to
the nursing home to visit his mother.

203
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,967
- So why are you mad?
- Because it's a lie! Heidi hates her!

204
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:17,831
She wouldn't cross the street
to visit that drooling fossil.

205
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:21,824
And that's the third cancellation,
and every excuse has been a crock.

206
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,280
Why would people lie
to get out of a kid's party?

207
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,008
Because Laura Miller's
out there spreading her poison.

208
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:30,649
She's telling every woman in the P.T.A.
their kids aren't safe in my house.

209
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,878
Those hausfrau cronies of hers
are lapping it up.

210
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,915
Juanita will be heartbroken
if no one comes to her party.

211
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:40,009
They'll come.
We just have to build it, that's all.

212
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:43,632
This is about to cost me money,
isn't it?

213
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:46,734
There are women
who think I'm a bad mother.

214
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:50,306
It is your job to support me. Now
just shut up and fork over some cash.

215
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:55,257
Wouldn't it be easier to just
watch the kids while they play?

216
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,105
Did you just say that to my face?

217
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:02,109
Here.
Take the whole wallet.

218
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,588
Voilà. Grilled langoustine.
Your favorite.

219
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,953
How very thoughtful of you.

220
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:14,983
They weren't easy to find.

221
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:17,800
The man at one store
tried to sell me shrimp.

222
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:21,337
And when I tried to explain
the difference, he gave me an argument.

223
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:23,969
What is it with service people
these days?

224
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,669
They used to be polite
and deferential.

225
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,853
Now they just sneer

226
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,180
right in your face.
It's intolerable.

227
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,559
I wouldn't let it spoil
a nice dinner.

228
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,644
Sorry, I had a very irksome
encounter myself today.

229
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,198
Really? Where?

230
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:41,043
At a... café.

231
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:46,363
I was having lunch,
and this waitress was

232
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,072
rude and superior.

233
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:49,983
Superior? To you?

234
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,007
You should've whipped out
a copy of your best-selling cookbook,

235
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,496
like you did last week
in the food court at the mall.

236
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:57,915
I doubt this woman
would've been impressed.

237
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:01,096
Really? You sure put
that pretzel vendor in his place.

238
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,624
I was so startled, I didn't know
what to say. I just...

239
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,967
- let it go.
- Is this a café you frequent often?

240
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,973
As often as I can.

241
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,745
Next time you're in there,
I think you should clear the air.

242
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:16,350
Demand a little courtesy.

243
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,331
Thank you, Orson.
I think I may do that tomorrow.

244
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:23,691
This is nice, isn't it?
Sharing a meal,

245
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:25,651
talking about our days.

246
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,717
Why don't you pass
on that café tomorrow

247
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,449
and let me make you
a nice salad or an omelet?

248
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:33,403
Thank you, dear,

249
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,838
but tomorrow I'm planning
on having something a bit spicier.

250
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:42,191
Look what Roy did.

251
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,529
Open. Closed. Open! Closed!

252
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,673
We don't need to use
that spatula anymore!

253
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:49,249
That's great!

254
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:54,413
Since you're so ingenious,
how about you build some flower boxes

255
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,283
- for our bedroom windows?
- Our window if you want

256
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,106
- but not the kids'.
- Why not?

257
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,525
- Cause they'll never water 'em.
- I'll remind 'em.

258
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,206
They can't keep a goldfish alive
for more than one day.

259
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:07,171
What makes you think they're
gonna take better care of geraniums?

260
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:09,653
I don't know. I just know
we're getting flower boxes.

261
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,038
You could go ahead
and get those started.

262
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,216
Are you good with this, Mr. Scavo?

263
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:21,290
Sure. What the hell.

264
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,873
- I'll go measure the windows.
- Thanks, Roy.

265
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,216
- What was that?
- What?

266
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,259
He just went over my head to you.

267
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,887
I knew I liked that guy
the minute he walked in.

268
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,223
Look!

269
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:41,036
Open. Closed. Open! Closed!

270
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:55,815
I'm glad you're here, Laura.
I wanted to apologize.

271
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:59,187
Things got a little heated and we both
said some things we didn't mean.

272
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:01,132
I appreciate that, Gabrielle.

273
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:02,508
Good.

274
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:07,786
Now that that's behind us,
if Rachel would like to come

275
00:16:07,956 --> 00:16:10,381
to Juanita's birthday party,
we'd love to have her.

276
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:13,033
Sorry, but I'm still not
comfortable with that.

277
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:14,301
That's a shame.

278
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:17,126
We're gonna have
face painting and...

279
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,976
a cotton candy machine...

280
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:22,101
- and a clown.
- A clown?! Where's a clown?!

281
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,699
Not here, sweetie.

282
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:26,100
He'll be at Juanita's
birthday party on saturday...

283
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,219
the one your mommy
won't let you go to.

284
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:31,402
- I wanna go!
- Rachel, we'll talk about it later.

285
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,743
What are you doing?

286
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,741
I'm sorry. She asked me a question.
I just answered it.

287
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:41,479
For example, if she were to ask me
if we were having a bouncy house,

288
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,506
I'd have to say, "just the biggest
bouncy house you've ever seen!"

289
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:47,543
- A bouncy house!
- I love bouncy houses!

290
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,807
Is the clown gonna
be in the bouncy house?

291
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:52,840
Maybe, but you'll never know.

292
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:55,721
Please.

293
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,225
You're right. I'm sorry.
This is cruel.

294
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:01,137
Come on, Juanita.
We gotta buy bananas.

295
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:04,184
The people at your party are gonna
want something to feed the monkey.

296
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:06,437
- A monkey?!
- Mommy!

297
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,899
<i>We'll talk about it later.</i>

298
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:19,385
Excuse me?

299
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,399
Did you need something in your room?

300
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,539
I'm not checked in.
I came here to see you.

301
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:28,792
I don't have any weed, lady.

302
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:29,965
Sorry?

303
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:33,591
All you ladies with the nice cars
thinks anyone who talks like this

304
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,341
must have ganja to sell.

305
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,682
I am not here to buy ganja.

306
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:39,094
I came about yesterday.

307
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,057
I appreciated you finding my earring,
but I didn't care for your attitude.

308
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,371
It was very insulting.

309
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,229
Did I say one cross word to you?

310
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:50,634
You didn't need to.

311
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,400
Your disdain was perfectly clear
from the look you gave me.

312
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,153
And there is it again.

313
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,240
I have 12 rooms to do.
I don't have time to argue.

314
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,099
Fine. Then I'll help.

315
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:07,199
Lady, please.

316
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:09,454
I won't look at you no more, okay?

317
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:12,336
I'm just saying you shouldn't make
snap judgments about people.

318
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:17,007
You see I'm having an affair,
And you just assume I'm a bad person...

319
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:18,933
And a dope fiend.

320
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:21,284
If you knew more about my marriage,

321
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,472
you'd see me very differently.

322
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:26,809
I don't need to know
about your marriage.

323
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:30,443
If you're going to form opinions
about it, then yes, you do.

324
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:33,842
My husband is a controlling ex-con.

325
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:35,858
I've begged him for a divorce

326
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:38,278
but he won't let me go.
I'm practically his prisoner.

327
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:40,072
Your husband's a good man.

328
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:42,116
You know nothing about him.

329
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,243
I know he does your shopping
for you.

330
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:49,218
When you lied to him on the phone,
told him you were at the grocery store.

331
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:52,464
- He said he already went.
- And your point is?

332
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,294
You know what I would give
to have a man do my shopping for me,

333
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:59,054
make my life a little bit easier?
And you're not even grateful.

334
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,219
You're just sneaking off here
to do the nasty with your boyfriend.

335
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:06,437
Who are you to judge me?
You can't even make hospital corners!

336
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,073
What do you want me to say?

337
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,936
That cheating's not a sin
when you do it in pearls?

338
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,032
Unless you want to start on
the toilet,

339
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:16,400
I think we're done.

340
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,570
These flower boxes
are really coming along.

341
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,700
If you have a moment...
no rush...

342
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,085
would you hang this birdhouse
for me?

343
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:40,179
I was thinking on that big tree.

344
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:41,589
You got it.

345
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:42,756
Thanks.

346
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:47,181
Over there. That tree.

347
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,469
I was talking to Tom
about it this morning

348
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:52,486
and, he wants it over here.

349
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:56,626
Well, that's probably because
he forgot the sprinklers go off

350
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:58,098
over there. So...

351
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,783
do me a favor
and hang it in that tree.

352
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:02,355
Thank you.

353
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,842
... cause she's telling me she wants it
on the other side of the yard.

354
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,427
Gotta go.

355
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:23,313
Boy, you're everywhere.

356
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,056
We should get you a bell.

357
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,642
Why you calling Tom?

358
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,867
To make sure he's okay with
where you wanna hang this thing.

359
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:32,356
I mean, he is the man of the house.

360
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:36,173
Okay, I know,
since you're using a cell phone,

361
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,611
you know what century it is,
but just to clarify...

362
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,904
you don't have to
keep checking with Tom.

363
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:43,033
I make plenty of decisions
around here.

364
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:44,418
I noticed.

365
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,871
I just prefer to treat the guy
with a little respect.

366
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:49,456
Excuse me?

367
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:53,043
Just cause you like crunching
his walnuts doesn't mean I do.

368
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,397
I beg your pardon!

369
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,524
His walnuts are completely intact!

370
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,634
And you know what? I think
we are done here. You can go.

371
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,234
Fine. Soon as I hang this birdhouse.

372
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:07,545
And he said he doesn't care
where it is, so you win... again.

373
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:09,710
This isn't about winning!

374
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:12,688
And I just fired you,
so you can go home.

375
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:17,234
I promised Tom I'd do this
and I'm doing it.

376
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:27,911
I'd clean that up,
but you just fired me.

377
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,084
Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry.
I thought you saw me.

378
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:48,140
No. It's okay.

379
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,166
I was... just...

380
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,633
Yeah, I shoulda realized.
I'm sorry.

381
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,242
I guess you heard
that after it happened,

382
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,527
some people thought that...

383
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,165
I know it wasn't you, Danny.

384
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:10,871
That night we argued,
you said you were seeing a guy.

385
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:15,667
You think maybe he had
something to do with it?

386
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:18,531
I thought about it,

387
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,780
but no.

388
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:22,007
He's not that kind of guy.

389
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:24,805
So you have no idea?

390
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:26,267
I wish I did.

391
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:28,729
I haven't been able to sleep.

392
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:31,439
Every time I'm about
to close my eyes,

393
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:33,936
I'm afraid he'll be there
when I wake up.

394
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,386
You know what?

395
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:40,036
I think I might
have something to help.

396
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,380
Thank you, all, for volunteering.

397
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,712
Here's the thing. Whoever
attacked Julie is still out there, so,

398
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,647
it's up to us to look out
for each other which is where

399
00:23:03,814 --> 00:23:06,093
the neighbor watch comes in.

400
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,935
Susan's gonna talk to you
about patrol duty.

401
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,717
What is she patrolling for?
His tonsils?

402
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:32,885
We still need people for

403
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:35,414
9:00 to midnight on thursday.
Any volunteers?

404
00:23:38,612 --> 00:23:39,962
"Project runway."

405
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,966
We have Mona Clarke...

406
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:49,845
and Irma Pritchet.

407
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:54,135
No one else?

408
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:58,145
Okay, meeting adjourned.

409
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:02,149
There's coffee back in the kitchen.

410
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,273
Mrs. Pritchet's got
a clogged shower drain,

411
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,640
and I promised I'd fix it for her.

412
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:16,959
I don't think she saw that one.
You wanna do it again?

413
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:18,676
I'll see you at home.

414
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,046
A word?

415
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,676
Did you not see my hand up?
I was trying to volunteer.

416
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,926
I saw.

417
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:33,478
I was just trying to pick the people

418
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:35,891
who I thought could best
protect our neighborhood.

419
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,041
So you picked Irma Pritchet?

420
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,479
Her son is in a nursing home.

421
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:42,544
Irma is old

422
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:45,230
but she's not a big fat liar.

423
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,943
Excuse me?

424
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:53,075
Well, are younot going around
saying that my husband hit on you?

425
00:24:57,302 --> 00:25:00,701
I know you're under
a terrible strain, but...

426
00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:03,228
do you really think
it's a good idea to air...

427
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,504
your dirty laundry
in front of all these people?

428
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:10,075
You're the one with dirty laundry.
My laundry is clean,

429
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,242
folded and put away, you loon.

430
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:14,971
Girls? Everything all right here?

431
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:17,425
It's not.

432
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:19,476
First she calls me a liar,

433
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:21,933
and now I'm a loon.

434
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:26,233
You all heard the things she was saying.
You saw the way she acted at my wedding.

435
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,318
Not everyone was invited
to your wedding.

436
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,272
Jeez, Mona. You're like a dog
with a bone. Let it go.

437
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,913
I understand why you're upset.

438
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,660
I'd be on edge, too,
if my marriage were having problems.

439
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,132
Okay, Mike and I are
perfectly happy,

440
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,233
and the only problem we have is you.

441
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,583
So stay out of our lives,
or you'll be sorry.

442
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:49,005
If you two are so happy. Then
where did he just disappear to?

443
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,984
He's snaking a lady's drain, okay?

444
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:58,249
And, yes,
I realize how that sounded.

445
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:00,566
Get your minds ut of the gutter.

446
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:09,899
Have fun.

447
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:13,039
Coco the clown will make you
any balloon animal you want.

448
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,552
You know, maybe I should
stay for a little while.

449
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:19,088
Come on. I'm watching them.
I've got everything under control.

450
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:20,605
Will you be here?

451
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:28,391
Could you believe her?
I'm a good mom, aren't I?

452
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,381
- People trust me.
- I brought my kid, didn't I?

453
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,631
You did.

454
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,250
But wait. You're staying.

455
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,250
I'll get us drinks.

456
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,984
Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?
Aren't you having a good time?

457
00:26:44,151 --> 00:26:45,984
The man is putting the monkey away.

458
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:48,398
He said he was too tired
to play anymore.

459
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:52,947
I don't think so.
That ape is on the clock till 4:00.

460
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,530
What gives?

461
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,992
Sorry. Mr. Fibbs did two shows
yesterday. He needs a nap.

462
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,205
No way. I paid for two hours of monkey.
I want two hours of monkey.

463
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,806
Let him go.
I can do the gig alone.

464
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,988
No offense, Coco, but I need this
to be the greatest party ever,

465
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:11,755
and your act isn't exactly
zingin' the kids.

466
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,972
I killed at your other kid's party.

467
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:17,085
Those kids were 3!
These are 7-year-olds! The big time!

468
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,826
Crappy balloon animals ain't
gonna cut it! We need the monkey!

469
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,223
Lady, he's tired.

470
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,851
Well, then give him some
bana-flavored coffee.

471
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,666
You screw me on this and I swear,

472
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:28,113
Fibbs will never work
in this town again.

473
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:37,948
Come in.

474
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:43,279
- You called for a lightbulb?
- The bedside lamp.

475
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,118
I saw you pull in an hour ago.

476
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:54,673
Your gentleman friend stand you up?

477
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,134
Sorry to disappoint you
but he just called. He's on his way.

478
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:01,388
That's nice.

479
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:07,234
Well, if you finish your magazine,
there's a bible in the nightstand.

480
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:11,168
Tell me something.
Did he cheat on you just once

481
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:13,285
or did he do it all the time?

482
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,294
Who?

483
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,593
I've been wondering
what makes a woman

484
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,248
so quick to judge anyone
who has an affair,

485
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:23,865
and I think I know.

486
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,917
Your husband cheated on you,
didn't he?

487
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,167
My husband...

488
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,710
was the best man that I ever knew.

489
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:45,385
But a good man

490
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:47,907
wasn't good enough for me.

491
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,144
I was like you.

492
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:52,188
I wanted fun, excitement,

493
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:54,488
so I found myself a boyfriend.

494
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:57,897
Good-looking guy. Sexy.

495
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:01,614
And we had ourselves a real good time.
You having a good time, lady?

496
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:04,933
Yes, I am.

497
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:09,561
Enjoy it while it lasts.

498
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,250
It didn't last long for me.

499
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,050
And when it was done,

500
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:15,892
I had no husband

501
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:17,964
and no boyfriend.

502
00:29:19,852 --> 00:29:21,652
So now I'm cleaning rooms.

503
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:26,077
Every day, I see women in here
acting just as stupid as I was.

504
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,750
I don't say a word to them.

505
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,920
I just give them a look.

506
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:35,719
Well, I'm...

507
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:38,625
sorry your affair ended so badly.

508
00:29:39,463 --> 00:29:41,863
But that doesn't mean
that mine will.

509
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:01,459
You seem like a nice lady.

510
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,135
Don't you ever feel guilty?

511
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,255
Yes, all right?

512
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:17,816
Yes, I feel guilty all the time.

513
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:23,277
You don't know what it's like
when I come home,

514
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:26,241
and my husband's at the door

515
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:30,071
and there's such love
in his eyes, such...

516
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:31,915
hope.

517
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:36,554
And I wanna shake him
and say, "stop it.

518
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:40,430
Stop loving me.
I'm not worth it anymore."

519
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:45,395
Don't you want to be worth it again?

520
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:51,663
Hi, honey, I'm so sorry.

521
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:55,331
Is there some kind of problem?

522
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:57,804
No, sir.

523
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:01,216
Just turning on a light.

524
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,153
There you are.

525
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,271
Now it's a kids' party.

526
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:19,836
You still mad about Laura?

527
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,912
The party's a success.
The kids are having a great time.

528
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,605
We're drinkin' margaritas.
What's not to likey?

529
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,972
You know what?
You're right. I won.

530
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,695
Laura and her stuck-ip posse thought
her kids weren't safe in my house.

531
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:39,105
I've shown them the best time
they're gonna have all year.

532
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:43,651
I know. They're loud.
Kids! Adults talking!

533
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,583
No, I think that there's a problem.

534
00:31:46,193 --> 00:31:49,343
- What's goin' on?
- The monkey's killing the clown!

535
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,834
I've gotta get my tranquilizer gun.

536
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,691
I told you he need a nap!
He was already on edge,

537
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:06,687
and then that damn clown
popped a balloon in his face!

538
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,709
Laura, I was here every minute!

539
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:24,605
It's not my fault they sent us
a homicidal monkey!

540
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:26,117
The important part

541
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:28,958
is the kids had a good time
and created lifelong memories.

542
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:37,638
You forgot your goody bag!

543
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:44,231
So I still don't get
why you fired Roy.

544
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,143
I mean, he was putting the birdhouse
where you wanted it, right?

545
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,798
It's not about that.
He said I emasculate you.

546
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:53,272
- He said that?
- Well, not in those words.

547
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,516
He went with a more colorful
nutcracking analogy.

548
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,727
- He is funny.
- He is not funny!

549
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:03,064
And this would be a really good place
for you to jump in and tell me I'm not

550
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,147
- a castrating bitch.
- Sure.

551
00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:06,818
Just put down the knife first.

552
00:33:09,352 --> 00:33:11,488
We are not laughing
at this at all, huh?

553
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:12,657
Come on, babe.

554
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,149
We're great. You know that.
What do you care what he thinks?

555
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,665
I don't care. It's just...
it bugs me that he's judging me.

556
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:26,337
- What are you doing with that?
- I thought I'd barbecue some chicken.

557
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:29,706
It's almost dinnertime,
and that's still frozen.

558
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:32,222
Just get some burgers
from the garage.

559
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:33,807
You got it.

560
00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:50,862
Can I talk to you?

561
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,198
Sure thing, pally.
Here. Take a load off.

562
00:33:56,454 --> 00:33:59,546
If it's about me getting into it
with your wife, though,

563
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:02,832
I have to stop you first
and say I'm sorry.

564
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,469
Well, thanks.

565
00:34:04,636 --> 00:34:06,886
I mean, I know times have changed,

566
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,753
but a man's still a man,

567
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,674
and you deserve
to have your wife respect you.

568
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,760
She respects me plenty, Roy.

569
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:19,306
Here's the thing

570
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:22,269
you gotta understand about Lynette.

571
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:27,290
She grew up without her dad.
Her mom was a drinker.

572
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:30,107
So she had to be responsible
for everyone.

573
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,401
Well, that's rough.

574
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,925
It left her with this constant

575
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:41,131
fear that everything
could suddenly fall apart.

576
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,291
And that's why she needs
to control everything.

577
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,926
Of course, she can't.

578
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:49,687
Nobody can.

579
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:51,224
But...

580
00:34:52,468 --> 00:34:54,609
she can control me...

581
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,869
if I let her.

582
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:00,461
So I do...

583
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:05,013
because it makes her feel safe.

584
00:35:08,364 --> 00:35:09,764
And that is my job

585
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:11,976
as her husband...

586
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:15,684
to make her feel safe.

587
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,930
You're a good man, Scavo.

588
00:35:27,764 --> 00:35:28,764
I try.

589
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:31,838
Now...
if you'll excuse me,

590
00:35:32,486 --> 00:35:34,841
I have hamburger to fetch.

591
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:44,881
Stop beating yourself up.
It wasn't that bad.

592
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:49,034
Carlos, a monkey
almost killed a clown.

593
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:51,858
That is the definition
of a bad children's party.

594
00:35:57,664 --> 00:35:59,914
Laura's right.
I'm a terrible mom.

595
00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:02,157
Come here.

596
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:06,097
Look...

597
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:09,425
I am no expert at raising children.

598
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,367
All I know is,

599
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:14,965
when all those other kids
ran screaming to their moms,

600
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:19,331
Juanita jumped in the bouncy house and
zipped it up and Celia played dead.

601
00:36:19,586 --> 00:36:21,186
Those girls are smart.

602
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:24,037
They were quick
on their feet, weren't they?

603
00:36:24,204 --> 00:36:28,153
Which they wouldn't be if you'd been
hovering all over 'em their whole lives.

604
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,309
They have learned to be
independent and resourceful,

605
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:33,926
and that is thanks
to your negligence.

606
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,688
So sweet.

607
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:41,436
That better not be
the good suitcase!

608
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:52,924
- Sweetie?
- Get mike!

609
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:55,755
- He's on a job. What's going on?
- Somebody is outside.

610
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,882
Oh, my God.
What is that?!

611
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:00,718
- It's a gun.
- Where did you get that?!

612
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,468
Give that to me.
What are you thinking?

613
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:07,077
It's loaded, right?

614
00:37:15,787 --> 00:37:17,283
I have a gun!

615
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,550
I've called the police!
They'll be here any minute!

616
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:40,800
You shot me!

617
00:37:45,623 --> 00:37:46,891
The gun just went off!

618
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,308
- Are you all right?
- You tried to kill me!

619
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,196
I just shot you. Let's not be
throwing accusations around.

620
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:55,643
It looks like it just grazed your
shoulder. There's hardly any blood.

621
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,234
- What happened?
- Susan shot me! Call the police!

622
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,903
I told you she was gonna snap.
It's always the pretty ones.

623
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,603
It was an accident.

624
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,658
- I want you to be my lawyer.
- I call Bob as my lawyer.

625
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:08,244
We heard a gun go off.

626
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,579
Susan shot me!

627
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:13,374
I didn't know it was her.

628
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,080
What were you doing
sneaking around my house?

629
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:18,678
I was on neighborhood watch!

630
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:21,478
- You didn't have an assigned shift.
- Tom Scavo had to study.

631
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:25,344
- He asked me to fill in!
- Well... you should've checked with me.

632
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,885
That's what I was trying to do
when you shot me!

633
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:31,642
All right. Everybody, just calm down.
I'm gonna go call an ambulance.

634
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,022
Perhaps we should unload this
before someone else gets hurt.

635
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,703
- Susan just shot Katherine Mayfair.
- What?

636
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,789
She's okay,
but she's... freaked out.

637
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,542
I never pegged Susan as a gun owner.

638
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Crap.

639
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:04,137
- It's our gun. I gave it to Julie.
- What? Why?

640
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:06,719
She was sacred.
She wanted protection.

641
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,010
That gun is under our real name!

642
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:13,181
- If they trace that back to us...
- We are not going to let that happen.

643
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,294
You're going to jail for this.

644
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:19,756
Everyone heard you
threaten me at that meeting.

645
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:21,923
- I have witnesses.
- Please.

646
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,795
If I were gonna kill you, I wouldn't
do it in my own front yard.

647
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,407
I'd sneak into your house and
shoot you while you were asleep.

648
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,070
Not that I would ever do that.

649
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,210
- Katherine, where are you going?
- Home, to call the police.

650
00:39:45,063 --> 00:39:47,983
The ambulance is on its way.
But I brought a first aid kit.

651
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,500
Why don't you let me clean
you up and then you can call?

652
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:56,085
Just leave it!

653
00:39:56,252 --> 00:39:58,813
Hand me the phone.
I wanna call the police.

654
00:39:59,918 --> 00:40:00,982
Dumb move.

655
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,025
What?

656
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:06,271
Listen to me.

657
00:40:06,856 --> 00:40:08,106
You and Mike...

658
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:09,782
I see it, too.

659
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,913
Those looks he gives you?
He's still crazy about you.

660
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:18,321
I know!

661
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:21,184
So... use your head.

662
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:25,166
You wanna call the police and have the
mother of his kid carted off to jail?

663
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:27,758
Don't be stupid.
High road all the way.

664
00:40:30,706 --> 00:40:32,206
That's a good point.

665
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,597
And besides,

666
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:37,106
you walk around with a bandage
on your shoulder for a few days...

667
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:38,978
she looks like a monster

668
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,678
and you come off
looking like a saint.

669
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,405
- So how we doin' here?
- I'm fine!

670
00:40:55,858 --> 00:40:59,108
I don't think we'll be needing
that ambulance anymore.

671
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,949
- So am I going to jail?
- She's not calling anybody.

672
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:09,266
She's a little worked up
but we talked.

673
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,676
It's gonna be okay.

674
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,688
<i>It is in our nature
to judge the people around us.</i>

675
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,209
<i>If they ignore our wishes,</i>

676
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:28,893
<i>we believe they are disrespectful.</i>

677
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,330
<i>If they don't watch their children,</i>

678
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:37,703
<i>we conclude they are unfit parents.</i>

679
00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:42,364
<i>If we catch them cheating,</i>

680
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:45,544
<i>we assume we know their reasons.</i>

681
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:50,068
<i>But what happens
when we finally stop for a moment</i>

682
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:52,396
<i>to judge our own lives?</i>

683
00:41:55,254 --> 00:41:57,235
<i>It can be painful to step back</i>

684
00:41:57,402 --> 00:41:59,644
<i>and see what we've been doing...</i>

685
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:05,910
<i>and even more painful to realize</i>

686
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,142
<i>we have no intention</i>

687
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:11,752
<i>of stopping.</i>
