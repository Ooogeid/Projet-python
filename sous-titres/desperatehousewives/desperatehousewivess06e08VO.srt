<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,518
- No sex for at least a month.
- <i>Bree made a decision...</i>

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:07,204
Focus on getting me a divorce.

4
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:09,175
- <i>And hired Angie.</i>
- Let's get cookin'.

5
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,887
- <i>Gaby struggled at home.</i>
- What is going on?

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,307
- It's called homeschooling!
- <i>Lynette's body was changing.</i>

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,768
I have to hide these things at work
so Carlos doesn't find out I'm pregnant.

8
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:21,897
Cops wanted to know where you
were when Julie was strangled.

9
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,525
- You know I never attacked her.
- <i>Angie knew about the affair.</i>

10
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:29,279
Is it true you shot
Katherine Mayfair?

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,659
<i>And Susan got in trouble.</i>

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,117
<i>If someone wanted proof</i>

13
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,871
<i>that judge Mary Gallagher
had a sense of humor,</i>

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,046
<i>all they needed to do</i>

15
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:47,610
<i>was watch her pronounce sentence.</i>

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,760
<i>For the slum lord
who refused to fix a furnace...</i>

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,160
You have to live in your own
tenement for a month...

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,523
Starting in december.

19
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:00,769
<i>The woman who threw a phone
at her maid...</i>

20
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:04,424
You will clean Mrs. Garcia's
home for the next six weeks.

21
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:07,309
And, yes, you will do windows.

22
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:11,529
<i>For the high school coach who made
lewd remarks to a cheerleader...</i>

23
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:14,704
At the next school assembly,
you will perform a cheer...

24
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:15,983
in uniform.

25
00:01:16,153 --> 00:01:19,608
And I'd shave those legs
if I were you.

26
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:24,047
<i>And then there was
the case of the housewife</i>

27
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,752
<i>who shot her neighbor...</i>

28
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,964
So, she just popped up
in my window, and I fired.

29
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:34,256
- It was an accident.
- Liar!

30
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:36,930
It was no accident!
She wanted me dead.

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,386
I did not.
At least, not then.

32
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,477
As you can see, your honor, this
is an unfortunate situation.

33
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,309
It's a mess is what it is.
I assume there's some history here.

34
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:49,033
- She once dated my husband.
- She stole him from me.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Stole?

36
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:53,228
He came screaming back
like he was running from a fire.

37
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:54,395
Enough.

38
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,946
I take it
you're the man in question.

39
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:02,784
Yes, your honor.

40
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:05,825
I could see shooting someone
over you.

41
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:08,404
Thank you?

42
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,021
I'm gonna rule now.

43
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,037
My inclination is to avoid

44
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,299
giving out jail time in this case.

45
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,735
- I object!
- Overruled!

46
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:21,136
However...

47
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:24,006
a firearm was discharged and

48
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:26,107
there are consequences for that.

49
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:29,102
Your honor, before you hand
down your ruling, may I say something?

50
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:32,147
Make it quick. I already
find you uninteresting.

51
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:36,957
Not only

52
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:41,367
did Susan shoot me
at point-blank range,

53
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,971
she trashed me to all of
my friends and neighbors,

54
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:47,204
telling them I was some kind
of crazy, stalking nut!

55
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:49,608
That true?

56
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:51,893
Have you been trashing her?

57
00:02:55,403 --> 00:02:56,403
I...

58
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:58,681
Never said "nut."

59
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:01,176
I... Said "loon."

60
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:14,112
I trashed her a little.

61
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:18,667
But what I said was true,
and that's free speech.

62
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,779
You can't punish me for that.

63
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,083
<i>Yes, when it came to sentencing,</i>

64
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,647
<i>judge Mary Gallagher
had a sense of humor.</i>

65
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,584
<i>But not everyone</i>

66
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,059
<i>found her funny.</i>

I hope they have decaf today.
Last time I was here, they were out,

75
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,407
so I had to have regular and got
so wired, I didn't sleep all night.

76
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:32,475
Does that happen to you?

77
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:36,776
Seriously? You think I'm gonna
make small talk with you?

78
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,059
Excuse me?

79
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,028
I know you slept with my husband.

80
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:50,955
So... I'm thinkin' we're
past the chit-chat stage.

81
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,749
I am so sorry.

82
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,862
Let me tell you how shame works.

83
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,671
When you see the wife
of the guy you banged,

84
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:09,930
you don't make conversation.
You don't even smile and say hi.

85
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:13,716
You avert your gaze and you blush.

86
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,938
Nod if you understand.

87
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:23,693
Here's your mocha latte.
That'll be $3.50.

88
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:27,108
It's on her.
She owes me.

89
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,042
You're gonna be late for class.

90
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,344
Dad?

91
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,506
All my clothes are too tight.
I had to borrow yours.

92
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,596
I was gonna wear that shirt today.

93
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,588
When you're hiding your fourth
month of pregnancy with twins,

94
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,013
you can have it back.
What do you think?

95
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:55,029
I'm still attracted to you
in men's clothes.

96
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,010
Is that weird?

97
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,807
All I need is to pull
this off for two more days.

98
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:01,898
You should've told Carlos
two months ago.

99
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:06,483
There's no way he won't
be furious when he finds out.

100
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:09,653
I may be wearing men's clothes

101
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:11,785
but I am not an idiot.
I've got this.

102
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,219
Terrence Henderson and I
are about to close the biggest deal

103
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,122
in the history of this company.

104
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:19,692
Once Carlos sees
how great Terrence is,

105
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:23,330
he'll see the work can still get
done even when I'm on maternity leave.

106
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,904
And you're sure this deal
is gonna close?

107
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,634
That's why we need
to keep our fingers crossed.

108
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,346
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

109
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:36,933
Now come here, mister.
I wanna kiss ya.

110
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:39,964
Now it's weird.

111
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:51,990
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

112
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:53,742
Go ahead, my child.

113
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:57,433
I've been homeschooling my daughter
and it's been a living hell,

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,248
so I tried to bribe someone
to get her into catholic school.

115
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,626
And, what happened?

116
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,530
You tell me.

117
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,715
What are you doing?

118
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:12,029
Come on. You're the head of admissions.
You've got a great school here,

119
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,929
but there's a 2-year waiting list!

120
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,640
Put your money away.

121
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,684
It's your money. Sleep with it
for a while. See how it feels.

122
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:24,314
I wish I could help,
but my hands are tied.

123
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,670
I'm not asking you
to part the Red Sea.

124
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,527
Just find a spot
for one kid in the second grade.

125
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:32,703
If a student were to withdraw,
I might be able to move you

126
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,172
- to the top of the waiting list.
- Fantastic!

127
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,453
But frankly, we tend to favor those
who are more faithful.

128
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:40,995
What does that mean?

129
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,875
I've noticed that you
don't come to mass very often.

130
00:07:46,643 --> 00:07:50,109
I hear ya, padre. You're okay
with money as long as it comes

131
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,556
in one of those wicker
baskets you pass around.

132
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,135
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Of course not.

133
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:58,570
I realize it's dark in here,
but just know I'm winking back.

134
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:06,304
So your first opera...

135
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,056
That's quite a milestone.

136
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:10,373
Throw in "last,"
and it's two milestones.

137
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,797
Stop. I saw you tear up
at the end of act two.

138
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,688
Only because I realized
there was an act three.

139
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:20,838
"Madame Butterfly"
is Puccini's masterpiece.

140
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:23,446
Didn't you enjoy it just a little?

141
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,646
What about that scene
when Butterfly tells her child

142
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:30,380
not to feel sorrow
for her mother's desertion?

143
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:32,757
Didn't that make you feel anything?

144
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:34,440
Actually,

145
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:37,966
that's when you leaned forward,
and I saw a little peek of your boob.

146
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,681
I guess it made me feel horny.

147
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:41,481
Karl, don't.

148
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,908
Come on. It's a dark
parking structure.

149
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:47,870
- They gonna think I'm mugging you.
- We agreed no sex for a month.

150
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,192
We need to find out if we can be
together in a nonsexual manner.

151
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:52,861
I'm serious.

152
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,196
Can you keep your hands to yourself?

153
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:01,579
Can I? Thanks to you,
it's my only choice.

154
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:14,453
How was your business dinner?

155
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:20,473
Our bid was too high. It looks like
they're gonna go with another caterer.

156
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:23,023
What are you listening to?

157
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,909
It's a new recording
of "Madame Butterfly."

158
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:50,460
Isn't that glorious?

159
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,594
It is.
I should go to bed.

160
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,964
All right, guys. You sign the lease,
and we'll pop the champagne.

161
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,419
The Florida branch
is officially a go.

162
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,759
<i>Terrific. When do we get
our branch manager?</i>

163
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:24,802
We have got somebody great lined up.
We just need to finalize some things.

164
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,706
- We'll get back to you. Thanks.
- Who do we have lined up?

165
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,646
Nobody. That's the thing
we need to finalize.

166
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:34,212
But today, we celebrate.
You really hit this one out of the park.

167
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:37,804
I gotta give credit where
credit is due. Terrence did a lot

168
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,840
of the heavy lifting on this
and I don't care if I embarrass him.

169
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,680
- This guy is a star.
- Strangely, I'm not embarrassed.

170
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:47,999
I didn't want to interrupt your
phone call but your wife is here.

171
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:50,804
Tell her to wait in my
office until we're finished.

172
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:53,778
<i>You listen to me, Carlos Solis!
I just came from St. Ursula's</i>

173
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,878
<i>and we've got big trouble!
Do not blow me off!</i>

174
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:01,393
According to the catholic church,
we're not holy enough.

175
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,534
But I have a feeling a big, fat
check might slap on a halo.

176
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,997
How big?

177
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,546
Somethingthat'll make a priest say
"holy" and "mother"

178
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:11,423
in the same sentence. That should
get her to the top of the list.

179
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,008
I'm not going to write a big check
on the chance that it might get her in.

180
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:19,864
I can't do this now.
You know the problems that I'm facing

181
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:23,848
trying to get the new Florida office up
and running. Now if you don't mind...

182
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:27,163
Fine.
Can I trouble you for $5?

183
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,906
I'll buy Juanita a hairnet

184
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:32,067
and prepare her for a future
in the fast food industry.

185
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,533
Hello... Gentlemen.

186
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,913
What? A lot of people
are wearing this style.

187
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,980
Well, doesn't make it right.

188
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:49,964
I heard you mention St. Ursula's.
It is worth the hassle.

189
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:53,295
Our daughter Molly's in
the second grade. She loves it there.

190
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,491
I didn't know Molly was
in the same grade as Juanita.

191
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,257
Would you excuse me?

192
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:09,424
That branch in Florida?
I think I found our man.

193
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,316
You can't send Terrence to Florida.

194
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,220
You should take it as a compliment.
You trained him well.

195
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:19,042
Exactly. You can't send him away.
What if you need him?

196
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:21,918
- Why would I? I've got you.
- But...

197
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:24,911
What if I was hit by a bus

198
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,354
and I was... Put on bed rest

199
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:29,393
for, say, three months?

200
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,446
Who would cover for me?

201
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,612
That's not gonna happen.

202
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:39,254
You jinxed it. Now for sure some
version of that is gonna happen.

203
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,464
It's done. We are
sending Terrence to Florida.

204
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:45,812
And I really like this new look
that you've got going but careful...

205
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:49,425
Roberta in accounting asked if
you'd like to go bowling with her.

206
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,099
What are you doing here?

207
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:09,683
I was just having lunch with some
friends who are not on a chain gang.

208
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:11,411
Thought I'd stop by and say hi.

209
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:14,164
You mean stop by and gloat.

210
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,850
Maybe a little.

211
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:20,045
So... How's it going?
Meeting anybody?

212
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,262
They say the friends you make
on the inside... You'll have for life.

213
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:27,969
Yes, Katherine, this all sucks.

214
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:29,809
But you know what?

215
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,759
At the end of the day,
I go home to Mike...

216
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:35,041
which means I won.

217
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:38,409
That's big talk for a woman
standing in an orange jumpsuit

218
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:40,376
with blisters on her feet.

219
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,465
Mike will rub them when I go home.
And for the record,

220
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,158
I totally make this work.

221
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:47,965
The fact that you think
you look good in orange

222
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,885
show I'm not dealing
with a rational person.

223
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,214
By the way...

224
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:54,875
you missed something.

225
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:57,374
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

226
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:04,824
Come back here!

227
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,427
- She littered! Shoot her!
- What a moron.

228
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,706
I wish I'd caught her license
plate number. She'd be sorry.

229
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:14,381
Really?

230
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:18,418
What kind of damage could you do
with her home address?

231
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,274
You missed something.

232
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:42,377
Did you get 'em all?

233
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:44,586
You're supposed to eat it,
not wear it.

234
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:46,631
They call it crumb cake
for a reason.

235
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:50,149
Can you steam me some 2% milk?

236
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,353
This is what happens
when I'm five minutes late?

237
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:01,897
- What?
- The waitress with the hands.

238
00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:05,609
She was brushing crumbs
off my shirt.

239
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,449
What, the ones Julie missed?

240
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:12,324
Is this how it's gonna be
every time I talk to a woman?

241
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:15,195
Probably.

242
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:18,955
I'm sorry. I don't know
how many times I can say it.

243
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:22,751
I'll do anything you want.
I'll do couples therapy.

244
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,686
Great idea.
Let's tell somebody all our secrets

245
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:30,680
and when we're cured,
we can kill him.

246
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,515
I don't know what you want.

247
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:39,811
I want you to be the guy
you used to be,

248
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:42,938
the guy who saved my life,
not the guy who destroyed it.

249
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:46,775
How we doing here?

250
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:51,051
Never been better,

251
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:56,544
Come on in!

252
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:58,364
This is so nice of you.

253
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:01,899
It's not every day that one
of my associates gets a big

254
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,796
- promotion.
- Thank you.

255
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:06,443
Why don't you take Crystal
in the den and get comfortable

256
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:09,261
while I steal this guy
to help me make cocktails?

257
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:11,043
Come on. Right this way.

258
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:18,725
How excited are you? Miami?

259
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,227
Pretty jazzed.

260
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,511
- It's an exciting opportunity.
- I think it's great how you're

261
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:26,528
- concentrating on the upside of this.
- There's a downside?

262
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:29,985
Not really.
Forget I mentioned it.

263
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:33,798
It's just...

264
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,978
Do you remember Tim Baker

265
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:39,202
who was sent to head up
our Chicago office?

266
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:40,787
Never heard of him.

267
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:43,112
Exactly.

268
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:46,888
So... You are moving to Florida.

269
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:49,880
- Pecan?
- No, thanks. I'm on a diet.

270
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,550
I can't wait.
No more winter.

271
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:57,162
- Just heat and hurricanes.
- I'm willing to put up with that.

272
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:59,561
Miami has so many
other things to offer.

273
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:03,032
It certainly must to attract
all those colombian drug lords.

274
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,239
The Chicago branch was a little slow
out of the gate. Corporate freaked

275
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,779
- and made Tim the scapegoat.
- Where is he now?

276
00:17:10,872 --> 00:17:12,212
He's in plastics...

277
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:16,323
or paper, depending on what you want
your groceries in. Wine?

278
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,810
And when they cut
into the alligator's stomach,

279
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:21,555
not only was the guy's arm
still intact,

280
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:24,317
but it was still holding
his golf club.

281
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:27,035
He would've been fine
if his wife hadn't left him.

282
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:29,175
That led directly to the alcoholism,

283
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:32,458
which probably had something to
do with him threatening the president.

284
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,841
Is that a bitch on the old resume.

285
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:39,794
That humidity... Your hair?

286
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:41,973
I think it's a recipe
for cotton candy.

287
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,316
Here we go, everybody.
We've got the wine.

288
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:49,064
I would like to propose a toast.

289
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:51,626
To Terrence and Crystal,

290
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:54,387
may Miami be everything
you think it will.

291
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,923
- Anybody home?
- Come on in, Angie.

292
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,399
This is pretty.
What is it?

293
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:13,004
It's from the opera
"Madame Butterfly."

294
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,369
She sounds so sad.

295
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:19,467
Actually, in this aria,
Butterfly is hopeful

296
00:18:19,637 --> 00:18:22,013
that one day her lover
will return to her.

297
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,390
Does he?

298
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,041
Because of his abandonment,

299
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:29,980
she kills herself.

300
00:18:31,864 --> 00:18:34,895
You ever see "Avenue Q"?
The musical with the puppets?

301
00:18:35,065 --> 00:18:36,652
That's good theater.

302
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:42,379
Bree's not here.
What do you want?

303
00:18:43,216 --> 00:18:45,367
I need to talk to her
about some work stuff.

304
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:47,188
- Where is she?
- She's out.

305
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:52,437
That's generally
where Bree is these days.

306
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,222
Out.

307
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,971
She's meeting
with a prospective client,

308
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,682
so she says. She's had
four client meetings this week,

309
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:04,777
and not one has resulted
in a booking.

310
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:07,601
Why do you think that is?

311
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,062
It's a rough economy.

312
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:14,316
I think she's taken a lover.

313
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,546
What? Come on.

314
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:20,822
No way.

315
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,611
- How can you be so sure?
- An affair?

316
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:27,037
Please, the woman makes
her own croutons.

317
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:29,605
Perhaps.

318
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,830
I have to go away on a golf weekend.

319
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:38,392
While I'm gone,
could you do me a favor and

320
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,971
keep an eye on Bree?

321
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,594
- What do you mean?
- Just observe her.

322
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:46,402
Does she come home at night?
Is anyone with her?

323
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,386
If you wanna be paranoid,
go ahead. It's a free country.

324
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:52,651
But I am not gonna
spy on your wife for you.

325
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,087
I suppose that's for the best.

326
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:02,883
If I did find out she was betraying me,
I'd probably do something stupid.

327
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:29,062
Toughen up. It's just a little dust.

328
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:36,870
Look, I have to clean that area.

329
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,486
Would you mind having your
breakdown someplace else?

330
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,453
Just leave me alone, okay?

331
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,660
You won, I lost. Isn't that enough?

332
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:45,491
What?

333
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,601
When you're sitting on the side
of the road picking up

334
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:51,334
styrofoam and wads of gum,
it's time to admit defeat.

335
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,003
The man I love chose you.

336
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,690
Are you messing with me?

337
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,263
I'm being honest.

338
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:07,566
Why has this been so hard on me?

339
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:17,422
- You loved him.
- I did.

340
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:21,454
I really did. And now he's gone.

341
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,161
You're an attractive, intelligent woman.
You're gonna meet other guys.

342
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:28,377
Not like Mike.

343
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:31,955
We connected
on so many different levels...

344
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:35,793
Intellectually, emotionally,

345
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:37,881
sexually.

346
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:41,871
I've never felt such passion.

347
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:45,678
Where am I gonna find
another guy who'll

348
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:48,683
make love to me
five times in one day?

349
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:55,565
- That's a lie.
- No, it's not.

350
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,275
Five times?

351
00:21:58,096 --> 00:22:01,446
Susan, come on. Don't tell
me that you and Mike have never...

352
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:15,379
Maybe I didn't lose after all.

353
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:31,341
Remind me to ask you what you
want for breakfast more often.

354
00:22:31,508 --> 00:22:35,106
- Beats a bowl of oatmeal, doesn't it?
- You kidding? That beat a waffle.

355
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:36,773
I have a crazy idea.

356
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:41,183
Why don't we both call in sick and
spend the day in bed naked together?

357
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:43,363
Did I mention naked?

358
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:47,295
You wanna go for seconds?
What's gotten into you?

359
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:51,466
Even on my birthday you told me to
hurry up because <i>The Bachelor</i> was on.

360
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:55,747
Can't a wife just want to
spend time with her husband?

361
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:58,385
It's just that your timing's bad.

362
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:02,390
Gotta finish Mr. Hinkle's shower.
I promised him I'd be there yesterday.

363
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:03,787
I'm serious.

364
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,988
The old man hasn't had a shower in
three days. And that's a long time...

365
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,785
for an old man...

366
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,773
to not take a shower.

367
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,699
The hell with it. He survived
World War II. He'll get through this.

368
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:26,647
Father Crowley, hi.

369
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:28,583
This is for you.

370
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:32,855
I thought I'd catch up on my giving
to my favorite parish.

371
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,415
I certainly didn't expect this.

372
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:38,143
Well, do with it what you will...

373
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,921
buy a new pipe organ,
help the needy,

374
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,842
take a trip to Tahiti.
I really don't care.

375
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,752
I don't know which nun
you're gonna put my kid with

376
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,651
but make sure she's had
a tetanus shot. Juanita's a biter.

377
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,225
- I think you're jumping the gun here.
- Why?

378
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:56,728
A spot opened up. Molly Henderson
is moving to florida, right?

379
00:23:56,978 --> 00:24:00,941
She was. Her father was going to take
a new job but he decided against it.

380
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:04,653
What? No!
No, this can't be!

381
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,154
I'm afraid it is.

382
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,949
Anyway,
how did you even know about this?

383
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,230
We'll talk about it in confession.

384
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:17,311
Have faith, Gabrielle. When God
closes a door, He opens a window.

385
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,499
Thank you.

386
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,812
I got the stuff for the mushroom tarts.
How's that cake coming along?

387
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:42,384
Just when I think I can't
top myself, I do.

388
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:45,288
How about that?

389
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:48,071
By the way, Orson thinks
you're having an affair.

390
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,609
He thinks what now?

391
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:57,293
He thinks you're steppin' out.
But I told him there is no way

392
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,453
Bree Van De Kamp is whoring it up
in some sleazy motel.

393
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:03,471
Thank you for that.

394
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:07,254
Sorry to spring it on you like that.
I just felt you should know

395
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:09,545
- what he was saying.
- I appreciate it.

396
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:12,470
I just don't understand
why he would go to you.

397
00:25:13,018 --> 00:25:14,885
Well, he was drinking a lot.

398
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:18,035
Also, he asked me
if I would spy on you.

399
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:24,649
Relax, Bree.
Obviously I said no.

400
00:25:25,554 --> 00:25:28,062
And I appreciate that, too.
Would you mind

401
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:29,821
cleaning this up for me?

402
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:33,199
Are you sure you're done
topping yourself?

403
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:41,596
This is serious, Karl. He asked
Angie to spy on me. And...

404
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:44,213
God knows who else
he has watching me.

405
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:47,339
I don't think we should
see each other again

406
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:49,580
until after
you've gotten me a divorce.

407
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:52,422
Don't ask me how.
You're the lawyer.

408
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,449
Aren't you supposed to be at school?
You never come home for lunch.

409
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:06,863
I thought I'd try
something different.

410
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,986
Since we're both home, why
don't we go upstairs and make love?

411
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,990
Seriously? You want to do it again?
I just got a sub from Martinelli's.

412
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:18,161
I am offering you a nooner.
Drop your pants and get upstairs.

413
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:22,457
- Can I bring my sandwich?
- Bring it. Grab a pickle. I don't care.

414
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:27,587
You're the best wife ever.
Can I turn on "The Three Stooges," too?

415
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,916
Lynette, it's Gaby!

416
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:37,181
In a minute.

417
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,567
Hey, Nanook.
Why you wearing a parka?

418
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,653
Because... Fur is murder.
What's up?

419
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:56,206
I talked to Crystal Henderson
and she said you talked Terrence

420
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:59,710
- out of going to Miami. Is that true?
- I didn't talk him out of it. I merely

421
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:03,258
- pointed out the pros and cons.
- Apparently, the cons won.

422
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:06,751
You've gotta untalk him out of it.
I need him out of this state.

423
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:09,629
Why?
Are you sleeping with him?

424
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:15,572
Truth is if he doesn't go, Juanita can't
take his kid's spot at St. Ursula's.

425
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,873
You are unbelievable. You want
this guy to uproot his entire life

426
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,485
just so you can get out
of homeschooling your daughter?

427
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:24,394
Selfish Gaby. Same old song.
Join in if you know the words.

428
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,344
- Sorry, Gaby, I need terrence here.
- Why?

429
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:30,013
Are you sleeping with him?

430
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:33,084
I just need him here.

431
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:37,115
Every time I turn around, someone is
trying to make my life more complicated.

432
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,492
Why can't everyone just let it go?

433
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:42,014
I'm sorry.

434
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,332
Come here.
Everything's gonna be okay.

435
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:48,292
Why are you getting so upset?

436
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:52,756
- What was that?
- What was what?

437
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:57,001
Your stomach just kicked me.

438
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,596
- Open the parka.
- I'd rather not.

439
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:00,846
Open it!

440
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:08,063
You're pregnant?
Why didn't you tell me?!

441
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:11,608
Because... I knew you'd tell Carlos.

442
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:14,846
Yeah, so I tell Carlos.
What's wrong with...

443
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,408
When Carlos offered you
that promotion,

444
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:24,196
you knew you were pregnant and you knew
you'd be leaving him in the lurch?

445
00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:27,732
Carlos just got this company!
He brought in people he could depend on,

446
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:29,710
and he thought
he could depend on you!

447
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,954
I didn't tell Carlos
because I knew I was

448
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:34,939
the best person for the job
and I wanted to prove it.

449
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:37,175
You certainly proved something.

450
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:40,720
Wait! Please don't tell Carlos.
I think he should hear it from me.

451
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,632
Better late than never, right?

452
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,949
I'm home! Are you hungry?

453
00:28:58,116 --> 00:28:59,116
<i>Up here!</i>

454
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:05,743
Hello, lover.

455
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,667
I can't.

456
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:14,934
I got nothing left. I hit my hand with
a wrench today and when I cried,

457
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,601
- only dust came out.
- You cried?

458
00:29:18,146 --> 00:29:20,454
That is so sexy.

459
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:24,431
What is going on with you?
It's like you just got out of prison.

460
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:27,615
Is there a problem with
a husband and wife having sex?

461
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:30,532
We have a passionate
relationship, don't we?

462
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:34,325
Of course we do. It's just,
I was hoping tonight we could...

463
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:35,959
cuddle.

464
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:38,631
Cuddle?

465
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,157
- Am I that repulsive to you?
- What?

466
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:45,278
It's okay, Mike. You can say it.

467
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,373
I'm a lousy lay.

468
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:51,082
We had sex three times today.
All right, I can't do it again.

469
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:54,211
It's not you.
It's basic biology.

470
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:57,756
Really? Biology? Well,

471
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,912
here is some basic math.

472
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:04,795
You had sex with Katherine
five times in one day

473
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:07,772
And me three.
Five minus three equals

474
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,727
Katherine turns you on,
and sex with me is a chore.

475
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,606
You and Katherine
actually talked about this?

476
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,397
More like she rubbed it in my face.

477
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,948
The only reason that
that "record" ever happened

478
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:23,990
was we got snowed in
during a ski trip.

479
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:28,245
And we had absolutely nothing
to talk about.

480
00:30:30,074 --> 00:30:31,774
Sex was all we ever had!

481
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:40,657
Don't you get it?

482
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:43,502
There was nothing else
to the relationship.

483
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:45,845
But you and I...
we've got everything.

484
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:47,800
We have a rich,

485
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,015
full life together.

486
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:52,561
We could finish
each other's sentences.

487
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,590
"I've been so foolish."

488
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,090
Is that what you were gonna say?

489
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,669
- And?
- You wanna cuddle.

490
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:10,453
I was gonna say <i>The Bachelor</i> is on.

491
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,453
But cuddling's good, too.

492
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,533
What are you doing here?
Someone could see you!

493
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,425
Especially if you leave me
standing on your doorstep.

494
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:31,930
Relax.
I parked two blocks away.

495
00:31:32,097 --> 00:31:35,812
I don't appreciate your taking risks
like this. If Orson find out about...

496
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:38,299
You won't have that
to worry about much longer.

497
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,942
I found a way to spring you
from this marriage!

498
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:51,745
Orson's still on parole, right?

499
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,595
For another year. Why?

500
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:57,207
If he violates parole
by, for instance,

501
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,424
associating with a known felon,

502
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,533
- they can revoke it.
- And send him back to jail.

503
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,037
All we need to do is get
some ex-con in a room with Orson,

504
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,087
take some pictures, and bam!

505
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:10,431
He can't touch you
because if he does,

506
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:13,892
the parole officer will get
the pictures and it's bye-bye, Orson.

507
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,978
That's perfect! And then
he'll have to let me go.

508
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,981
I think someone deserves a kiss.

509
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:24,345
Karl, we agreed.

510
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:28,736
For the first time since we've been
together, your husband is out of town.

511
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:31,493
Do we really want
to let that go to waste?

512
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,212
Come on. Come on!

513
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,555
Do not answer that.

514
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:33,346
<i>- This is Bree. Please leave a message.</i>
- Damn it!

515
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,026
You gotta get that man
out of your bedroom right now!

516
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:48,426
What? There's no man in my room.

517
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:52,616
Good, cause it was just about to get a
whole lot more crowded. Orson is home.

518
00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:12,428
You're home early.

519
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:14,881
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

520
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,146
Why are you back so soon?

521
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,393
I'm coming down with a cold.

522
00:34:28,053 --> 00:34:30,903
You know how I hate to be sick
away from home.

523
00:34:34,562 --> 00:34:36,012
What are you doing?

524
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:41,706
There are two glasses downstairs
and one has wine.

525
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,459
<i>You are obviously not alone here.</i>

526
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,306
- What are you implying?
- You know perfectly well

527
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:50,173
what I'm implying, Bree.
Who was drinking the wine?

528
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:54,563
Well, first of all, I am insulted
that you would even think that...

529
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,930
Where are you?

530
00:34:57,636 --> 00:34:59,054
There you are!

531
00:35:01,587 --> 00:35:04,598
I pop home for five minutes
to toss some clothes in the dryer,

532
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:06,965
and you got a man in your bedroom.

533
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:10,255
You were here tonight?

534
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:13,196
Just tossin' back a little vino
and gossiping.

535
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:16,449
This girl knows
everything about everybody.

536
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,317
Is there any wine left?

537
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:25,341
- I could use a glass.
- Yes, downstairs on the table.

538
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:28,545
You go on ahead.
We're gonna finish up our girl talk.

539
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,346
- Where are the clothes?
- Behind the pillow.

540
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:47,493
You're gonna have to jump.
There's rose bushes, so

541
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,107
put your pants on first.

542
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:56,184
- I can't thank you enough.
- I didn't do this for you.

543
00:35:56,351 --> 00:35:58,700
- I did it for Orson.
- For Orson?

544
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,329
I told him you had too much
class to do something like this.

545
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,041
I understand your disdain
but this is a complicated situation.

546
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,960
Let me make it simple for you.
Two men want you. Choose one.

547
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,585
But which one? Orson's blackmailing
me to stay with him.

548
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:16,041
- He's manipulative and calculating.
- Then go with lover boy.

549
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,179
But what kind of life would I have
with Karl? He's crass and conceited

550
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,932
and the only thing we seem
to have in common is sex.

551
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,960
Then why are you having an affair
with someone you don't even like?

552
00:36:25,127 --> 00:36:26,934
Did I mention the sex?

553
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:30,330
Karl brings out passion in me
I never knew I had.

554
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:33,151
- I melt every time he touches me.
- Great!

555
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:36,645
Then find a way out of your marriage
and start building a life with this...

556
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:38,912
- Karl.
- I would. It's just...

557
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:40,491
What?

558
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:48,431
Orson likes opera.

559
00:37:01,643 --> 00:37:02,643
You busy?

560
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,852
So, did... Gaby talk to you
last night?

561
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:11,542
But I need to talk to you.

562
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:15,527
- I want you to run the Miami office.
- What?

563
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:18,709
If it isn't gonna be Terrence,
then it has to be you.

564
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:22,307
The future of the company is at stake.
I need my best people on the spot.

565
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:25,996
It won't be forever, and depending on
how things go after a couple of years,

566
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:29,289
Maybe you could even move back
and telecommute from here.

567
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,710
- Carlos, what is this?
- What's what?

568
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,148
Come on, I know,
you know, I'm pregnant.

569
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:36,615
You're pregnant?

570
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,967
- Great.
- Please, I know gaby told you.

571
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:45,765
I would remember somebody
telling me something like that.

572
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:49,728
So what's your answer?

573
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,987
You send someone else to Miami...

574
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,526
and I stay here.
That's my answer.

575
00:37:57,085 --> 00:37:58,935
Except I need you in Miami,

576
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:01,056
and I don't need you here.

577
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,449
Not anymore.

578
00:38:03,538 --> 00:38:06,874
Carlos, I am sorry.
I know I should've told you

579
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:10,555
when I first found out.
Believe me, I wish I had now. But...

580
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:13,835
You can't fire me
for being pregnant.

581
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:17,476
I'm not firing you, Lynette.
I'm offering you a promotion.

582
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:20,656
If you choose to turn it down
and quit instead, I can't stop you.

583
00:38:20,823 --> 00:38:22,873
All I can do is say good luck.

584
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,370
And congratulations.

585
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:35,207
It's late and
I still gotta close up.

586
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:40,501
Tomorrow's no good either.

587
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:44,145
Listen, you're a nice guy.

588
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:47,403
I'm just not looking
for a relationship right now.

589
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,570
Sorry.

590
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,470
Hello?

591
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,712
I know you girls think that lettin'
a guy down easy, but... trust me,

592
00:38:58,381 --> 00:38:59,381
it ain't.

593
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:03,176
You okay for now?
I gotta clean up in the back.

594
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,676
Yeah. I'm good.

595
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:22,045
Agent Padilla?

596
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,966
Little memory quiz for you.

597
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:26,705
This is Black Owl.

598
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:31,441
Damn, Chris,
still sharp as a tack, huh?

599
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:34,894
Don't ask me anything. Don't talk.
This conversation will last

600
00:39:35,061 --> 00:39:37,640
less than 60 seconds.
We both know why.

601
00:39:38,395 --> 00:39:41,882
I'm thinking about comin' in.
You interrupt me again and I hang up.

602
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:45,472
I said I was thinkin' about it. Now
here's what you need to think about.

603
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,051
I don't care what happens to me,
but I have to know she gets a pass.

604
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:51,737
There'll be no further discussion
on this until that is firm.

605
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:54,623
Next time you hear from me,
you'll have an answer to that question

606
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,187
and it better be yes.

607
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,726
You eavesdroppin' on me?

608
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:09,213
I just got here.

609
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:11,536
And I wanna go home.

610
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:18,602
I'll see you.

611
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:26,760
<i>There is a coffee shop in fairview.</i>

612
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,467
<i>It's known as a place</i>

613
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:33,184
<i>where you can read
your morning paper...</i>

614
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:37,771
<i>Where you can meet your friends...</i>

615
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:41,457
<i>Where you can have a cup of coffee</i>

616
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:43,693
<i>at the end of a long day.</i>

617
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:47,889
<i>Yes,</i>

618
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:51,354
<i>it was a place known
for many things.</i>

619
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:58,007
Did you forget something?

620
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:00,335
What are you doing?

621
00:41:08,785 --> 00:41:12,347
<i>But after this night,
it would be known for something...</i>

622
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,720
<i>Far worse.</i>
