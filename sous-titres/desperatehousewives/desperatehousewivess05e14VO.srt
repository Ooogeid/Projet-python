1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,870
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,290
Porter scavo, you are under arrest.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,180
What? Porter had nothing
to do with that fire.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,900
- Apparently there is a witness that says otherwise.
- A witness?

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,800
What are they talking about?

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,210
Porter was accused but not convicted.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,540
Katherine's love affair...

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,610
I got the flowers.

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,880
Became serious.

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,520
Mommy needs to lose a few pounds.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,940
- You wanna help mommy be beautiful again?
- No.

12
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,090
As did gaby's resolve.

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,650
Here's my cookbook.

14
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,360
And bree's success came at a price.

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,840
You can be a little tough sometimes.

16
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,160
It's only to be expected.

17
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,630
I don't think I do that.

18
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,490
I know you don't.

19
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,260
People don't talk about
money in the suburbs...

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,020
Mostly because they don't need to.

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,600
The ones who have it let you know
with their brand-new clothes...

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,950
Their expensive appliances...

23
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,800
And their manicured lawns.

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,190
The ones whodon'thave it let you know
with barbecues that need replacing...

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,040
Walls that need painting...

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,130
And classic cars...

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,850
That need to be sold.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,290
Hey you go,walter. She's all yours.

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,330
This is so awesome! Where's tom?

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,420
I wanna thank him for making
this the greatest day of my life.

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,730
He's inside, but between sobs,
he wished you happy driving.

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,660
Where is that man going with tom's car?

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,970
Oh,that man is walter
brotski, and he just bought it.

34
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,850
Tom loves that car.
Why would you sell it?

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,400
Sadly,we can no longer
afford tom's midlife crisis.

36
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,720
Okay,here's the deal.
We're... Sort of broke.

37
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,370
Lynette.

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,540
Between porter's legal fees and that
ghost town that we call a restaurant...

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,460
I thought scavo's was doing well.

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,700
When times get tough, people do without
things like pizza and sports cars.

41
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,840
I am so sorry. I had no idea.

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,530
It's okay. Just keep it under your
hat. It's a little embarrassing.

43
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,590
You should not be embarrassed. This is a
horrible economy. We're all in the same boat.

44
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,030
Hello,ladies. What do you think?

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,070
You bought a new car?

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,450
My book just made the
"times'" best seller list.

47
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,900
Now they're talking 3-book deal,
so I got the urge to splurge.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,590
And look what just blew on my
windshield at the stop sign!

49
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,810
Life is good.

50
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,250
Yes,people don't talk
about money in the suburbs

51
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,280
because when they do,
other people get angry.

55
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,850
Whenever someone on
wisteria lane buys a new car,

56
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,760
a simple ritual is performed.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,450
So how do you like my new car?

58
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,650
It's gorgeous!

59
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,430
- I am so jealous.
- I wish I had one.

60
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:26,360
But on this day, one of the owner's friends
refused to participate in the ritual.

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,900
And even more surprisingly, the owner of
the car in question didn't seem to notice.

62
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,520
Look,there's even a refrigerator.

63
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,170
The lexus dealer said there's just enough room
for a split of champagne and two chilled glasses.

64
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,120
And the best thing is, it's a
hybrid so you can barely hear it.

65
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,520
Let me show you.

66
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,340
Actually, I have to go to work.

67
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,290
But congratulations,bree. It's a beauty.

68
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,940
Was it just me, or was
that a little abrupt?

69
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,600
Eh,don't take it personally. I think
she's got other things on her mind.

70
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,620
Oh,dear. Is something wrong?

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,630
Well... Apparently,she and tom
are having financial problems.

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,230
They just had to sell tom's car.

73
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,900
And you know,i saw her
at the recycling center.

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,700
She was turning her cans in for money.

75
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,690
Yikes. That's,like, a half a step away
from selling your eggs on the internet.

76
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,170
And here I am,rubbing my
fabulous new car in her face.

77
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,030
I feel awful.

78
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,800
Oh,don't. How could you have known?

79
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,120
Thank god I didn't show her
how the car parks itself.

80
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,860
But you're gonna showus,right?

81
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,240
Well,it is pretty amazing!

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,550
Well,it's nice to see
you again,mrs. Mayer.

83
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,430
Thankyoufor agreeing
to see us,mr. Hobson.

84
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,030
Running a school like oakridge
mustn't leave you with much...

85
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,530
Free time.

86
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,080
Happy to oblige.

87
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,670
So I heard through the grapevine that there
might be an opening for another student?

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,510
I assume you're referring to
the henderson boy's expulsion?

89
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,780
Yeah. He bit his teacher,huh?

90
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,530
They had that problem
with their older boy, toby.

91
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,530
It's a family of biters.

92
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,940
Well,the whole situation was
incredibly unfortunate. But...

93
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,410
We can't tolerate that kind of behavior.

94
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,610
Well,you wouldn't have to
worry about tt with m.j.

95
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,160
He'ssowell-behaved.

96
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,600
Look,i know how much you
want your son at oakridge.

97
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,770
You've called us every week
for the past five months.

98
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,160
I've been too pushy.

99
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,200
Oh, please don't take it out
on m.j. He is such a bright kid.

100
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,500
Say something in spanish.

101
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm bored.

102
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,410
Be bored in spanish.

103
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,420
Mrs. Mayer,you can relax.

104
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,340
We would love to have m.j. Join us here.

105
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,620
Seriously?

106
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,650
Yes. As a matter of fact,his name
was first on our waiting list.

107
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,190
Fantastic!

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,640
Here's a schedule for you.

109
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,680
Here are some insurance
forms you need to fill out.

110
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,670
And here's the tuition. As you
can see, it's gone up a tad.

111
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,880
Yeah. That's quite a tad.

112
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,380
But we're starting in the middle of
the year, so we'd only pay half, right?

113
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,990
Yes. We've already
prorated it. That is half.

114
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,740
Fantastic.

115
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,240
Hey,i just thought of a way for us
to celebre our anniversary next week.

116
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,350
What do you think about
dinner at the palm?

117
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,720
The palm?

118
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,740
As in, "they don't even show
the prices on the menu" the palm?

119
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,620
Honey,we're still paying
off credit card debt.

120
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,660
Not anymore.

121
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,430
The deal closed. I got the bonus.

122
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,460
Oh,my god! That's great!

123
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,760
Oh,why didn't you tell me this when
you were begging for sex this morning?

124
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,040
You would've closed thatdeal,too.

125
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,720
We're rich again! Hallelujah!

126
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,820
Well,we are not "lighting cigars with $5 bills"
rich, but we are headed in the right direction.

127
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,860
Honey,we're gonna be us
again-- the old carlos and gaby.

128
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,840
You know what? I'm gonna wear my
dress from the night you proposed.

129
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,680
You still fit in that?

130
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,370
We're rich again! Hallelujah!

131
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,230
Have you not noticed
me working my butt off?

132
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,400
I'm almost back to the weight
I was when we got married!

133
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,370
All I meant was...

134
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,900
You don't have to wear an old
dress. I will buy you a new one.

135
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,860
No,no. This'll be way more romantic.

136
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,970
I'm one good colonic away
from being the old me!

137
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,740
I'll call the restaurant.

138
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,250
They can write that on the cake.

139
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,520
Sorry. I know how much
you loved that car.

140
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,950
This is all I have to remember her by.

141
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,620
- I called her "foxy." You wanna know why?
- No.

142
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,820
Tom.

143
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,330
I just heard. You sold the car?

144
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,160
Yeah. Well,we needed the
money. The restaurant is dying.

145
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,790
Apparently,people don't wanna buy their
pizza from parents of an alleged arsonist.

146
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,090
Yeah, but porter didn't do it.

147
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,980
Well,maybe peopletill think that he's
guilty, or maybe it's the economy.

148
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,630
Or maybe it's both. I don't know.

149
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,450
All I know is, I am driving a "dad car"
while some other guy is out rolling with foxy.

150
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,520
Oh,buddy. I'm so sorry.

151
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,080
I wish there was something I could do.

152
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,980
We should get going.

153
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,250
But if we can help in any
way, um,let us know. Okay?

154
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,120
Thanks.

155
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,990
Okay,whatjust happened back there?

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,870
Nothing.

157
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,250
Oh,yeah. Like that's gonna work.

158
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,290
Why can't you everremember
who you're dealing with?

159
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,190
Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob-- I can
keep this up all day. Bob?

160
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,960
fine.

161
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,390
The day the case against
porter was dismissed,

162
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,120
I was going over the discovery
materials that the d.a.sent me.

163
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,380
Okay? So?

164
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,820
The witness who put porter in
the storage room at the club,

165
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,460
The only one linking him
directly to the arson--

166
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,020
Tom's helpful buddy
there-- dave williams.

167
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,350
- What?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,870
Porter wasn't even in the building.

169
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,170
What the hell is dave doing?

170
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,880
I don't know,but we have
to tell tom and lynette.

171
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,520
No,that'll just get ugly.

172
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,850
I'm okay with that.

173
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,770
Lee,the charges have been dropped.

174
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,470
It's no longer ourusiness.

175
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,110
Besides,there's something about
that dave guy that scares me.

176
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,940
Oh,i don't get it!

177
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,570
I'm only a few pounds
away from my runway weight.

178
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,260
You want me to let it out?

179
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,950
That would be cheating.

180
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,930
I'm gonna try to go pee again.

181
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,040
It's okay. You've had two
children. The weight redistributes.

182
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,210
Give in to it! I did.

183
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,140
Jean,you didn't just give in to it.
You slapped a piece of cheese on it.

184
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,870
Yeah,i said it. Now just fix the hem.

185
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,720
And this time,try not to
leave the edges frayed.

186
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,960
Hey,edie! Wait up!

187
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,320
Now don't forget, the clasp is broken.

188
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,120
Oh,i'll replace it.

189
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,880
It may not match exactly.

190
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,180
But,um,your hair will cover it.

191
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,560
Jean,carlos is taking me to
the palm,not out for hoagies.

192
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,050
Make it perfect.

193
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,510
I see jean is back.

194
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,670
Ah,yeah. Times are good.

195
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
Not for her.

196
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,680
Her,mrs. Mccluskey said something
about you losing 5 pounds in one day.

197
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,530
How'd you do that?

198
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,350
I got drunk on bourbon and
threw up all over her lawn.

199
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,980
No,not that story.
Something about a boot camp.

200
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,370
Oh,ye. Just started.
Very military,veryintense.

201
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,800
That's perfect. I'm trying to fit
in an old dress. I need intense.

202
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,730
Forget it. You can't get in without a
recommendation, and i'm not recommending you.

203
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,460
Why not?

204
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,260
Because you'd embarrass me.

205
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,720
This is real exercise.

206
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,170
It's not the lotus position
followed by a mocha latte.

207
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,620
Oh,you're just afraid i'm
gonna look better than you!

208
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,710
6:00 a.m.,theark. Prepare to die.

209
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,860
Jeez. This is the tuition?

210
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,570
We're gonna blow his
college fund on first grade.

211
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,960
I know,i know.

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,910
We may have to give up a few luxuries.

213
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,070
Yeah,like food and heat.

214
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,590
Okay,you know the problems
they're having at his school.

215
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,360
And now with all the budget cutbacks...

216
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,630
I mean,this place is fabulous.

217
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,190
Yeah,i'm not saying it's not.
I'd kill to send him there.

218
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,860
But I just can't swing it.

219
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,500
Well,we've gotta do something.

220
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,230
My editor just quit, and my books are
not exactly flying off the shelves.

221
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,030
Could you pick up some extra shifts?

222
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,550
Oh,yeah,i will...

223
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,470
As soon as they create a 30-hour day.

224
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
I'm working around the clock.

225
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,570
What about that big job you just
did for the last three months?

226
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,570
What did you do with that money?

227
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,730
Susan, we're not married anymore.

228
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,440
And what I do with my money
is none of your business.

229
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,980
Yeah,well,if we were
still married,you'd...

230
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,200
Probably would've waited
until I finished my sentence.

231
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,330
What's this?

232
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,780
A check. I understand you and tom
are going through some rough times.

233
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,330
No.

234
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,550
Thank you, but I can't accept this.

235
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,060
However,i would like to know
how much i'm not accepting.

236
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,920
$20,000?

237
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,830
How many cookbooks
are you selling,woman?

238
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,660
We just went to a second printing,
and now they're talking a 3-book deal.

239
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,370
So seriously,i am not
gonna miss that money.

240
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,890
That must be nice. But...

241
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,500
I can't accept it.

242
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,340
Why not?

243
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,330
What's the point of success if you
can't share it with the people you love?

244
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,530
Because the people that you love may not be able
to pay you back, and then you stop loving them.

245
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,900
Then it's not a loan, it's a gift.

246
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,810
Don't you have a birthday coming up?

247
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,800
And so do you.

248
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,730
And i'm gonna feel real crappy when
you unwrap your lavender bath beads.

249
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,580
Come on,lynette. You can't tell me
this money won't take the pressure off.

250
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,720
It would. But I can't.

251
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,440
I wouldn't want it to
affect our friendship.

252
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,160
- Okay.
- Although...

253
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,910
How would you like to own a
piece of an italian restaurant?

254
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,440
What?

255
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,400
It wouldn't be a loan
or a gift. It would be...

256
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,400
An investment that would buy you,say...

257
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,510
15% of scavo's.

258
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,470
Well, that's an intriguing offer.

259
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,980
If we do well, you get
a cut of the profits.

260
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,610
If we go belly-up,we liquidate,
and you get the first $20,000.

261
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,930
And then,of course, my
family moves in with you.

262
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,740
So... Do we have a deal?

263
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,250
We most certainly do... Partner.

264
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,780
Some people think it's strange I
have a contract for my exercise class.

265
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,620
But I want people to understand
the commitment I expect from them.

266
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,020
- I found in the past--
- here you go.All signed.

267
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,150
You didn't even read it.

268
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,440
Oh,no need. I'm up for anything.

269
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,350
Although I did just get a manicure,
so nothing that might chip a nail.

270
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,690
Mrs. Solis...

271
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,090
Let me tell you what I
learn in the israeli army.

272
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,040
A group without commitment
is a group that will fail.

273
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,770
The women in my morning
class are committed.

274
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,410
I am starting to think
thatyouare not tough enough.

275
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,490
Not tough enough?

276
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,870
- Let me tell you something,mr. Iraqi army guy.
- Israeli.

277
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,900
Whatever.

278
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,300
I used to be a model, and
you don't know what war is

279
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,330
Until you've been in a dressing room with a bunch
of size zeroes reaching for the last rice cake.

280
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,920
I am plenty tough.

281
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,030
I'm not so sure.

282
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,860
Hey,i know some of those
women in your exercise class.

283
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,290
The most exercise they ever
get is cutting a piece of cake.

284
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,950
That's a lap!

285
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,880
Excuse me?

286
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,410
In the contract.

287
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,270
There are certain words
I do not tolerate--

288
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,160
"cake," "tired," "can't," "doughnut."

289
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,350
If I hear them, you owe me a lap.

290
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,430
It's an exercise class. Why
would anyone say "doughnut"?

291
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,970
That's another lap!

292
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,150
You know,maybe I should
give this a little gander.

293
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,440
********

294
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,490
When I was in the special forces, we
would do sit-ups in 115-degree weather.

295
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,500
I still have sand in my ass.

296
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,480
You people are weak! Let's go! Let's go!

297
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,870
Gaby,knock it off. You're
gonna get us all in trouble.

298
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,820
It's hard.

299
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,860
Of course it is. That's
why it's called boot camp.

300
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,090
Just hang in there,gaby.
We all went through it.

301
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,320
Shut up,mona. I'm puking air.

302
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,910
He's coming. Get crunching.

303
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
Did I hear talking?

304
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,720
Sorry,sir! She got a little nauseous.

305
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,620
I don't give a rat's ass what your
problem is. You retch on your own time.

306
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,710
Okay. We need to talk.

307
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,390
Gaby,no.

308
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,620
What the hell are you doing?

309
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,720
Get your butt back down!

310
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,340
Yeah,yeah,yeah. Time-out.

311
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,610
Time-out?

312
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,650
Look,i appreciate this
whole military commando act,

313
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,790
But i'm new at this, and
frankly,this is a bit much.

314
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,290
- A bit much?
- Yeah.

315
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,930
Are we gonna get a break soon?

316
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,960
Oh,we want a break.

317
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,460
Like,maybe some coffee, me pastry?

318
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,270
Oh,that sounds so yummy. You got any?

319
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,600
No,i don't got any! Now get
down or i'm gonna put you down!

320
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,730
I said time-out!

321
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,030
There is no time-out! You
signed a contract! Now get down!

322
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,380
Don't take that tone
with me. I am paying.

323
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,070
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do
it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

324
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,420
Who brought her here?

325
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,730
That would be me! Sorry,sir!

326
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,510
Because of edie, our
2-mile run is now 4 miles!

327
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,860
Oh,my god. Look at those.

328
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,500
What's going on?

329
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh,susan, you gotta check these out.

330
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,940
Oh,please don't make a fuss.

331
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,340
They're magnicent. Susan,look at 'em.

332
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,680
Uh,what am I looking at exactly?

333
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,740
The pearls.

334
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,560
Oh,those. Oh,they're stunning.

335
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,150
Thank you.

336
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,630
Well,i have a big bar
mitzvah to prep. See ya.

337
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,270
She's so lucky. Mike
is such a great guy.

338
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,030
What? Mike bought those?
He bought her pearls?

339
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,520
He's a keeper.

340
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,230
Oh,that's right. You
didn't keep him,did you?

341
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,360
Lynette,hi. Oh,i wish I had time for
a chat, but i'm on my way to a meeting.

342
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,500
I might design my own line
of bakeware. Can you imagine?

343
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,490
- This will just take a sec.
- Okay.

344
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,440
Tom and I are so grateful for your investment
that we want to do something special for you.

345
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,210
Oh,that sounds lovely.

346
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,010
We'd like to shut scavo's down for the
night and throw a party in your honor.

347
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,480
Just family and friends.

348
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,740
We'd toast your success and have a
night of fun, just like old times.

349
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,590
What do you say?

350
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,360
Oh,that sounds nice.
Can we walk and talk?

351
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,530
Yeah,yeah.

352
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,230
You know what might be even better?

353
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,890
My publisher has been begging me
to do a local launch for my book.

354
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,000
I could do a signing at your
restaurant and finally fill the place.

355
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,820
Would you hold that for a moment?

356
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,600
Well,we've filled the place many times,but
it's your party. Whatever you want.

357
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,940
Oh,you can just put that
on a hanger in the back.

358
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,890
What I want is to make
this an opportunity foryou.

359
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,290
We can turn one of your dismal thursday
night seatings into a real event.

360
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,560
- I don't know what to say.
- Well,don't thank me. It was your idea.

361
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,410
Right.

362
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,910
Glad I thought of it.

363
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,460
Susan mayer knew she couldn't always give
her son everything she would've liked...

364
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,730
Yet when she saw her child's tuition
around katherine mayfair's neck,

365
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,580
She felt something had
been stolen from him.

366
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,880
And it didn't take her long to decide...

367
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,270
How she was going to get it back.

368
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,950
Susan,hi.

369
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,700
You at home?

370
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,290
Uh,yeah. I'm just about to
jump in the shower. What's up?

371
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm going crazy 'cause I think
I left my front door unlocked.

372
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,340
Could you run and check?

373
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,700
I'll stay on the line.

374
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,720
No,no. I totally understand.

375
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,730
The one day I don't lock up, I always
thinkthat'sthe day somebody's gonna break in.

376
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,110
Exactly.

377
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,040
And so even though I was
already halfway to the airport,

378
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,340
I turned around and I came home,
and,yep,i had left the garbage disposal on.

379
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,680
So ever since then, I always check.

380
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh,i'm the same way. Anyway,you can
relax. The front door's all locked up.

381
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,110
Oh,you know what? I'm actually
still worried about the side door.

382
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,100
Do you think you could check that,too?

383
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,820
Already did. You're good.

384
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,500
Well,i'm gonna take that
shower now. See ya later,hon.

385
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,040
Mike,is that you?

386
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,530
You're just in time.

387
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,010
Susan?

388
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:35,130
Susan mayer! For god sake,
give me back my pearls!

389
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,070
Pearls or towel--
you decide.

390
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,310
You wouldn't dare.

391
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,060
I have been naked on this street.

392
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,130
It would be nice to take
the heat off that story.

393
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,110
Have you lost your mind?

394
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,750
Mike said he can't afford to
pay for m.j.'s private school.

395
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,880
Now I know why.

396
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:54,260
He wants to see his girlfriend
wearing pearls when she flashes him.

397
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,070
What? He wouldn't pay for m.j.'s school?

398
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,880
No. So I was going to take these
and sell them to try to pay for it,

399
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,470
And,yes,now that i'm saying it out
loud, I hear how stupid that sounds.

400
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,820
I can't believe mike would do that.

401
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,920
Well,he did.

402
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,640
Hey,mrs. Mayfair. It's nice to see you.

403
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,330
Perhaps we should discuss this later.

404
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,870
This can't be good.

405
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,340
So is this a "welcome home, we
missed you" kind of thing or...

406
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,690
Damn right,"oh."

407
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,040
What happened to "i'm broke and can't
afford to send m.j. To private school"?

408
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,770
Don't get me wrong,mike. It was
a wonderfully generous present.

409
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,610
But you can't go around blowing your
kid's money on jewelry for your girlfriend.

410
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,200
What did these cost you? $4,000,$5,000?

411
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,010
- What?
- They're fake,okay?

412
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,540
And I knew howadly you wanted pearls,
and I couldn't afford real ones.

413
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,690
And the salesman swore you'd never
know the difference, and she didn't.

414
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,040
Well...

415
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,280
At least you won't feel
bad if you ever lose them.

416
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,310
I just wanted to get you a really
nice gift, and I don't know.

417
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,440
I-i guess I was
embarrassed when I couldn't.

418
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,700
Mike,don't ever feel like you
have to spend money to impress me.

419
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,310
Okay? Trust me.

420
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,770
I'm already very impressed.

421
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,630
Okay,okay. Point made. Move along.

422
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,120
I'll go fix us some dinner.

423
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,410
How dare you.

424
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,100
I didn't know they were fake.

425
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:17,330
I mean how dare you think that I would put jewelry
for my girlfriend ahead of my son's education.

426
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:23,640
Okay,maybe I jumped to conclusions,
but this school is important for m.j.

427
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,540
I feel really bad that
we're falling short.

428
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,790
Susan,i've been at work
since 6:00 this morning,

429
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,150
and after I inhale a 5-minute dinner,
i'm going back out till midnight.

430
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,210
I am busting my ass to give our son the best,
so ifwe'refalling short, it's not because of me.

431
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,910
What?

432
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,480
Where are you? You're late for training.

433
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,190
Oh,yeah,i quit that.

434
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,140
There is no quitting.
It's in the contract.

435
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:08,690
Yeah,well,maybe you should take
it up with my lawyer. Here he is.

436
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,510
We are not leaving!

437
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,800
Come on,ladies! Keep
going! Keep it moving!

438
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,280
What the hell do you think you're doing?

439
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,970
When you don't come to boot camp,
boot camp comes to you. Fall in!

440
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,480
Are you out of mind? I
have two sleeping children.

441
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,380
Oh,i know. I've seen
the cellulite. Fall in!

442
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,440
Do it,gaby. There is no quitting.

443
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,400
Oh,don't get all holier than thou,mona.

444
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,350
I saw you pull into the
doughnut shack yesterday.

445
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,350
Doughnut--that's
a lap!

446
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,280
Oh,really? Well,try this on for size.

447
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,100
I'm going back to bed, because i'mtired.

448
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,010
And when I wake up, maybe i'll
have somecake, and youcan'tstop me.

449
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,000
Gaby! Where are you going?

450
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,100
If you don't get out there, he is
gonna take it out on the rest of us.

451
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,770
Well,frankly, some of them need it.

452
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,650
I just came for a little remodel, and
there are some real teardowns out there.

453
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,060
You are one spoed, selfish,little brat.

454
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,050
Oh,for god sakes,edie, it's
a stupid exercise class.

455
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,460
I tried it. It sucked. I don't
want to do it anymore. Lighten up.

456
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,420
Well,that stupid little exercise
class is filled with women

457
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,570
Who bust their asses three times a week while
raising kids and holding down full-time jobs.

458
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,830
Well,they're crazy.

459
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,330
He yells,and they jump.

460
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,500
He tells them to run all the
way over here,and they do it.

461
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,180
He didn't make us come
here. We agreed to.

462
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,860
What the hell for?

463
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,490
Because you told us that it was
important to you to get into that dress.

464
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,230
So we came here to support you.

465
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,910
You wanted the old gaby back?
Well,congratulations.You got her--

466
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,000
a self-centered, obnoxious jerk.

467
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,000
Personally,i liked
poor,paunchy gaby better.

468
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,900
At least she had some humility.

469
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,570
Okay,time to stretch. Not you!

470
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,930
You are 25 minutes late. Give me 50.

471
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,710
Oh,my god. You'reher!

472
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,340
Well,technically, i'm she,but yes.

473
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,850
Your turkey tetrazzini
saved my marriage.

474
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,420
Would you sign this for me?

475
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,260
Certainly.

476
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,990
I am so excited to be
tasting your food tonight.

477
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,090
My food? What are you talking about?

478
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,320
Oh,well,it says here the chefs of scavo's
are going to be making recipes from your book.

479
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,370
They are?

480
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,930
I can't wait to try
that four cheese pizza.

481
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,650
Well,you might have to. Excuse me.

482
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,890
Lynette.

483
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,760
I understand you and your fellow chefs will
be serving my four cheese pizza tonight.

484
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,240
Yep. Just adding the parmesan.

485
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,990
- But that's commercial parmesan.
- So?

486
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,750
So that's like the dust they sweep off the
floor of a place that makes real cheese.

487
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,300
Oh,no. It's fine. We
use it all the time.

488
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,280
Oh,perhaps you do,but my
recipe specifies fresh grated.

489
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,800
Bree,no one will notice.

490
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,260
Parmesan is the fourth
cheese in a four cheese pizza.

491
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,030
It's the ringo of these cheeses.

492
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,690
Hey,mr. Scavo said the grease
trap is overflowing again.

493
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,560
Oh,for pete sake. I'll be right back.

494
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,150
Uh,take your time.

495
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,930
I'm sorry. We haven't been
introduced. I'm bree hodge,part owner.

496
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,000
- I'm cindy.
- We'll chat later.

497
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,120
Roll out some dough and
show me where the basil is.

498
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,130
We'll be serving three
cheese pizza tonight.

499
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,460
But what about the
pizzas that we just made?

500
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,220
********

501
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,940
This place is packed. It's packed!

502
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,830
Yep. You know what? Bree
really came through for us.

503
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,870
Wait,wait,wait,wait. Even if she hadn't,
you would have landed on your feet.

504
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,410
I had total faith in you.

505
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,690
Andyouhave had three scotch and sodas.

506
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,560
Dude,this money goes
right in your pocket.

507
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,730
I'm just supportingyou.

508
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,880
Hey,i gotta go check
on that grease trap.

509
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,380
Yeah,i gotta get back to edie.
She wanted me home by 10:00.

510
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,340
But,dude,congratulations.
I'm proud of you.

511
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,540
- See ya.
- You bet.

512
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,250
- Hey,tom?
- Yeah?

513
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,330
Nothing. Never mind. You're
busy. You know,wait. I...

514
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,300
I just want you to know that...

515
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,820
That guy's not your friend.

516
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,660
Who? Dave?

517
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,800
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- Yeah.

518
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,700
Son of a...

519
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,380
If this doesn't stop your mother-in-law
from criticizing your cooking,

520
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,790
I will give you a full refund.

521
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,740
- Hey, can I borrow you a sec?
- Now? People are waiting.

522
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,200
You'll still be a celebrity
in five minutes. Come on.

523
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,160
Excuse me.

524
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,060
You want to explain this?

525
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,770
Oh,dear. I was hoping to spare
your feelings, but since you know,

526
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,700
I wasn't comfortable having my recipe
made with substandard ingredients.

527
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,700
We use that parmesan all the time.

528
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,840
You can't go changing
things without asking me.

529
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,640
Hey,you made me partner.

530
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,950
I can change 15%, and
I chose the parmesan.

531
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,130
And I don't know if you've heard,
but people are raving about my pizza.

532
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,120
Well,they probably would
have loved my pizza,too,

533
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,540
But we'll never know, because my partner
threw it in the garbage. What a waste.

534
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,120
Fine. I'll reimburse you,
if that'll make things right.

535
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,920
Oh,sure. It's only money,right?

536
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,970
What's that supposed to mean?

537
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,720
We all know how well you're doing,bree.
You have made that very clear.

538
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,040
But you shouldn't be lording it over everybody
just 'cause you've caught a couple of breaks.

539
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,900
Caught a couple of breaks?

540
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,520
I've worked my ass
off to get where I am.

541
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,790
I've worked my ass off,too.
I just wasn't as lucky as you.

542
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,080
Well,i've always believed
that we create our own luck.

543
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,420
Meaning that i've
created my own failure?

544
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,800
Well,not completely,but let's
face it. You do cut corners.

545
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:14,340
I mean,one of the things I can teach you is
the importance of the attention to detail.

546
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,430
Talk about luck.

547
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,830
When I offered to throw you
this little thank-you party,

548
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,670
I never imagined that it would turn
into an opportunity for me to learn

549
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,400
from the great bree hodge.

550
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,040
Well,i'm not the one who needed
$20,000 to keep my business afloat.

551
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,750
No,you're the one who's
never gonna let me forget it.

552
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,260
- Where are you going?
- Home.

553
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,840
Tell me how the party I
threw for you turns out.

554
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,540
Lynette,i-i-i don't
understand why you're so upset.

555
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,560
I know you don't, but five
years ago, you would've.

556
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,920
My car!

557
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,950
You know that was an accident,right?

558
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,080
I did the best I could
on the clasp,mrs. Solis.

559
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,010
I don't think you'll be
able to tell the difference.

560
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,790
Okay,be honest. Here I come.

561
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,990
So what do you think?

562
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,660
You are stunning. Radiant.

563
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,710
Really?

564
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,300
Really. You're back,mrs. Solis,
exactly like you were before.

565
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,910
Oh,i think i've changed a little bit.

566
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,740
Not that I can see.

567
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,590
If there's nothing else, i'll be going.

568
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,030
- Jean,wait.
- What is it? Is there a problem?

569
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,610
No,no. It's perfect.

570
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:55,460
I just want to tell you how helpful you've been
to me over the years, and i'm really grateful.

571
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,540
Thank you.

572
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,550
Hey,buddy. How was the rest of the...

573
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,520
- I know what you did.
- What?

574
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,110
Don't give me that!

575
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,040
I know that you told the cops
that porter set that fire.

576
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,490
I didn't say he set the fire. I only
said I saw him in the back hallway.

577
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,410
You couldn't have! He wasn't there!

578
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,650
Tom,the cops were really grilling me.

579
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,330
They wouldn't let up.

580
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,150
I had to tell them what I thought I saw.

581
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,080
Porter could have gone to jail.

582
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,730
You almost destroyed my
fami, destroyed our business.

583
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,530
I'll make it up to you. I swear.

584
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,550
I never meant to hurt you or lynette.

585
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,540
Oh,lynette doesn't know
about this. I didn't tell her.

586
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,730
If I had,you'd be dead.

587
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,220
I am so sorry.

588
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,100
I never should have said
anything to the cops.

589
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,630
It was dark. I'd been drinking.
You've gotta believe me.

590
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,540
Stop. Just stop.

591
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,840
- Are you done?
- Yeah.

592
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,420
This is crazy.

593
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,220
I mean,there's gotta be some
way we can work this out.

594
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,150
We're friends.

595
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,600
That's what I thought,too.

596
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,960
But I don't know who you are.

597
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,760
Tom.

598
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,890
Tom.

599
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,430
Can I ask you something?

600
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,690
Go ahead. Shoot.

601
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,980
I've been thinking a lot
about your first wife.

602
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,420
- Edie.
- I know.

603
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,850
Just one question,
and then i'll shut it.

604
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,890
I don't like talking about her.

605
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,270
It has been weeks since I found out she even
existed, and i've never mentioned her once.

606
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,190
Come on. Look at this as my reward.

607
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,910
Okay. One question.

608
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,340
Being married to her...

609
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,450
Or being married to me...

610
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,800
What's the biggest difference?

611
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,850
Honestly?

612
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,410
Our marriage is more real.

613
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,920
Really? In what way?

614
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,800
Well,with her, it was
like... A fairy tale.

615
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,000
I thought it would
last forever. It didn't.

616
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:03,900
What you and I have ismore real
because I know it's not forever.

617
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,700
When I hold you, when I kiss you,

618
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,500
I try to remind myself
to appreciate the moment,

619
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,320
Because tomorrow may never come.

620
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,740
Love...

621
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,700
Is just temporary.

622
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,990
The way the fairy tale ends... Is death.

623
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,790
My first instinct was to ask
you if she was prettier than me.

624
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,480
When will I learn to go with my gut?

625
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,750
I'm sorry. You can't afford the tuition?

626
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,140
No.

627
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,700
But I read in your brochure that
faculty members get a 50% discount,

628
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,390
so for your art department,

629
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:07,100
How would you like to hire an
award-winning children's book illustrator

630
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,780
who is great with kids And
has a face you can't say no to?

631
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,610
Unfortunately, our art
department is fully staffed.

632
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,710
Can't say no.

633
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,380
Miss mayer, I appreciate
your enthusiasm and the face,

634
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,790
but i'm afraid it just won't work out.

635
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,840
I wish you the best of luck.

636
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,870
Yes.

637
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,360
Right.

638
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,160
No,wrong.

639
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,940
Miss mayer,please, i'm so busy.

640
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:49,800
Look,i know I said that m.j.was
a star student, but the truth is,

641
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,870
He's one of those kids
that needs extra attention.

642
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:58,510
The classes at his school are way too big,
and I see him getting lost in the shuffle.

643
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,730
And if he gets lost now...

644
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:08,660
My ex-husband is doing everything that
he can, and I need to know that I am,too.

645
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,090
I will serve lunches.
I will be a janitor.

646
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,680
Anything.

647
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,450
But I am not walking
out on my son's future.

648
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,950
Well,one of our art teachers
does need an assistant,

649
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,260
but you're completely overqualified.

650
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,500
I'll take it.

651
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,480
Congratulations on your new job.

652
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,960
Congratulations on getting
me out of your office.

653
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,420
What's that?

654
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,760
A check for the damage to your car.

655
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,870
I can't afford to go
through my insurance company.

656
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,720
Oh,lynette,don't be silly. It's just
the bumper. You don't need to do that.

657
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,460
Yes,i do.

658
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,820
And the minute we're back on our feet,
I am gonna pay back your investment--

659
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,660
Every penny, with interest.

660
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,800
Lynette,stop. Wait.
Please. Don't be this way.

661
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,750
I don't want money to get
in the way of our friendship.

662
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
Yeah...

663
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,960
I think it's a little late for that.

664
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,460
There's a lot you can do
with money in the suburbs.

665
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,640
You can pay for a night on the town.

666
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,490
