<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:04,541
<i>A friendship was torn apart.</i>

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:08,133
I care about my friends. Sorry you're
no longer a part of that group.

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,535
- I need to talk to you.
- What? Here?

5
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:13,008
<i>Bree's affair was revealed to Orson.</i>

6
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:15,468
<i>Mona threatened Angie.</i>

7
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:18,388
You've got till tomorrow
to get the money, or I go to the police.

8
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:21,141
<i>And then tragedy struck.</i>

9
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:37,206
I'm at the site of a bizarre
accident that happened just hours...

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,219
<i>If you watch the news tonight,</i>

11
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,958
<i>you will be told all about a tragedy</i>

12
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:45,040
<i>that occurred
on a quiet suburban street.</i>

13
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:48,960
<i>You will hear eyewitness
accounts of the crash.</i>

14
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:52,505
<i>You will learn the extent
of the damage.</i>

15
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:56,635
<i>But the news can't tell you
who survived.</i>

16
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,812
<i>Because no one yet knows...</i>

17
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:01,989
<i>For sure.</i>

18
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,200
- Thank God, you're here.
- I was on my way home.

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,560
I got this text from Julie.
She said a plane crashed onto the lane?

20
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,649
A single-engine plane that
had to make an emergency landing.

21
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,226
- The pilot had a heart attack.
- Karl was taken away in an ambulance?

22
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,078
Yeah. He's in surgery.

23
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:25,872
How bad is it?
He's gonna make it, right?

24
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,501
There was a lot of bleeding.
Doctors are doing the best they can.

25
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,901
You want to sit down?
Here. Have a seat.

26
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,217
Was anyone else hurt?

27
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:39,427
Orson... And Mona Clarke.

28
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:42,302
- They're still in surgery.
- Bree got a little banged up,

29
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:46,017
- but nurse says she's gonna be okay.
- And Celia might have a concussion.

30
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,581
- What happened?
- The plane was headed straight for her,

31
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,607
and Lynette pushed her
out of the way. You saved her life.

32
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,506
You would've done the same
thing for my kids. It's no big deal.

33
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:57,804
No, Lynette, we owe you everything.

34
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,448
So what do we do now?

35
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,742
I guess we just wait and pray.

36
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:06,495
I think that's a really good idea.

37
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,925
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

38
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:24,790
I have this terrible pain.

39
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:26,768
<i>The truth is,</i>

40
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,944
<i>no one knows who survived</i>

41
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:31,104
<i>that tragic plane crash...</i>

42
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,998
I think there's something wrong
with the babies.

43
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:40,139
<i>Or more importantly, who didn't.</i>

46
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,050
Any word about Karl?

47
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:03,700
Still in surgery.

48
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,243
I feel like such a hypocrite.

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,156
After that guy cheated on you,
I hated his guts.

50
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:13,288
Never spoke to him again.

51
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,942
And I was just in the chapel
praying for him.

52
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:19,944
I know what you mean.

53
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:24,472
It's pretty complicated for me, too.

54
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:27,594
<i>With that,</i>

55
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:30,872
<i>Susan began to think
of her marriage Karl...</i>

56
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:34,042
<i>How wonderfully it had started...</i>

57
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:38,755
<i>How they'd been so happy...</i>

58
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:44,808
<i>Until the day Susan found lipstick</i>

59
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:47,847
<i>where she shouldn't have.</i>

60
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:53,874
<i>Susan then thought of the day
she told Karl to leave,</i>

61
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,153
<i>and she wondered...</i>

62
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:59,025
<i>What if she hadn't?</i>

63
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,614
Wait! Don't go.

64
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,449
You just kicked me out.

65
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:07,924
I know.

66
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,738
I put 12 years of my life
into this marriage,

67
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,890
and we have a daughter.

68
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,086
We owe it to Julie
to try to work this out.

69
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:21,287
Don't touch me.

70
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:22,757
You're still a pig.

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,944
If we are gonna put this behind us,

72
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:33,518
I need to know about everyone that
you've been with since we were married.

73
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,064
Everyone?

74
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,783
I don't think this is a good idea.

75
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:43,956
I don't want to be wondering,
when we go to a party or a restaurant,

76
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:47,198
"Did he sleep with her?
Her? Her?"

77
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:51,781
- You found out about Brandy.
- Yes.

78
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:55,353
It was nice to put the panties
with a face.

79
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:57,297
Go on.

80
00:04:58,284 --> 00:04:59,586
Before her...

81
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,045
Let's see...

82
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,882
It was Amber,
the dental hygienist...

83
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,242
Kwan Lee, the massage lady...

84
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,321
Remember
when we had cable installed,

85
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:14,058
and you wondered why we got
so many channels for free?

86
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,942
You know what?
Maybe you were right.

87
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:19,944
It's good to have some secrets.

88
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,513
Why don't you just go
upstairs and unpack your stuff?

89
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,527
I will learn how to swallow my rage.

90
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:27,278
You are not gonna regret this.

91
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:07,941
Hey there. I'm Mike Delfino.

92
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:12,450
We met at Mary Alice's funeral.

93
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,162
Your husband told me
you have a clogged sink.

94
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,344
Come on in.

95
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,505
So how you liking
the neighborhood so far?

96
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:33,133
I like it.
It seems quiet...

97
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,556
- Friendly.
- It is. And safe.

98
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:38,518
I bet we have the lowest
crime rate in America.

99
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:41,539
You need to get that?

100
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:43,688
Let the machine get it.

101
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,068
<i>Hi. It's Susan and Karl.
Leave us a message.</i>

102
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:51,416
<i>Suse. It's me.
I'm gonna be working late.</i>

103
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:54,486
<i>Don't hold dinner for me.
The switchboard's gonna be closed,</i>

104
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:57,036
<i>so don't bother calling.
Love ya.</i>

105
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,207
He's screwing his secretary.

106
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:05,023
My husband.

107
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,094
Thinks he's fooling me.

108
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:08,279
He's not.

109
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:10,375
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:17,372
You know,

111
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,084
what would serve him right...

112
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:23,354
To come home

113
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:26,730
and find me in bed with another man.

114
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:31,404
- I gotta go.
- What's the rush?

115
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:34,198
I've got to
get a part at the hardware store.

116
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,455
And they close at 6:00.

117
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:44,709
Am I that undesirable?

118
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:48,087
No, you're very desirable,
in a big way.

119
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,714
Did you just call me fat?

120
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,552
I think you're very beautiful.
It's just...

121
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:57,545
You're married.

122
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:00,968
Right.

123
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:02,961
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:06,689
If you're unhappy,

125
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,646
you should do something about it.

126
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,846
Please.
Not another business trip.

127
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,455
Please.

128
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,075
- Let it be another business trip.
- I tried.

129
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,737
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:55,911
That's it?

131
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,893
15 years of marriage,

132
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,744
and that's all I get,
two lousy sentences?

133
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:03,663
I don't know what else to say.

134
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:05,943
How about...

135
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,404
"Hey, Susan,

136
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:11,734
"thanks for eating nothing
but broccoli and colon cleanser

137
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:15,049
"for the last six months so you
could lose weight and look good for me"?

138
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:17,063
Or, "Hey, Susan,

139
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:20,122
thanks for wasting the best
years of your life while I went out

140
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:22,598
and banged everything with
a GED and a tramp stamp."

141
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,657
I'm sorry, okay?

142
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:28,937
But you could've
spared yourself all this pain

143
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,903
if you'd just let me go
the first time.

144
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:40,885
You really do deserve better, Susan.

145
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:58,342
Mrs. Delfino?

146
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,473
Karl didn't make it.

147
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:07,152
Oh, my God.

148
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,104
If there's anything you need,

149
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,482
we have counselors available.

150
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:15,465
I'll be fine.
Thank you.

151
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,869
I can't imagine
what you must be feeling.

152
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,006
Mostly...

153
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,389
I'm feeling grateful.

154
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,992
<i>Bree Hodge was told about
the death of Karl Mayer</i>

155
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:46,087
<i>at 6:12 that evening.</i>

156
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:48,747
<i>She became so hysterical</i>

157
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,830
<i>she had to be sedated by 6:18.</i>

158
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,483
<i>It wasn't long
before she fell asleep.</i>

159
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:58,542
<i>And then she began to dream...</i>

160
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:02,562
<i>A dream about what
her life would have been like</i>

161
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:04,767
<i>if Karl hadn't died.</i>

162
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:09,055
You are so corny!

163
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,252
No deviating from the marriage playbook.
I'm doing it right this time.

164
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:17,897
Happy?

165
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:21,097
You've made me happy
in ways I couldn't even imagine.

166
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:24,392
If it wouldn't be too much trouble,
would you mind pulling down my zipper

167
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,139
with your teeth
and taking me on the table?

168
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:32,022
What is it with you women
once you get a ring on?

169
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,114
And if you're a stickler for tradition,
we could always

170
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:37,594
- take it up to our bedroom.
- Our bedroom...

171
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,318
I like the sound of that.

172
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:43,810
Get used to it... Because it's
going to be our bedroom for a long,

173
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,980
long time.

174
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,089
I meant what I said when I proposed.

175
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,456
Being with you is gonna make me
into a whole different man.

176
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:55,810
I hope not completely different.

177
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,611
I don't ever want to lose
that sexy beast

178
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,506
who swept me off my feet.

179
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:05,423
Trust me.
He's not going anywhere.

180
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,682
Honey, that was fantastic.

181
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:14,812
Oh, my God.

182
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,136
You're supposed to be
catering a wedding.

183
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,779
Yes, clearly this is my fault.

184
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:23,070
- Courtney?
- I'm so sorry, Bree.

185
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:25,614
Really, Karl, my yoga instructor?

186
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,491
No charge for next month.

187
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:29,623
Like I'm keeping you!

188
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,204
- Get the hell out of my house.
- She's going.

189
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:34,371
I'm not talking to her!

190
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:38,353
How could you, Karl?
In our own bed?

191
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,421
You're right.
That was tacky.

192
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:41,844
I am so sorry.

193
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:44,925
- I'll call you.
- What?

194
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,427
Sorry. Force of habit.

195
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,978
This thing doesn't have to
mean any more than we decide it does.

196
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,778
You made a vow to me.

197
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:55,102
Why did I think I could change you?

198
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
I know.

199
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:59,899
You thought you could turn me
into your personal lapdog, like Orson.

200
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,407
- You leave Orson out of this.
- Why?

201
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,950
I haven't done a thing to
you that you didn't do to him.

202
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,864
Get out of my house!

203
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,696
- The truth hurts, doesn't it?
- Get out.

204
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,727
I didn't know who else to call.

205
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,711
You were his emergency contact.

206
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:23,594
I'm just a little surprised.

207
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:27,545
Orson and I hadn't spoken
in nearly ten years.

208
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:31,913
Are you sure there wasn't someone
else in his life? A girlfriend maybe?

209
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,242
Never saw one.

210
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:37,720
In fact, in seven years he lived here,
I never saw anybody visit him at all.

211
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:45,486
Where did you... find him?

212
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:47,899
In the bed.

213
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,575
Paramedics said it was a heart attack.
He'd been there two days.

214
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:54,596
Can you imagine?

215
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:58,324
Just like that, you're gone,
and no one notices?

216
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,329
Poor Orson.

217
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:08,080
Take whatever you want.
I'll have goodwill pick up the rest.

218
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:47,794
You know, he spoke about you
constantly.

219
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,227
It was always "Bree this,"
"Bree that."

220
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:53,721
It was almost like he died of...

221
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,372
What? Say it.

222
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:00,853
Like he died of a broken heart.

223
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:13,782
I just wanted to tell you
your husband's out of danger.

224
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,397
Thank God for that.

225
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,497
But there were some complications.

226
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,249
What kind of complications?

227
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,792
This is a preliminary assessment,

228
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:27,713
but it seems there has been some
damage to his spinal column.

229
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,716
What does that mean exactly?

230
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:34,637
There's a good chance
your husband is paralyzed.

231
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:45,022
Excuse me. Can you tell me
anything about Mona Clarke's condition?

232
00:15:45,282 --> 00:15:48,291
The doctors, they did everything
they could, but that woman...

233
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:50,202
I mean, she was hit by a plane.

234
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:56,534
Now all we can do is wait
and hope that she pulls through.

235
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:00,021
- Pulls through?
- Yes. Your friend's a real fighter.

236
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:03,132
- She's hanging in there.
- How? She got hit by a plane!

237
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:06,519
The doctors couldn't believe it either.
I don't know if you're religious but,

238
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,212
now would be the time to pray.

239
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,673
Believe me, we will.

240
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,927
Dear God, please take that
blackmailing bitch home now.

241
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,837
A freaking plane hit her.
What is it gonna take, a silver bullet?

242
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm gonna go home, pack up our stuff.
You stay here.

243
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,973
If they pry the propeller out of
her mouth and she starts yapping,

244
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,840
get the hell outta here.

245
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,808
<i>Just like that,</i>

246
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:35,281
<i>Angie Bolen began to consider
what was happening.</i>

247
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:39,285
<i>She thought of the doctors
trying to save Mona</i>

248
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:43,289
<i>and how long it might take her
to recover.</i>

249
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:48,527
<i>Then she imagined Mona waking up...</i>

250
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,882
<i>and telling the police
everything she knew.</i>

251
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:56,271
<i>And Angie asked herself,</i>

252
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:59,888
<i>what would happen
if Mona Clarke lived?</i>

253
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,291
How about a little lunch,
Ms. De Luca?

254
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,025
Eggplant parm.

255
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:15,695
It's not like the place you used to go
into on east 10th street, but not bad.

256
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,659
- I want to see Nick.
- He's a little busy.

257
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,871
I just want to talk to him
for a couple minutes.

258
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:27,808
As far as the bureau is concerned,
Nick is a traitor.

259
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,794
Get used to it. You're never gonna
talk to him again.

260
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:32,338
What about Danny?

261
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:35,403
Tyler is with your mother.

262
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,543
But enough about what you want.
Here's what I want...

263
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,264
Patrick Logan.

264
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:55,944
You need to be thinking
real clear right now.

265
00:17:56,855 --> 00:18:00,724
We know Logan ran everything, but
without him, it's all gonna fall on you.

266
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,746
I don't know where he is. I
haven't spoken to him since that night.

267
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:09,093
You've been on the run 18 years,
and you and your former lover

268
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:11,043
don't even exchange a phone call?

269
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:13,597
Don't take this personally,
agent Padilla,

270
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,798
but you weren't the ones
I was running from.

271
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:18,922
I know Logan.

272
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:21,095
I know how scary he is.

273
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,602
But I think the situation
you're in now...

274
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,228
is worse.

275
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:30,401
Then you don't know how scary he is.

276
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:38,779
Federal sentencing guidelines
dictate the punishment in this case.

277
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,115
There's no room for leniency
from the court.

278
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,247
That being said, Miss De Luca,

279
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,619
you would like to address the court.

280
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,869
Thank you, your honor.

281
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,376
No one...

282
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,665
Was supposed to get hurt.

283
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:59,511
We believed in something, and we wanted
to make other people believe in it, too.

284
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,963
But someone did get hurt.

285
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:05,097
A man died.

286
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,538
I read every newspaper article
about your husband,

287
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,896
about Sean.

288
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:15,203
How he coached little league,

289
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,351
that the whole neighborhood
came to his funeral.

290
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:22,317
I never lived in a world
like that...

291
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,742
until we moved to Fairview.

292
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,241
I never felt like
a part of a community,

293
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,447
which...

294
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:32,960
made it so much clearer to me

295
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:36,560
how horrible it is
that I brought so much pain to yours.

296
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,430
Please rise for sentencing.

297
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:51,414
Angela De Luca, you are hereby
sentenced to life imprisonment

298
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,668
without the possibility of parole.

299
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:56,893
Marshals, remand the prisoner
to custody.

300
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:19,693
So... How is she?

301
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:26,762
I'm so sorry.
She didn't make it.

302
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:31,517
I know how upset you must be.

303
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:35,854
Please don't be angry with God
because your prayers weren't answered.

304
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,943
Don't worry about it, hon.

305
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,401
Me and God are good.

306
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:52,297
I spoke with the doctor.
They are goingo keep her

307
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:55,612
- overnight for observation.
- I thought they said she was fine.

308
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,881
They're just being
extra cautious. That's all.

309
00:20:58,834 --> 00:20:59,967
Look at her.

310
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:01,930
I feel bad even saying it,

311
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:04,028
with everything
that's happened but...

312
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:06,674
we really lucked out, huh?

313
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:09,398
I don't think it was luck.

314
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:11,015
I think it was God.

315
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,932
Actually, it was Lynette.

316
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,199
Lynette was his instrument.

317
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:17,674
Either way, it was a hell of a tune.

318
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:18,941
I'm serious.

319
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,167
I think God saved Celia
because she's special.

320
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:23,584
She has a gift.

321
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:26,482
What kind of gift?

322
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:28,544
I'm not sure yet.

323
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:30,477
But she has one.

324
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,400
I know she's gonna do
something amazing with her life.

325
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:38,095
Fine.
While you figure out

326
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:41,830
how our daughter's gonna change
the world, I'm going to the cafeteria.

327
00:21:41,997 --> 00:21:43,177
See you in a few.

328
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:46,972
<i>As she lay there,</i>

329
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,077
<i>Gabrielle began to think of ways
her daughter could shine.</i>

330
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,044
<i>She thought of music...</i>

331
00:21:58,135 --> 00:21:59,701
<i>And sports...</i>

332
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:06,724
<i>And other creative pastimes.</i>

333
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:12,636
<i>And before she drifted off to sleep,</i>

334
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:14,655
<i>Gabrielle wondered,</i>

335
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:17,441
<i>what if her daughter was destined</i>

336
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,582
<i>to be a great actress?</i>

337
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,095
Celia Solis. How old are you?

338
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:32,434
Five. It's our first audition.
We're very excited.

339
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,271
Well, great. Such a cutie,
just what we're looking for.

340
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,022
She can be cuter. Show him honey.

341
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,432
Good girl.

342
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:48,200
This is a... Here. This is a commercial
for Ouch Away! Bandages.

343
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,952
Stand right there on the T.

344
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,208
You just got a boo-boo
on your finger.

345
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,915
You're gonna hold it up,
look real sad and cry, okay?

346
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
And go.

347
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,841
No. Don't smile, honey.
We need you to cry.

348
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:06,541
Let's try it again.

349
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,257
- Thank you... Thank you very much.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

350
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:16,867
You gotta give her
another shot. Please.

351
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:20,172
I love the look, but can I be honest
with you, mom? The side dish that came

352
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:22,651
- with my lunch has more talent.
- What are you saying?

353
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:25,612
I'm saying she's not as good
as coleslaw. Deal with it.

354
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:29,284
That little girl is here for a reason.
She is going to inspire people,

355
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,651
and you are gonna be part of that!

356
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,079
All right. Well, hurry up.

357
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
All right.

358
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,169
I got you another chance.
Can you cry for mommy?

359
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,505
Sure you can.

360
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,584
When that nice casting man
asks you to hold up a finger,

361
00:23:46,751 --> 00:23:48,802
just hold it up and cry.
How easy is that?

362
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:56,406
Hello?

363
00:23:56,774 --> 00:23:57,774
What?

364
00:23:58,224 --> 00:23:59,585
Oh, my God.

365
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:03,522
Daddy fell and hurt himself.
I don't think he's gonna make it.

366
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,463
And... when he fell,

367
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,452
he landed on...

368
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,988
your hamster cage

369
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,225
and crushed Mr. McFuzz.

370
00:24:17,392 --> 00:24:19,750
He is dead. Mr. McFuzz is dead.

371
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:29,801
Roll it.

372
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,579
Gaby, I'm going to take Celia
for an ice cream!

373
00:24:37,746 --> 00:24:39,096
Be back in a bit!

374
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,474
The bus for camp
leaves in 20 minutes.

375
00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:50,030
But what about my auditions?
Mommy's gonna kill us.

376
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,785
Let me handle mommy.

377
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:53,909
You need a sleeping bag
to get ice cream?

378
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,410
Run!

379
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,921
Leave it. Leave it! Leave it!

380
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:19,830
What the hell are
you doing? We talked about this.

381
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:22,187
No summer camp.
She's got auditions.

382
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,684
You have got her living
in this weird little bubble,

383
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:26,871
and she needs to be
around kids her own age.

384
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,528
She will be. I'm taking her
to a casting call for "Annie".

385
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,655
Why can't you support her career?

386
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:35,107
Celia, will you wait
in the car, please?

387
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,320
Thank you, sweetie.

388
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,165
Because she stinks.

389
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:46,660
That little girl is destined for
greatness. That is why God saved her.

390
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:49,131
God does not save people who stink.

391
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,154
Maybe God saved her so that
she could go to camp and

392
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:54,678
make some friends
and have a normal childhood!

393
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:57,408
Who would believe
in a God like that?

394
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,517
- Gaby, she's miserable.
- No, she's not. She wants this.

395
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,477
No, she does it to please you!

396
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:05,833
That is a horrible thing to say.
I am not hurting her.

397
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,750
In fact, making her shine
is my life's work.

398
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:12,195
All I want is for people to
understand how special she is.

399
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,114
- Get in the house!
- Celia, wait.

400
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:17,409
I'm sorry, but you have
clearly lost your mind,

401
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,919
and I'm not gonna stand here and
watch you ruin our daughter's childhood.

402
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:23,039
If you don't like it, leave.

403
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,790
Gaby, be careful what you say,
because I am very close to going.

404
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:30,934
See ya. Come on.

405
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,719
Let's go get ready for your audition.
You're gonna be the best annie ever.

406
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:46,229
<i>There you go, sweetie.</i>

407
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,432
<i>All better.</i>

408
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,699
<i>Ouch Away!, adhesive bandages...</i>

409
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,159
<i>They heal with a mother's love.</i>

410
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:00,494
Look at that face. That's a star.

411
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,402
You're not watching this again.

412
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:07,643
Now please,
help me with the groceries.

413
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:12,006
Did you get my wrinkle cream?

414
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:14,600
You can't buy stuff like that
with food stamps.

415
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,917
I know. I just wish you loved me
enough to steal it.

416
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:30,357
Jerry, sweetie.

417
00:27:30,743 --> 00:27:32,393
Honey, it's your agent.

418
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:34,361
Celia's dying to work.

419
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:36,427
What do you got for us?

420
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,497
Come on. There's gotta be something.

421
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:44,037
No, no. She's not too old.
She can pass for 15.

422
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,873
Hell, I'm looking at her
right now. Okay, we'll be there.

423
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,370
Baby, we've got an audition.

424
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:52,127
And we gotta get that hair
into pigtails.

425
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:54,365
I think we need to talk.

426
00:27:54,532 --> 00:27:58,093
What did I dowith those ace bandages?
We gotta flatten you down.

427
00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:01,346
Listen to me.
I don't want to be an actress.

428
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,765
What? You can't quit. You're...

429
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:07,761
I'm special. This is my destiny.
It's why I was spared.

430
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:12,284
You spent the last 20 years
telling me I'm meant for big things.

431
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,972
And you are.

432
00:28:15,431 --> 00:28:17,779
I'm not special. I'm normal.

433
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,864
And I just want to have
a normal life.

434
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,909
Get married, have kids.

435
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,662
And there's gonna be
plenty of time for that.

436
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,501
You always say that.

437
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:30,166
Why can't you admit it's over?

438
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:34,166
Because if we give up,

439
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:37,507
then everything I've worked for
is for nothing.

440
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,250
Your father walked out.
Your sister never calls.

441
00:28:43,644 --> 00:28:45,094
This is all I have.

442
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:50,603
What time's the audition?

443
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:52,704
Tomorrow, 3:00.

444
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:56,478
Now let's do something
about this hair.

445
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,761
Honey, this is the one. I feel it.

446
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:02,479
One day you're gonna thank me.

447
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,507
I brought you coffee.

448
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:25,339
So have you figured out what our
4-year-old is gonna do with her life?

449
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,851
But I did figure out what
she has to do to be special.

450
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,311
What's that?

451
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:38,407
Absolutely nothing.

452
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,202
How could this happen? I know
I fell, but I felt fine afterwards.

453
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,851
It doesn't take much to cause
a tear to the placenta.

454
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:51,623
But you said the one baby is fine?

455
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,784
But if we don't operate
on the other one, there could be

456
00:29:54,951 --> 00:29:57,379
a decrease
in blood flow to the brain,

457
00:29:57,721 --> 00:30:00,215
which could put the child
at risk developmentally.

458
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,802
- At risk how? Physically? Mentally?
- Right now

459
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,553
there's no way to know.

460
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:12,627
- How soon can we do the surgery?
- We're ready to go. Let's get her in.

461
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,319
<i>At that moment,</i>

462
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:22,367
<i>Lynette began to think of
the baby she had yet to meet.</i>

463
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:28,243
<i>She thought of what it would
be like to hold him,</i>

464
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:32,747
<i>how it would feel to look
into his eyes...</i>

465
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:37,313
<i>and to kiss his tiny hand.</i>

466
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:41,088
<i>And then</i>

467
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:45,226
<i>Lynette thought of what would
happen if the doctor told her</i>

468
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:47,667
<i>that same beautiful child</i>

469
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,013
<i>was disabled.</i>

470
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:00,828
He especially hates
the hamstring stretches.

471
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:03,398
Well, and obviously it's hard
to hear him cry,

472
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:06,214
but you really need to tune it out,
because without the therapy,

473
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:08,031
his muscle tone will...

474
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:10,798
You try. Maybe it's me.

475
00:31:12,216 --> 00:31:14,173
Sometimes it helps to sing to them.

476
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,624
I do that.
He loves it when I do that.

477
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:19,294
And the sailor said, "Brandy,

478
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:21,212
you're a fine girl"

479
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,617
what a good wife you would be".

480
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,218
Why don't we take a break?

481
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:31,119
Maybe we should take some time
and talk about where we're at.

482
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:35,481
Where we're at is we haven't seen
any milestones since august.

483
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,313
Not since he finally started
grabbing his feet.

484
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:40,994
- But that was a big one.
- Definitely.

485
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:43,754
But he should be sitting
by now, right?

486
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:46,613
Or pulling to stand or crawling.

487
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,764
If you worry too much about what
he suld be able to do by now

488
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:53,495
or what other kids his age are doing,
it's gonna drive you crazy.

489
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:55,788
Fine.

490
00:31:56,135 --> 00:32:00,043
I know I keep saying this, but try
to focus on the progress he's making.

491
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:02,148
Like what?

492
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:05,298
You're with him every day.
You tell me.

493
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:07,468
What do you see?

494
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:20,177
Would you, um,
excuse us for a second?

495
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:24,646
What is it?

496
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:26,528
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?

497
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,021
This, her, the therapy,

498
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:31,131
and the injections
and the equipment.

499
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:34,160
And no one can even tell us
if any of it is helping.

500
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,610
I think it is.

501
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:38,456
But even if it isn't,
this is what there is to do,

502
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,917
- so we're doing it.
- Well, I can't.

503
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:44,003
You don't want to. Neither do I.

504
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,811
Neither does he. Didn't you
hear him crying in there?

505
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:50,301
But we don't have a choice. So come on.
Jean's gotta go home soon.

506
00:32:51,154 --> 00:32:55,014
I feel like i'm being punished,
and I don't even know what I did.

507
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,475
You can't think that way.

508
00:32:58,211 --> 00:32:59,861
What else is there to think about?

509
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:02,689
Hopes for the future?
He might not even have one.

510
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,692
He's 14 months.
Don't write him off yet!

511
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:10,238
But you should start thinking
about the future,

512
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,838
because no matter what, it's coming.

513
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:16,311
And it's either gonna make you
less afraid or more,

514
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:20,386
and you will now that you either did
everything that you can for your son...

515
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,043
or you will be sorry.

516
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:44,076
It's okay.

517
00:33:45,563 --> 00:33:46,763
I can do this.

518
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,660
Hi, honey.

519
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,773
Can I have a sandwich?

520
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:12,418
Sure.
I just have to finish these dishes.

521
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:15,789
But I'm hungry.

522
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:20,619
Well, unless you want soap on rye,
you're gonna have to wait.

523
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,620
Actually, why don't you make
yourself a sandwich?

524
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,657
But you always do it.

525
00:34:44,637 --> 00:34:47,418
And you always watch me,
so I know you know how.

526
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:49,564
I'm tired.

527
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:53,209
So am I, and I still have
to vacuum and do the laundry.

528
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,135
My arms hurt.
I had to swim today.

529
00:34:56,487 --> 00:34:59,721
And you do that
so you can get stronger,

530
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,628
so you can do things
like make sandwiches.

531
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:05,534
Speaking of which, in the time
we've been arguing about this,

532
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:07,200
you could've, guess what...

533
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:08,922
made a sandwich.

534
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,512
So could you!

535
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:14,815
Jason's mom makes him
whatever food he wants,

536
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:16,197
even french toast.

537
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:20,409
I would happy to make Jason
french toast, too.

538
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:22,743
He always tells me how pretty I am.

539
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:25,604
Not to mention,
he's also in a wheelchair,

540
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:28,710
so he can't reach the shelves
in the fridge.

541
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:29,977
But you can!

542
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,299
Too bad you don't appreciate it.

543
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:38,094
You're not... You're not really busy!
You just don't want to help me!

544
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,424
You know what? One day
I won't be able to help you

545
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:44,904
because I won't be here,
and then maybe you'll understand

546
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:48,563
why I wanted you to learn
to do stuff for yourself!

547
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,241
Or you won't!

548
00:35:57,505 --> 00:35:59,991
But either way,
I'm not making you a sandwich.

549
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,805
That looks good.

550
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:02,382
Can I have a bite?

551
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:07,445
When I was born,

552
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:10,978
my doctor told my parents
I wouldn't make it through the night,

553
00:37:12,052 --> 00:37:13,652
then through the week,

554
00:37:14,963 --> 00:37:16,913
then it was that I was blind,

555
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:19,223
that I'd need a wheelchair.

556
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:23,528
I guess what I'm saying is...

557
00:37:24,253 --> 00:37:26,641
I've really pissed my doctors off.

558
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:33,013
At first,

559
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,961
my mother was scared...

560
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:37,092
Scared...

561
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,450
of my disability,

562
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:41,108
my limitations.

563
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:44,942
I know this because she told me.

564
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:49,082
Then she realized what she was
really scared of,

565
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:50,549
was my potential

566
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:54,355
and that she's miss something
that would help me reach it.

567
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:57,733
Gandhi said,

568
00:37:58,724 --> 00:37:59,824
"strength...

569
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:04,502
does not come
from a physical capacity.

570
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:08,364
It comes from an indomitable will."

571
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:12,757
My mother's probably
never heard that saying...

572
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:15,492
But every day of my life,

573
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,690
she showed me how true it is.

574
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,756
Now I...

575
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:24,514
I hope...

576
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:26,470
I can start showing her.

577
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:32,587
Thank you.

578
00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:36,189
Thank you all very much.

579
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,044
How's our baby?

580
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:54,641
Is he okay?

581
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:05,847
We lost the baby.

582
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:09,972
But...

583
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,905
The other baby is fine.

584
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:18,349
It's okay.

585
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:22,894
We're gonna be okay.

586
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:02,321
I don't know how to say thank you
for saving my child's life...

587
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:06,249
And how sorry I am for...

588
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,410
We were gonna name him Patrick.

589
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:22,047
And he would have been...

590
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,845
amazing.

591
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:35,489
<i>The funeral for Karl Mayer
was a dignified affair</i>

592
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:39,563
<i>attended by friends and family</i>

593
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:41,535
<i>and those</i>

594
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:43,024
<i>who loved him.</i>

595
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:47,223
<i>The priest spoke about
the nature of tragedy,</i>

596
00:40:47,587 --> 00:40:50,747
<i>how it causes people to ask
"What if?"</i>

597
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:54,784
<i>What if, he hadn't died?</i>

598
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:59,206
<i>What if, I had chosen differently?</i>

599
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,878
<i>What if, I had made that mistake?</i>

600
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:06,965
<i>And then the priest said</i>

601
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:10,176
<i>the best way to honnor
those who had died</i>

602
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:13,822
<i>was to focus and what was</i>

603
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:16,015
<i>and to keep on living</i>

604
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,711
<i>the best way we know how.</i>

605
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:21,478
<i>And in time,</i>

606
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:25,369
<i>that is exactly,
what my friends would do.</i>
