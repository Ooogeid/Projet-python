1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,220
the new neighbor... 
oh,my god. katherine.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,020
turned out to be an old friend of susan's...

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,910
- and that pine tree in the back yard...
- it's my pride and joy.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,150
who had a problem making new friends.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,440
oh,it absolutely kills me to have to ask you to cut it down.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,750
her daughter couldn't recall the past.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,690
- i'm julie's mom. 
- who's julie again?

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,340
your best friend when you were little.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,270
- but her husband had news for susan. 
- you're pregnant.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,030
- lynette revealed her condition.
- i have canr.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,530
gaby and carlos began a secret affair.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,340
- can you get away tonight?
- are you serious?

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,870
and edie uncovered a secret of another sort.

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,180
why didn't you ever tell me about your offshore bank account--

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,340
the one with $10 million in it?

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,280
the great crime wave hit wisteria lane on a tuesday afternoon.

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,340
that's when residents found 
their barbecues upended...

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,630
their clean laundry trampled...

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,000
and their skateboards missing.

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,010
naturally,everyone began to ask

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,980
who could be responsible for such carnage.

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,620
the answer lay in the home of a neighbor

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,540
who,20 minutes earlier,had been engaging in...

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,710
an altogether different type of crime.

26
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,990
oh,i gotta get back.

27
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,070
i told edie i was just going for a jog.

28
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,900
do i look sweaty enough for a 5-mile run?

29
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,430
yeah. unfortunately,it's my sweat.

30
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,050
mmm. mmm.
when are you gonna dump her?

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,080
it's complicated,okay?

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,180
besides,i don't see you
in any big hurry to dump victor.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,870
generally speaking,

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,740
women don't leave their husbands for guys
who have girlfriends.

35
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,600
just boot the bitch.
what are you afraid of?

36
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,030
hey,i am not afraid of--

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,050
oh,my god!

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,020
what the hell's the matter with you?

39
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,720
edie!

40
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,800
gaby,you in there? okay.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,300
one second!

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,210
edie! what brings you here?

43
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,990
i'm looking for carlos.
he went for a run,but it was hours ago.

44
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,080
sorry. haven't seen him.

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,270
really? because ida greenberg said that
she thought she saw him on your porch.

46
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,110
uh,that's impossible,because he's there!
there he is!

47
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,450
what?

48
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,710
carlos! he's at your house.

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,920
- oh,he just let himself in.
- oh.

50
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,130
there you go. he's home.

51
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,390
okay. well,thanks.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,650
you told her i was at home.

53
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,120
so?

54
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,560
so i'm not at home. i'm here.

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
what the hell am i supposed to do?

56
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,450
edie! edie,wait!

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,650
wait,wait,wait! don't go!

58
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,420
don't go! why?

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,690
uh,you,uh,have a birthday coming up,

60
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,850
and,uh,i don't know what to get ya.

61
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,340
or maybe a coffeepot

62
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,030
or scented hangers

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,540
or... a nice clock radio.

64
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,360
gaby,i don't have time for this.

65
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,540
why don't you just surprise me?

66
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,370
uh,wait,but don't go!

67
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,460
i-i need a little more guidance!

68
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,820
damn it,boys! you should not be screwing around in the streets!

69
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,320
somebody's gonna get hurt!

70
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,450
carlos!

71
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,450
can you believe this?
someone broke into our house.

72
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,960
oh,my god.

73
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,930
and so ended the great crime wave
on wisteria lane.

74
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,240
no one ever found out
who was responsible...

75
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,080
ew. honey,you're all sweaty.
go clean up.

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,370
because it was an inside job.

77
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,840
you will never see despair here...

78
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,980
or rage.

79
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,530
you will never see the tiniest bit of regre

80
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,130
you see,the people who live here have learned

81
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,430
there is one sure way of 
hiding their secrets...from their neighbors.

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,460
that's why,in the suburbs,
there is nothing more deceptive than a smile.

83
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,560
so what did julie say,exactly?

84
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,970
she said dylan's not the same girl.

85
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,360
not the same girl like she's changed,

86
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,110
or not the same girl  because she's been replaced by a robot?

87
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,100
i know it sounds weird,but julie says
dylan does not remember anything about living here.

88
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,030
well,maybe she blocked it out.

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,000
did something bahappen to her when she was young?

90
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,200
i'm not sure.
but there was somethingodd about the way they left.

91
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,800
so...

92
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,210
if it isn't the early morning gossip brigade. 
who are we dishing today?

93
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,220
uh,susan.

94
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,330
she's standing right there.

95
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,710
oh,my god.
have you been there this whole time?

96
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,850
anyway,i wanted to
talk to you girls about lynette.

97
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,610
what about her? 

98
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,440
well,since she's been so tired from chemo,

99
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,840
i thought it'd be nice if we did something for her,
like bring her lunch?

100
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,350
- uh,that sounds great.
- yeah,let's do it.

101
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,060
um,gaby,why don't you bring your vegetable lasagna?
susan,you do beverages,

102
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,340
and,uh,katherine, why don't you bring a simple green salad?

103
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,460
i'd rather bring dessert.

104
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,180
oh,no need,dear.
i always bring dessert.

105
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,060
oh,i'm thinking my lemon meringue pie.

106
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,780
oh,yum.

107
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,570
yeah,here's the thing.
the movers lost my salad bowl.

108
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,040
my pie plates,on the other hand--

109
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,730
will not be needed.

110
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,140
as i said,i always bring dessert.

111
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,460
i know.

112
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,090
i will lend you my salad bowl.

113
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,430
you really don't wanna miss bree's pie. 
it's perfect.

114
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,910
who am i to argue with perfection?

115
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,040
oh,sorry. it's justsomething
has been driving me crazy.

116
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,270
now you're perfect.

117
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,490
d-does it hurt?

118
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,680
it's a little uncomfortable,but i'm fine.

119
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,080
take a card.

120
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,560
hey,i told you i'm collecting queens.

121
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,380
pay attention.

122
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,450
you remember we played this 
when you were in labor with parker?

123
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,160
42 hours without meds.

124
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,210
i'll never forget what a trouper you were.

125
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,810
well,let's not compose my eulogy just yet.

126
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,330
i'm still troupin'.

127
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,490
take a card.

128
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,400
right.

129
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,430
it's funny.

130
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,050
we played cards on our honeymoon
the day that it rained.

131
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,340
do you remember that?
we--we lit a fire--

132
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,530
you're doing it again.

133
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,360
sorry.

134
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,950
hey,i told you i'm collecting queens.

135
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,500
shoot. that's right.

136
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,150
oh,my god. are you letting me win?

137
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,130
i just wanna make you feel good.

138
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,660
by taking all the fun t of the kill?

139
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,380
honey,i'm sorry. it's just...

140
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,870
i love you so much.

141
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,030
out.

142
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,030
what?

143
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,230
you are supposed to be distracting me, 
not depressing the hell out of me.

144
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,630
you're kicking me out of chemo?

145
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,710
i'll see you at home.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,860
honey,i'm your ride.

147
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,130
just go. i'll cab it.

148
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,930
there's that trouper that i admire so much.

149
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,660
out!

150
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,240
carlos! 

151
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,420
hi!

152
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,030
hey,there's my birthday girl.

153
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,000
oh. mmm!

154
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,310
it's a nice car.

155
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,330
we got company?

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
no.

157
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,300
then whose is it?

158
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,620
it's... your birthday present to me.
surprise!

159
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,540
a car.
i was gonna get you earrings.

160
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,500
so? get 'em.

161
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,810
and i will drive around with the top down

162
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,930
so everyone can see them.

163
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,480
edie,i can't afford this.

164
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,360
of course you can.

165
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,400
just move some of 
your offshore money onshore.

166
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,110
i told you,that account was a secret,

167
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,560
which it's not gonna be for long
if i start buying N$80,000 cars.

168
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,490
now i'm sensing that this little nest egg of yours

169
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,390
is a teensy bit illegal.

170
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,700
where'd it come from?

171
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,490
you don't need to know that, 
d the i.r.s.doesn't,either.

172
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,650
you want me to go to jail?

173
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,140
goodness,carlos.

174
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,670
i-i had no idea that
your situation was so...

175
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,850
precarious.

176
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,160
well...

177
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,320
i guess i'll just have to
take this back to the dealership.

178
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,500
thank you for understanding,babe.

179
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,530
look,if... if you don't want the earrings, 
just pick something else out instead.

180
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,810
just not too extravagant.

181
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,320
don't worry. i have a thought,

182
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,270
and it's right in your price range.

183
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,480
-
- oh! hi.
- hi.

184
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,220
hey,katherine. what's going on?

185
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,390
why is there a moving van in your driveway?

186
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,650
oh,i meant to call you. i,uh...

187
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,840
it's just been so nuts.  
i got a new job... in chicago.

188
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,910
- what?
- you're just leaving,like that?

189
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,390
i know! it's crazy,huh?

190
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,170
i really wish i had time to talk,

191
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,170
- but i gotta finish packing.
- oh,whoa. no,hang on.

192
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,070
let me just run and get julie
so she can say good-bye to dylan.

193
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,670
oh,we're really in a rush. 
i don't think we're gonna have time--

194
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,530
th-that's okay,guys! keep packing! 
i'll clean it up!

195
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,360
katherine?

196
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,560
are you okay?

197
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,180
you seem a little jumpy.

198
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,880
i just had a-a long night, 
and i-i have a lot to do.

199
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,420
i'm really gonna miss you.

200
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,550
katherine,hi.

201
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,030
oh,uh,i brought you that salad bowl.

202
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,490
- oh,thank you. you're so thoughtful.
- no problem.

203
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,070
hey,you know,i was meaning to ask you, 
how did that job in chicago work out?

204
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,700
job?

205
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,360
you know,the one that 
you left so suddenly for.

206
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,440
oh,right. yes,of course. uh,good.

207
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,150
- uh,it worked out well very challenging.
- oh.

208
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,090
i've got something in the stove. 
i've gotta go.

209
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,850
oh.

210
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,900
susan.

211
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,500
what?i'm eating for two.

212
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,640
well,do both of you wanna be fat?

213
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,470
okay,when i'm in labor

214
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,500
and i am pushing and screaming to 
bring your child into the world,

215
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,410
do you really want me to remember 
that you denied me syrup?

216
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,580
carry on.

217
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,870
mom,i need to talk to you about tonight.

218
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,720
oh,my god.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,230
is it about matt's party?

220
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,740
yeah. it turns out it doesn't start until 10:00,

221
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,130
so can i stay out till 1:00?

222
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,010
well,uh,well,the johnsons live right down the road.

223
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,830
- yeah,i guess that's fine.
- thanks.

224
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,490
whoa,whoa. 
is this the johnsons over on crestview?

225
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,610
yeah.

226
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,830
yeah,i-i don't think you should go to that.

227
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,000
why not?

228
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,720
well,i've done a couple jobs at that house,

229
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,030
and they have some really wild parties.

230
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,130
i don't even wanna tell you
what i've snaked out of that toilet.

231
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,900
- those re his brother's parties.
- matt's not like that.

232
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,450
all 17-year-old guys are like that.

233
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,550
the only reason my buddies and 
i even had parties was to get girls wasted.

234
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,760
well,i don't drink.

235
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,050
neither did missy taylor,

236
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,330
and fast-forward to her tying her bra  on my car antenna.

237
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,060
i really appreciate your concern,

238
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,020
but my mom already told me i could go.

239
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,690
well,that's true.

240
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,050
just giving my opinion.  it's up to your mom.

241
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,740
uh,well...

242
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,510
i mean,you both make a-a good case.

243
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,750
um... but i think 
i'm gonna have to agree with,uh...

244
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,390
- and you know i love you both
- decide.

245
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,290
- mike. i'm going with mike.
- what?

246
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,890
well,it sounds like this party could be
on the wild side, and it is starting very late.

247
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,310
this is so unfair.

248
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,280
i'm sorry,honey.

249
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,250
you wanted decision. this is my decision.

250
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,450
more syrup?

251
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,580
missy taylor?

252
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,360
carry on.

253
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,520
look at your little dylan,all grown up.

254
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,710
karen mccluskey.

255
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,300
i babysat you way back when.

256
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,250
you were a biter.

257
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,360
well,i hope i didn't hurt you.

258
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,080
nah,you were a cutie... but loud.

259
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,330
i remember the racket you used to make on your tricycle.

260
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,880
i gave your dad hell four putting that horn on it.

261
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
my dad?

262
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,100
mm-hmm.

263
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,520
how could you know my dad?

264
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,080
he left when i was a baby.

265
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,960
nah,he used to come around once in a while.

266
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,430
anyway,nice to have you back.

267
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,760
please let me help. 
i feel so guilty just sitting here.

268
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,080
do not move.
we want to pamper you,so please let us.

269
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,060
thank you.

270
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,580
hey,so how's the chemotherapy going?

271
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,520
oh,no,no. she doesn't want to talk about that.

272
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,940
- i don't mind.
- oh,come on.let's dig in to the pie.

273
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,290
looks amazing.

274
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,710
wow.

275
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,040
oh,my god. bree,that is,like,
the best pie you've ever made.

276
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,110
well,thank you.  
i don't think i did anything differently.

277
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,410
this is not my pie.

278
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,550
okay,
you caught me. it's mine.

279
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,010
- what happened to the pie that i brought?
- oh, i was a little sneaky,

280
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,780
and i put it in the fridge.
i just wanted you to try mine.

281
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,220
well, did we or did we not agree 
that i would bring the dessert?

282
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,860
i know, but everyone says
you're such an amazing baker,

283
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,300
and i was hoping you would give me some tips 
to improve my recipe.

284
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,190
well, clearly no tips
are needed.

285
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,190
as my friends said,
"best pie ever made."

286
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,380
well, then perhaps you
shouldn't have said anything.

287
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,880
i would have been happy for
everyone to think it was yours.

288
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,650
so back to chemo--

289
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,780
how's that been?

290
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,030
yeah, so far...

291
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,290
not that bad.

292
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,290
though i did have to
kick tom out yesterday.

293
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,310
why?

294
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,410
he was getting so emotional.

295
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,300
it felt like the last 20 minutes
of "brian's song."

296
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,260
so... i guess i'm in the market
for a new chemo buddy.

297
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,860
well, i would be more
than happy to go with you.

298
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,780
count me in.

299
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,020
i'll sit with you.

300
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,500
i volunteer at the hospital,
so i'll be there anyway.

301
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,990
oh! my god, you guys.

302
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,110
i'm so touched you're all
willing to do this.

303
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,450
what are friends for?

304
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,250
gaby?

305
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,100
oh, no cream for me, thanks.

306
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,410
She staged your lemon meringue pie?

307
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,000
you've gotta be kidding.

308
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,960
i'm not. that despicable woman

309
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,700
was just supposed to bring a simple green salad.

310
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,640
she not only brought
a pie-- she hid mine
and served hers.

311
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,910
well, that's beyond despicable.
that's culinary terrorism.

312
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,950
oh, it gets worse.
her pie was better than mine.

313
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,410
impossible.

314
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,130
it's true.
everyone thought so.

315
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,560
even me. oh, and that
simple green salad--

316
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,490
mache and baby arugula with
duck confit and candied walnuts!

317
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,860
my god, she plays to win.

318
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,260
i have been here for hours
trng to replicate her recipe,

319
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,690
and nothing has even comclose!

320
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,280
don't be so hard on yourself.
this one's fantastic.

321
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,670
- that's hers!
- sorry.

322
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,340
orson, what am i gonna do?

323
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,230
you might have to bite the bullet
and ask her for her recipe.

324
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,880
what? surrender?
debase myself?

325
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,790
bree,
it's your signature pie.

326
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,570
you make it for parties,
church suppers, bake sales.

327
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,320
if she's always right there
behind you with her superior version,

328
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,410
staking out her claim as fairview's
number one homemaker...

329
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,330
she will have stolen
my entire identity.

330
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,170
well,
i wouldn't go that far.

331
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,620
no, it's true. the only thing about me

332
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,040
that's special is what i can do
in the kitchen.

333
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,430
you're right.

334
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,280
i have got
to get that recipe...

335
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,960
by any means necessary.

336
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,180
hey, gaby.

337
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,500
hey, what's up?

338
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,990
well...i felt a little weird
about something that happened at lunch,

339
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,420
and i thought
we should talk about it.

340
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,610
i know. do you believe
that pie business?

341
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,770
i thought bree's head
was gonna explode.

342
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,630
o, not that.

343
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,360
okay, i don't know how
to say this, so i'm just gonna say it.

344
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,570
when everyone was offering
to come with me to chemo--

345
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,150
even katherine,
who i don't even know,

346
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,750
you sort of clammed up.
what was that about?

347
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,030
well, it just seemed like people
had it pretty well covered.

348
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,660
yeah, but between us, 
you're the onei really want there.

349
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,530
out of everyone,
you're the most fun,and i need that now.

350
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,150
oh, that's sweet.

351
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,070
but to be honest,
i don't like hospitals.

352
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,820
nobody likes hospitals.
unfortunately, that's the place

353
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,450
you have to go when you're sick,
or your friends are.

354
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,070
you are my friend, right?

355
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,040
what, is this a test
of our friendship?

356
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,790
yeah... kinda.

357
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,890
can i pencil you in?

358
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,690
i can't wait.

359
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
psst! come here.

360
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,790
okay, i'll come there.

361
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,170
are you still mad at me
about the party?

362
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,390
oh, you picked up on that,
did you?

363
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,930
okay, look, i've been thinking about things, 

364
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,260
and...
just forget what i said earlier.

365
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,170
you mean i can go?

366
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,070
- shh! jeez! ooh,
mike's in the other room.
- you're not gonna tell him?

367
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,500
- no, and neither are you.
- why are you
walking on eggshells?

368
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,700
- you are my mother. you have
every right to override him.
- i know.

369
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,430
i just--i think it's sweet
that he worries about you,

370
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,430
and i want him to feel like he's part of 
the decision making process.

371
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,770
well, clearly he's not if
you're going behind his back.

372
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,240
do you wanna go or not?

373
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
yes! yes, i really wanna
go to the party.

374
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,940
party? you guys still
talking about that?

375
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,070
can you believe it?

376
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,960
ugh! let it go. you know, mike and i decided--
no party, and that's final.

377
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,640
bree.

378
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,320
i hope this isn't
a bad time.

379
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,700
i just wanted to bring you
a housewarming gift.

380
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,050
it's the recipe for
my special mincemeat pie.

381
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,930
it wouldn't be thanksgiving
at my house without it.

382
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,260
well...
aren't you thoughtful?

383
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,830
let me just file this
in my recipe box.

384
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,520
well, as long as we're
swapping pie recipes,

385
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,600
i would love the one for
your fabulous lemon meringue.

386
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,740
really? i'm so flattered
you'd ask.

387
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,260
but i don't share that.

388
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,470
excuse me?

389
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,990
you have to understand--

390
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,760
i experimented for years
before i came up with my secret ingredient.

391
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,830
which is what?
vanilla? nutmeg? cardamom?

392
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,550
if i told you, it wouldn't
be a secret anymore.

393
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,840
it would just be
an ingredient.

394
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,250
well, that, um,
hardly seems neighborly.

395
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,220
after all, i just gave you
the recipe for my mincemeat pie.

396
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,500
yes, and it's a very good one.
i have the book it came from.

397
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,100
that recipe is not
from a book.

398
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,600
that recipe was handed down
to me from my mother.

399
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,950
well, unless your mother
was betty crocker,

400
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,360
she got it from a book.

401
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,070
oh, dear.
now i've upset you.

402
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,700
no. no, i am not upset.

403
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,740
i'm just confused as to why
you seem so determined

404
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,050
to get off
on the wrong foot.

405
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,640
first you bring a pie
to lynette's,

406
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,300
when i clearly assigned you
the salad--

407
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,850
now, see,
that's where i'm confused.

408
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,330
just what, please, gives you the right to 
decide who brings 

409
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,850
what to a luncheon that i suggested?

410
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,750
well, it's tradition.

411
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,120
i always organize
our little get-togethers,

412
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,130
and i always bring dessert.

413
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,450
well, then
how lovely that i'm back

414
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,650
and can shouer
that burden for you.

415
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,870
just... give me the recipe!

416
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,980
sorry. i can't.

417
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,290
i do hope this doesn't keep us from being friends,
because i like you, bree.

418
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,990
and i'm sure
if you put your mind to it,

419
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,470
you can come up with an even better
lemon meringue pie than mine.

420
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,320
the trick is finding that
perfect blend of sweet and sour.

421
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,680
well, you've certainly
mastered that, dear.

422
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,930
so when do i get to see
my big surprise?

423
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,050
wait for it. wait for it.

424
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,180
ta-da.

425
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,420
whoa. all that syrup
went straight to your boobs.

426
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,090
so it's not my imagination.
they're bigger, right?

427
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,980
- especially the right one.
- mike!

428
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,890
just kidding. pick those up
and bring 'em over here.

429
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,430
well, i'd better warn you.i may have to work
the shoulders.

430
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,450
that thing with juli
and the party this morning...

431
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,750
- mm-hmm?
- thanks for backing me up.it meant a lot,

432
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,480
 and i know
it wasn't easy for you.

433
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,880
uh, yeah, well, you know,
sometimes you gotta hang tough.

434
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,550
mm, well,
you did the right thing.

435
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,930
i drove by that house
tonight.

436
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,630
- that party was out of control.
- what?

437
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,690
yeah, there were kids
staggering around drunk...

438
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,110
puking in the gutter,

439
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,200
and then i saw some girls
running around topless.

440
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,410
i'm sure the cops
will be there any minute.

441
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,800
we need whipped cream.

442
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,240
what?

443
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,240
well, i don't think that
you can have sexy date night without whipped cream.

444
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,310
can't and won't.

445
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,080
well, i...
i can go get some.

446
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,610
no, no, you've, uh,
worked all day.

447
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,490
you stay here.
i'll go to the store.

448
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,750
could you get more syrup?

449
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,920
make a wish.

450
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,450
so i'm dying
to see what i got you.

451
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,330
- how thoughtful was i?
- very.

452
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,640
open it.

453
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,260
"yes!"

454
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,170
not yet.
i haven't asked the question.

455
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,680
will you marry me,
carlos solis?

456
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,670
and you say...

457
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,270
you're proposing?

458
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,020
you said you didn't
want to spend too much.

459
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,750
so what's more affordable
than a promise?

460
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,680
- look, edie--
- i'm doing this for you.

461
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,350
if the i.r.s. gets wind
of your... rainy day fund,

462
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,670
they could make me testify
against you.

463
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,420
but if i were your wife...

464
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,990
how are they going to
find out?

465
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,110
oh, honey, people talk--
angry people,

466
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,730
disappointed people.

467
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,530
come on. say your line.
it's my birthday.

468
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,220
fine.

469
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,010
we're engaged.

470
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,190
oh! carlos!

471
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,530
i think i'm gonna cry.

472
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,590
yeah, me, too.

473
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,580
i mean, how weird is that?

474
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,460
my mom always told me that my dad took off
right after i was born.

475
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,630
so did she explain
what mccluskey said?

476
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,790
i didn't tell her.

477
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,560
she kinda freaks out
anytime i bring him up.

478
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,440
dylan, you have a right
to know about your dad.

479
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,140
- you've got to confront her.
- yeah, right.

480
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,880
i could never do that.
she isn't cool like your mom.

481
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,470
hi. it's my birthday.

482
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,870
oh, that must mean
you're matt.

483
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,280
i'm susan mayer, and i'm--
all righty.

484
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,090
boomer, you magnificent bastard!
you actually did it!

485
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,880
it wasn't me,
but happy birthday, man.

486
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,520
well, it was somebody.
who cares? gather 'round, men.

487
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,490
so you like this music?

488
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,980
ah, it's fine.

489
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,130
would somebody just tell me
where i can find--

490
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,290
hey, enough talking.
just take it off.

491
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,020
we're feeling generous tonight.

492
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,740
oh, my god!

493
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,870
i'm not a stripper.

494
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,000
- you're not?
- is this gonna happen or what?

495
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,720
boomer, she's not a stripper.

496
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,870
well,what's with the implants?

497
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,590
i'm pregnant.

498
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,940
that's hot.

499
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,840
sorry. should've known
you were julie's mom.

500
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,010
you're way too gorgeous
to be a stripper.

501
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,770
if that's your lame attempt to
keep me from calling your parents...

502
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,040
it worked. well played.

503
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,450
excuse me. 

504
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,100
mom,what are you doing here?

505
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,010
i am taking you home.
this party is out of control.

506
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,290
no, it's not.

507
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,310
well, of course
you don't think it is,

508
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,880
because yore knocking back
a big cup of...

509
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,910
orange soda.

510
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,010
i don't believe this.

511
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,770
well, believe it. we're going.
you, too, dylan. come on.

512
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,690
- and what are you wearing?
- it's embarrassing.

513
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,340
yeah, well,
boomer likes it.

514
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,810
call me tomorrow.

515
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,270
we'll go to a movie
my mom can drag us out of.

516
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,330
look, i get
that you're upset.

517
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,260
no, i'm confused.
first, i can go to the party,

518
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,490
then i can't
because mike says no.

519
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,310
then i can, but "don't tell mike
and behave yourself."

520
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
so i behave myself,
and you punish me.

521
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,840
okay, i admit that there's a certain lack
of consistency there.

522
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,580
it's like...ever since
you got married,i can't win.

523
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,370
do you think
this is easy for me?

524
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,390
trying to keep peace between a new husband
and a teenage daughter?

525
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,270
you're always putting me
in the middle.

526
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,060
ugh. i don't do that.

527
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,880
please. every time you and mike
disagree on something,

528
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,320
you give me the look--

529
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,870
that pitiful face that says
if i don't back you up,

530
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,230
i love the other one more.

531
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,680
i don't expect you to side
with me every time.

532
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,800
just make a decision
and stick to it.

533
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,710
and no more lying.

534
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,920
well, you're right.

535
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,020
i'm an adult, and i need to be
honest about these things,

536
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,850
and i will be...
starting tomorrow.

537
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,340
hey.

538
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,380
look who i picked up
coming out of the movies--

539
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:38,400
a p.g. movie. is this
the perfect teenager or what?

540
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,430
oh, the movies, huh?
that's funny.

541
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,400
'cause one of julie's friends just called to
make sure she got home from the party.

542
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,520
she was worried when she saw you
leaving with a stripper.

543
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,700
the jig is up, mom.

544
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,830
no, no, we can salvage this.
just work with me.

545
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,850
i did go to the party.

546
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,350
mom went behind your back
and told me i could.

547
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,030
but i-i didn't drink or do
anything i shouldn't have.

548
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,650
glad to hear it, and, uh,
thanks for your honesty.

549
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,710
you know,this perfect teenager thing
is really starting to chap my ass.

550
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,010
i'm going to bed.

551
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,070
please tell me this isn't
gonna be one of those things

552
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,600
where you leave me and i go
screaming down the street.

553
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,750
why'd you go
behind my back?

554
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,270
i'm sorry.

555
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,940
you gotta understand,
for so long,

556
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,670
it's just been
julie and me,

557
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,160
and i've made
all the decisions alone.

558
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,350
you felt so strongly.

559
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,050
it was just an opinion, really.
she's your daughter.

560
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,970
i completely respect your right
to raise her however you want.

561
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,360
thanks.

562
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,070
now that being said,
this baby is ours.

563
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,790
so we'll get to make all those
parenting decisions together, right?

564
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,230
right.

565
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,610
so can we go back
to date night?

566
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,820
ly if you work
the shoulders.

567
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,120
gaby, where have you been?

568
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,940
you went to the bathroom,
like, half an hour ago.

569
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:23,040
oh, sorry. i stopped off
to get you some magazines.

570
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,780
"top ten new hairstyles."

571
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,530
yeah, well, i'm kinda bald
right now, but thanks.

572
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,610
why n't i go check
if there are some other ones?

573
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,730
no, no, i don't need magazines.i need

574
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,070
you've been bouncing around
since you got here.

575
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,720
so...

576
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,030
how do you like being
the first lady of fairview?

577
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,790
it's good.

578
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,500
are you cold?
they keep it cold in here.

579
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,750
i'm fine.

580
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,940
so tell me something.
when you go to a ribbon cutting,

581
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,720
do you get to keep those
gigantic novelty scissors?

582
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,580
you must be freezing.

583
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,970
you know, i have
the cutest shawl in the car,

584
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,190
so i'm just gonna run out
and get it for you.

585
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,390
boy, you really don't wanna
be here, do ya?

586
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,120
what are you talking about?
i'm trying to help.

587
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,090
yeah, in any way
that gets you out of this room.

588
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,270
i'm sorry. it's just
hospitals are hard for me.

589
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,960
yeah, you told me,
but, jeez, gaby,

590
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,080
don't you care enough
to make an effort?

591
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,470
you think i don't care?

592
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,230
i get it.
you're uncomfortable.

593
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,150
just go. i'm fine.

594
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,110
i'm fine.

595
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,460
did i ever tell you
about my father?

596
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,990
he had cancer, too.

597
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,130
started in the liver,
went into his bones,

598
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,270
and ten months later,
he was dead.

599
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,960
thanks for
that encouraging story.

600
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,910
i'm not finished.

601
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,440
those last weeks,

602
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,530
every day we thought
we were gonna lose him.

603
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,860
and every day, before i
would go into his room,

604
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,990
my mom would say,
"no tears.

605
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,240
"daddy wants to see you
smiling.

606
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,250
if you're gonna cry,
you can't go in."

607
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,920
so... on the last night...

608
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,730
i sat there
and i watched him die.

609
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,720
his eyes were closed,

610
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,160
but i thought
he could still see me.

611
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,700
so i kept smiling...

612
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,520
all night.

613
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,030
i was 5.

614
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,840
oh, my god.

615
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,720
but on the plus side,

616
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,370
i made a pretty good career
out of knowing how to smile

617
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,170
when i didn't really feel
like it.

618
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,400
but i can't pretend with you.

619
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,290
not when i'm scared i'm gonna lose you.

620
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,370
you're not gonna lose me.

621
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,620
you promise?

622
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,010
'cause if i did...

623
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,200
then...

624
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,230
god! i'm such a mess.

625
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,770
it's okay. come here. let it go. oh.

626
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,070
honey?

627
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,630
i'm going to get adam. be right back.

628
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,470
can i talk to you about something?

629
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,460
sure. if you don't mind talking in the car.

630
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,050
bree hodge persisted in her effor

631
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,380
to unlocthe secret

632
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,860
of katherine mayfair's lemon meringue.

633
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,750
but after several failed attempts,

634
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,250
it occurred to bree that while she might not have

635
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,780
the key to katherine's recipe...

636
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,060
she did have the key...

637
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,980
to katherine's house.

638
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,910
oh,hey,what's up? i was doing a little baking,

639
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,060
and i was wondering if i could borrow something.

640
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,080
sure. what do you need-- flour,sugar?

641
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,270
you can't believe what karen mccluskey tells you.

642
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,330
she's an old woman-- 
practically senile.

643
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,220
she didn't sound senile to me.

644
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,180
dylan,maybe this is not the time,okay?

645
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,560
you said my father didn't care about me,

646
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,110
but she says he came here. 
he wanted to see me.

647
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,580
why wod you not tell me that?

648
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,040
he's my father. 
i deserve to know.

649
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,640
the only thing you need to know about that man

650
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,170
is he was a monster.

651
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,880
i can decide that for myself. 
where is he?

652
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,860
i don't know.

653
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,350
you're lying. no,she's not.

654
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,340
yes,she is.

655
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,950
she has been lying to me my whole life.

656
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,840
i'm starting to think maybe you're the monster.

657
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,410
she can't talk to me that way,

658
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,130
not after everything i've done for her.

659
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,500
well,maybe that's the problem.

660
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,340
she doesn't know what you've done for her.

661
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,700
nobody does, and it's gonna stay that way.

662
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,100
are you sure? 
she's just gonna keep asking questions.

663
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,140
then we'd better start coming up with better lies.

664
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,770
oh,there you are.

665
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,100
i was wondering where you'd gone to.

666
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,900
i just let myself into katherine's house

667
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,390
to get that recipe.

668
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,000
well,that seems a bit extreme.

669
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,250
well,at least you know her secret now.

670
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,700
yes,and it has nothing to do with pie.

671
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,350
ahh. here's the thing.

672
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,460
i got a real chance at getting back
together with my ex,

673
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,300
but this woman is standing in my way.

674
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,240
and she knows about the money, 
and she's made it clear

675
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,630
that if i leave, she's gonna blow the whistle.

676
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,130
you gotta understand...

677
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,840
i really did care for edie,

678
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,070
but i can't let her ruin my life.

679
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,600
that's where you come in.

680
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,280
you guys,we better behave,

681
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,880
or the nurses are gonna kick us out.

682
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,760
hey,it's our chemo party, 
and we'll laugh if we want to.

683
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,100
gaby,this was a wonderful idea.

684
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,130
i cannot tell you how much it means to me.

685
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,960
well,don't get sappy on me. 
i won't stand for it.

686
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,450
all right,susan, is the camera ready?

687
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,930
yeah. got it.

688
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,140
okay,once the light starts blinking,

689
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,780
we've got three seconds,

690
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,090
so,everybody,say,"cheese" and holdt.

691
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,300
okay.

692
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,120
one,two,three.

693
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,150
cheese!

694
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:07,030
there is nothing more deceptive than a smile,

695
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,270
and no one knows this better

696
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,340
than the people who hide behind them.

697
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,120
some flash their teeth as a polite
warning to their enemies.

698
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,400
some put on beaming faces to
keep their tears from falling.

699
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,380
others wear silly grins to mask their fear.

700
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,860
but then there is that rare smile

701
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,300
that is actually genuine.

702
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,740
i'll take care of it.
