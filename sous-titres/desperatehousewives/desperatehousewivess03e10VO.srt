<i>Gaby found a new calling...</i>

2
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:09,560
Yes, i'm unbelievable.
Close your mouths.

3
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:11,216
<i>Someone new moved in...</i>

4
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:13,393
(Lette) he's a bachelor who
lives with his invalid sister.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,416
<i>But lynette found
a dark secret...</i>

6
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:17,431
(Lynette) our neighbor
is a pedophile.

7
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:18,719
You can't sit on this,
lynette.

8
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:22,111
<i>Orson's mother
revealed his past...</i>

9
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:24,326
He cheated on alma,
broke her heart

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,294
For his precious monique.
Monique polier?

11
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:30,404
<i>And the police couldn't find
the evidence...
we couldn't find a toolbox.</i>

12
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:31,605
(Man) the man's a plumber.

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,237
<i>Until mike tried to hide it.</i>

14
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,468
I'll take those.

00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,859
<i>(Mary alice)
the annual block party</i>

16
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:45,874
<i>Was a winter tradition
on wisteria lane.</i>

17
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:53,009
<i>It was a way for the residents
to spread holiday cheer.</i>

18
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:56,721
<i>Everyone was invited...</i>

19
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,880
<i>Including art shepard,</i>

20
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:04,047
<i>The newest resident
of wisteria lane.</i>

21
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:07,535
<i>But as the big night
drew near,</i>

22
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,151
<i>More than holiday cheer
was being spread around.</i>

23
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:14,150
Hey, did you hear about
the new guy that just moved in?

24
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:17,053
Unh-Unh.
Well,
get a load of this...

25
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:19,957
Apparently, the perv's
got all this weird stuff

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,260
In his basement.

27
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:22,733
No, seriously.

28
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:25,492
It's like this
big kiddie trap full of toys.

29
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:30,004
<i>By sunday evening,</i>

30
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:32,275
<i>Most of the gossiping
had subsided,</i>

31
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:34,195
<i>And the neighborhood
was once again</i>

32
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:36,955
<i>Consumed by
the spirit of the season.</i>

33
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:39,793
<i>Friends laughed over eggnog,</i>

34

<i>Lovers kissed under mistletoe</i>

35
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:46,080
<i>And the mood was jolly.</i>

36
00:01:48,343 --> 00:01:49,191
<i>That is,</i>

37
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:51,086
<i>Until a certain guest</i>

38
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,903
<i>Made his appearance.</i>

39
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:03,572
(Deep voice) ho, ho, ho!

40
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:07,454
Look who's here!

41
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,076
Merry christmas, everybody!

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,546
Merry christmas!

43
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:21,022
Now, kids,
who's been good this year?

44

<i>(Chuckles) oh, come on,

46
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,121
Joey, get back here.

47
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,702
What's going on?

48
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,718
(Normal voice)
i'm not sure.

49
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,005
(Woman) let's go, girls.

50
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,756
Art, maybe we should go.

51
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:03,123
<i>Yes, for the residents

52
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:06,042

53
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,898
<i>But for arthur shepard

<i>The holiday season

<i>Once the decorations
came out.</i>

60
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:38,595
<i>For some, that meant
pulling out the colored lights.</i>

61
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,425
<i>For others, it meant
locating that holiday wreath.</i>

62
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,186
<i>And then there were those</i>

63
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:50,473
<i>Eager to display
their nativity scene.</i>

00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,794
<i>It was all about
the mistletoe.</i>

66
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:57,913
Oh!

67
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,887
You have to kiss me.
It's the law.

68
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,287
(Chuckles)
mmm.

69
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:04,978
While you're in
a good mood,

70
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,943
I thought
i'd spring something on you.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,041
My parents
are coming to town.
Your parents? Really?

72
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,239
And i wondered
if you might be free

73
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:12,886
To join us
for dinner saturday.

74
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:19,380
Absolutely. Uh, so i assume
this means they know about me?
But of course.

75
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:20,795
And they know
about me as in...

76
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,036
(British accent)
"mum, dad, bloody good ns.

77
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:25,786
I've got melf
a smashing new girlfriend."
(Laughs) that's adorable.

78
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:28,601
Please don't do it
in front of them.
(Normal voice) right.

79
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,905
So, um, do you want me

80
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:34,624
<i>To make reservations
at that little french place?
We--We could do that,</i>

81
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,520
But it's a--
It's a 4-Hour layover

82
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,431
And they're
going to be exhausted,

83
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,432
And i thought we might have
a more enjoyable time

84
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,759
If they came here and--And you
made dinner for them.

85
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:47,822
Okay, i guess it's time
we have the conversation.

86
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:51,310
Ian...

87
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:55,224
Haven't you ever wondered
why i've never cooked for you?

88
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,516
?????

89
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,859
No, i wish.

90
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,794
My cooking...
is not good.

91
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,797
Well, my parents won't
be expecting a gourmet meal.

92
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,719
Will they be expecting
stomach cramps,

93
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,997
Acid reflux, night sweats?

94
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,910
(Laughs) come on,
you can't be that bad.

95
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:20,745
<i>Oh. Oh,
it is really important</i>

96
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,711
That i make them
a home-Cooked meal?

97
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:24,307
Well, it's just that

98
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:26,603
They're very old-Fashioned
hearth-And-Home types,

99
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,284
And they might wonder why--
Why you didn't make the effort.

100
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:33,212
Oh, but it's okay. You--You--
You'll win them over...

101
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,058
Eventually.

102
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:40,129
Okay, i'll give it a shot.
(Laughs)

103
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,081
Thank you.

104
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:44,671
Now nothing elaborate.

105
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:46,288
Just a simple roast
and, uh,

106
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:49,070
And something appropriate
to go with it.
Right...

107
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,792
Like an ambulance.

Little miss snowflake glides.
She doesn't stomp.

111
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,542
Is that better?

112
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,053
Getting there, sweetie.

113
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:09,846
(Under breath)
if she was a horse,

114
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,162
We'd have to shoot her.

115
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:15,107
(Under breath) poor thing,
she tries so hard.

116
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:18,667
(Normal voice) yeah, she's
a trooper. Let's dump her.
(Normal voice) what?! Why?

117
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,722
Pageant consultants are judged
on the strength of their roster.

118
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:22,945
You know,
we can't afford to bounce

119
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,418
Every nose-Picking
no-Talent,

120
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:25,466
But we can definitely lose
the one

121
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,058
Who's dragging us down,
and that's amy.

122
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:30,666
(Under breath) we can't do that!
Her mother died last year.
Yes, i know, i know,

123
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:32,968
And it's tragic,
but we are running a business.

124
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,720
Amy is sucking up
all of our time,

125
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,376
And we should be
focusing on sherri.

126
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,928
She actually has
a shot at winning.

127
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,567
How will i tell her family?
We'll do it together.
We'll be very diplomatic.

128
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,592
Are you sure about this?

129
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:48,638
The poor kid's been through
the wringer and--
Amy! For god sakes,

130
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:51,086
Little miss snowflake
does not scratch down there!

131
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,501
(Sighs)
well, then again,
her mother died a year ago.

132
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,651
How long
is she gonna milk it?

133
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:01,288
Ahh... mother hodge,
i have your breakfast.

134
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,624
Just put it over there.
I'll pick through it later.

135
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:04,672

Home movies.

139
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:13,518
Aw. It's fun looking back
at the past, isn't it?

140
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:18,278
Well, it's one way to kill time
while you're waiting for death.

141
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:21,165
We also have cable.

142
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:25,156
Have you decided what
you're gonna do about orson?

143
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,483
Decided?
Yes. Have you
called a lawyer yet?

144
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,723
I don't think
that's any of your concern.

145
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,043
I don't mean to pry,

146
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:35,115
But i think
you're a good christian woman,

147
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,547
And you deserve better
than my son.

148
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,202
Well, i will take that
under advisement.

149
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:42,769
If you give him a chance,
he'll draw you back in.

150
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,184
It's whahe does.
Just walk away.

151
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,369
It's not that easy.
I love him.

152
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:55,183
You'll get over it. I did.

Well, believe merita,

You know what?

162
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,951
We should have a meeting,
get all the moms together

163
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:21,134
And figure out
what to do about this guy.

164

Yeah, saturday, your house.
Sounds good.

Hey, rita, i gotta go.

168
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:39,253
Sorry, i can't talk now.
I have somewhere to go.

169
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:43,556
Well, my brother doesn't.
The youth center just fired him.

170
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,098
Are you happy?

171
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,161
I'm not sad.
He shouldn't be around kids.

172
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,553
I saw those pictures.

173
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:52,330
Those boys
were on his swim team.

174
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:53,705
He was proud of them.

175
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:56,017
Turning that
into something dirty

176
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,681
Says more about you
than him.

177
00:08:57,873 --> 00:09:00,640
You can defend him all you want.
I know what i know.

178
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:03,704
Ar engine starts)

179
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:07,559
Did you know
my brother got spit on

180
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,543
Athe hardware store
yesterday,

181
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,302
That they refused
to serve us at the diner,

182
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:17,724
That our tire got slashed
at the church parking lot?

183
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:18,293
(Exhales deeply)

184
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:24,804
I am not a well woman.
I don't need this stress.

185
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:30,651
Well...
i am sorry that happened.

186
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,369
Have you considered
even for a moment

187
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:34,937
That you could be wrong,

188
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,790
That you misinterpreted
what you saw,

189
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,911
<i>That you are ruining
my brother's life and mine</i>

190
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,534
Over nothing?

191
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:46,701
I have kids, okay?

192
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,942
Better safe than sorry.

193
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,355
So i'm cooking dinner

194
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:08,836
For ian's parents
tomorrow night,

195
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:10,203
And it's the first time
i'm meeting them,

196
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:14,467
So i sort of
wanna impress them.
And yet you're cooking?!

197
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:15,849
Well, that's the thing.

198
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:19,546
Uh, so i was hoping--You know,
if you're not too busy...

199
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,505
Oh, no, no, these things
practically build themselves.

200
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,184
Thank you.
You are a lifesaver.

201
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:26,188
Actually...

202
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:29,360
I could probably use
the distraction.

203
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,302
Oh?

204
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:36,071
(Sighs) i asked orson
to move out last night.

205
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,141
Oh, come on! Why would you
bury your toolbox in the woods?

206
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:45,037
I knew the cops were
looking for it, and i panicked.

207
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,710
I was just trying
to buy myself me time.

208
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:50,125
Well, you may have
bought yourself 20 to life!
Oh, let the guy
enjoy his breakfast.

209
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,413
Stay out of this, carlos.

210
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:54,044
Mike, i want you
to look at me.

211
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,619
Yeah, you look me in the eye
and you swear to me

212
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,194
That you
didn't kill anybody.

213
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:01,235
How many times do i have
to tell you? I can't remember.

214
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:03,443
<i>You can't remember,
or you don't wanna remember?</i>

215
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,149
Um, guys.

216
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,153
Bree, you have got to go
to the police with all of this.

217
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:23,249
I can't. Not yet.
I-I need some time to think.

218
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,888
His wife goes missing,
then his mistress turns up dead.

219
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,294
What is there
to think about?

220
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:27,935
(Bree sighs)

221
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:33,559
I know it sounds suspicious,
but in my heart of hearts,

222
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:36,070
I just can't believe that
orson could do such a thing.

223
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,557
Sweetie,
we all wanna believe

224
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,181
The best of the people
we care about,

225
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:41,270
But you cannot
let your feelings for a man

226
00:11:41,294 --> 00:11:43,093
Blind you
to cold hard facts.

227
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,980
What in the world?

228
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:52,882
Oh, my god!

229
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:57,755
What's going on?

230
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:59,779
They just arrested mike
for murder.

231
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:01,234
What?!

232
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,258
They're saying he killed
that woman othe news,

233
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,585
That monique person.

234
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,088
Oh, thank god!

235
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:14,647
I can't believe we're gonna
break that little girl's heart.
Do not
wimp out on me here.

236
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:16,088
We gotta do
what's best for the business.

237
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:18,696
What if the father
yells at me?
Then i will jump in
and defend you.

238
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,959
Okay, but if you do,
try and be diplomatic.

239
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,199
I'm always diplomatic.

240
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,495
Now just get in there,
you spineless 'mo.

241
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:27,926
Excuse me, mr. Pearce?

242
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,677
I'm so glad
you could come today.

243
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,221
This is
my partner gabrielle.

244
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:36,876
Pleasure to meet you.

245
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,524
(Laughs)

246
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:39,492
(Vern) shall we?

247
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:44,715
So, uh, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

248
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:45,835
Is there a problem
with amy?

249
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,587
Not a problem, per se.

250
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,041
We're just
a little concerned

251
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,457
That she might not
have the, um...

252
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:54,847
Temperament
for pageant competitions.
And what does that mean?

253
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,961
Well, when it comes
to performing,

254
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,768
She's not exactly...

255
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,533
Well, she tends to be--
Feel free to jump in.

256
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:07,033
I have no idea
where you're going with this.

257
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,943
Well,
as gaby and i discussed,

258
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:15,454
Amy has certain limitations

259
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:16,863
And her odds of winning
are slim.

260
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:17,951
Vern!

261
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,046
(Scoffs)
he is so competitive.

262
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,557
I constantly have to remind him
they're just kids. (Chuckles)

263
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,757
When did you lose the joy?
Oh, i think you know.

264
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,261
Wait, i'm--I'm confused.
Are you--Are you dumping amy?

265
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:31,922
Of course not, bill.

266
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,649
Can i call you bill?

267
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,150
(Chuckles) it's just,

268
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:38,416
We feel that amy would benefit
from some private coaching.

269
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,070
Maybe i could
come to your house?

270
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:41,735
Say, friday, 5:00?

271
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,095
Sure.
(Laughs) yeah, i guess.

272
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,000
Great! It's a date.
(Laughs)

273
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,038
Maybe i should come, too.

274
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,870
After the harsh things
you said about amy?

275
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,126
I don't think so. (Laughs)

276
00:13:58,736 --> 00:13:59,876
I'm gonna need
a good lawyer

277
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,001
And that may take
a lile research.
Uh-Huh.

278
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,895
And whoever takes my case
will need a retainer,

279
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,409
So if you don't mind,
i promise i'll pay you back.

280
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:11,997
Oh, okay.
And makeure
he knows about my wrench.

281
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:16,160
Apparently, they tested it ??????

282
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:19,661
What's wrong?

283
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,124
I don't know if you
picked up on this, mike,

284
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,860
But...
i haven't been happy.

285
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,107
No, i didn't
pick up on it.

286
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,776
Well, i wanted
to tell you this weeks ago

287
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,598
And i wish that i had,
because now i know

288
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,173
You're gonna think that
i'm breaking up with you

289
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,052
Over this whole
blood on the ax thing.
Wrench.

290
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,645
Whatever. But believe me,
that's not it.

291
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,891
It's jus..

292
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,571
We are moving too fast.

293
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,539
What are you trying to say?

294
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,178
Well, may--Maybe
we should just... take a break.

295
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,833
You know...
date other people.

296
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,334
You're telling me this

297
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,525
On the day
i'm put in a men's prison?

298
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,189
Well,
i said the timing was bad.

299
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:12,887
I am sorry.
I... i really am.

300
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:16,019
(Whispers)
i just can't do this.

301
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,826
They told me
somebody was coming,

302
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,905
But i did not expect it
to be you.

303
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,769
Is edie
getting you a good lawyer?

304
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,721
(Chuckles) i doubt it.
She dumped me today.

305
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,712
What? Why?

306
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,895
<i>Well,
i was arrested for murder.</i>

307
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:47,528
Still...

308
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,743
It's tacky.

309
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,152
(Chuckles)

310
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,102
Well, okay then, uh...

311
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,604
I-I'll help get you out.

312
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:59,580
Uh... what's your bail?

313
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,513
A million dollars.

314
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,215
Oh. (Laughs)

315
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:09,536
You don't
have to help me, susan.

316
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,144
I want to.

317
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,831
Aren't you gonna ask?

318
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,752
What?

319
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,238
If i killed that woman?

320
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:28,781
I don't have to.
I know you didn't.

321
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,949
I wish i was that sure.

322
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:42,715
I... i have these flashes
where i see her face,

323
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:43,963
So i must've known her.

324
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,012
And if i did,
maybe something happened.

325
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:47,610
Maybe i got angry, maybe--

326
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,426
There's an explanation f this,
and we're gonna figure it out.

327
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:54,137
N't worry about a thing.

328
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:05,632
Miss gabrielle!

329
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,671
When are you gonna
come outside and watch me?

330
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,840
Oh, um, the grass, honey,
and my allergies...

331
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,350
Go ahead and practice.
I'll watch you from here.

332
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:17,926
Are you sure
i can't help with anything?

333
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:20,162
Ah, i've been a single dad
for a while now.

334
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,472
I got
the nner thing down.
Mmm, i've got
the restaurant thing down.

335
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,809
I can't bring myself
to cook for one.

336
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,104
Not that i ever
cooked for two. (Chuckles)

337
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:33,576
Well, no restaurant tonight.
You are having dinner with us.

338
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,288
Oh, that's sweet.

339
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:37,833
It's the least i can do
to thank you for helping amy.

340
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,824
Oh. It's nothing.

341
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:47,765
Yeah,
she's a special girl.

342
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:50,876
So...

343
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,284
How is it for you,
being single again?

344
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:58,276
Oh, honestly? Um...
mm-Hmm.

345
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,162
I hate it. It's like
i've forgotten how to date.

346
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,798
Me, too. You know,
i even let a friend of mine

347
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:06,652
Talk me into one of
those speed dating things.
How was it?

348
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:08,514
Mmm, i didn't even go in.

349
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,226
I just sat
in this hotel lobby.

350
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,970
I watched all these

351
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:13,610
Lonely, desperate
single people filing in,

352
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,106
And then it hit me--
I'm one of them.

353
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:18,633
I know what you mean.

354
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,144
Did you see that?

355
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,160
It spun three times
and then i caught it.

356
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,687
Um...

357
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:27,913
You didn't see.

358
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:30,991
Yeah, i-I'm sorry, sweetie.
I-I was distracting gabrielle.

359
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,927
Oh, no, no,
it's totally my fault.

360
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:35,613
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Go outside and do it again.

361
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:37,303
I promise this time
we're gonna watch.

362
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,535
(Knock on door)

363
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:55,715
Come in.

364
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:56,346
(Door closes)

365
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,323
Hey. Wow, oh,
those are gorgeous.

366
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:02,340
Well, i, uh, i figured
you'd be too busy cooking

367
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:03,658
To manage a centerpiece.

368
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,378
Well, you, uh,
you may not be a good cook

369
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,313
But you're--
You're certainly a tidy one.

370
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:12,537
Don't worry.
Dinner's all taken care of.

371
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,705
We're having...

372
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:16,804
<i>Blanquette de veau
and a grand marnier soufflé.</i>

373
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,518
Well, that's
very ambitious of you,

374
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,061
And, uh, when will bree
be done making it?

375
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,117
5:30. (Chuckles)

376
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,580
But i am rewarming it
all by myself.

377
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,352
Oh, what's, uh,
what's all this?

378
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,018
Um, mike was
arrest for murder.

379
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,500
My god.
I-I mean, of course
he's totally innocent.

380
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:37,395
I'm just trying
to help him find a lawyer.

381
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,739
Oh. Shouldn't, um, shouldn't
his girlfriend be doing that?

382
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:43,241
Yeah. Edie dumped him.

383
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:44,657
Hmm.

384
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:51,610
Okay, i know how this looks,
but i just feel bad.

385
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,239
He's just a friend now.

386
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,817
(Sighs) yes. Yes, a friend
you sat by for six months,

387
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,079
Hoping he'd wake up
and ravish you again.

388
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:04,143
<i>You are the only one
allowed to ravish me these days,</i>

389
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,382
So stop worrying.

390
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,988
(Lowered voice) orson,
it's me again. Please call.

391
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,612
We need to talk.

392
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:16,972
(Sighs)

393
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:20,855
I'll do the chips.
You deal.

394
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,188
You got it.

395
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:27,467
Guys, why has it been so long
since we've played poker?

396
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:28,585
I really need this.

397
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,808
Oh, me, too.
There's nothing more relaxing

398
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:33,455
Than an afternoon
of finger food and girl talk.

399
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:36,553
Hi, ladies!
(Lynette)
hey! How you doing?

400
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:38,784
(Sighs) so did you
tell the police

401
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,631
That you think
orson killed monique?

402
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:41,711
What?!

403
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,191
No, i did not,
and i don't plan to.
But mike is in jail,

404
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:48,461
And you said yourself
you thought orson did it.

405
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:49,599
I said i had concerns,

406
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:53,437
Concerns that have disappeared
now that mike has been arrested.

407
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:55,613
What are you saying?
You think mike is guilty?

408
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,389
Hey, why don't we start
that girl talk?

409
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:00,333
I'll get the ball rolling.
Anybody have a yeastnfection?

410
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,316
They found monique's blood
on the wrench

411
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,268
That mike
was trying to dispose of.

412
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:09,306
<i>I mean, that hardly screams
innocence.
Her teeth were pulled.</i>

413
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:11,066
You don't think
that's worth telling the cops

414
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:13,169
<i>She was messing around
with a dentist?</i>

415
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:15,322
Orson was slipping it
to the dead chick?

416
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,145
Mike is innocent.
I know that in my heart.

417
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:19,657
We all have
convictions, susan.

418
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:22,057
I believe mike's last one
was for manslaughter.

419
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,872
Okay, okay, we've all made
some excellent points

420
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:26,664
And blown off
a little steam.

421
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,816
Whoo!
Let's play some cards.

422
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,430
If you're so sure
that orson is innocent,

423
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:35,998
Why don't we go through
his things? Where's his desk?
At his office.

424
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:38,630
And what did you think
you'd find there anyway?
I don't know.

425
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:41,558
A blackmail letter,
a necklace made of teeth?

426
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:44,213
We're not gonna play cards,
are we?
Nope.

427
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:46,076
Well, i am certainly not
playing with a woman

428
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:49,508
That is willing to let mike take
the fall for her psycho husband.
Well, needless to say,

429
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:53,827
I won't be cooking dinner
for ian's parents.
Fine. I'll cook myself.

430
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:56,659
Good. Let me know
if there are any survivors.

431
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,433
And if you take orson back,
you do the same.

432
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:00,378
(Exhales deeply)

433
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,800
(Bree) well, that was
incredibly awkward.

434
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry you both
had to sit through it.

435
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Was it me?
Was i out of line?

436
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,100
Hey, come on in.
You're just in time.

437
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,300
Thanks so much, rita.

438
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,400
I think
it's such a good idea

439
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,000
That we all get together
and talk and...

440
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>Wow. Wow.
What is all this?</i>

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,500
Oh, we decided
to stage a protest

442
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,900
In front of art's house.

443
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,300
A protest?
Mm-Hmm.

444
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,700
Rita, i want the word
"pedophile" to really stand out.

445
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,100
Do we have any glitter?

446
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Say "molester."
It sounds scarier.

447
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,400
I'm sorry.

448
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,300
I-I-I thought we were
all gonna talk about

449
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,500
How to keep an eye
on this guy.

450
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
We're past talking.
The guy's a menace.

451
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,800
Well, that's what we think,
but we don't exactly have proof.

452
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,200
The youth center just fired him.
How much proof to you need?

453
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,600
But, see,
the only reason they fired him

454
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
Is because
people were gossiping,

455
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,200
And the only reason
they're gossipg

456
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,700
Is because
of what i told mrs. Mccluskey.

457
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,300
Yeah, and you told me
to spread the word.

458
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,600
So--So that people could watch
their kids and be vigilant.

459
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,500
So you wanna wait

460
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,600
Until he actually molests
one of our kids?

461
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,200
Whose side are you on,
lynette?
Knock it off, gert.

462
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,600
Remember,
if it weren't for lynette,

463
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,200
We never would've found out
about this cre.

464
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,000
She's our hero.

465
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,900
(Door opens)

466
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
(Door closes)

467
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,900
(Susan sighs)

468
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
<i>(Man) ...the 22-Yard line,
the give is to harrison,</i>

469
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,200
<i>Who is hit immediately
and dropped for a loss</i>

470
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,100
<i>In his own backfield...</i>

471
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,400
(Amy) bye-Bye, daddy.

472
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
(Bill) see you, sweetie.
Have fun. Mwah.

473
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,400
So i was, uh,
i was thinking you--

474
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,400
You wanna grab a cup of coffee
or something after class?

475
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,900
I'd love to grab
a cup of coffee...

476
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,300
Or something. (Laughs)

477
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,300
(Sighs) amy, you are so lucky
to have such a nice dad.

478
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah, i know.

479
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,800
Leave him alone.

480
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,700
Excuse me?

481
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,800
You heard me.
I don't want you dating him.

482
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,600
Oh, sweetheart.

483
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,200
I have a feeling
i know what this is about.

484
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,100
No u don"t

485
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,600
I think you do

486
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,000
Miss your mommy,
and it feels funny

487
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,800
Seeing your daddy
be nice to somebody else.

488
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,100
But believe me, i'm not trying
to replace your mom.

489
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,700
Well, i am,

490
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,300
And i have someone
all picked out.

491
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,400
What?

492
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,600
I want my dad
to marry sherri's mom.

493
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,600
Sherri from class?

494
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,700
We're best friends,
and we have it all planned out.

495
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,300
Our parents
are gonna get married,

496
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,300
And then
we'll be real sisters.
What about your dad?

497
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,700
???

498
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,100
My mom died.

499
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,000
All my dad wants
is for me to be happy.

500
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,000
Now get in there and teach me
how to work the runway.

501
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,900
That's what
we're paying you for, right?

502
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
<i>(Man) ...runs it left,
swings it around.</i>

503
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,300
<i>He fights his way to the 25
for another first down,</i>

504
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,800
<i>And that should
just about do it.</i>

505
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
<i>I tell you, with 1:12
left on the clock</i>

506
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,900
<i>And no time-Outs remaining...</i>

507
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,300
(Turns off television)

508
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
(Orson sighs)

509
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,900
(Bree) orson?

510
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,300
(Orson) bree?

511
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Orson. Why haven't you
returned any of my calls?

512
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,700
I was afraid you were calling
to ask me for a divorce.

513
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
(Sighs) no, i wasn't.

514
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
They arrested mike

515
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,000
For the murder
of monique polier.

516
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,700
They did?
The other night,

517
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
You wanted a chance
to explain everything.

518
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Well, here it is,
and i want it all.

519
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,500
If i find out
you've left anything out,

520
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,700
Then i will ask
for that divorce.

521
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay.

522
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,000
(Sighs)

523
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
<i>You're working
so hard, sherri.</i>

524
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
You must really wanna
win this pageant.

525
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,900
More than anything.

526
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,600
Aw. Well, i think dedication
should be rewarded,

527
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,600
So i have
a little surprise for you.

528
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,400
What is it?

529
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,500
Well, you know how the pageant starts with
a big opening number?

530
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,300
This year, all the contestants
are gonna dance in pairs,

531
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,200
And i've arranged

532
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,400
For yoto dance with
your best friend amy!

533
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,500
What's wrong, sweetie?

534
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
Well...

535
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,700
Amy sucks.

536
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,700
Well, i thought you two
were practically sisters?

537
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,800
We are...
but she still sucks.

538
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,400
And first impressions
are everything.

539
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
You said so yourself.

540
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,300
Well, that's true--
And this is
the opening number.

541
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,400
If the judges see me
tripping all over that klutz,

542
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
There's no way
i'm gonna win.

543
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,400
That's a good point.
Now i wish i hadn't told amy.

544
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,600
You already told her?!

545
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,100
She was so excited.

546
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,700
(Sighs)

547
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,400
Well,
she's your best friend.

548
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,000
Why don't you just tell her
the truth? She'll understand.

549
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,600
What if she doesn't?

550
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Well, friends come and go...

551
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,500
But a crown is forever.

552
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,600
I never loved alma.

553
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,000
My mother
pushed us together,

554
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,300
And... i was stupid enough
to get her pregnant.

555
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,600
You had a child?

556
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,000
Alma miscarried
a month after the wedding.

557
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,500
I was trapped.

558
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,300
Well,
you could've left her.

559
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
Mother wouldn't hear of it.

560
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,700
Divorce is a sin.

561
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,900
So i stayedin the marriage,

562
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,800
Hoping i would come to feel
what i was supposed to,

563
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,100
But i never did.

564
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,400
So i resigned myself
to a life without love.

565
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,300
And then i met monique.

566
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,600
It was wrong. I didn't care.

567
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,000
I loved her more than
i'd loved anyone...

568
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
Till you.

569
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,000
So why couldn't you
tell me this?

570
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,600
Because you told me
about rex,

571
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
How he cheated on you,
how hurt you were.

572
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,100
Bree, i needed you
to feel safe with me.

573
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,600
(Bree) well, you haven't done
a very good job.

574
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,700
Handling the truth would have
been a hundred times easier

575
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,000
Than dealing with
all the doubt and suspicion.

576
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,300
(Orson speaking indistinctly)

577
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,300
So you stayed in a loveless
marriage because of your mother?

578
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,100
I know how it sounds.

579
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,800
But after my father died,
she s all i had.

580
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
His death caused me
so much pain.

581
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,900
(Orson speaking indistinctly)

582
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,900
I would've
done anything for her.

583
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,200
(Bree speaks indistinctly)

584
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,400
(Orson speaks indistinctly)

585
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,800
She saw that weakness,
and she ran with it.

586
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,200
(Orson speaking indistinctly)

587
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,400
You--You've got no idea
how manipulative she can be.

588
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,900
She ruins lives.

589
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,100
Now i've told you
everything.

590
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,000
What happens now?

591
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,200
Well...

592
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,000
First you pack up your things
and come home,

593
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,400
And then...

594
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,500
We toss your mother out
on her evil ass.

595
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,800
God, i love you.

596
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,700
Hi!
I'm sorry i'm late.

597
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,000
Where are your folks?

598
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,900
They're not coming.

599
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
Their plane was snowed in
at o'hare.

600
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,800
Oh. Well, that's too bad.
Well, no harm done then, huh?

601
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,200
You're 40 minutes late.

602
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,200
But they're not here.
You didn't know that.
And where's dinner?

603
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,700
Uh... bree and i
sort of had a fight.

604
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,000
Um... look, i'm awfuy sorry
that i'm late.

605
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,500
I-I had an emergency.

606
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,700
Did this emergency
have anything to do with mike?

607
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
I'm pretty sure
that bree's husband

608
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,500
Murdered the woman
the cops think mike killed.

609
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,700
I went to his office--

610
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,500
Oh, for god sakes, susan.

611
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,600
No, no,
i found evidence. Look.

612
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,100
Orson was committed
to a mental institution

613
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,600
For over a year.

614
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,700
I mean, doesn't that suggest
he's some sort of--
I don't care!

615
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,000
Tonight meant a great deal
to me, and you blew it off.

616
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,000
I said i was sorryian.

617
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,300
I have to help mike.
I'm all he's got.

618
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Actually, you're wrong.
He's got me.

619
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,500
What?

620
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,300
Tomorrow, i'll hire the best
lawyer in town to defend him,

621
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,800
And i'll pay
every cent of his bill.

622
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,800
You would do that for mike?

623
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Yes, on one condition...

624
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,900
You can't see him anymore.

625
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,200
Why?

626
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
If you start visiting him,
being a friend to him,

627
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
He'll fall in love
with you again.

628
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,300
Then you'll have to decide whose
heart to break, his or mine.

629
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,000
As jealous ultimatums go,
that's very flattering,

630
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But i don't think
that's necessary.

631
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,100
Mike and i are done.

632
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,500
Then you should have no problem
accepting my generous offer.

633
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,900
You would really get him
the best lawyer in town?

634
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
An absolute piranha.

635
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,700
Do we have a deal?

636
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,600
Well, okay then.

637
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
You know,
mike barely remembers me.

638
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,100
What makes you so sure

639
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,800
He would fall in love
with me again?

640
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,500
What a perfectly asinine
question.

641
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,800
How could he not?

642
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,100
(All shouting at once)

643
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,200
(Shouting continues)

644
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,300
God, i was only
in the house 15 minutes.

645
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,700
Are there more of them now?

646
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Yep.

647
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
(Shouting continues)

648
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,100
Go ahead, say it.
I know you want to.

649
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,300
This is all your fault.
You should've listened to me.

650
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,000
I know, but be fair.

651
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,100
There is no way
i could've anticipated this.

652
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,600
You tell people
frankenstein's on the loose,

653
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,600
<i>Then you're surprised to see
the torch-Wielding villagers?</i>

654
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,300
I'm putting the kids
to bed early.

655
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,800
I don't want 'em
to see this.

656
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,200
(Siren wailing)
is that an ambulance?

657
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,200
(Amy) i can't believe
you're doing this!

658
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,600
???

659
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,400
God, i hate you!
I hate you!

660
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,200
Don't ever talk to me again!

661
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,300
Hi. Bill?

662
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,500
I was wondering, do you
have plans saturday night?

663
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,800
(Crowd speaking indistinctly)

664
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,700
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

665
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,000
What--Excuse me, can you--
Can you tell me what happened?

666
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,300
Ma'am, i need you
to step back.
Okay.

667
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
We're brinng in
a female, late 30s.

668
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,800
And get crash ca ready.
She's in cardiac arrest.

669
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,900
There he is.
There he is.

670
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,800
(Crowd speaking indistinctly)

671
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,700
(All shouting at once)

672
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,200
Stop it! Stop it!
You can't do this to people!

673
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,100
Have you lost your minds?!

674
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,700
Well, excuse us for wanting
to feel safe in our own homes.

675
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,500
Well, that's my home,

676
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,800
And i don't feel
very safe right now.

677
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,700
Please, please, all of you,
just leave this street.

678
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,500
Please, i beg of you. Go!
Just get off my street, please!

679
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,000
Wait, wait!
Art, wait, i'm sor--

680
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,500
(Shouting continues)

681
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm sorry.

682
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,600
You're an idiot
to take him back.

683
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,600
I am no longer interested
in your opinion.

684
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,200
I thought
i made that clear.

685
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,700
Where are you sending me?

686
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,100
Oh, we've rented you
a condo

687
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,400
In a lovely
retirement community.

688
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,100
It's our christmas gift
to you.
So you're exiling me?

689
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,800
Cutting me off
from my new grandcldren?

690
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,300
That's our gift to them.

691
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,300
<i>You think you can
be rid of me that easily?</i>

692
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,800
It's over, mother.
I told her everything.

693
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,600
Oh, i doubt that very much.
You still have secrets, my boy.

694
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,900
So do you, mother,

695
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,000
And if you want them kept,
you'll keep mine.

696
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,200
It's me. I have some bad news.
She's taking him back.

697
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Meet me on the corner
in an hour.

698
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,700
We need to deal with this.

699
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,200
I heard about rebecca
on the news.

700
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,600
If there's anything
i can do to help,

701
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,400
I...

702
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,200
Uh, with
the funeral arrangements

703
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,900
Or, uh...

704
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,300
Help you call relatives...

705
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Wow.

706
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,600
You must be feeling
really guilty.

707
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,300
Oh! Of course!

708
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,800
I-I-I feel just terrible.

709
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,100
I-I mean, if you knew,
if you could just know

710
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,800
I'm--How sorry i am.

711
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Hey.

712
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,300
You know, in a weird way...

713
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,500
I should thank you.

714
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,200
My sister was...

715
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,000
A really wonderful person.

716
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,400
She always saw
the best in me.

717
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,300
But there were things
she couldn't see...

718
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,100
Or chose not to,
god love her.

719
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,200
What do you mean?

720
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,300
I think you know.

721
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,300
See, i always knew

722
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,800
That i had
to take care of rebecca,

723
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,500
So i could never
let myself...

724
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,200
Slip and do something
that would hurt her.

725
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,500
But now...

726
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,900
(Exhales deeply)

727
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,100
I'm free...

728
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,500
(Whispers)
and all because of you.

729
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
You--You can't stay here.

730
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,600
Oh, don't worry.
I'm already packed.

731
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,600
Where are you going?

732
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,400
Why, you gonna write?

733
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,000
Well...

734
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
(Sniffles)

735
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,200
Good-Bye, lynette.

736
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,100
<i>You take care of that
beautiful family of yours.</i>

737
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,600
<i>There's a reason people
can't wait for christmas,</i>

738
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,600
<i>And it has little to do
with fily reunions...</i>

739
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,300
<i>Or curling u

741
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,700
<i>Or receiving a present
