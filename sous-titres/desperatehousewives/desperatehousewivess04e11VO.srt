Previously on...desperate housewives

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,810
Bree moved in...

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,250
You can stay as long as you want. Mike went to Rehab...

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,110
Mike went to Rehab...I will fix this

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,880
Carlos faced a permanent illness...

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,920
She's not gonna leave you because you lost your sight.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,250
you don't know Gaby.

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,730
Dylan had questions about her father...

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,060
The only thing you need to know about that man is he was a monster.

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,630
why would you not tell me that?

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,780
And Adam uncovered a secret...

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,020
You told me it was all his fault.

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,850
Now I find out it was yours.

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,780
That one person wished he hadn't.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,950
Katherine Mayfair was not the kind of woman who liked to relive the past.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,980
But when her husband Adam left her,

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,370
Katherine's life began to unravel,

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,340
And the mistakes of her youth

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,650
started to flash through her mind.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,300
She thought of Wayne Davis,the first man she married...

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,990
And the first time he had hit her.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,380
She thought of how sincerely he apologized...

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,290
And how meaningless his apologies were...

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,970
And how she finally decided...

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,840
To hit back.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,060
These were the thoughts going through katherine's mind...

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,160
When her friends and neighbors arrived...

28
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,500
Bearing gifts.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,940
Well,hello there.

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,600
What's all this?

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,780
We brought you muffins.

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,610
And jam.

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,470
Okay,uh,what's the occasion?

34
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,690
Well,we heard you were having a rough time.

35
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,300
So we just wanted you to know that we're here for you.

36
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,540
Ah,so word is out that Adam's left me,

37
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,210
And you thought that muffins and jam

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,780
Would help me pick up the pieces.

39
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,150
The jam was Bree's idea.

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,310
- Susan!  - I wanted to bring flowers,and I was shot down.

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,300
That's all I'm saying.

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,190
Katherine,we didn't come here to upset you.

43
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,120
No,we thought that you just might need someone to talk to.

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,240
No,you just thought you'd get the juicy details.

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,500
No,we came here.

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,780
We wanted to help you,to fix you lunch or clean your house.

47
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,830
Or offer up our own houses for you to clean,

48
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,880
If that's your thing.

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,380
I'm fine,truly,

50
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,800
And I do appreciate your concern,

51
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,870
But... you know...

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,430
Okay.

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,490
I told them you weren't into jam.

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,240
Susan!

55
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,830
Look,I don't mean to pry,

56
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,740
But given what I know about you and Adam,

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,260
I'm surprised he was the one to do the leaving.

58
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,230
Well,Bree,the truth is...

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,030
I really don't want to talk about it.

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,330
I understand,but whatever you do,

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,120
Don't keep your feelings bottled up.

62
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,100
You've got to let 'em out.

63
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,990
I'll do that.

64
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,330
Yes,

65
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,470
katherine Mayfair,was not a woman who liked to relive the past.

66
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,370
But lately,her life had begun to unravel.

67
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,210
And she couldn't help thinking of all the mistakes she had made...

68
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,400
And especially...

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,790
The ones she had buried.

72
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,080
It happened once a week on Wisteria Lane

73
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,400
Like clockwork.

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,010
The faithful would emerge from their homes

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,490
In their sunday best...

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,050
With their family bibles...

77
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,350
And their rosary beads...

78
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,070
And they would head off

79
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,070
To their various houses of worship,

80
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,630
Passing by a certain nonbeliever

81
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,820
Who had never taken an interest in their ritual.

82
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,030
But on this day,Lynette Scavo,

83
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,230
For the first time in her life,

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,670
Was struck by something...

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,860
Get the ball.

86
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,980
Something she would later think of

87
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,410
As divine inspiration.

88
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,060
We should go to church.

89
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
What?

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
Why? what did we do?

91
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,000
Ah,it's just...

92
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,510
We've been through a lot lately,

93
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,290
And we have a lot to be thankful for.

94
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,490
Don't you think we owe the big guy a little face time?

95
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,210
Fine,fine. we'll go to church...

96
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,760
Next week.

97
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,390
Tom...

98
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,090
I'm serious. what's the rush? God will still be there next Sunday.

99
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,400
The Pistons,on the other hand...

100
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,250
They lose today,they're gone for good.

101
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,250
So I'm clear,

102
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,060
You can't be bothered with saving your eternal soul

103
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,670
Because the Pistons have no defense?

104
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,570
Okay,look.

105
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,350
You didn't grow up going to church.

106
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,350
I did.

107
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,040
My parents dragged me to st. anthony's every sunday.

108
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,590
I've done my time.

109
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,230
Well,I haven't.

110
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,030
I have some questions I would like answered.

111
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,790
And I don't know anything about God or Jesus,

112
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,340
And our kids don't either. well,

113
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,690
you don't have to go to church to learn that stuff.

114
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,490
Yeah,I know about Jesus.

115
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,450
See?

116
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,920
He's the guy who helps out Santa Claus.

117
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,490
Get dressed,kids. we're going to church.

118
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,140
Mm-hmm. right.

119
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,660
Orson,I don't want to be late.

120
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,000
Services don't start 10:30.

121
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,880
Yes,but I'm sure Edna Fletcher has been there since 9:00,

122
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,000
Kissing up to reverend Sykes.

123
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,230
Is this about the ladies' auxiliary again?

124
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,230
Damn right.

125
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,300
Bree,please,such language on a Sunday.

126
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,840
I am sorry,but I have to make sure

127
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
That he doesn't let her chair that committee.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,540
well,how could he?You plan every pancake breakfast.

129
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,500
You organize every bake sale.

130
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,940
you'd be a saint if our church believed in that sort of hogwash.

131
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,350
Exactly,and all the while,where was Edna?

132
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,400
Lounging around in zimbabwe in the peace corps.

133
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,110
She won't let any of us forget it.

134
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,110
Well,I wouldn't worry.

135
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,560
Edna's "curing the village of dysentery" story

136
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,420
Has long since lost its novelty.

137
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Oh,Lynette. Hi. You look pretty.

138
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,510
What are you all dressed up for?

139
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,150
Well,I decided I should go to church today.

140
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,400
Yeah,Tom said the same thing.

141
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,010
Anyway,since you're the most religious person I know,

142
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,100
I was wondering if you would take us to your church.

143
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,560
I would love that.

144
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,470
We're...we're leaving right now. you can follow us.

145
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,950
Great! just give me a second to sell Tom on the idea.

146
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,100
You know,he was raised Catholic.

147
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,220
Oh,don't go Catholic.

148
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,020
All that standing and kneeling and genuflecting...

149
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,080
I go for worship,not a workout.

150
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,120
Mm. Not to mention the incense,which smells good at first

151
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,910
Until you feel your breakfast coming back up.

152
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,590
Okay.

153
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,700
Well,I'll be right back.

154
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,400
Oh,this is so exciting. I'm going to church.

155
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,460
By the way,what am I now?

156
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,920
Presbyterian.

157
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,960
Right.

158
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,930
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

159
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,590
Oh,shoot.

160
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,200
Did I miss mass?

161
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,540
Was it at 9:00?

162
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,620
Yes,Gabrielle. 9:00 mass is still at 9:00.

163
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,200
Oh,that's good to know.

164
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,600
Uh,father,can I talk to you?

165
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,660
Of course. I've actually been expecting you to come by.

166
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,820
Why?

167
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,780
Well,I thought you might need some comforting

168
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,120
After your husband's death.

169
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,810
Oh,that.

170
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,810
Yeah,I was a little blue,

171
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,010
But the good news is,I've bounced back.

172
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,290
Really?

173
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,230
Okay,this may come as a little shock to you...

174
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,390
But guess who's getting married again?

175
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,350
And I was thinking,

176
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,860
Maybe you could perform the ceremony.

177
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,440
Is Tuesday good for you?

178
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,770
Uh...

179
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,890
Victor's only been dead two weeks.

180
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,310
Yeah,I know,but I'm no good single.

181
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,810
Honestly,I don't know how you do it.

182
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,460
Well,who is this man? did you just meet him?

183
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,290
No. no,no,no,no. it's Carlos.

184
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,860
Carlos? I-i didn't know you two were even speaking.

185
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,600
Oh,yeah. we bumped into each other a few months ago,

186
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,590
And we just fell in love all over again.

187
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,700
Uh,a few months ago?

188
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,500
But you were married six months ago.

189
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,450
Boy,you are just determined to make this awkward,aren't ya?

190
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,730
Oh,Gabrielle.

191
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,820
Okay,look,in the eyes of the church,

192
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,220
Carlos and I were never divorced.

193
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,460
Technically,the affair was with Victor,

194
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,400
And God smote him.

195
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,780
So we're good.

196
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,030
All right,yes,I've been a bad Catholic.

197
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,640
Enough with the guilt thing. Are you gonna marry us or not?

198
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,210
Fine,as long as you promise

199
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,660
To stay married to Carlos for the rest of your life.

200
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,400
Absolutely.

201
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,820
Oh,but if I don't,I promise you,

202
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,800
I will change religions.

203
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,340
Thank you.

204
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,650
Sorry. No,this is good.

205
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,470
Accountants always appreciate it when people take the time

206
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,740
To develop a sophisticated filing system.

207
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,860
Are you always this sarcastic with your clients?

208
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,930
Nope,just my favorite cousin.

209
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,320
I so appreciate you helping us out.

210
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,090
Mike would be doing our taxes,but he's off...

211
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,100
Getting better.

212
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,650
Mom told me. Besides,I'm happy to have the work.

213
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,520
Yeah,I was sorry to hear about your job.

214
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,790
You know,ever since n.a.f.t.a.,

215
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,780
Corporate outsourcing has been the bane of the American worker.

216
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,060
Is that right? I heard somebody say that on n.p.r.,

217
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,190
And I just keep repeating it to people.

218
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,040
Actually,I wish I could blame losing my job on n.a.f.t.a.,

219
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,250
But it really has more to do with Chloe.

220
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,420
My boss' daughter.

221
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,680
Oh,Tim.

222
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,800
I don't know why he got so mad. I mean,she was 18.

223
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,440
Okay,so back to these receipts.

224
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,860
What is it about a girl in a cheerleader outfit?

225
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,340
Done catching up. all about accounting now.

226
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,720
Come on,Susan. you're acting like I'm some sort of creep. No,

227
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,690
I know you're not.

228
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,910
I mean,18's legal.

229
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,490
I checked with a lawyer before I did anything.

230
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,920
These receipts are self-explanatory.

231
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,900
I'd even know why I'm here.

232
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,220
This is the nourishment

233
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,030
Each soul requires to go from acorn to oak.

234
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,570
And this is what should bring us peace in our hearts--

235
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,180
The blessed knowledge that God's love for us

236
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,820
Is as sure as the sunlight

237
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,530
And that it is always shining.

238
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,080
We only need see it.

239
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,980
Amen? amen.

240
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,820
Now if you'll take out your hymnals

241
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,580
And turn to page 335.

242
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,070
What are you doing? I've got a question about his sermon.

243
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,640
What? No. Put your hand down.

244
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,420
It'll just take a sec. Lynette,please,we don't do that here.

245
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,820
Uh,yes,can I help you?

246
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,380
Hi. I'm Lynette Scavo.

247
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,410
I'm a friend of Bree Hodge. and your sermon was lovely,

248
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,750
Especially the part about the trees.

249
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,270
Thank you. but here's where you lost me--

250
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,110
"God's love is as sure as the sunlight."

251
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,660
Yes,absolutely.

252
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,980
There. You have your answer. Now sit.

253
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,430
The reason I ask is,there are wars all over the world,

254
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,830
And it seems like every month,

255
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,590
Some dumb-ass walks into a school

256
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,160
And starts shooting children.

257
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,220
So I'm thinking,God's love?

258
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,130
Not so sure.

259
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,850
Did she just say "dumb-ass"?

260
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,080
Ah,the eternal question--

261
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,290
"why do bad things happen to good people?"

262
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,680
What you have to remember is,God gave us free will.

263
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,260
Much of the evil in the world is brought on by man himself.

264
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,210
Oh,Lord.

265
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,870
Yes,Lynette?

266
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,910
Okay,I give you that one.

267
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,220
But what about the tornado that just happened?

268
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,820
You can't blame man for that.

269
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,870
Get the keys ready. we'll slip out the back.

270
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,280
You bring up a big theological issue,

271
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,630
One that deserves a lot more time to explore.

272
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,270
Why don't you come to our tuesday night bible study?

273
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,520
We can discuss it then.

274
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,850
Well,sure. I'm easy. Thanks.

275
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,020
Katherine,Dylan,hi. What's up?

276
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,470
Julie and I have a study date,

277
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,630
And my mom wants to apologize for being rude...

278
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,920
Again.

279
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,890
Is this about the other day?

280
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,170
Yes. You were just trying to help,

281
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,310
And I shouldn't have reacted the way I did.

282
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,780
Oh,please. After what you've been through,

283
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,230
No one is judging. Come on in.

284
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,110
I'll put on some coffee.

285
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,970
Oh,um,this is my cousin Tim. Tim,this is the neighbors.

286
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,380
Mrs. Davis?

287
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,870
Davis? Nobody's called me that in years.

288
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,950
Do we know each other?

289
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,310
Oh,of course you do. That's right!

290
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,920
This is my cousin Timmy.

291
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,500
He stayed with us

292
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,930
That summer that he went to band camp.

293
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,210
Oh! Yes.

294
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,090
I remember.

295
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,010
Gosh,you're all grown up.It's nice to see you again.

296
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,400
You,too. hold it. Is this little Dylan?

297
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,890
Can you believe it?

298
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,380
Wow! the last time I saw you,you were pulling a wagon.

299
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,490
Oh.

300
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,040
How old are you now? I turn 18 next week.

301
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,550
Really?

302
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,740
18?

303
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,020
Julie,Dylan's here! study time!

304
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,380
I'm... sorry.

305
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,630
That was probably a little louder than it needed to be.

306
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,560
Edie,is that you?

307
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,690
Oh,my god. you knew it was me

308
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,050
Just from the sound of my footsteps?

309
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,940
No,from your perfume.

310
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,230
I smelled it the moment you hit the parking lot.

311
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,010
Look,there's no reason to be pissy.

312
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,330
I'm here to do something nice.

313
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,870
Really?

314
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,370
I feel bad about the whole losing-all-of-your-money thing.

315
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,940
Even though we know tornado-- clearly not my fault.

316
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,620
Um...

317
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,600
Anyway,i-i thought maybe this...

318
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,170
Would help.

319
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,150
It's the diamond bracelet you gave me.

320
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,160
It must be worth thousands of dollars.

321
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,090
Do you think you still have the receipt for it?

322
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,060
Uh... I think I threw it out.

323
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,420
Oh. well,you said it was from cartier,right?

324
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,700
I'm sure they have some sort of record.

325
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,500
Carlos?

326
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,250
Actually,the box was from cartier.

327
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,840
The bracelet's from...

328
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,440
A swap meet.

329
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,500
Hold it.

330
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,260
Are you saying

331
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,450
That those diamonds are cubic zirconias?

332
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,250
If we're lucky.

333
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,880
You son of a bitch. I gave you my heart,

334
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,600
And all you could give me was fake jewelry?

335
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,310
Edie...  I'm sorry. I never thought you'd find out.

336
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,050
I just spat on one of your jell-o cubes.

337
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,220
Happy hunting.

338
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,950
Hey,you. do you know how long it's gonna be

339
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,390
Until Carlos gets his sight back?

340
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,590
Because I have a 2-word sentence I'd like to say to him,

341
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
And there's a hand gesture that goes along with it.

342
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,340
I don't know. Mr. Solis' condition is very serious.

343
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,390
Serious? what's wrong?

344
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,120
Well...

345
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,130
You know,you should really talk to the doctor about this.

346
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,590
I don't even think his girlfriend knows.

347
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,450
You mean Gaby?

348
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,660
I'm sorry. I said too much already.

349
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,210
Oh,please don't tell me that's your lunch.

350
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,990
Yeah. I'm sort of on a budget.

351
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,660
No,no,no. if you're gonna give quality care,

352
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,230
You're gonna need some quality food.

353
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,340
Now I know of this great,little french bistro.

354
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,270
It's the perfect place for lunch...

355
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,510
And conversation.

356
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,860
"your father was murdered."

357
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,820
Wow.

358
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,430
I know.

359
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,830
Are you sure your aunt knew what she was writing?

360
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,650
She was pretty sick. no,she had it together,even on that last day.

361
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,640
I remember aunt Lily really wanted to tell me something,

362
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,630
And then my mom just came in and stopped her.

363
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,870
Does your mom know you found this?

364
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,650
No,and I'm not gonna tell her either.

365
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,240
Why give her another chance to lie to me?

366
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,130
That's why I'm going to Adam.

367
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,420
I can trust him to tell me the truth.

368
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,300
I just don't get it.

369
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,750
I mean,why would your mom lie about your dad being murdered?

370
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,500
Are you serious?

371
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,850
Julie...

372
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,870
She's the one who killed him.

373
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,880
Hi,babe.

374
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,170
I'm about to do something that's gonna make you very happy.

375
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,310
Great,but close the curtain first.

376
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,760
Last time,the nurse almost walked in

377
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,240
When you were about to-- Carlos! I have a priest with me.

378
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,040
Priest? what,is there something

379
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,200
The doctors aren't telling me?

380
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,480
No,no,no. I wanted it to be a surprise,

381
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,600
But we're getting married!

382
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,030
Father,hit it.

383
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,440
Dearly beloved,we are gathered here

384
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,600
In the presence of-- whoa,whoa,whoa.

385
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,730
Gaby,what's the rush?

386
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,730
I don't know. just after everything we've been through,

387
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,720
There's nothing in our way now.

388
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,520
We can finally be together.

389
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,600
And I really need that.

390
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,430
I need a happy ending,Carlos.

391
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,240
So what do you say? will you marry me?

392
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,850
Okay.

393
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,810
Holy matrimony. bring it on.

394
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,370
Gaby,before we get started,

395
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,830
There's something that I need to tell you...

396
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,740
In private.

397
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,510
Okay,he's gone. what's up?

398
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,810
Look,I haven't been completely honest with you

399
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,940
About the extent of my injury.

400
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,020
Okay.

401
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,300
The doctor says...

402
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,080
I might not get my sight back.

403
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,000
For three months. four,tops.

404
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,850
I-i just want to make sure that you can handle that.

405
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,300
Wow.

406
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,230
That's... a really long time.

407
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,900
But for better or worse,right?

408
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,460
Right.

409
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,460
Okay,padre.

410
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,960
We're ready. Let's take it from the top.

411
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,130
Dearly beloved,we are gathered here in the sight of god

412
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,090
To join this man and this woman

413
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,770
In the holy sacrament of matrimony.

414
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,950
You're out of milk. you want me to pick some up?

415
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,670
No,that's okay. it can wait.

416
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,800
I don't mind. I could use a little air anyway.

417
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,500
Mm.

418
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,060
Hmm.

419
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,280
Mm.

420
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,310
Tim! where's that milk?

421
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,860
Oh,I thought you didn't want any. uh...

422
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,460
I'm having a baby.

423
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,920
I can't give birth with brittle bones. go!

424
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,840
Bye!

425
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,550
Hey,church buddy. look what I got.

426
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,130
Wow,you bought a bible.

427
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,070
Yeah,and I'm breaking her in tonight.

428
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,230
Nothing like that new bible smell.

429
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:43,880
Oh,so you're...

430
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,040
Coming to bible study. yeah,and I hope the reverend's ready,

431
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,590
Cause I got about a zillion questions for him.

432
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,200
Lynette,I-I realize

433
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,360
You don't have much experience with churches,

434
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,650
So this really isn't your fault.

435
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,920
What isn't my fault?

436
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,890
Well,last sunday,when you kept raising your hand...

437
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,170
We don't really do that.

438
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,750
The church isn't a place for questions.

439
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,130
It's a place for answers.

440
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,440
Yeah,but how do you get the answers

441
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,760
If you don't ask the questions?

442
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,880
Well,typically,we sit there and let the preacher preach,

443
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,190
And eventually,our questions are answered,

444
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,200
And no one is humiliated.

445
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm sorry. did I embarrass you on Sunday?

446
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,990
Well,it's just that in our church,

447
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,190
People don't talk back to the minister.

448
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,800
Well,what if I need to?

449
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,090
What if that's the kind of church I'm looking for?

450
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,670
Well,then maybe you should explore other options.

451
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,720
I mean,if you really enjoy talking back to the pulpit,

452
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,310
Why don't you try that

453
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,470
Gospel Church by the airport?

454
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:45,950
Okay.

455
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,180
Or,uh,the unitarians.

456
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,020
From what I hear,those folks are "anything goes."

457
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,980
Hey,Adam. it's Dylan.

458
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,630
I waited at your hotel all day,but you never came back.

459
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,590
You have to call me. I found this note that aunt lily wrote.

460
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,960
Mom threw it in the fireplace,but I fished it out,

461
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,220
And I have to talk to you.

462
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,290
Call me on my cell,not at home,'cause I--

463
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,290
She doesn't know anything. I can hear it in her voice.

464
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,430
But she's got the note. Maybe a few burnt pieces.

465
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,860
Trust me,all she's got are questions.

466
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,940
Well,I could,um,refuse to see her.

467
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,120
Yeah,'cause that won't arouse her suspicion.

468
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,800
No. you are going to ask her to come here,

469
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,680
And then you're going to find out

470
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,040
Exactly what she knows and what she doesn't.

471
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,190
After all these years,maybe it would be easier

472
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,760
Just to finally tell her the truth.

473
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,800
And you would just wave good-bye

474
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,080
as they cart me off to jail?

475
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,840
She wouldn't call the police.

476
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,750
Seriously,I think you two have a great relationship.

477
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Then you have not been paying attention.

478
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,890
Give me a chance to get home,

479
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,500
Then call her and set up a time for you two to meet.

480
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,810
Okay.

481
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,450
You know...

482
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,340
When you called me tonight,

483
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,390
I was half hoping you missed me.

484
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,550
Really?

485
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,800
I miss you.

486
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm so terribly lonely.

487
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,880
You know I don't do well on my own.

488
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,750
Is there any chance we could...

489
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,840
Get past this,

490
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,840
and you could come back home?

491
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,060
I will talk to Dylan.

492
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,080
I will provide you one last alibi.

493
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,160
After that,I'm done.

494
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,390
Are you guys outta here?

495
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,390
Yes,I'm gonna run some errands,

496
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,950
And Orson's gonna take Benjamin to the park.

497
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,850
Actually,I thought I might take him to the museum.

498
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,600
You know how much Benjamin loves Matisse.

499
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,340
Benjamin doesn't love Matisse. he loves Purple. oh.

500
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,670
Please stop trying to turn our son into an intellectual. mm.

501
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,670
If you saw how her first two turned out,

502
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,010
You'd understand how important it is

503
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,080
For me to fight the van de kamp d.n.a.

504
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,860
Hey,it's Tim.

505
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,170
It was great seeing you the other day.

506
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,800
Yeah,I can't stop thinking about you either.

507
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,010
So listen,um

508
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,110
I've got the whole place to myself.

509
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,880
You wanna come over?

510
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,550
Hey, Gaby.

511
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,050
I heard you and Carlos got married yesterday.

512
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,400
Guess this means you win.

513
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,050
Oh, Edie, it wasn't a competition,

514
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,680
But, yeah, I guess I did.

515
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,120
Yeah,but I think it's all for the best.

516
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,000
I mean, after all, I could have never been

517
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,580
The hero that you're about to be.

518
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,760
Hero? why am I a hero?

519
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,100
Committing your life to a man who's blind?

520
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,760
My god,you're gonna have to do everything for him...

521
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,040
Dress him,shave him,lead him to the bathroom,

522
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,500
Pray that his aim is halfway decent.

523
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,950
It's not a big deal.

524
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,160
Carlos is gonna get his sight back in three months.

525
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,190
Four, tops.

526
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,420
Is that what he told you? You poor,gullible fool.

527
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,710
What are you talking about?

528
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,870
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

529
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,260
But I talked to the nurse,

530
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,090
And she said that his condition is...

531
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,040
Oh,what's the word? um...

532
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,110
Oh,yeah.

533
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:08,870
Permanent.

534
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,190
I don't believe you.

535
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,670
Call the doctor if you'd like.

536
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,460
And apparently,he was begging Carlos to tell you.

537
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,020
No. no,no,no. This can't be true.

538
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,380
Look on the bright side.

539
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,990
Women who are married to blind guys

540
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,030
Don't have to worry about makeup or getting fat.

541
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,470
Are you sure you didn't already know about this?

542
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,700
Okay,I'm calling Dr Dunlap.

543
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,000
You do that.

544
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,500
Oh,and by the way,

545
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,000
Congrats on your big win.

546
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
So how's your occupational therapy going?

547
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,100
Do they still have you scrubbing pots in the kitchen?

548
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,580
No,no. once they found out I'm a professional plumber,

549
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,000
I got promoted to scrubbing toilets. mm,well,maybe you won't mind

550
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,070
Doing a little scrubbing when you come home next week. actually,

551
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,720
the doctors kinda frown on that.

552
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,070
They encourage us to leave that sort of stuff behind.

553
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,320
Well,it doesn't have to be toilets.

554
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,690
I mean,it could be sinks,bathtubs.

555
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,060
You're making me wanna use,Susan.

556
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,320
This junkie thing's awesome.

557
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,320
Oh,I forgot. uh,tim has some questions about the taxes.

558
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,120
Do you mind talking to him? no,I don't mind. though I can't believe

559
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,330
He'd have any trouble with your cookie tin filing system.

560
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,040
Hello? hey,uh,tim,I've got Mike here.

561
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,750
Do you want to talk to him?

562
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,870
Uh,can I do that later? I'm sort of taking a nap.

563
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,080
What was that? is someone there?

564
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,500
What? no. no. unh-unh. no...no one's here.

565
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,330
Really? 'cause it sounded like a girl.

566
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,900
No,uh,it...it was just the TV.

567
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,960
I thought you were taking a nap.

568
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,940
Uh,the TV helps me sleep.

569
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,180
Uh,tell Mike I'll call him later.

570
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,130
I've gotta go.

571
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,680
What? what? you just got here.

572
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,190
I know,but this visit was really more for Julie.

573
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,570
For me? yeah,you're going to college soon,

574
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,830
And I want him to tell you about the dangers of drugs.

575
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,290
Scare her straight,mike.

576
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,610
Honey,you down here?

577
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,750
Yes,sweetheart.

578
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,250
I'm in the kitchen making dinner.

579
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,810
Mmm. smells good.

580
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,410
It's a new recipe for beef stew.

581
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,130
I think you're gonna love it.

582
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,230
Why don't we let that simmer?

583
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,820
During my nap,I had the filthiest little dream.

584
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,330
I was kinda hoping maybe we could...

585
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,680
Skip straight to dessert?

586
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,770
Yeah.

587
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,520
What do you say?

588
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,270
I'd say I'm one step ahead of you.

589
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,130
I have already slipped into my pink lace teddy,

590
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,430
And I'm wearing those whore-y pumps that you love.

591
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,130
Ooh,I like that image. where are you?

592
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm right here,babe.

593
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,790
Ow!

594
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,690
Oh,I'm sorry. I forgot that was open.

595
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,000
Let's do it over here,on the table.

596
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,480
Can you give me a hand?

597
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,210
Can't. My legs are in the air.

598
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,500
Just follow the sound of my voice.

599
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,740
There you go.

600
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,910
I'm over here,sweetie.

601
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,620
Whoa! uhh! Son of a bitch!

602
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,960
Ooh,I meant to move that.

603
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,170
Hang on. let me just pull my panties up so I can help you.

604
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,880
Okay. Here.

605
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,120
Let's go do it over here.

606
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,810
Aah! damn it! what the hell is going on?!

607
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,210
I'll tell you what's going on.

608
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,600
"in three months. four,tops."

609
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,460
Uh-oh.

610
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,100
"uh-oh" is right,you blind bastard!

611
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,230
Ow! all right,I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied! oh,no,no.

612
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,210
i think it was a fantastic plan.

613
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,190
I mean,there's no way I ever would have figured out

614
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,130
That I was married to a permanently blind guy!

615
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,740
Ow!

616
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,570
All right, I just thought that by the time you did,

617
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,670
You'd be used to the idea,

618
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,640
And maybe then you wouldn't leave me.

619
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,330
Leave you?

620
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,570
Do you really think I'm that shallow?

621
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,760
Gaby, I'm poor and I'm blind,

622
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,680
And let's face it.

623
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,320
There is nothing about that that is your type.

624
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,550
Wow. thanks for the vote of confidence.

625
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,100
Y-yes, the truth would have freaked me out,

626
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,030
But I would have come around.

627
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,150
If you had just had a little faith in me,

628
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,370
I could have proven to you that I was up for the challenge,

629
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,920
But you robbed me of that chance. I'm sorry.

630
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,020
Good.

631
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,040
To avoid future confusion,I love you,

632
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,800
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

633
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,300
Gaby, this is not going to be easy.

634
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,880
I know, but like I said,

635
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,490
"for better or for worse."

636
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,400
Think you can forgive me?

637
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,760
I'll work on it.

638
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,900
While you're working on it,

639
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,720
Mind if I dig into some of that stew?

640
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,280
Sure.

641
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,920
Ugh! Get off that poor girl right now!

642
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,710
I finished your taxes.

643
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,890
What the hell is going on here? Susan,I'm so sorry.

644
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,800
No,Katherine,

645
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,210
I know what you've been going through emotionally,

646
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,470
So you don't have to apologize.

647
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,810
And by the way,your boob is out. oh.

648
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,430
You,on the other hand... I know. I know.

649
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,940
I don't understand you. is this something you do?

650
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,740
You worm your way into a neighborhood

651
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,210
With the promise of free tax preparation,

652
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,220
And then you jump on the nearest middle-aged divorce? hey!

653
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,290
It's not like that. she came over for some drinks,

654
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,840
And we got to talking and started reminiscing,

655
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,100
And all these old feelings came rushing back.

656
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,210
Oh,nice try,timmy. like I'm really going to believe that.

657
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,060
Shame on you. Just... shame!

658
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,900
What do you mean, "old feelings"?

659
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,970
Do we really need to get into this?

660
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,500
What do you have to reminisce about?

661
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,370
He was here for a week when he was 16.

662
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,620
What could you two have even...

663
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,480
Oh,my god,you slept together.

664
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,040
Okay,

665
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,310
before you get some sordid image in your head...she took my virginity.

666
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,780
Do you have to say it like that?

667
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,960
that's how I said it to every single guy at band camp.

668
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,290
Shame on you!

669
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,510
His mother trusted me to take care of him,

670
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,660
And you swoop in

671
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,430
Like some swooping,sex-craved...

672
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,490
Oh,for god sakes,tim! Pull up the blanket!

673
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,700
You can't blame it on Katherine. I knew exactly what I was doing.

674
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,170
I don't want to hear this. I'm done with both of you.

675
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,180
If anybody needs me,I'll be at the mall...

676
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,470
Buying sheets.

677
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,790
Good morning. I'll see you after service.

678
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,350
Oh! good morning,reverend.

679
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,280
I brought your favorite...blueberry scones.

680
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,980
Thank you,Bree.

681
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,290
By the way,I'm sorry I've taken so long

682
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,270
To make a decision about the ladies' auxiliary.

683
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,000
Oh,is that happening now? I'd forgotten all about it.

684
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,630
So is your,uh,delightful neighbor coming?

685
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,860
The one with all the questions?

686
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,170
Delightful? I thought she annoyed you.

687
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,230
No,I found her refreshing.

688
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,070
It's like I always say.

689
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,980
Church is not a place for answers. It's a place for questions.

690
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,010
You don't say that.

691
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,040
I've...I've never heard you say that,not once. yes,well,anyway,

692
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,260
I want to thank you for taking the initiative.

693
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,520
New members are crucial to the health of this church.

694
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,240
I won't forget you brought them... or these.

695
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,730
Thank you,Reverend,

696
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,030
And I'm--i'm sure the Scavos will be here soon.

697
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,950
Why did you just say that?

698
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,530
You know very well they went to catholic church.

699
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,480
Which is just down the street. I'll be right back.

700
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:25,610
Psst! Not you. Lynette.

701
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,180
What are you doing here?

702
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,940
I was gonna ask the same of you.

703
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,640
Why are you in a catholic church?

704
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,160
Because we're catholic. oh,please.

705
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,430
Mowing your lawn in a notre dame sweatshirt

706
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,640
Doesn't make you catholic.

707
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,280
You're presbyterian now. come on. Let's go.

708
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,820
Weren't you the one who said I should explore other churches?

709
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,580
I meant sample, like a buffet.

710
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,110
You take a little plate of everything,

711
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,680
And then you sit down for the main course,

712
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,820
Which is across the street...

713
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,150
At the presbyterian church.

714
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,870
No. I just put 10 bucks in the collection plate,

715
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,520
And I'm gonna get my money's worth. is there a problem?

716
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,810
No,no problem. just talking to my friend. she's trying to poach her.

717
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,630
I am not!

718
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,750
My friend's just a little confused.

719
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,830
She forgot that she's presbyterian

720
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,170
And wandered into the wrong church. I'm not presbyterian.

721
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,430
I'm a free agent.

722
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,670
And if you're open to a little q and a,you've got me.

723
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,880
Lynette, please.

724
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,410
Can't we just go outside and talk for a moment?

725
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,310
Okay,what gives?

726
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,360
Well, I was at the service this morning,

727
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,800
- And it's just not the same without you. - bree...

728
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,380
And I am... up for the head of the ladies' auxiliary,

729
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,350
And reverend sykes was so impressed

730
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,190
That I brought a new family into church,so...

731
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,950
If you don't come back,then...

732
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,750
- Oh,then you won't get what you want? - well,yes.

733
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,570
Well,forget it.

734
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,040
Let someone else help you with your power grab.

735
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,990
Lynette!

736
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,900
You were the one who came to me. you sought me out.

737
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,730
Yes,and do you know why?

738
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,950
Because out of all my friends,

739
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,150
You are the one who had real faith.

740
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,200
You had an actual relationship with God.

741
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,140
At least,that's what I thought.

742
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,090
Lynette...

743
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,660
Because I have had a rough few months.  okay?

744
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,080
But I know you've had rough times,too,

745
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,890
And I always assumed

746
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,520
That your faith had helped you get through them.

747
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,910
I envied you that,to be honest.

748
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,010
It did. it did help me.

749
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,380
Really? Okay. How?

750
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,640
It just did.

751
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,300
Well,that's not a good answer.

752
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,500
I have been through cancer and a tornado,

753
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,500
And I don't know why I survived,

754
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,140
and so many other people didn't.

755
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,190
I don't understand,and I need to.

756
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,180
Lynette,why didn't you tell me?

757
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,280
Why didn't you ask?

758
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,790
Oh,that's right. You don't like asking questions.

759
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,170
Hey,Lynette.

760
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:13,870
Hi! There.

761
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,690
Just... wanted to tell you

762
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,230
That I'm out of the running for the ladies' auxiliary.

763
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,440
I told reverend Sykes to,uh,give it to Edna fletcher.

764
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,250
She was in the peace corps,you know.

765
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,450
Huh. that's nice of you.

766
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,300
I suppose. I just wanted to let you know that.

767
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,590
And also to... apologize.

768
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,340
Oh,you don't have to do that.

769
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,010
Yes, I do. You were right. Faith shouldn't be blind.

770
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,450
You don't threaten it by asking questions.

771
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,820
You make it stronger,and I lost sight of that.

772
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,440
Well,maybe a little.

773
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,190
And it meant a lot that you came to me for guidance,and...

774
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,280
I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you.

775
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,310
I want you to have faith in me and our friendship.

776
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,470
Well... There are some things that are easy to believe in.

777
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,690
How's catholicism going,by the way?

778
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:17,810
Meh.

779
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,080
Well, if you ever wanna try us again...

780
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,180
Oh, well, I'm pretty comfortable with the catholics.

781
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,650
They're the only ones who don't judge me

782
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,610
For having so many kids.

783
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,500
Hey.

784
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:34,860
Hey.

785
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,860
Okay,so I have to ask.

786
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,690
This thing that happened with you and Katherine

787
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,510
12 years ago...

788
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,570
Was it an ongoing affair?

789
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,600
No. no,it was just the one time,

790
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,020
And I think she felt pretty guilty about it afterwards.

791
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,480
She told me not to come around anymore.

792
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,000
So you didn't go back?

793
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,510
It's weird. I tried to.

794
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,870
It was the last night of my visit.

795
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,250
I thought if I brought her some flowers,

796
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,180
Maybe I could get something going,you know?

797
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,760
But when I got up to the front door,

798
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,520
- I heard all this yelling. - ...say good night to my daughter.

799
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,610
- She is asleep. get the hell out. - I went around to the window

800
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,630
- Just to get a look at what was going on... - remember? she's my daughter!

801
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,450
- I'm her father! - and I could see she was having a fight with someone.

802
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,370
I was about to rush in and help her

803
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,110
When I saw katherine pick up this candlestick

804
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,900
And just wail on him.

805
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,250
He went down pretty hard.

806
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,590
Katherine was just standing over him

807
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,380
With this look in her eye.

808
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,620
It scared the hell out of me,

809
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
so I got out of there.

810
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,670
I left the next morning

811
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,290
And never talked to Katherine again.

812
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,160
So... this man...who do you think it was?

813
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,130
Don't know.

814
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,840
I sort of got the impression he was her ex-husband.

815
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,350
Does she ever talk about him?

816
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,590
Not really.

817
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,370
Mm. have you seen him lately?

818
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,550
No.

819
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,970
Ever since I can remember,I've had this feeling

820
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,780
That something's not right.

821
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,250
Weird dreams that don't seem like dreams at all.

822
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,100
People telling me I forgot things that

823
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,310
I know I would've remembered.

824
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,350
And now finally,

825
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,790
I find a sentence on a piece of paper...

826
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,210
That could explain all of it

827
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,900
And prove that I am not crazy.

828
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,080
And the best that you can come up with

829
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,510
Is that Aunt Lily was losing it

830
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,930
And she didn't know what she was writing?

831
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,560
I need the truth, Adam.

832
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,910
Please. Please.

833
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,720
The truth, Dylan... Is that...

834
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,810
Your mother didn't kill your father.

835
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,000
And she loves you more than you will ever know.

836
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,140
Faith is a belief in something that cannot be proven.

837
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:42,110
So we trust in the words of the only father we've ever known.

838
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,030
We believe the promises of the woman who shares our bed.

839
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:55,330
We rely on the example of dear friends

840
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,540
Who help us to be better people.

841
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:06,300
Yes,we all want to believe in those we are closest to,

842
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,180
But where there is doubt,Our faith begins to vanish...

843
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,680
And fear rushes in to take its place.
