<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,294
- May I sit?
- Not just yet. What is it you want?

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:08,717
I wanna learn the business from
the ground up, then help you expand it.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,385
- <i>Bree...</i>
- Mr. Allen?

5
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,762
- <i>... hired a new employee.</i>
- Now you can sit.

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,962
You should be saying,
"Great, Ana. Go for it!"

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>Gaby thought
she had ended a romance.</i>

8
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,769
- Where's Danny?
- New York.

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,688
Danny went to find Ana.

10
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,356
You have to leave.

11
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,317
<i>Robin was asked to go,</i>

12
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,277
<i>but Katherine...</i>

13
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,333
<i>had a change of heart.</i>

14
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:40,196
<i>Preston Scavo was finally
coming home from Europe,</i>

15
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:43,340
<i>and his family was wondering
what kind of souvenirs</i>

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>he'd be bringing them.</i>

17
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:49,148
<i>His brother wanted an
army knife from Switzerland.</i>

18
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,095
<i>His sister wanted some
wooden shoes from Holland.</i>

19
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:58,325
<i>His father wanted
some cheese from Bavaria.</i>

20
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:00,772
<i>And his mother?</i>

21
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:05,049
<i>All she wanted was to hold
her little boy in her arms...</i>

22
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:08,443
Guess who's back!

23
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,696
<i>But she'd soon discover
her little boy</i>

24
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,219
<i>wasn't so little anymore.</i>

25
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,635
Let me at him! I get the first hug!

26
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:20,925
- Mom, you're huge!
- I know. Look at you.

27
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,751
You don't have to grow a mustache
to see how bad it would look.

28
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,641
- What'd you bring me?
- He just walked in.

29
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,970
Give him a chance to unpack
and give me my cheese.

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,009
Actually,
I do have a little surprise.

31
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:34,841
There's plenty of time for that.
You've been traveling all day.

32
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:38,139
- You want to take a shower or a nap.
- I kinda need to do this now.

33
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:41,601
You are really gonna
want to see the surprise.

34
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,604
I'm a little nervous.
Maybe I should explain.

35
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,315
You don't need to explain,
I'm sure we're gonna love it.

36
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:49,449
Everyone...

37
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:52,057
I'd like you to meet Irina.

38
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:56,783
I am finally to meet
the lovely Preston family.

39
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:02,414
Nice to meet you, Irina.

40
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:05,083
Preston didn't say
he was bringing a friend.

41
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:07,794
She's more than a friend, mom.
We're in love.

42
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:09,921
<i>Yes,</i>

43
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:12,734
<i>Preston Scavo had
returned from his trip</i>

44
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:15,010
<i>with a beautiful souvenir,</i>

45
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,876
<i>And his mother would soon wish</i>

46
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:19,857
<i>he hadn't.</i>

- Ana, you're doing it again!
- But you can't see my face.

59
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,754
This is a tool calendar.

60
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,264
It's gonna be hanging
in some fat mechanic's basement,

61
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,192
and he won't be
looking at your face.

62
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,527
I came to New York
to be a fashion model.

63
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,614
I came to make art films.
Isn't life funny?

64
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:21,859
I'm getting a doughnut. You have
two minutes for an attitude adjustment.

65
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:30,877
- What are you doing here?
- I've been looking everywhere for you.

66
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,296
You wasted your time. We broke up.

67
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,840
We were broken up by your aunt.

68
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,718
She doesn't care about your career.
All she's ever cared about

69
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,568
is keeping us apart...

70
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,515
And that's why she sent you here.

71
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,854
That's why the agency's only been
sending me out on these crappy jobs.

72
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:52,148
It all makes sense now.

73
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,238
We got a lot of catching up to do.
Can we go somewhere and talk?

74
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,534
Come on, January. Time is money.

75
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:06,830
I quit.

76
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,057
Gaby, you in here?

77
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:15,338
I need Ana's address in New York.
I'm on my way to the airport.

78
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:22,046
- Why would you need that?
- Because Danny ran off to find her.

79
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:24,097
I will save you the trip,

80
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,982
'cause if Danny finds Ana,
she'll send him packing.

81
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:30,535
She wants nothing to do with your son.
She'll tell you herself.

82
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,237
<i>Hey, this is Ana. Leave a message.</i>

83
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,078
<i>And if you're my Aunt Gaby,
I know what you did.</i>

84
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:37,525
<i>Drop dead.</i>

85
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,861
Hold that cab. I'm coming with you.

86
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,540
Aren't you a little
overdressed for bacon and eggs?

87
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,167
And buttered toast.

88
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,049
Buttered toast. If I'd known that,
I would have worn my formal boxers.

89
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,758
So... do you like it? I got the check
from the sale of the strip club

90
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,008
and I decided to treat myself.

91
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:07,265
Plus, I figured I needed something
to wear when we go to Chez Naomi.

92
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:10,977
Chez Naomi? Why don't we just
stay home and eat money?

93
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:15,540
Because you promised
to take me there to celebrate

94
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,423
paying your business loan off.

95
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:20,552
I'm sorry, but that loan
is years away from being paid off.

96
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:22,822
Not anymore.
I took care of it.

97
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,700
- You did what?
- With the check I got.

98
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,785
What the hell did you do that for?

99
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,848
What I think you meant to say was,

100
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:32,999
"Thanks, Susan.
You're the best wife ever."

101
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:36,069
That loan was my responsibility.

102
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:40,673
You were paying 9% interest.
You were never gonna pay that loan off.

103
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:43,051
I appreciate it.

104
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,054
But in the future,
just check with me first, okay?

105
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:50,308
- I'm gonna take out the trash.
- Now?

106
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:52,734
Lee's getting his mail.

107
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:54,998
He can't see my new dress in here.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,117
Think about it. You already
specialize in comfort food...

109
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:03,363
Marry that
with a creole or cajun twist.

110
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,907
- It's a no-brainer.
- It's brilliant.

111
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,576
- I love it.
- You love what?

112
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:13,000
Sam just came up
with the idea for my next cookbook...

113
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,820
"Down home
cooking with Mrs. Van de Kamp."

114
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:17,345
Thank you, Sam.

115
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:26,260
"To my darling Sam... I couldn't
make it through the day without you."

116
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:27,731
What was that?

117
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:31,516
It's the dedication page
to your new cookbook, I'm guessing.

118
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:33,792
And I have your first recipe...

119
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,694
apple brownnose betty.

120
00:06:35,864 --> 00:06:37,397
That's Sam's specialty.

121
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,429
Since when is hard work brownnosing?

122
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,987
That young man is the first one here
every morning and the last one to leave.

123
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,573
It takes a lot of time
to turn all that water into wine.

124
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:51,754
I am sorry you don't appreciate him.
I think he's tremendous.

125
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,665
In fact,
I have decided to give him a promotion.

126
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,375
A promotion to what?

127
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,419
Vice president.

128
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,797
Check my stationery.
I'm vice president.

129
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,509
A company can have more than one.
There's plenty of work to go around.

130
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:10,645
I don't believe this.
You barely know the guy.

131
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:12,056
I'm your son.

132
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,079
I know
you don't understand this now,

133
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,936
but I am doing
what I think is best for both of us.

134
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,732
Remember that sentence. You'll hearing
it the day I put you in a nursing home.

135
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:45,673
Did I wake you?

136
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:49,302
I just didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?

137
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,835
I was just on my way
to buy some overpriced shoes

138
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,432
to go with my overpriced dress.
You wanna come?

139
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,770
Thanks, but it's...
not a good time.

140
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,626
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

141
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:02,808
Gotta go.

142
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,474
Please don't shut me out, Katherine.

143
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:09,559
Now that you're home
from the hospital,

144
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,158
I want us to go back
to the way we used to be.

145
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,953
There was a time you and I
could tell each other anything.

146
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,625
Morning, hon.
I'll go make the coffee.

147
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:29,933
So...

148
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,861
Anything you wanna tell me?

149
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,621
Are you Rose De Luca?

150
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,373
Why?

151
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:03,418
I think you're my grandma.

152
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:06,204
Tyler?

153
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:16,643
So, after we get to Manhattan,
what's our plan?

154
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:19,030
We go to Ana's modeling agency.
I know that world.

155
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,520
It's all interconnected. Someone will
know someone who knows where they are.

156
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,367
How do you know that world?
Were you a model?

157
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:28,651
You didn't know? Big-time.
I was even on the cover of Vogue.

158
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,862
Really? What happened?

159
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:35,074
I decided I wanted a different
kind of life and married Carlos.

160
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,493
Good for you.

161
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,712
So...

162
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,888
- What?
- I shared something about my past,

163
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:49,764
and I know nothing about yours,

164
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:52,475
like where you grew up
or where you lived

165
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:54,533
before moving to Fairview.

166
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,014
My past isn't that interesting.

167
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,183
Come on. I shared stuff about me.

168
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,394
Telling me you were a supermodel
is not sharing. It's bragging.

169
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,939
It's not bragging when it's the truth.
And the fact is, I was very successful.

170
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,525
If you were, how come
I've never heard of you before?

171
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,224
Because you had to be
looking in a fashion magazine,

172
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,739
and I doubt you
were ever doing that.

173
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,366
Are we done sharing?

174
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,083
So, Paris, Prague, Madrid...

175
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:27,190
it sounds like you
guys saw everything.

176
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,152
But you still haven't
told us how you two met.

177
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,235
The first time I saw Irina
was on a beach in Nice.

178
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,360
It was...
How you say in english?

179
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,012
The...

180
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:39,977
Topless?

181
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:43,142
You real did see everything.

182
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:47,104
I was so embarrassed
to show my breasts in public.

183
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,732
Clearly, you've gotten over that.

184
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:52,318
Sweetie? Would you give me a hand?

185
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,321
Sure.
Are you finished?

186
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:57,070
Thanks, mom.

187
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,751
Why are you being so rude?

188
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,476
Because I love that boy
more than anything in the world,

189
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:08,213
and there is no way in hell
he could get a woman that hot,

190
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,127
so what does she want?

191
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:13,844
Fine. He's dating out of his league.
Remind me to high-five him later.

192
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,801
Now get back over there and be nice.

193
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:19,428
Here you go.

194
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:20,979
Thank you.

195
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:23,816
You have given me
so much beautiful food.

196
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,351
You're welcome.

197
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,009
And you have beautiful boots.

198
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:32,813
Preston buy these for me in Paris.

199
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,152
300 euros...

200
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,697
Almost $400 American, yes?

201
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,499
I remember sending you money
in Paris for an emergency.

202
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,829
I didn't realize
it involved footwear.

203
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,831
Fine. I'll pay you back
out of my college fund.

204
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,125
Your son is so generous.

205
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:54,824
He promised to take me
to the shopping spree

206
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,591
in real American mall.

207
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,553
I hear people pay $80 for T-shirt.

208
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:05,865
Here in America,
people are willing to pay a lot

209
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,591
for beautiful things.

210
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:14,567
I'm sorry. The water was running. Did
you just say Katherine is a leprechaun?

211
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:18,487
Lesbian. Katherine is a lesbian.

212
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,814
- The first one made more sense.
- Apparently, the other night,

213
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:25,271
Katherine and Robin
got a little drunk...

214
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:26,746
Hold it. Robin?

215
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,333
She's a leprechaun, too.

216
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:33,936
Katherine and Robin.

217
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:39,467
You could get the image out of your
head, or I won't tell you anything else.

218
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:41,492
This is too weird.

219
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,349
A lot of people discover
they're gay later in life.

220
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:50,078
How could she go from being with me
to being with women?

221
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,772
She was probably leaning
that way already.

222
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,275
She was lucky to have you.
You were a nice transition.

223
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,497
- What?
- You know,

224
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,264
when you make love,

225
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,202
you're so gentle and
you like to cuddle and...

226
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:09,747
So what are you saying,
that I make love like a woman?

227
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,770
No, I'm saying...

228
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:15,701
that you are a well-balanced man

229
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:17,630
who's in touch with
his feminine side.

230
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:20,007
I don't even have a feminine side.

231
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,622
It's what I love about you.

232
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,013
You cry at movies.

233
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,849
Movie. One movie... "Brian's song."

234
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,559
And "The notebook."

235
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:32,812
Tears of boredom.

236
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,500
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

237
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,361
Why is daddy yelling?

238
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:45,324
He may have turned
a woman into a leprechaun.

239
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:50,938
You can complain about
Irina all you like.

240
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:52,608
I think she's nice.

241
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:55,626
Please. Your opinion of her was set
once you heard the word "Topless."

242
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,380
That reminds me. Did Preston
take any pictures on this trip?

243
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:04,764
Tom, I was there when
she unpacked her suitcase.

244
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:07,369
Preston buy me this.
Preston buy me that.

245
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,923
I am telling you, that woman is...

246
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:12,199
How do you say? A gold digger.

247
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:16,981
If you're right,
she'll move on soon enough.

248
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:23,279
I need to talk to you guys.

249
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,948
I know that look.
He's come to his senses.

250
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:29,520
I proposed to Irina,

251
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,120
and she said yes.

252
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:33,456
I don't know that look at all.

253
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:35,791
You proposed?

254
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,419
But you've only known
each other for a few months.

255
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,586
But she's the one. I know it.

256
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:44,271
Honey.

257
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:46,635
Wake up.

258
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,636
What's that mean?

259
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,327
Your mother's just concerned

260
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,601
that Irina might be with
you for the wrong reasons.

261
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,570
Like your college fund.
Why'd you tell her about that?

262
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:02,546
- You must really think I'm an idiot.
- I think you're young.

263
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:05,988
And I'm sorry.
Sometimes young is idiot-adjacent.

264
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,241
You don't approve?

265
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,955
Fine. I can live with that.

266
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:15,372
But I want Nana's ring.

267
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:19,415
You want to buy that woman boots,
I can't stop you,

268
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,587
but she is not getting
my grandmother's ring.

269
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,341
Nana promised I could have that ring
when I got married. You don't get a say.

270
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,805
You're making a mistake.

271
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,655
Maybe the mistake
I made was coming home.

272
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:43,484
God, your friend owns this place?
It's pretty swank.

273
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,445
Yeah, we used to call it
"The house that bulimia built."

274
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:50,324
I could have never been a model.
I like food too much.

275
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,951
Yeah, that's why.

276
00:15:57,113 --> 00:16:01,117
- Can somebody get me a coffee later?
- Holy crap. Is that Heidi Klum?

277
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,175
- Do you wanna meet her?
- Get out.

278
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,386
Sure. She's an old friend.

279
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:11,999
Come on.

280
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,101
Hi. It's me, Gaby.

281
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,938
Gabrielle Marquez.

282
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,360
I remember you. It's hard to forget
someone who taped toilet paper

283
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:27,736
to the bottom of my Manolo Blahniks and
laughed when I walked down the runway.

284
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,263
That was quite
the practical joker back then.

285
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,788
Anyway, this is my friend,
Angie Bolen, from Fairview.

286
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,496
Practical joke, my ass. Because of you,
I didn't get to be on the cover

287
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:45,212
of "Sports illustrated." So screw you,
screw your friend and screw Fairview.

288
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,045
She seems nice.

289
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:59,977
Hello, gorgeous!

290
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,374
Hi. This is my neighbor Angie.

291
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,732
Nice cheekbones.

292
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,794
Now what the hell is up with that snotty
niece of yours? Don't get me wrong...

293
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:12,865
She's gifted and she's got the look...
but that attitude!

294
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,405
Tell me about it.
Do you have any idea where she is?

295
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:18,913
- She's not in her apartment.
- Your niece walked off a shoot.

296
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,416
Her boyfriend, Broody McFine Ass
showed up, told her

297
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,029
that he had relatives in town they could
stay with. Short story shorter...

298
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:28,896
I don't know where she went
and don't care.

299
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:32,613
You have relatives in New York?

300
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:34,607
Only one.

301
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:40,524
<i>Who's there?</i>

302
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:41,791
It's me, ma.

303
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:08,322
What?

304
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,819
I finally get to meet my grandson
for the first time,

305
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:14,093
and now you're telling me
that he has to go?

306
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,012
- You know it is not safe here, ma.
- Here's what I know...

307
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,039
Every night, for the past 18 years,

308
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:22,796
I was the only one at this table.

309
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,402
One plate, one cup,

310
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:26,939
one chair.

311
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,191
And then, someone knocks on my door,

312
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:31,743
and they sit right there.

313
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,717
And he calls me "Grandma."

314
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:37,324
I could have looked at him
till my eyes dried up.

315
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,340
And now you show up,
and you tell me it's not safe.

316
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:42,663
Why? The feds don't care about him.

317
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,213
It's not the feds I'm worried about.

318
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,254
So that's why you want
to take him away. Patrick Logan?

319
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,891
If my kid shows up,
he's a direct link to me.

320
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:56,223
- That's how he'll find me.
- That was 18 years ago.

321
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,659
Patrick Logan does not
care about you,

322
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:01,976
and he sure as hell
does not care about my grandson!

323
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,060
Ma, please.

324
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,436
I'll tell Danny you were here.

325
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,140
Robin the stripper?

326
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:23,746
You had sex

327
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,325
- with Robin the stripper?
- Holy Chaz Bono.

328
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:28,167
Was that the first time you ever...

329
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,417
Yes.

330
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,819
And Robin's at her cousin's wedding,

331
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:34,648
so I only have a couple of days
to figure this out.

332
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:36,008
Am I gay now?

333
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:39,470
Did you enjoy it?

334
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,869
I don't know. It was different.

335
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,850
I mean, we started kissing,
and then we...

336
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,269
No details necessary.

337
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:51,111
Katherine, you're not gay.

338
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:55,088
As much as you think you can switch
your entree from meat to fish,

339
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:57,446
it doesn't work that way.
This is not a choice.

340
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,699
But how could this have happened
if I'm not gay?

341
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:04,536
Look, I was with women
all through my 20s...

342
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,645
Any excuse to drag that out.

343
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,166
But it always felt weird.

344
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,044
Then when I slept with a man,
I knew that was it.

345
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,046
Then a thousand men later
he found me.

346
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,716
My point is,

347
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:19,927
if it didn't feel quite right to you,
chances are it's just a onetime thing.

348
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,058
Maybe you're right.

349
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,972
We were both pretty drunk.

350
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:27,893
If you're not sure, take sex out of it.
Get to know Robin.

351
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:31,814
It's a little late to start dating.
We already live together.

352
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:33,633
That is fast.

353
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,567
Maybe yo are a lesbian.

354
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:42,563
And in the short time he's been here,
Sam has proved himself invaluable.

355
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,253
So I would like you all to
give your support

356
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,220
to our new vice president.

357
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:51,139
Thank you.
This is a great company, but I think

358
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:54,086
we can make it even better.
Now I've got a lot of great...

359
00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:00,475
Sorry. I was just,
showing my support.

360
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:01,999
Carry on.

361
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,096
Is that beer?

362
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,247
Just cause you can't have
a liquid lunch,

363
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:09,114
doesn't mean the rest of us
have to suffer.

364
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,733
It's okay. It's okay. I've got this.

365
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:17,568
- Why don't we get you some coffee?
- Why don't we not?

366
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,818
Besides,

367
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:21,572
I believe everybody
is waiting to hear

368
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,308
How you're gonna sprinkle
your magic fairy dust

369
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:26,285
and whip this company into shape.

370
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,214
- Am I right?
- You need to go now.

371
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:29,981
Get your hands off me!

372
00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:36,837
Sam, are you okay?

373
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:40,515
I'm fine.

374
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:44,553
But if you don't mind, I think
I'll take the rest of the day off.

375
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,369
See? Told you he was a slacker.

376
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:58,775
Lynette, what can I do for you?

377
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:03,906
My son came home from Europe and
is engaged to a beautiful Russian girl.

378
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,116
- Congratulations.
- I hate her.

379
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,125
Anyway,
this is my grandmother's ring,

380
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:12,942
And Preston wants to give it to her.

381
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:15,959
- She's very lucky.
- She's not getting this...

382
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,421
Because you're gonna
find me a cheap copy.

383
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,507
I can try, but she's probably
gonna know the difference.

384
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,861
I'm counting on it.

385
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:28,616
Irina is quite the opportunist.
Five seconds after she gets it,

386
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,685
she'll have that piece
of glass appraised,

387
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:33,894
and when she finds out
my son has given her a... fake,

388
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,314
I'm betting that little Russian parasite
will be looking for a new host body.

389
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:40,525
But when your son finds out,
isn't he gonna be mad?

390
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:45,461
That's why I keep having kids, Jimmy,
To replace the ones who hate me.

391
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:48,572
MJ's asleep.

392
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:51,746
Are you coming to bed?

393
00:22:53,987 --> 00:22:55,037
I miss you.

394
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:58,568
What, you...
need somebody to do your hair?

395
00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:01,035
You know, us, sensitive men,
are good at that.

396
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,147
Please don't pout.

397
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:06,638
You are all man.

398
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:10,035
You're one of the strongest,
most macho men I know.

399
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:12,215
Now come upstairs.

400
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,980
I don't have to come upstairs
to show you that.

401
00:23:18,672 --> 00:23:19,940
What are you doing?

402
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,617
I can show you
how macho I am right here.

403
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,945
Don't you think our bed
is a bit more comfortable?

404
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:27,101
Beds are for wimps.

405
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,074
That was MJ's lunch.

406
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,623
Now I'm getting rid of this T-shirt.

407
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,040
- What is this made of?
- Here. Let me take it off.

408
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:39,251
I'm ripping it.

409
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,628
You don't have anything to prove.

410
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,397
Where are the scissors?
I just wanna make little starter cut.

411
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:47,384
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I like it rough.

412
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:50,429
I'm glad that you're having fun,

413
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,478
but my back is hurting,
so let me get on top.

414
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,600
- I'm on top.
- Serously, Mike!

415
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,358
I'm on a salt shaker.

416
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:01,210
Sweetie. Are you okay?

417
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:04,401
No, not really.

418
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:06,001
Honestly,

419
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:09,740
if I had known that you were gonna
get this upset about Katherine...

420
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,150
It's not about Katherine. It's you.

421
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,786
And it's not even really
about you. It's me.

422
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:17,581
Okay, just how hard
did you hit your head?

423
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,167
The loan.

424
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:22,169
Susan, you paid off my loan.

425
00:24:24,318 --> 00:24:25,809
Well, isn't that a little...

426
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:29,009
1956 of you?

427
00:24:30,747 --> 00:24:31,847
I grew up...

428
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:35,614
watching a man
who didn't provide for his family,

429
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:39,905
and I always swore
that was one thing I was gonna do.

430
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:42,898
I'll never be rich,

431
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,697
I'll never be famous,

432
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,800
But I can

433
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:49,154
be a guy
who takes care of his family.

434
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,325
In that case,

435
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:57,117
I will cancel the check tomorrow,

436
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:01,375
and you can pay
the loan off by yourself.

437
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:03,143
Thank you.

438
00:25:05,368 --> 00:25:08,035
You know that 1956 thing?

439
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:11,384
It's kinda sexy.

440
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:13,248
Really?

441
00:25:19,578 --> 00:25:22,640
Ana, this is my 17th message.
You might as well pick up the phone,

442
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:25,023
because I'm not leaving New York
until I see you.

443
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:28,777
Tell me.
What exactly are you planning to do?

444
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,650
Find Ana, cut the purse strings,

445
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:33,619
destroy her hopes and dreams
and catch a Broadway show.

446
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:42,997
Angie, you met Luke,

447
00:25:43,164 --> 00:25:46,253
and of course you recognize
the beautiful Paulina Porizkova.

448
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,879
She and I go way back.

449
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,840
How have you been? Give me a hug.

450
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:51,716
Why?

451
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,635
What's wrong?

452
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,012
You treated me like dirt,
and now you want a hug?

453
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,000
What are you talking about?

454
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:02,644
You remember all the fun we had doing
that photo shoot on the beach in Brazil.

455
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,830
What I remember is getting you that job
when you were just starting out

456
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,579
and then freezing on the sand for
three hours while you bitched

457
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:11,244
because they couldn't find
the exact right shade of lipstick

458
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:13,093
that would make you look pretty.

459
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:16,785
I see you still haven't found it.

460
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:23,832
You know... I really don't think I need
to meet any more of your friends.

461
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,690
I'm gonna go call Nick.

462
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,588
Can you believe Paulina?
What was that about?

463
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:31,715
You're kidding, right?

464
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:35,927
Okay, maybe I threw
a little attitude once in a while.

465
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,263
You didn't throw it, honey.
You heaved it.

466
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:42,058
Come on. I was no worse
than a lot of other girls.

467
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,872
No, sweetie, you were
the Queen Bitch Diva...

468
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,223
Insulting photographers,
upsetting booking agents.

469
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,358
That's why your career
went down in flames.

470
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:54,011
No. My career ended
because I decided to marry Carlos.

471
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:56,672
You remember.
I called you the night he proposed.

472
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:59,339
And I told you to grab
that brass ring.

473
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:02,454
Because I knew it was over for you,

474
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:05,081
and you did, too,

475
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:07,834
or else you never would have left.

476
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:22,967
Excuse me?

477
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,436
I think I'm in the wrong place.
Does Sam Allen live here?

478
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:28,647
That one. But he's not here.

479
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,021
Then I guess I'll just,
leave these on his porch.

480
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:35,788
If you want the dogs to eat it.
Put it inside. It's unlocked.

481
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:22,742
What are you doing
with a picture of Rex?

482
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:27,372
I'm waiting.

483
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:29,916
He was my father.

484
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:32,752
What?

485
00:28:33,318 --> 00:28:36,840
This is not how I wanted you
to find out. I am so sorry.

486
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:45,431
Bree, let me explain.

487
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:52,133
Irina really loved the ring, mom.

488
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,901
That's why she wanted to go
right to a jeweler, to get it sized.

489
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,485
- Good.
- I know I sprang this on you but,

490
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:00,528
once you get to know her,
you'll see what I see in her.

491
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:04,034
I am looking forward to when
we both see the same thing.

492
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:07,717
Hello, everyone.

493
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:15,086
You hungry? Mom made lentil soup.
I told her it was your favorite.

494
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,203
- Your mother's full of thoughts.
- In english, we say "thoughtful."

495
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,259
You're not wearing your ring.

496
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,730
Gee...

497
00:29:23,282 --> 00:29:25,055
I hope there's not a problem.

498
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:28,830
I am all day thinking
about this ring.

499
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,102
I do not want it.

500
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:35,732
But... Preston said you loved it.

501
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,027
I do, but,

502
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:39,736
it is too precious.

503
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,781
This ring has been
in your family for generations,

504
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,034
and for you to give it to woman
you don't know, it feels wrong.

505
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,455
Save it for Penny.

506
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:54,584
What a classy thing to do.
Thank you, Irina.

507
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:57,003
You can buy me another ring.

508
00:29:57,346 --> 00:30:01,346
You sure? Nana's ring is worth
a lot more than anything I can afford.

509
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,178
I know exactly how much it is worth.

510
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:08,056
But I want your mother to know

511
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,090
I am full of thougs, too.

512
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,997
So... let's eat.

513
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:20,242
Preston, get her a chair.
Here you go, honey.

514
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:37,078
Two visits in 18 years.
It's gettin' monotonous.

515
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,046
I need to tell you something...

516
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:44,551
About Patrick.

517
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:48,336
This again?

518
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,090
Fine.

519
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:55,437
What about the great
and powerful Patrick Logan?

520
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,836
First you have to promise
you won't ever tell Danny.

521
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:03,862
There you are!

522
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,030
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Wait...

523
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,881
Just give me five minutes.
If you don't like what I have to say,

524
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:11,868
- then you can tell me to go to hell.
- Two minutes.

525
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:13,585
I'll meet you inside.

526
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:19,794
Before you start, I know you sent me to
New York just to get me away from Danny.

527
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,839
True. I begged Luke to take you
and he did me a favor.

528
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,792
- I knew it.
- But it turns out

529
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,969
I was doing him a favor, too, because
he thinks you're really talented.

530
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,263
- He said that?
- He also thinks

531
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,697
you're a petulant, whiny,
spoiled brat, just like I was,

532
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:36,923
and that's gonna kill your career,
just like it killed mine.

533
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,690
- I thought you were successful.
- I was,

534
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:42,692
until everyone was tired
of putting up with my crap.

535
00:31:43,115 --> 00:31:45,862
So I want you to go back to Luke,
apologize and start

536
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,838
acting like a professional.

537
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:50,093
Modeling can be a great ride,

538
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,667
and I don't want you to be
kicked off before it's over,

539
00:31:53,957 --> 00:31:55,007
like I was.

540
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:04,610
Mom, I know you're here for me,
but I'm not goin'.

541
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:06,216
Grandma wants me to stay.

542
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:12,671
I don't.

543
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:17,640
What did you say to her?

544
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:21,189
She didn't have to say anything.
Your mother knows what's best.

545
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,404
But...

546
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:30,323
we have a relationship now.

547
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,410
We're gonna talk
to each other all the time.

548
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,579
Really?

549
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,651
I promise.

550
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:43,483
But as long as you're here,
neither one of us is safe.

551
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,199
Now go pack your stuff.

552
00:33:08,127 --> 00:33:11,243
Do you, by any chance, know who
that woman is, talking to Rose?

553
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,824
That's her daughter Angie.

554
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:14,328
Really?

555
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:17,453
I haven't seen her around here.
Where is she visiting from?

556
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:18,912
Fairview.

557
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:24,131
He's still out there.

558
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,419
You really should talk to him.

559
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:29,345
I have nothing to say.

560
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:31,175
Bree, he's 26.

561
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:33,428
He was born before
you and Rex were married.

562
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,515
Fidelity is not the issue.
Rex had a secret life.

563
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,465
Fine. Be mad at Rex,
not at that young man.

564
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:42,792
- He's innocent.
- He showed up to work for me

565
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:45,599
and didn't tell me that he was
my dead husband's son.

566
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:48,026
What does he want?

567
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,278
There's only one way to find out.

568
00:33:57,282 --> 00:34:00,622
You told me you wanted to explain.
You have two minutes.

569
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,037
My mother and father met at a bar.

570
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:07,709
He was single, so was she.

571
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,590
They had one night together
and then he went away.

572
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:14,672
When she found out
she was pregnant, she called him.

573
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,971
He had just met you
and said he was in love.

574
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:21,935
He offered to support her
financially, but my mom,

575
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,634
who was very proud,

576
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,573
turned him down.

577
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:29,739
But he did visit you.

578
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,334
A few times,

579
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,822
but my mom asked him to stop
because it was too hard on me.

580
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:39,151
- And did you ever see him again?
- Yes.

581
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,519
From right here.

582
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,915
I used to ride my bike over.

583
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:52,446
I'd watch you
and Andrew and Danielle.

584
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:59,054
I wanted to understand why my father
would choose all of you over me...

585
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:03,437
And I did.

586
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:07,985
You were all so perfect.

587
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,709
My mom died six months ago,

588
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:22,036
And that's when I decided
I needed to meet you.

589
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:25,206
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

590
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:27,792
Because I wanted you to like me...

591
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:32,630
And I wasn't sure you would.

592
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:38,777
You look cold.

593
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,098
Why don't you come into the house,

594
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,393
and I'll make you some hot chocolate,
and we can talk?

595
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:05,493
You know, not to
put any pressure on you, but,

596
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,383
I caught the bouquet.

597
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,996
Do we need to talk?

598
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,302
I mean, we haven't since...
it happened.

599
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:21,841
First of all,

600
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,557
you are a wonderful,
beautiful person.

601
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,811
Yowza.

602
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,351
I was drunk.

603
00:36:31,112 --> 00:36:34,817
I didn't even know what I was doing
until I was doing it, And then...

604
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,570
The other night was a mistake,

605
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:40,737
And...

606
00:36:41,328 --> 00:36:42,533
I'm so sorry.

607
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,634
That is...

608
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,382
complete crap.

609
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:53,705
What?

610
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,423
I'm not gonna let you blame
what happened on being drunk.

611
00:36:58,755 --> 00:36:59,805
Okay, then.

612
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,055
You know
what I've been through recently.

613
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:06,843
And maybe I was...

614
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:09,268
trying to forget that with you?

615
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,979
But I am not attracted to women.

616
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,796
So no matter what it was,

617
00:37:16,105 --> 00:37:17,401
it doesn't count.

618
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:26,536
I know how you touched me,

619
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,827
and I...

620
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,521
I saw the look in your eyes
when I touched you.

621
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:34,703
You may deny it now, but,

622
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,461
we connected...

623
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,422
and it counted.

624
00:37:56,718 --> 00:37:57,768
It counted.

625
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:01,143
Thank you.

626
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:13,416
You want an extra pillow?

627
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:17,833
There's empty seats in the back.

628
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:20,908
I'm just gonna go sleep there.

629
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,138
You okay?

630
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:29,891
I'm just tired.

631
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:36,419
You may have picked up
on this trip that

632
00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:38,793
I haven't always been a good person.

633
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,810
And I'm gonna work on that,

634
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:42,403
starting with you.

635
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,489
Did Danny say there were
seats in the back?

636
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:48,740
Come on. Come on.
I'm serious. I'm serious. Look,

637
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:50,411
I know you have a secret.

638
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,713
Carlos and I overheard
you and Nick fighting...

639
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,835
Something about blowing your cover.

640
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,254
Don't worry.
I didn't tell anybody. I just...

641
00:39:01,636 --> 00:39:03,216
I just want you to know that...

642
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,770
I've carried around
a lot of secrets,

643
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:10,890
and I know how lonely it can feel.

644
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,537
So if you ever need a friend...

645
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:33,746
When I was 18,
I wanted to save the planet.

646
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:38,452
I organized protests against
logging companies, big oil,

647
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,990
auto plants.

648
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:43,798
But then I got involved
with a bad guy...

649
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:45,925
A really bad guy.

650
00:39:46,498 --> 00:39:49,598
He convinced me
that we had to get more aggressive.

651
00:39:52,404 --> 00:39:53,854
Long story short...

652
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,110
Someone got killed.

653
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:05,154
So... this bad guy...

654
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:08,435
You're not talking
about Nick, are you?

655
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:12,034
He's the one who helped me
run away from the psycho.

656
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,414
So who's the psycho?

657
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,980
Danny's father.

658
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,466
<i>It's not always easy</i>

659
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,969
<i>to see someone's true colors.</i>

660
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:32,994
<i>Sometimes,</i>

661
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:35,971
<i>you must look beneath
the masculine veneer</i>

662
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:38,653
<i>to find that fragile ego.</i>

663
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:43,416
<i>You must ignore
the sparkle of the jewel</i>

664
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:47,306
<i>to know you're looking at a fake.</i>

665
00:40:49,672 --> 00:40:52,666
<i>You must bring the truth
out of the shadows</i>

666
00:40:54,257 --> 00:40:56,738
<i>to see the beauty of its smile.</i>

667
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,756
<i>Yes, people hide their
true nature from us,</i>

668
00:41:01,923 --> 00:41:03,100
<i>every day,</i>

669
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:04,432
<i>And sadly,</i>

670
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,599
<i>we only find out</i>

671
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,132
<i>when it's too late.</i>

672
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:11,633
It's Iris Beckley.

673
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:14,686
I live next to Rose De Luca.

674
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:19,511
You told me to give you a ring
if I ever saw Rose's daughter.

675
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:25,445
I'll tell you where she lives
when I get my $1,000.
