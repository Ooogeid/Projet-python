<i>Previously</i> on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,852
<i>Carlos' niece arrived.</i>

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,507
We want you to be part of this family,
but you will obey our rules.

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,608
<i>Lynette and Tom got big news.</i>

5
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:12,387
- We're gonna have another baby.
- Twins.

6
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,719
You'd actually send
your wife to prison?

7
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:16,786
My wife... no.
My ex-wife...

8
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,644
- you bet.
- <i>Orson resorted to blackmail.</i>

9
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,689
I think you're the most fascinating
woman that I have ever met.

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,649
<i>And Karl made his move.</i>

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,568
<i>Katherine's marriage to Mike...</i>

12
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,321
That woman... tell
her I had to go. It's an emergency.

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,989
<i>... was put on hold.</i>

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,159
You guys are in danger. Get out
of that car. Get away from Dave.

15
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:38,163
<i>And when the dust settled,
wedding bells rang were ringing</i>

16
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:39,927
<i>for someone.</i>

17
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:47,656
<i>The veil was made
from the finest silk.</i>

18
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:53,923
<i>The garter was trimmed
with handmade lace.</i>

19
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:59,476
<i>The shoes were designed
by the top couturier in Milan.</i>

20
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:04,516
<i>You see,
the bride wanted only the best</i>

21
00:01:04,683 --> 00:01:06,133
<i>for her wedding day</i>

22
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,958
<i>because she was about to marry
the best man in the world...</i>

23
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,616
<i>For the second time.</i>

24
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:17,619
- How do you feel?
- Like the worst person in the world.

25
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:19,621
Don't do this to yourself.

26
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,956
Katherine is never gonna
forgive me for this.

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,999
This is your day.

28
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,003
You and Mike were meant
to be together.

29
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:29,964
Wish me luck.

30
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:37,448
Then by the power vested in me,

31
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:39,391
I now pronounce you

32
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:41,685
husband and wife.

33
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:43,813
You may kiss the bride.

34
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,813
<i>Yes, the bride wanted
the best wedding money could buy.</i>

35
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:10,138
<i>But as she left the altar,
it suddenly occurred to her...</i>

36
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:15,922
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

37
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:19,879
<i>She should've spent more
on security.</i>

00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:37,179
<i>It's not hard
to find sin in the suburbs.</i>

41
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:40,283
<i>Just look behind closed doors.</i>

42
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:44,753
<i>That's where you'll find your neighbors
cheating on their taxes...</i>

43
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,664
<i>And drinking too much vodka...</i>

44
00:02:51,177 --> 00:02:54,027
<i>And stealing
their father's magazines.</i>

45
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:58,508
<i>Yes, the suburbs are filled
with sinners,</i>

46
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,472
<i>some of who occasionally...</i>

47
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,539
<i>repent.</i>

48
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:04,511
We can't do this.

49
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:05,894
It's adultery.

50
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:08,213
Luckily, we're both adults.

51
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,982
Stop! I'm married.

52
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:14,238
Yes, to a man
who's blackmailing you.

53
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:18,114
Making love to your lawyer wouldn't
be a nifty way to get back at him?

54
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,371
What now?

55
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:28,770
If I'm gonna break a commandment,
I don't want it to be for a quickie.

56
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:31,512
Who said quickie?
I've got 40 minutes before my 10:00.

57
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,005
And thou shalt get sweaty.

58
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:37,169
I wanna do this. I do.
But not here.

59
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:38,760
I need to feel special.

60
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,720
But you are special.

61
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,765
Are you saying you've
never made love on this couch?

62
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,733
Not a special woman.

63
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,702
I get it.

64
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:53,316
I want this to be nice for you.
I'll find us a hotel.

65
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:55,865
Call me later when you've
set something up.

66
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,032
Done.

67
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:02,027
And just so we're clear,
this visit was not billable.

68
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:08,058
Morning. I'm late for school.
I don't have time for breakfast.

69
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:09,821
At least take a muffin.

70
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,099
Thank you, uncle Carlos.

71
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,462
Kind of warm for a sweatshirt,
isn't it?

72
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,918
It gets really cold
in the classroom.

73
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,679
Stop.

74
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:22,761
Lift it up.

75
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,422
Girls who spend an hour on makeup
do not wear baggy sweatshirts.

76
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:28,589
Lift it.

77
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:35,582
That oughta heat up the classroom.

78
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,153
- Go and change.
- What is your problem?

79
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,322
All the girls in my class
dress like this.

80
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,654
That's why your school nurse
is an obstetrician.

81
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:46,744
- Wear something else.
- Fine. I'll borrow one of your tops.

82
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,754
It might be exciting for it to go
someplace besides the supermarket.

83
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:55,734
Snap!

84
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:57,881
You I can hit.

85
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:04,178
Do you see
what I have to put up with?

86
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:05,805
It was just a shirt.

87
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,164
And when she came home past
curfew, it was just 40 minutes.

88
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:12,467
And when she took money
from my purse, it was just $5.

89
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:16,087
- Why do you make excuses for her?
- She's had a sad life.

90
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,359
Her mom's in jail.
Her dad walked out.

91
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:21,250
She's one dead dog
away from a country song.

92
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:22,567
I don't care.

93
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:26,701
Maybe she would calm down
if she felt a little more secure here.

94
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:28,507
I'm not signing those papers.

95
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:32,009
- We need to be her legal guardians.
- And look after her for two years?

96
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,169
Until I see a change in her behavior,
I'm keeping all my options open.

97
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:38,880
Is this better?

98
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,294
Yes. Very nice. Thank you.

99
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,005
Stop.

100
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,208
What do I smell?

101
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,654
Despair. Mortality.

102
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:12,163
Paralyzing fear.

103
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,042
- I thought it was waffles.
- Do you realize

104
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,921
that when these twins finish
high school, I'll be in my 60s?

105
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:23,918
No, you'll be in your...

106
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:28,714
At their graduation,
I will be the crazy old lady

107
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:30,510
with oatmeal on her chin.

108
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:34,469
I know this wasn't planned,
but we can do this.

109
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,063
We had a lot of fun
raising the first four kids.

110
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:38,999
But we were done.

111
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,627
We were across the finish line.

112
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,677
No more diapers.

113
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:47,073
No more strained carrots. No
more reading stupid "goodnight, moon"!

114
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,860
And with Preston going to Europe,
we even had one moving out!

115
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,446
We will never be done

116
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:57,779
if we birth two
every time one moves out!

117
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,302
That's just math!

118
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,562
Eight and half months to go.

119
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,598
Are you all right?

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,352
You know what's funny?

121
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,067
I was never able
to picture us old together,

122
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:21,334
sitting on the porch, gray hair.

123
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,098
I tried,

124
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:25,486
But I could never see it.

125
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:28,197
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,358
- You don't have to...
- Mike, please.

127
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,997
I don't need
another reminder of you.

128
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:48,384
So... How'd it go? How was she?

129
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,670
She was... okay.

130
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:54,838
What does that mean?
Did you tell her everything?

131
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:56,988
Did you tell her
we're getting married?

132
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:59,288
I think she's trying
to take the high road.

133
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:02,705
The high road? As in,
"I wish you and Susan the best"?

134
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,382
Or the high road as in,
"when I cut susan's brake line,

135
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:07,153
she'll careen off the high road"?

136
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,074
She knows it's over,
and she's dealing with it.

137
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:15,782
That must have been
really hard for you.

138
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:17,789
It was.

139
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:21,459
But now that she knows, it'll be
easier when you talk to her.

140
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,284
Me talk to her?

141
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:25,874
Why? Why?

142
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,005
You're the one who was
dating her, I just...

143
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:30,825
I don't...

144
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:32,595
I think we're good now.

145
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:36,440
You're gonna have
to deal with her at some point.

146
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,607
Fine. Yes.

147
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:39,024
I will. I will.

148
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,081
Just not today,
'cause Julie's coming home

149
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:44,357
and, you know,
I wanna get her settled in.

150
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:48,862
- So... what about tomorrow?
- That's not good either,

151
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,494
cause Julia and I are gonna
pick out my wedding dress.

152
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,961
You live right across the street from
her. You can't avoid her for 50 years.

153
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:56,397
Not 50.

154
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:59,784
Just till
she's too old to throw things.

155
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,817
Don't worry about it.

156
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:06,754
I think Katherine's
really gonna surprise you.

157
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:28,548
All of the windows are
triple pane energy efficient.

158
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:31,409
And the hardwood floors were
completely redone recently.

159
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:32,726
Black walnut.

160
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,266
It's nice.

161
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,119
Do you have any questions for me?

162
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,497
- You pretty much got it covered.
- Really?

163
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,832
Check me out!

164
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,915
I'm new at this. I just got
my broker's license last week.

165
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:49,904
Congratulations.

166
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,442
It's a pretty nice house
for your first listing.

167
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,948
I got really lucky. The woman
who handled the properties

168
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:57,583
in the neighborhood, she slammed
her car into a pole and got

169
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,401
and got fried by a power line.

170
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:01,395
Like I said, congrats.

171
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,478
Mrs. Bolen's been awfully quiet.

172
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,993
- What do you think?
- Me?

173
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:10,234
- I'm thinking you're full of crap.
- I'm sorry?

174
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:14,274
The fact that we can afford this place
says to me something is wrong with it.

175
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,049
So, start talkin'.

176
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,201
Mold? Termites? Leaky roof?

177
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:21,782
Honestly, I have told you
everything that I know.

178
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:24,737
Sure, you could play it like that.

179
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,037
But if we do buy this place

180
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:29,033
and it turns into a money pit,

181
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,495
I'm gonna need to
take my anger out on someone.

182
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,972
Like maybe the realtor

183
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:37,757
who made a big deal out of telling us
he lives right across the street?

184
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:43,063
I don't know that this
is actually considered a flaw,

185
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,750
but a while ago,

186
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,042
the lady who was living here,

187
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,955
she was apparently going
through kind of a tough time, and

188
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:52,605
long story short,
she committed suicide.

189
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:56,994
Shot herself...

190
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,075
In the head.

191
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:03,371
In this room.

192
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,345
That's it?

193
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:12,768
We'll take it.

194
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,852
Really? That is so...

195
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,987
I'll just get the paperwork.

196
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,686
It's a nice place.

197
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,188
I think we could be happy here.

198
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,731
Right, Danny?

199
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,241
Why are you asking me?

200
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,080
I didn't want to move here.

201
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,759
Honey.

202
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,696
Whose fault was that?

203
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:47,546
<i>Look at you!</i>

204
00:11:59,431 --> 00:12:01,762
- Angie, these are incredible.
- What do you call 'em?

205
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,272
Pizzelles. Come on, eat up.
I made six dozen.

206
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,392
My grandmother's recipes
were for 30 people.

207
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,978
Trust me, she'd fatten
you four up in a week.

208
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,511
These go straight to your ass.

209
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:16,726
I'm sorry.
Do you guys not say "ass"?

210
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:19,567
Sure, we do.
Come on, Bree. Show her.

211
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,405
Susan tells me that your
son is about to start college.

212
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:28,831
We're just dealing with paperwork,
but he should be startin' next week.

213
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,877
I thought he was already in class.
He asked Julie to tutor him in math.

214
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,171
Really?

215
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:38,591
- That must be Katherine.
- I'll get it.

216
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:44,065
- You didn't say Katherine was coming.
- She's just dropping something off.

217
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:47,455
What's the matter? You've seen
her since this Mike thing.

218
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:48,628
Sorta.

219
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,604
Your voice just got very high.
You have talked to her, haven't you?

220
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,854
I'm...

221
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:56,692
going to. I've just been so busy
with all the wedding plans.

222
00:12:57,456 --> 00:12:59,256
I wouldn't open with that.

223
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:04,992
I'm just dropping off the menu
for the Davenport anniversary party.

224
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,282
You finished that? Already?
It's three months away.

225
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:12,002
I have a lot of free time
on my hands these days.

226
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:19,924
How are you doing?

227
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,594
Haven't seen you in a while.

228
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:25,960
I've been...

229
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,599
using the back door a lot more
lately.

230
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,103
Your buttons...

231
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:39,063
I don't know
where my head is anymore.

232
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,160
Was it just me or was that
the most awkward moment ever?

233
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:53,916
You bet your sweet ass it was.

234
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,503
Hon, could you get me
a glass of water, please?

235
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:05,073
- You got it.
- Thanks.

236
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,309
- It's our first.
- Yeah, I got that.

237
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,202
How about you?

238
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,689
Four at home, two on the way.

239
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:19,859
Big family.
You're so blessed.

240
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:25,398
I just can't imagine anything
better than being a mommy.

241
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,242
Really?

242
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,582
I mean, I know it's a lot of work,

243
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:33,873
but luckily my husband
plans to be really hands-on.

244
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,514
That's not gonna happen.

245
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:39,348
Pardon?

246
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:42,208
He'll be there at first,
maybe even change a diaper or two

247
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,100
until the novelty wears off.
But those 4:00 a.m. feedin

248
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,298
he said he'd help out with?
Forget it.

249
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,264
You don't know my Johnny.
He's different.

250
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:52,626
Does he have boobs?

251
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,365
Then you're the only bar in town.

252
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:58,576
That baby can
scream into a bullhorn,

253
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:00,144
and Johnny won budge.

254
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:04,734
Thanks.

255
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:06,942
I'm not done.

256
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,110
You see this?

257
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,160
You'll never wear a bikini again.

258
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:14,371
But you've had four kids,
and you look good.

259
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,358
You haven't seen me naked.

260
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:19,238
My stomach looks like
spanish stucco.

261
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:22,169
And my breasts resemble two
balloons you'd find behind the couch

262
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,631
a week after the party.

263
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:28,052
Most women say this is the
greatest experience of their life.

264
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,519
Most women are liars.

265
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,524
My mother was liar,
and her mother was a liar,

266
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:37,003
and your mother is a liar. It's
a lie every generation tells the next

267
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,855
- so they can get grandchildren.
- Please stop talking to me.

268
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:43,315
You need to hear this.
You have to be prepared.

269
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:46,929
Your children will hit you
and steal from your purse.

270
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:50,097
Your husband will begin to buy
your birthday presents at the car wash.

271
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:52,773
And the kicker...
for the rest of your life,

272
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:56,125
there will be so many moments
when you feel lonely,

273
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:59,286
but you will never be alone.

274
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,612
They were out of water.
Is juice okay?

275
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,199
Hormones. Get used to it.

276
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:18,399
I cannot believe
we are finally going to do this.

277
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:21,564
You're not an easy woman
to pin down,

278
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:24,335
but I sure am going to enjoy trying.

279
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:33,492
- What?
- This is not what I was expecting.

280
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,204
I think I look pretty good
for my age.

281
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:39,661
Not you, Karl. The room.

282
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:42,209
It's filthy and hideous.

283
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,125
I took you to a nice hotel,
last week and we had to leave

284
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,087
cause you saw someone you knew.

285
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:50,050
- Who we gonna run into here?
- Certainly not a cleaning lady.

286
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:52,617
So it's a little dusty.

287
00:16:52,787 --> 00:16:55,347
But trust me, once I get started,
you'll never even notice.

288
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:58,392
- My God, those sheets!
- What's wrong with them?

289
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:02,313
They're discolored, threadbare
and reek of industrial bleach.

290
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,535
Give me five minutes,
they'll reek of us.

291
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:07,602
I'm not gonna lie
on that revolting sheet,

292
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,795
wondering how many junkies
have died on it.

293
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,212
What do you want me to do about it?

294
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,487
Egyptian cotton!

295
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,903
- These are pretty, aren't they?
- Great. Love 'em. Let's go.

296
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,584
It doesn't help when you say
that about every single set.

297
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:24,918
An hour ago, I was half-naked.

298
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:28,086
Now I'm sheet shopping.
Forgive me if I'm an easy sell.

299
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:30,633
I'm just not sure this color
will match the carpet.

300
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,183
Get 'em in blue.
I'll tell you what they'll match then.

301
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,136
Fine. I'll take these.

302
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,474
Now we just need to stop
for some flowers.

303
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,151
Flowers?

304
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:42,436
I just want this affair to be nice.

305
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:47,939
You know, you don't want
this affair to be nice.

306
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:49,652
You don't want it at all.

307
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:52,071
Don't be silly.
Of course I do.

308
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:54,009
You may think you do,

309
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:56,151
but I've been chasing you
for two weeks,

310
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:58,912
and you've down nothing
but throw up roadblocks.

311
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,279
"Not tonight."

312
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,201
"Not this hotel."
"Not those sheets."

313
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:06,746
If you think I've been
leading you on, you're wrong.

314
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:09,797
It's not your fault.
It's just who you are.

315
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:13,759
A good girl who never breaks the rules
no matter how miserable it makes her.

316
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:17,254
I thought a little Karl time
might brighten your day.

317
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:20,606
But there's not much I can
do for someone who would rather be good

318
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:21,825
than happy.

319
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:33,927
Can I help you?

320
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:36,894
I've got a delivery for Susan Mayer,
but she's not home.

321
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:38,961
Do you mind signing for her?

322
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,891
That must be her gown.

323
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,583
Of course I'll take it.

324
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:49,870
We do things like this all the time.

325
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:53,258
In fact, just last month,
she took in something of mine.

326
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,188
Oh, God.

327
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,065
Katherine, it's me.

328
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:21,866
I've just come over to pick up my...

329
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,957
Hello, Susan.

330
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:31,697
- I did not see that coming.
- It's just so beautiful.

331
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,638
I couldn't resist.

332
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,367
Thank you for

333
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:40,926
taking such good care of it.

334
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:44,786
But I should probably go, so...

335
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,424
if you just wanna slip it off and...

336
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,064
Wait. I have to check on my sauce.

337
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,211
Sauce?

338
00:19:58,108 --> 00:19:59,573
Doesn't that smell good?

339
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,394
It smells done.

340
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,331
Why don't you step away
from the pot?

341
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,042
No. The secret is
you have to keep stirring.

342
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:14,922
You know,

343
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:18,967
I really love this fabric.
It feels so expensive.

344
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:21,038
It is.

345
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:24,798
That's why they had it
all protected with that

346
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:27,851
acid-free tissue paper
and plastic garment bag.

347
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,978
Maybe...

348
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,858
I should give you some
of this sauce to take to Mike.

349
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:38,293
He used to love my sauce.

350
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:40,426
Of course,

351
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,950
he used to love me, too.

352
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:50,143
Okay, enough with the sauce.
I want my dress back, now.

353
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,051
Of course. I'm sorry.
Can you please unzip me?

354
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:11,344
It really is a beautiful dress.

355
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,539
Katherine was actually
wearing the dress?

356
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:20,545
Stop blocking my light.
Keep blotting.

357
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,089
- Mom, relax. We got all the sauce.
- No, I still see flecks of red.

358
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:27,380
It's your third wedding. An all-white
dress is gonna be a stretch anyway.

359
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:31,197
Do me a favor. Save the
"my mom's a slut" jokes for the toast.

360
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:33,334
You think I should
go talk to her again?

361
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,501
What? Why?

362
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,859
She's obviously hurting
more than I thought.

363
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,432
Excuse me, she kidnapped
my wedding dress

364
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,093
and held a pot of sauce to its head!
How could you possibly defend her?

365
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,179
I'm not defending her. I'm just
a little concerned. Aren't you?

366
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:47,873
No! I mean...

367
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,967
Yes, I was.

368
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:53,186
But at this point,
I'm a little sick of her.

369
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,110
Do you know that when I told
people that I'm getting married,

370
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:58,338
No one says congratulations.
They all say,

371
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:01,015
"Oh, my god. Is Katherine okay?
How's Katherine?"

372
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:03,928
Does no one remember
that you were with me first?

373
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:07,409
She stole my leftovers.
Does nobody remember that?

374
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,745
Did she just refer to me
as leftovers?

375
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:12,921
My point is that I didn't
do anything wrong.

376
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:15,172
You and I have a child,

377
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,735
And I am just tired
of feeling like the other woman.

378
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:25,260
Scary part is, of the two women
you could marry, that's the stable one.

379
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:32,017
Thanks for taking me to the store.
I promised Roy I'd make him meatloaf.

380
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,604
I think it's sweet that you found a male
companion at this stage in your life.

381
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:39,145
Roy's no companion.
The man has seen Paris.

382
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,778
That's right.
I'm back in the saddle.

383
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,076
It started one night when Roy asked

384
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:48,585
if my bathtub
was big enough for two...

385
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:51,452
You want me to crash the car?
Cause I will.

386
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:02,214
Hey, aunt Gaby.
Need your car washed?

387
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,410
I'm aunt Gaby now?

388
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,010
Let me guess.
You want something.

389
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,513
Well, there is a party
tomorrow night...

390
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:10,931
Really?!

391
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,787
Okay, you can go.

392
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:22,174
- Seriously?
- Well, if you can make an effort

393
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:24,807
around here,
then I guess I can, too.

394
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:27,041
Just be home by 10:00.

395
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:29,032
Yeah, that's the thing.

396
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:33,787
- The party doesn't start till 11:00.
- What kind of party starts at 11:00?

397
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:37,013
This new dance club is opening
downtown, and it is, like,

398
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,376
the hottest thing ever.
Everybody's going.

399
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:41,475
Not everybody.

400
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,641
It's a school night,
and you know the rules.

401
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:47,008
But thank you for washing the car.

402
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,276
- Well, she's quite the charmer.
- Do you see what I'm dealing with?

403
00:23:56,443 --> 00:23:58,546
Carlos and I basically
took her off the street.

404
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,185
You'd think she'd be grateful.

405
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:03,043
But every day is a battle.
I don't know how to get through to her.

406
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,652
Teenage girls, they're the best
reason for not having kids.

407
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:08,401
Thank god Roy had a vasectomy.

408
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:16,121
So based on the data given
for this population,

409
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,713
and using the standard
deviation formula,

410
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,834
What do you think this variable is?

411
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:24,133
Would you like
to go to a movie sometime?

412
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:30,648
It's not like it would
be a date or anything.

413
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:32,426
We're friends, right?

414
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,403
Friends go to movies all the time.

415
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,570
I don't know if you know that.

416
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:39,144
Did you know that?

417
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:42,568
I did know that.

418
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:47,705
Really?

419
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:50,197
That's great.

420
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,610
Hey, Julie.
Nice to see you again.

421
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,495
Danny, do me a favor and take
the trash out, will ya?

422
00:24:58,203 --> 00:24:59,998
Can I do it a little later?

423
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,615
Yeah, you could, but I think
you're gonna do it right now.

424
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:12,454
- Thanks for doing that.
- Doing what?

425
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:17,349
Not shooting him down.
I know he's probably not your type.

426
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:19,192
No, I like him.

427
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:22,743
- He's nice.
- Well, yeah, yeah, but...

428
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,751
Clearly not in your league.

429
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:32,196
I'm sorry you have
to work late, sweetie.

430
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,626
Don't worry about us.
Everything is fine here.

431
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:36,773
Good night, Ana.

432
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:39,642
Sorry.

433
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,760
Ana paid me $5.

434
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:08,824
Hey, muscles. I need a lift.

435
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:16,548
Hands! Hands! Hands!

436
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,610
Excuse me!

437
00:26:33,777 --> 00:26:36,636
Sorry to interrupt. But can I
have your attention, please?

438
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,597
Hello?

439
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:47,997
Hi. My niece is somewhere
in this building.

440
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:51,750
She's got brown hair,
gold leggings, a cream top...

441
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:53,909
which she took from my closet.

442
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:56,740
So if you could just look around
and point her out...

443
00:27:00,477 --> 00:27:02,601
This is important, okay?
She's only 16.

444
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:06,666
And she came here even though
she knew she wasn't supposed to.

445
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,526
Either you find my niece,

446
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:17,594
or I will call the cops
with their drug-sniffing dogs.

447
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:24,184
<i>Found her over here!</i>

448
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:27,187
- <i>Here she is!</i>
- Stop. Put me down.

449
00:27:28,426 --> 00:27:31,544
Somebody... Get your hands off me.
Let me down.

450
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,860
God, what are you doing?

451
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:37,948
Thank you, everybody.

452
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,869
I told you not to mess with me.

453
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,860
- I cannot keep doing this, Ana.
- Or what?

454
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:01,731
You're gonna throw me out?

455
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Fine.

456
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:07,505
You'd actually be doing me a favor.

457
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:10,224
I can take care of myself.

458
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:13,066
You're 16. How exactly
are you gonna make money?

459
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:17,445
I'm... I'm gonna be a model.

460
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:20,865
A model?

461
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,994
You know, people tell me
that I'm pretty enough.

462
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,414
I will just... I'll go to Paris
or New York, and I'll get discovered.

463
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:30,859
And I will be rich and famous,

464
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:34,296
And no one will ever
tell me what to do again.

465
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:38,074
And you really think it's
that easy to become a model?

466
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,491
It was for you.

467
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:42,198
What, you left home
when you were only 15.

468
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:45,165
I left because I had to.
My stepfather was...

469
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:49,602
not a nice man.
My mother didn't care about me.

470
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:52,267
My father left when I was 3,

471
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,806
and my mother's been in and out
of prison ever since.

472
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,707
- I can beat you at this game.
- This is not a game, Ana!

473
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:02,926
- This is your life.
- You can't scare me, all right?

474
00:29:03,093 --> 00:29:05,856
- And I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
- Don't give me that.

475
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:07,912
We feed you.
We put a roof over your head.

476
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:10,915
And you're also keeping
all your options open.

477
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:16,902
I heard.

478
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,767
Good, you're back.
The girls haven't made a peep.

479
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:51,348
No more options.

480
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:53,208
I am now officially your guardian.

481
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:57,128
So... What?
I'm supposed to hug you now?

482
00:29:57,668 --> 00:29:59,839
No, you're not gonna want to hug me,

483
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,475
Because from here on out,

484
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:03,885
I am gonna be watching you
like a hawk.

485
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,041
I wanna know where you are
going, who you are going with,

486
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:10,172
And when you are coming home.
And I'm gonna keep you

487
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,645
from ruining that life
you are so anxious to start living.

488
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,072
You are so mean.

489
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,200
And I wish...

490
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:23,721
I wish...

491
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,920
someone had been this mean to me
when I was your age.

492
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:45,436
- Look, it's complicated.
- No, it's really simple, Julie.

493
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,720
You only care about yourself.

494
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,337
- Please let me explain!
- Go to hell.

495
00:31:03,716 --> 00:31:05,331
Katherine said you were here.

496
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:07,632
And I thought,
since you were already in church,

497
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,376
we might see the pastor
and schedule some counseling sessions.

498
00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:13,345
I don't need counseling, Orson.
I need a divorce.

499
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:15,359
Don't tell me
we don't need counseling.

500
00:31:15,526 --> 00:31:18,187
You've been sleeping in the guest room
for weeks. It's not right.

501
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:20,731
I agree, and if you had
an ounce of chivalry,

502
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,851
you'd have given me the master.

503
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:28,064
You might think that withholding sex
will make me give up on us.

504
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:30,031
But I can be very patient.

505
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:33,558
You do realize in prison, I went
three whole years without any sex.

506
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,152
No, but thank you
for clearing up a question

507
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,319
I never quite knew how to ask.

508
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:41,657
Eight years ago,

509
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,443
We stood at an altar like this,

510
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,529
And we made a vow before god
to love each other.

511
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:49,711
Do you think I haven't
struggled with this?

512
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:52,802
I've struggled with this in ways
you can't even begin to imagine.

513
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:55,497
Then let me help you.
I can make you happy again.

514
00:31:56,236 --> 00:31:58,452
How? By blackmailing me?

515
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,641
I'm not your wife anymore,
orson. I'm your captive.

516
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,005
Don't you feel any remorse
at all over that?

517
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,739
Of course I do,

518
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,220
But sometimes guilt is a small price
to pay for happiness.

519
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:20,375
There it is.
Baby number one.

520
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,513
It was so worth
cutting class to hear this.

521
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,861
And... There's number two.
Good, strong heartbeats.

522
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,180
Isn't that great, Lynette?

523
00:32:31,592 --> 00:32:32,842
Yeah. Terrific.

524
00:32:36,032 --> 00:32:37,032
I'll...

525
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:40,409
get the nurse,
have her come clean you up.

526
00:32:40,576 --> 00:32:41,576
Thank you.

527
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,110
So what's with you?

528
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:49,884
What?

529
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,162
That was an amazing moment,
and you just sat there like

530
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:54,514
you didn't even care.

531
00:32:58,056 --> 00:32:59,269
I'm just tired.

532
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,591
Look, I know this has been a shock,

533
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:05,009
and I'm trying to give you time,
but it's been three months.

534
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:08,526
When are you gonna start
getting excited about our kids?

535
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:18,364
What?

536
00:33:26,675 --> 00:33:28,131
I don't love them.

537
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:38,016
Please. Don't look at me that way.

538
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,896
If I can't talk to you about this,
then I am in big trouble.

539
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:48,568
You're just upset because...
this wasn't planned.

540
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:51,134
None of them were planned,

541
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:54,616
But I loved each of our kids
the moment I knew they were coming.

542
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:59,145
It's different this time.

543
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:03,479
I don't love these babies.

544
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,274
Stop saying that.

545
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:16,767
When you hold them in your arms,
you will care about these kids

546
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:19,147
just as much as the others.

547
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:47,989
I think I left something
in the car. I'll see you inside.

548
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:59,176
Orson will drink too much today,
like he always does at weddings.

549
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:02,684
He'll be asleep by 9:00.
Meet me at the Shangrila Motel at 9:30.

550
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,523
- And you won't bail on me again?
- I booked the room last night.

551
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,808
I've already changed the sheets
and cleaned the bathroom. Kiss me.

552
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,229
What happened to the good girl?

553
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:20,696
She decided guilt's a small price
to pay for happiness.

554
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:31,337
Frankly, I think
it looked better on me.

555
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,850
What are you doing here?

556
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:38,508
You may have noticed that
I've been out of sorts lately,

557
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:40,575
and I just couldn't understand why.

558
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:43,955
I mean, sure, I was dumped
by the love of my life, but,

559
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,519
it was more than that.
And then it hit me.

560
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,219
My friend,
who was sort of responsible

561
00:35:49,386 --> 00:35:51,136
for my world imploding...

562
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:54,531
never bothered to cross the street

563
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:57,211
to see how I was doing.

564
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:06,684
Didn't have the...

565
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,098
decency...

566
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:09,959
to apologize.

567
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,951
- I am very, very...
- No, not here.

568
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:18,899
Out there.

569
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,679
- In the hallway?
- In your ceremony.

570
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,780
Everybody in town
knows you humiliated me.

571
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:27,695
I think I deserve a public apology.

572
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:31,791
In the middle of my wedding?

573
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:34,509
I found the perfect spot,
right here.

574
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:38,279
After the reading of ecclesiastes
and right before

575
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,239
"we've only just begun."

576
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:42,492
I am not doing that.

577
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:44,289
Yes, you will,

578
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:47,126
Or I will create a scene so ugly

579
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:50,958
Your guests will still be talking
about it on your golden anniversary.

580
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:03,679
But I am not happy about this.

581
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:06,657
Try to smile anyway.

582
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:08,726
Nobody likes a grumpy bride.

583
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:12,842
Why don't we just
get this over with?

584
00:37:13,512 --> 00:37:17,026
Would you mind getting my gloves?
They're in the garment bag.

585
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:26,410
I'm sorry.
It's just until after the ceremony.

586
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,999
And from this day forward,

587
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,001
You shall be each other's home.

588
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:36,504
You shall be each other's sanctuary.

589
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:39,454
Susan, let me out!

590
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:45,346
With this ring, I thee wed.

591
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:13,916
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

592
00:38:15,283 --> 00:38:17,642
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

593
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:18,909
Susan knows.

594
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:25,914
Look, I don't know what you want,

595
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:28,931
but I'm asking you nicely to leave.

596
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:34,361
And if you don't, so help me god,

597
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:37,178
I will drag you
out of this church myself.

598
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:49,486
I'm sorry. I...

599
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:53,153
I just wanted...

600
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:01,681
I'll go.

601
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:04,603
Katherine, wait.

602
00:39:14,196 --> 00:39:17,480
Hello, everybody.
I just wanna say something.

603
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:21,894
We don't need this on the video.

604
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,602
When Mike asked me to marry him...

605
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:27,769
again,

606
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:32,370
it was one of the happiest days
of my life. But for someone else,

607
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:36,332
It was the day
her whole world fell apart.

608
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,585
And I have to admit, I...

609
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:41,222
I didn't care.

610
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:46,728
In that moment,
I was a selfish person,

611
00:39:46,994 --> 00:39:49,470
And I chose my happiness.

612
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:52,056
But I want you all to know

613
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,477
that I am truly sorry

614
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:56,727
for changing her path.

615
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,730
And I hope that
Katherine Mayfair finds happiness

616
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:04,106
and can find it in her heart
to forgive me...

617
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:08,990
and be my friend again.

618
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:23,776
I hope that helped.

619
00:40:24,304 --> 00:40:25,354
Honestly...

620
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,050
It didn't.

621
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,738
Where the hell is danny?

622
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,323
He left the wedding 2 hours
ago and he's not in his room.

623
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:55,081
- He'll be home soon.
- What has gotten into that kid?

624
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:58,104
He's staying out late, pickin'
fights with girls in public.

625
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:00,458
- He knows better than that.
- He's a teenager.

626
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,209
Well, go look for him.

627
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,264
We can't afford to make waves here.

628
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,431
Everyone has to think
we are nice, normal people.

629
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:26,692
<i>It's not hard
to find sin in the suburbs.</i>

630
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:30,766
<i>Just look behind closed doors,</i>

631
00:41:30,933 --> 00:41:33,124
<i>and you'll find your neighbors</i>

632
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,201
<i>cheating on their husbands....</i>

633
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:41,707
<i>resenting their children...</i>

634
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:48,089
<i>plotting against their friends.</i>

635
00:41:52,203 --> 00:41:54,203
<i>But as much as we like to talk</i>

636
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,161
<i>about the sinful things people do...</i>

637
00:41:59,973 --> 00:42:03,729
<i>We forget there is a difference
between sin...</i>

638
00:42:05,062 --> 00:42:06,151
<i>and evil.</i>

639
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
<i>Sadly,</i>

640
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,180
<i>there's always someone
willing to come along</i>

641
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,843
<i>And remind us.</i>
