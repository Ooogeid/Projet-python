00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,970
Previously on DH...

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,850
My name is bree, and I am an alcoholic.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,380
Bree put her problem behind her.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,640
there's at least one employer
who'd love to hire me.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,360
Who?

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,490
Orson asked for a job.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,700
You.

8
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,280
Dave lost his temper...

9
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,680
damn it, edie! I said no!

10
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,140
And aroused the suspicion...

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,050
this guy is up to something.

12
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,520
Of his neighbor.

13
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,710
It was all karen mccluskey's fault.

14
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,200
She kept asking me all this
stuff about your background.

15
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,250
She reminds me of my grandmother
when we first started to notice.

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,330
The dementia, that is.

17
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,180
You think karen's going senile?

18
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,500
it could have been
such a lovely evening.

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,060
You see, the idea was to have
a surprise birthday party.

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,720
People would bring food and gifts and wait
in the dark for the guest of honor to arrive.

21
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,920
But it turned out to be a
night full of surprises--

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,770
the kind most people don't care for.

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,330
Damn it, lynette. Why do you
have to be such a buzz kill?

24
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,040
Why can't you, just once,
give me a little support?

25
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,340
Fine. I'll get you a towel.

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,390
For what?

27
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,670
If I was with another woman,
that wouldn't bother you?

28
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,270
No, it wouldn'T.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,390
I'm sorry that I lied, and for what it's
worth, the guilt has been tearing me apart.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,990
Get your hands off me,
you selfish son of a bitch!

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,370
orson, please. You're putting
me in an impossible position.

32
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,150
Then let me make it simpler for you.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,770
I want a divorce.

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,820
Oh, yes, it could have
been such a lovely evening,

35
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,040
but this was one party that was over...

36
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,740
before it even began.

37
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,460
surprise!

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,420
You think you can screw with me?

42
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,850
Moments before she was to leave for the
party, gabrielle solis was at her mirror,

43
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,990
halfheartedly putting the
final touches on her lips.

44
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,310
You see, a problem had
come to her attention...

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,130
damn.

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,800
One she couldn't gloss over.

47
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,040
Mommy, what are you doing?

48
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:34,250
Uh, well, mommy has a friend who visits her
every month, and she's late, and that's bad.

49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,070
Why?

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,930
Because she's the one who assures me that
you won't get a baby brother or sister.

51
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,900
- But I want a little brother.
- I don't care.

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,500
oh, sorry. It's just...

53
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,010
mommy really misses her friend, and mommy's gonna
be really sad if her friend doesn't show up soon.

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,390
Now go downstairs and play.
Mommy has some praying to do.

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,380
well, I have your test results.

56
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,810
Congratulations. You're pregnant.

57
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,680
Mrs. Solis.

58
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,300
I don't care. You told me this couldn't
happen. You said it was impossible!

59
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,840
The human reproductive system is
complicated and often unpredictable.

60
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,600
Sometimes miracles happen.

61
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,300
This isn't a miracle.
This is a disaster.

62
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,770
My husband's blind.
Neither one of us have jobs.

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,340
My husband's blind.

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,900
Trust me. Children are a blessing.

65
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,740
You'll see. It'll all work out.

66
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,540
Well, I hope to god you're right.

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,250
And what does this number mean anyway?

68
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,910
That's your beta number, and it's high,
which indicates the possibility of twins.

69
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,820
Gaby, relax.

70
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,800
This baby is gonna be the best
thing that ever happened to us.

71
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,340
I am so sick of everybody
looking at the glass half-full.

72
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,200
The glass is empty, people,
and so is our bank account.

73
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,300
Is that what you're
worried about--money?

74
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,600
Look, I'll get a job.

75
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,550
What are you gonna do, take up
piano and get a contract with motown?

76
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,940
Actually, I was thinking
about becoming a masseur.

77
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,010
You don't need your eyes for
that. It's all about the touch.

78
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,820
Well, I guess that's not the
worst idea you've ever had.

79
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,260
But it's not just about
the money, carlos. It'S...

80
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,460
oh, after my miscarriage,
I gave up on this dream.

81
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,320
I just figured god decided I couldn't possibly
be a good mom, so he didn't make it happen.

82
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,860
Well, he obviously changed his mi.

83
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,780
Well, I wish he'd stop doing that.

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,830
Nobody likes a fickle god.

85
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,800
Babe, believe me.

86
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,230
You getting pregnant is--is-- is a
one-in-a-million shot. It's a miracle.

87
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,970
Now let's embrace it and celebrate.

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,750
Hello, mrs. Solis.

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,440
I have your test results.

90
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,580
Great. So do I have anemia?
Is that why I've been so tired?

91
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,390
No. Not exactly.

92
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,680
And please don't slap me.

93
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,230
I'm pregnant!

94
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,020
Oh, my god. It's another miracle.

95
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:24,290
Yeah, we're up to two miracles, and if you come
back from the dead after I kill you, it'll be three.

96
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,940
w-why you mad at me?

97
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,150
"Oh, gaby, why do I
need to wear a condom?

98
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,650
There's no way lightning's
gonna strike twice."

99
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,400
Well, I didn't think it would.

100
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,060
Put the baby down, carlos.

101
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,010
I don't want to.

102
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,860
Do it. I need to hit something,
and it needs to be you.

103
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,630
You are looking at this all wrong.

104
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,300
This is one-in-a-million.We should--we
should celebrate and embrace--

105
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,950
oh, cram it, you fertile freak.

106
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,180
You're getting a vasectomy.

107
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,270
I can't do that. We're catholic.
It's against our religion.

108
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,260
I got news for you. We
just converted to judaism.

109
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,010
Problem solved. Mazel tov!

110
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,160
Gaby, it's not just
that.There are other reasons--

111
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,070
I am done fighting
off your bionic sperm.

112
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,560
You're getting snipped,
and that's final.

113
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,490
you're awfully quiet tonight.

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,720
Got a lot on my mind.
I think I'm pregnant.

115
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,250
- What?
- I know. It's crazy.

116
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,420
You had a vasectomy. It's impossible.

117
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,040
Yeah. So what makes
you think you're preant?

118
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,900
My period's late, and that never
happens to me. I'm like a swiss clock.

119
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,830
Oh, come on. There could be
a lot of reasons for that.

120
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,400
So let's not worry about it right now.

121
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,790
We're going to a party.
You gotta lighten up.

122
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,260
Okay. But I'm gonna talk to bob.

123
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,170
Bob? Why?

124
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,620
Because he and lee are
here. Bob's an attorney.

125
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,790
I'm gonna get him to sue the qck
who obviously botched your vasectomy.

126
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,180
Oh, gaby, let's not go there.

127
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,530
Hiring an attorney's expensive, and I
don't know that we can prove anything.

128
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,080
Well, I'm gonna find out.

129
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:02,090
Fine. But... let's not talk to bob.

130
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,560
I don't want our neighbors
involved in our business.

131
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,510
oh, don't worry. He's a professional.
He'll keep it confidential.

132
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,860
Gaby, no. You can't talk to him.

133
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,960
Why the hell not?

134
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,540
I never got a vasectomy.

135
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,310
Hi, guys. Welcome to the party.

136
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,140
Earlier that evening, as she
waited for her guests to arrive,

137
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,550
susan mayer took a
moment to do her eyebrows.

138
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,760
Of course, she had no way of
knowing just how hh those eyebrows...

139
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,390
sorry I'm late.

140
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,090
Would soon be raised.

141
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,200
What took you so long? People
are gonna be here any minute.

142
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,100
I need you to pour the cheap
vodka into the expensive bottles.

143
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,620
I couldn't find my pants.

144
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,700
I'm here so much that when I go back to my
place, I can't remember where anything is.

145
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,530
Well, just please change your shirt.

146
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,730
You know, I've been thinking that I spend
so much time with you now anyway that--

147
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,180
fine. You can have a
little space in the closet.

148
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,610
I think I've got some clothes from
the '80s I'm ready to part with.

149
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,250
Actually, I'm talking about moving in.

150
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,170
Moving in? Here?

151
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,650
Yeah. That's where we're headed. We
should take the plunge. What do you think?

152
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,920
So obviously, this is the bedroom.

153
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,810
Right.

154
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,810
So do you want to stick with this
color or switch it up or what?

155
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,830
I don't know.

156
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,160
I'm sort of going through a difficult
transition in my life right now.

157
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,810
I need a change.

158
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,310
Uh, I was thinking... taupe.

159
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,710
Sounds good.

160
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,260
You know, I like this
place. It's got a good vibe.

161
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,340
Uh, thanks.

162
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,640
And a nice scent. What
is that, your perfume?

163
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,320
Get out.

164
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,810
excuse me?

165
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,530
I was not born yesterday, pal.

166
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,840
You're coming on to me.

167
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,920
No, I'm not.

168
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,340
Oh, please. Telling me I smell good?

169
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,090
I'm not even wearing deodorant.

170
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,300
I said the house smells good.

171
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,590
Semantics. And then the not so
subtle sit-on-the-bed maneuver?

172
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,580
You know, why not
just ask for a massage?

173
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,120
I sat because my feet hurt from
you dragging me around for an hour,

174
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,770
telling me you want to
paint every room taupe.

175
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,690
You said you liked it.

176
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,390
Look, you're obviously
going through a rough patch.

177
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,770
I was afraid if I suggested
anything outside the beige family,

178
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,200
I might send you over the edge.

179
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,610
I'll let myself ouT.

180
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,280
No. No, don't go.

181
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,800
That was very sweet of you
to consider my feelings.

182
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,820
You know what? You're hired.

183
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,760
Uh, thanks... I think.

184
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,080
So do you need to look
these over one more time?

185
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Okay, then just sign them, and
you'll be officially divorced.

186
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,910
You know what? We need a minute.

187
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,350
Take your time.

188
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,100
are we doing the right thing here?

189
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,110
you're kidding me, right?

190
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,760
Once we sign these papers,
there's no going back.

191
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,490
I can't believe this.

192
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,280
You were the one who called the lawyer.

193
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,470
I know.

194
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,390
I'm thinking...

195
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,260
that maybe that was a mistake.

196
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,590
We've been separated for a year.

197
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,480
All we're doing today
is making it official.

198
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,030
We wouldn't be here if it weren't
for that accident. You know that.

199
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,120
Before that, we were good.

200
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,860
we could get back there.

201
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,520
Susan...

202
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,420
it's nobody's fault, but
I can't do this anymore.

203
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,220
Oh, come on!

204
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,610
We were mike and susan, remember?

205
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,380
You only get one of those in a lifetime.

206
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,010
We could make things right again.

207
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,280
Yeah.

208
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,790
And here's how.

209
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,520
You're back.

210
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,150
So what do you think?

211
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,390
it--it
looks good.

212
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,670
Yeah, I-I-I think you were right to
stick with this color. It looks fantastic.

213
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,100
Thanks.

214
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,660
Do you like scotch?

215
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,780
Okay...

216
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,600
I need to be honest about something.

217
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,210
H-honest? Okay.

218
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,070
I don't usually do this kind of thing,
hook up like this, out of the blue.

219
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:20,130
Not that it wasn't great, 'cause it was,
but I'm not really looking to start anything.

220
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,050
Work is crazy, and I
just got a dog, and...

221
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,680
I'm just not in that place right now.

222
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,640
So just to be clear, you're saying
you don't want a relationship?

223
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,000
Sorry.

224
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,210
I probably should have
said that right up front.

225
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,210
No, uh... it's fantastic.

226
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,460
Really?

227
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,300
I don't want a relationship either.

228
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,240
All I want from you is
exactly what we just did.

229
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,910
Except next time, it's susan.

230
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,230
Yeah.

231
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
"Mrs. Mayer" was probably a
little formal for the moment.

232
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,190
so there's gonna be a next time?

233
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,580
Unless you're not interested.

234
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,870
Are you kidding?

235
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,020
I'm this close to doing a
victory lap around the bed.

236
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,080
So you're really fine with this,
just a purely physical thing?

237
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,540
I gave romance a shot and...

238
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,180
I'm ready for something
a little more casual.

239
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,820
I've heard of women like you, but...

240
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,170
I thought you were an urban myth.

241
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,630
did you hear what I said?

242
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,950
Uh, yeah. You want to move in.

243
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,510
I-it's just that when I'm not with
you, I'm waiting to be with you.

244
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,180
I've never felt like this before. So...

245
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,330
what do you think? Do
you want to live together?

246
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,230
no.

247
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,160
So that's it? Just no? You're
not gonna give me a reason?

248
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,610
What's wrong with the way things
are? Why change everything now?

249
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,790
Because... I've fallen in love with you.

250
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,140
Hi, guys. Welcome to the party.

251
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,700
The last thing lynette scavo did before
a party was to check for gray hairs.

252
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,880
Penny! Let's go! Time for bath!

253
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:39,540
She had no way of knowing before this
evening was over, e would have a few more.

254
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,340
penny!

255
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,770
Penny.

256
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,550
If you're thinking of taking that
for a spin, I've got bad news.

257
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,200
You're 9.

258
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,420
Hey, what's the matter, sweetie?

259
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,450
Is daddy dying?

260
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,020
What? Of course not.

261
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,900
Why would you say something like that?

262
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,380
I heard porter and preston fighting about
who's gonna get daddy's car when he dies.

263
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,650
They're just being silly.
They're always silly.

264
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,300
That's why we won't be sad when
they move out of the house. Come on.

265
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,160
But everybody dies someday, right?

266
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:32,870
Yes, but daddy's gonna live to a ripe old age unless
he doesn't get home in time for mrs. Mccluskey's party,

267
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,730
and then all bets are off.

268
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,910
Oh, daddy's gonna be fine. Come on.

269
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,110
My husband-- I'm
lynette scavo.

270
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,050
- Dr. Baron called
me-- - I'm dr. Baron.

271
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,480
What happened?

272
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,550
Your husband was working on an
electrical panel at his restaurant...

273
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,620
And received a massive shock.

274
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,020
Essentially, his heart stopped pumping.

275
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,960
Is he...

276
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,160
fortunately, there was a
policeman eating in the restaurant.

277
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,760
He administered C.P.R. Until
the ambulance got there.

278
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,580
so he's okay?

279
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,570
His heart restarted.

280
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,140
Now it's a matter of determining
if there's any tissue damage.

281
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,610
We're optimistic, but the
next 36 hours are critical.

282
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,530
father o'brien, please report to the...

283
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,790
so I'm thinking no more
electrical work, okay?

284
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,450
The kids know everything's fine.

285
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,940
They send their love.

286
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,170
Don't worry about
anything, okay? Just rest.

287
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,020
I'll come back soon, okay?

288
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,820
You know what I thought?

289
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,660
When I was lying there on the floor,

290
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,320
I thought, I'm gonna
die in a pizza place.

291
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,860
I mean, my whole life was gonna be
summed up with this obituary headline--

292
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,810
"local pizza shop owner dies."

293
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,940
But it doesn't matter
because you're not dying.

294
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,610
I need more, lynette. I need--
th-there's gotta be more.

295
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,040
Okay. Okay. We'll find more.

296
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,490
Just rest now, okay?

297
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,180
hey, sexy.

298
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,390
Drop the rake and get in.

299
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,700
What the hell is this?

300
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,900
This is the car that I
have wanted my whole life.

301
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:57,060
When I was 12 years old, I had a
poster of this baby up on my wall.

302
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,130
And when I was 12, I had
a poster of shaun cassidy,

303
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,620
but you don't see me driving
around in him, do you?

304
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,840
I want to show you something.

305
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,860
What, do machine guns
come out of the headlights?

306
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,390
I carry this around to remind
me of the day that i almost died.

307
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:20,180
That day you promised me
that we would find more.

308
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,650
I'm keeping the car.

309
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,230
So do you want a ride?

310
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,210
where have you been?

311
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,150
So help me, if mccluskey gets
there before us, I will brain you.

312
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,030
- Sorry. Let's go.
- Well, sheesh.

313
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,030
Sweetie, we already got karen a candle.

314
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,410
An R.V.Might be overkill.

315
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,750
Yeah, but that's not
for her. That's for us.

316
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,930
I'm about to blow your mind, lynette.

317
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,810
oh, don'T. I like my mind the way it is.

318
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,190
What would you say to the idea of
taking the kids out of school for a year

319
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,620
and bopping around the country
in one of these sweet rides?

320
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,020
well, I might not say anything.

321
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,720
I might justut my finger to my
ear and twirl it in small circles.

322
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,640
- We can't do something like that, tom.
- Yes, we can.

323
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,370
We can do whatever we
want. Life is short.

324
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,150
Okay, let me ask you one tiny question
about this big adventure plan of yours

325
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,670
who's gonna be running our restaurant while
we're off doing the electric kool-aid acid test?

326
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,300
That won't be our problem.

327
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,730
The last few weeks, I've been talking
to a guy from passentino's pizza.

328
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,780
They want to buy us out.

329
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,210
this afternoon, I said yes.

330
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,500
Hey, guys. You ready to party?

331
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,670
Moments before she was
due at her friend's party,

332
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,910
bree hodge was at the
mirror, applying her eyeliner.

333
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,210
Aren't you dapper?

334
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,460
When I tell everyone I'm your new
partner, I want to look the part.

335
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,070
It would not be the last time that
evening bree would find herself...

336
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,690
um, actually, dear...

337
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,830
drawing a line.

338
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
I'd rather you not talk
about the job tonight.

339
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,880
But, bree, this is the first party in months
when I can answer the question, "what's new?"

340
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,530
Without mumbling into my drink.

341
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,470
Well, it's just vulgar to
discuss business at a party.

342
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,840
You haven't told
katherine yet, have you?

343
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,260
It's not that easy. You
know she'll be furious.

344
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,980
Yes, but the great thing about katherine is
she'll express it so passive-aggressively,

345
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,000
we'll hardly notice.

346
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,770
Look, I know she's your friend,
but she's also our employee.

347
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,390
Why is this so difficult for you?

348
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,650
It'S... complicated.

349
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,820
Well... another dead soldier.

350
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,810
Careful, dear. You don't
want to be ill tomorrow.

351
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,500
Yes. Nothing like a headache to spoil
a perfectly nice first day in prison.

352
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,910
uh, would anybody like
some more frittata?

353
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,750
Is my wife amazing or what?

354
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:24,470
I mean, how many inmates get sent
off with a festive champag brunch?

355
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,850
Uh, w-when you're in jail, you might want
to avoid words like "festive" and "brunch."

356
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,020
They kind of say, "hi.
I'm husband hunting."

357
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,400
andrew, please.

358
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,160
It's fine.

359
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,310
This is my last taste of
freedom for three years.

360
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,020
I want jokes. I want fun, laughter.

361
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,200
Anyway, prison won't
be such a big change.

362
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,790
You're a dentist. You're
used to cavity searches.

363
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,700
You vowed to me that
you wouldn't say that.

364
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,060
bree tells me that you're going to
make very good use of your time away.

365
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,530
Uh, yes. He's going to read a lot of
classic books, maybe study a language.

366
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,270
Yes, uh, he can learn the italian
for, "I cost five cigarettes."

367
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,360
andrew, really.

368
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,860
Bree, he's joking. Everything's fine...

369
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,890
except my glass, which
seems to be empty.

370
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,620
bree? Bree?

371
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,480
Oh, for god sake. Get up.

372
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,670
We have the garden club lunch in...

373
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,160
you've been drinking?

374
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,460
go away. I don't feel well.

375
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,530
We have a lunch to cater.

376
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,410
I'm too tired. Can you do it?

377
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,860
Get up.

378
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,250
When did this start?

379
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,430
When orson left, I...

380
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,240
began having a glass of
white wine now and then.

381
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,260
Then when danielle took benjamin, I
didn't see any reason to stop at just one.

382
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,260
So is this why you missed the lunch
last week and the braverman bar mitzvah?

383
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,740
I can't help myself, all right?

384
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,660
My husband's gone. My son's
gone. I have nothing left.

385
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,650
No, actually, you have a
lunch for 40 in 3 hours,

386
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,250
and I'm not letting you out of it.

387
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,540
Oh, katherine, please.

388
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,860
Okay, so you have a void in
your life. Welcome to the club.

389
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,070
Don't fill it with wine.

390
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,290
Fill it with work, with accomplishments.

391
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,780
Just think about the woman you
could be by the time orson gets back.

392
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,920
Or is this the woman you
want him to come home to?

393
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,360
He's gonna be so ashamed of me.

394
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,460
No, he won'T...

395
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,530
because you're not gonna tell him.

396
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,330
You know he'd just blame himself.

397
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,930
I don't know if I can make it this time.

398
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,610
Yes, you will, because I am moving in.

399
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,480
You would do that?

400
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,500
When I had nothing, you
made me your partner.

401
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,330
I'm not gonna forget that.

402
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,400
I am gonna get you through this.

403
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,240
And when we're done, that
scary woman over there--

404
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,570
she's never gonna be
seen in this house again.

405
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,190
When you think about it, tonight is the
ideal time for you to tell katherine.

406
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,960
The presence of the other guests
will keep her from causing a scene,

407
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,560
and as word spreads
that we're partners--

408
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,970
- and how is word going to spread?
- I'll be spreading it.

409
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,140
People will be congratulating me, and katherine
will have to join in and risk looking petty.

410
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,460
And she'll be twice as mad at
having been put in that position.

411
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,680
- I am not telling her tonight.
- Fine. Then I will.

412
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,770
No, you will not. I forbid it.

413
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
You know, for a partner, you're
sounding a lot like a boss.

414
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,770
I am telling her.

415
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,920
Look, if we can't agree on something this
basic, maybe we shouldn't work together.

416
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,500
What are you saying?

417
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,690
I'm saying, maybe you should
reconsider joining the company.

418
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,960
I have no intention of reconsidering.

419
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,510
Fine. You're fired.

420
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,200
Hey, guys. You ready to party?

421
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:53,950
the party was in full swing, and everyone
was waiting to surprise the guest of honor.

422
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,840
Little did they know, an even
bigger surprise was on its way.

423
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,100
Sorry I'm late. There
was a line at the bakery.

424
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,690
- Well, you really went all out.
- Yeah, she deserves it.

425
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,200
Can I help you, mrs. Mccluskey?

426
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,480
This letter for edie came
to my house by mistake.

427
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,300
I'm making sure that none
of my stuff, uh, came here.

428
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,100
Well, it's all yours.

429
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,010
Anything interesting?

430
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,710
Fortunately, no.

431
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,790
I just saw your friend karen outside.

432
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,450
Is she still asking
you questions about me?

433
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,390
A few, but don't take it personally.

434
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,690
Prying is what people too old to
have sex do to keep life interesting.

435
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,050
- She's turning 70 next week.
- No kidding.

436
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,540
Hey, we should throw her a party.

437
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,010
I'm already taking her out
for a drink. That's plenty.

438
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,480
She'll be 70, sweetheart.

439
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,230
Don't you think that
calls for something bigger?

440
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,190
Look, karen's a friend, but I
don't like having her in my house.

441
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,900
It would be one thing if we had a bathroom
with a window you could open, but...

442
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,260
well, couldn't you ask
someone else to host it?

443
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,710
- Well, I suppose I could palm it off to mayer.
- Good.

444
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,670
Tell her we'll supply
the food and liquor.

445
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,310
You know, karen's not a fan of yours.

446
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,740
Why do you want to throw her a party?

447
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,810
It's a big day for her.

448
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,770
I just want to make sure it's special.

449
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,440
So...

450
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,420
what do you think?

451
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,630
I think that is one hell of an outfit
to wear to a 70th birthday party.

452
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,420
It's my gift to karen.

453
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,950
I figure she'll get at least
five good boob jokes out of it.

454
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,480
Well, she'll be here soon, so
let's go over this one more time.

455
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,010
Okay.

456
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,770
I take her home, then I come up with
some excuse to get her over to susan's,

457
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,700
where everyone jumps out
and yells, "surprise!"

458
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,430
Which I still say isn't the
smartesthing to do to a 70-year-old.

459
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,070
mrs. Mccluskey. Happy birthday.

460
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,270
Jeez, edie, are we going
for drinks or mammograms?

461
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,150
That's one.

462
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,330
Oh, let me grab my earrings,
and we're good to go.

463
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,050
So...

464
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,620
It's quite a milestone. How's it feel?

465
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,090
No big whoop.

466
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,610
Edie told me that she takes you
out for a birthday drink every year.

467
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,650
I think that's a great tradition.

468
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,530
Look, I'm just trying
to be friends here.

469
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,500
all righty then.

470
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,630
I'll see you later. Come on. Let's go.

471
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,340
I've got enough friends.

472
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,170
Where's karen?

473
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,550
She'll be here as soon as she
gives her cat some medicine.

474
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,530
Do I you think she'll be surprised?

475
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,610
Oh, absolutely.

476
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,690
what the...

477
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,990
dave.

478
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:40,900
Just so I'm clear, you want us to sell our thriving
business so we can live in a bus, like carnies?

479
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,530
Come on. This is cool. We
can go wherever we want.

480
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,090
The--the kids
could see america.

481
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,780
And when we start stealing to support
ourselves, the ki can see the inside of a prison.

482
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,870
You're right, tom.
It's a brilliant idea.

483
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,070
Damn it, lynette. Why do you
have to be such a buzz kill?

484
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,440
Why can't you, just once,
give me a little support?

485
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,660
Fine. I'll get you a towel.

486
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,190
For what?

487
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,320
Bree, you can't fire me, not after
all the sacrifices I made for you.

488
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,640
Orson, stop throwing jail in my face.

489
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,670
You cellmate was a crooked C.P.A.
Who helped you form a bridge club.

490
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,200
It wasn't exactly attica.

491
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,090
Bree, I need this job.

492
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,560
Do you have any idea what it's like to wake up
every morning and have no reason to get out of bed?

493
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,430
To smile and nod at neighbors who know your wife's
supporting you because no one will hire a felon?

494
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,840
I am drowning, and for you to throw
me a lifeline and then snatch it away--

495
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,500
orson, I should have never offered you
that job. It wasn't fair to katherine.

496
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,220
I am your husband.

497
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,790
Why are you putting katherine's
feelings ahead of mine?

498
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,710
Orson, please. You're putting
me in an impossible position.

499
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,770
Then let me make it simpler for you.

500
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,590
I want a divorce.

501
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,580
Katherine, great dress.

502
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,340
You're gonna turn some
heads with that one.

503
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,060
I hope you're enjoying this party, carlos,
because you're not gonna live to see another one.

504
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,180
Look, I'm sorry that I lied, and for what it's
worth, the guilt has been tearing me apart.

505
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,490
You know what's gonna tear me apart?

506
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,150
Another 10-pound baby
shooting out my hoo-ha.

507
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,660
Honey, look at it this way, god blessed
us again because you are such a great mom.

508
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,250
Get your hands off me,
you selfish son of a bitch.

509
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,600
I told you i love you.

510
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,120
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

511
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:32,730
Yes. It means that someone forgot that
we had an agreement to keep things casual.

512
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,770
Okay.

513
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,270
So if we're not in a relationship, if I was
with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?

514
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,430
No, it wouldn'T.

515
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,020
Quiet, everyone. She's coming. Move it.

516
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,380
surprise!

517
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,640
You think you can screw with me?

518
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,900
What do you mean?

519
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,590
Karen, what the hell are you doing?

520
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,660
Ask that husband of yours!

521
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,100
- no!
- Let's not be doing that.

522
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,360
No, that man broke
into my house tonight!

523
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:23,870
What?

524
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,730
Yes, and he-- and he moved things around,
and he--and heook a picture off the wall,

525
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,910
and then he put the table next to
the couch, and the dish for the keys--

526
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,960
it's always by the...It's
always by the door.

527
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,620
And that's not the first
time he's broken in either.

528
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:40,320
He stole my cat, and
then he put him back.

529
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,830
Okay, mrs. Mccluskey, why
would I do those things?

530
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,110
Karen, I hate to say it, but you're
not making a lot of sense right now.

531
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,190
Maybe you need to lie down.

532
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,850
You...

533
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,310
I think we
should call 9-1-1.

534
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,460
Let go of me!

535
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,850
Why are you all acting like I'm crazy?

536
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,110
Halle-damn-lujah,
I got my period!

537
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,910
Oh, was she surprised?

538
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,010
She seemed totally
disoriented, babbling.

539
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,640
I just hope it isn't dementia.

540
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,230
She lives by herself.

541
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,800
We'll alert the hospital. We're
gonna need a psych evaluation.

542
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,030
Thank you. Thank you.

543
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,050
poor karen. I hope she's okay.

544
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,080
Yeah, me, too.

545
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,930
We should probably talk now, huh?

546
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,680
Yeah. Let's talk.

547
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,610
Does this relationship have a future?

548
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,060
Jackson, what we have here
has been working pretty well.

549
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,800
Answer the question.

550
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,010
Can't we just keep going the way we are?

551
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,270
And there's my answer.

552
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,300
it seems like they're
taking good care of her.

553
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,300
I hope you didn't mean
what you said earlier.

554
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,190
You just don't understandwhat
I owe to katherine.

555
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,820
You're right. I don'T.

556
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,280
You started the company and gave
her a job when she needed one badly.

557
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,820
Why are you the one who owes her?

558
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,040
You know that...

559
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,060
brunch we had for you right
before you left for prison?

560
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:04,310
I was very tense, and
I was very unhappy.

561
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,990
So I had...

562
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,270
a glass of champagne.

563
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,990
She's tough. I'm sure she'll be okay.

564
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,200
How about the crazy married couple
throwing drinks? How are they gonna be?

565
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,930
You know, I just thought that you got it, that
you knew what I was going through after accident.

566
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,370
You know, obviously I was wrong.

567
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,320
No, I get it.

568
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,010
The sports car, the garage band...

569
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,000
maybe what we need now,
tom, is for you to get it.

570
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,750
Hey, I was the one laying on the
floor with a cop pounding on my chest.

571
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,160
And I had cancer. I get it. I get it.

572
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,100
- You want your life to countor something.
- Exactly.

573
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,420
I just don't want to keep making pizzas
every day till I drop to the floor for real.

574
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,260
I want my life to be exciting.
You know, I need adventure.

575
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,080
Scavo's was the adventure.

576
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,630
We changed our whole lives so you could
live out your dream, and now you're bored.

577
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,020
We can't keep doing this, tom.

578
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,700
We can't keep throwing all the cards up in
the air every time you get a little restless.

579
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,070
Let's call it a night.

580
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,000
We have to work tomorrow.

581
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,620
Are you coming?

582
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,330
I'll come when I'm ready.

583
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,430
Did she really need an ambulance?

584
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,940
I don't know.

585
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:51,150
But you would have if I
hadn't started my period.

586
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,380
How could you have done this?

587
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,610
Isn't it obvious? I want another kid.

588
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,170
We can't handle another kid.

589
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,820
We're living hand to mouth as it is.

590
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,010
That's what you said before we had juanita
and before we had celia, and somehow we manage.

591
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,160
And can you imagine
our lives without them?

592
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,820
Of course I can'T. It's just...

593
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,100
how could you have lied to me?

594
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:20,420
I just couldn't shake the idea that maybe
god had one more miracle in store for us.

595
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,100
Maybe a son.

596
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,820
And we have so much love in our
lives, I got greedy, and I wanted more.

597
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,440
But you're right. It was selfish
and stupid, and I am so sorry.

598
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:39,030
I will call tomorrow
and schedule a vasectomy.

599
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:47,360
Or... we use birth control,
and I'm talking double-bagging,

600
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,130
at least until we both
decide it's a good idea.

601
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,230
I think I gotta kiss you.

602
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:06,180
And until we get a box of condoms in
that house, that's all you're gettin'.

603
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,390
Orson. What's up?

604
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,130
Bree told me what you did
for her when I was in prison.

605
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,070
- I just want to thank you.
- It's nothing.

606
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,270
Not to bree or me.

607
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,270
And you were dead right to
stop her from telling me.

608
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,740
I'd consider it an honor to
work for somebody that wise.

609
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,650
Work for? The last I
heard, it was partner.

610
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,560
All right, how's this?
I'll become a partner...

611
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,080
but only after you decide I've
earned it. I'm a patient man.

612
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,230
I don't care if it takes two years.

613
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,410
Oh, honey...
working for bree--

614
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,440
you're not gonna last ten months.

615
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,210
Mind if I say good-bye to our girl?

616
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,260
Sure, but she's a little groggy.

617
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,220
You planned the whole thing.

618
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,990
You're trying to get rid of me.

619
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,160
Yes.

620
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,860
And I'm sorry it had to be you.

621
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,500
'Cause I know you're
up to something--

622
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,630
something awful.

623
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,880
You don't know what "awful" is.

624
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,820
You take care of yourself,
karen, and I mean that.

625
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:06,190
Yes, it was a night
filled with surprises.

626
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,770
some had learned of their
husband's plans for the future...

627
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:18,930
others had discovered the
truth of their wife's past...

628
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:25,360
some were touched by their
husband's secret longings...

629
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,800
others were hurt by their
lover's quick departure.

630
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,950
But for one resident, the
evening had gone as planned,

631
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,530
and he now turned his
thoughts to his real agenda.

632
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:50,980
It wouldn't be long now before he
destroyed the man who had ruined his life,

633
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,390
but he knew he had to move carefully.

634
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,140
After all, he wanted
it to be a surprise.
