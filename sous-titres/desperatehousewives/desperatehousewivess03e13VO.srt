<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:04,709
<i>While Ian's wife Jane
was in a coma...</i>

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,455
Do we have a deal?

4
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:06,829
<i>Susan got an ultimatum.</i>

5
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,017
He's not crazy about me
spending time with my ex.

6
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:12,657
Mike's new hero...

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,292
Owe you one.

8
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:17,371
After those mutts knocked you around
the other day, your boy paid 'em off.

9
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,048
...had a secret agenda

10
00:00:19,293 --> 00:00:20,274
Gabrielle.

11
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:22,507
<i>Gabrielle learned the identity...</i>

12
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:24,671
I’m rich now. I can give you
anything you want.

13
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:26,404
<i>...of her secret admirer.</i>

14
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:27,516
Tell me everything.

15
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:32,137
<i>and Orson's mother shared some
family secrets that Bree...</o></i>

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,339
<i>...would later discover.</i>

17
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:43,599
<i>If there was one thing Orson Hodge
understood, it was teeth.</i>

18
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:48,862
<i>that's why people stopped him
at barbecues...</i>

19
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,472
<i>during cocktail parties...</i>

20
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:57,492
<i>and in the occasional men's room.</i>

21
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:02,267
<i>Yes, when it came to teeth,</i>

22
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:06,584
<i>people expected Dr. Hodge
to have all the answers.</i>

23
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:10,970
<i>sadly for Orson,
this was not always the case.</i>

24
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:15,918
Well, it does look  a little fishy.

25
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,918
Fishy?

26
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:18,967
It couldn't be more obvious.

27
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:21,035
Alma killed Monique.

28
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:22,458
That's why she disappeared.

29
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,580
And I bet she pulled the teeth so people
would suspect her dentist husband.

30
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:26,824
Well, why would she keep them?

31
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,812
Who knows ? She's probably gonna sneak
in and plant them in our house.

32
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:32,788
Well, we've saved her the trouble,
haven't we? Is it a full set?

33
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:37,223
- Orson! Not on the duvet!
- Oh, it's okay. They won't stain.

34
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:39,427
I don't care! I am not sleeping
in a bed

35
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:41,613
that had your dead
mistress' teeth in it!

36
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,691
Let's just take them to the police.

37
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:48,418
And say what? We can't prove
these came from Alma's.

38
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:51,536
She'll deny ever having seen. And don't
forget, I’m the one they suspect.

39
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:53,097
Well, we have to do something.

40
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:56,292
I agree, but not until we put
this back in her house.

41
00:01:57,524 --> 00:01:58,861
And then we'll call the police.

42
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:01,446
Trust me, she'll never get away with it.

43
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:15,663
Hello.

44
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,590
You've been very naughty, haven't you?

45
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:22,561
Orson? Is that you?

46
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,915
I know what you and Alma are
up to, and it's gonna stop.

47
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,519
<i>Yes, Orson was an expert on teeth.</i>

48
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:33,057
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

49
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,760
Oh, I think you do.

50
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:40,853
<i>That's how he could tell when
people were lying through them.</i>

Desperate Housewives - Saison 3
Episode no 13 "Come Play With Me"

54
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,951
<i>It can happen so quickly.</i>

55
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:29,780
<i>In the moment it takes a gunman's bullet
to enter his victim's leg...</i>

56
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:36,360
<i>in the time it takes to tell a wife her
husband won't be home for dinner...</i>

57

<i>in the instant it takes a father to meet
his son for the very first time...</i>

58
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:49,360
<i>yes, life as we know it can change...</i>

59
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,668
<i>in a heartbeat.</i>

60
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,799
Jane's still running a fever.

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,399
Yes, and she hasn't responded

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,500
to any of the meds that we've tried.

63
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,599
Do you think we should call her husband?

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,099
Uh, not just yet.

65
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's try vancomycin.
It worked for her before.

66
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,500
I don't want Ian to worry.

67
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,000
This is your new lawyer, Alan Marcus.

68
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,599
Alan, this is Mike Delfino.

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,410
Hey, Mike. Sorry I couldn't
start on your case sooner.

70
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,599
I was wrapping up
an armed robbery trial.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,300
It's nice to finally meet you.

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
And you must be Ian.

73
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I can't thank you enough
for helping me out here.

74
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,000
Susan and I are happy
to be of assistance.

75
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,399
So should we get started?

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Sure.

77
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:39,799
So, Mike,

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,299
I've had a chance to review
all the evidence against you,

79
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,799
and I've got a strategy

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,200
to ensure your case
never goes to trial.

81
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,100
Don't you love this guy?
What's the strategy?

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,199
Pleading guilty?
What kind of a strategy is that?

83
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,899
He'd only be pleading
to manslaughter.

84
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,801
- That's still ten years in prison.
- Well, which is better than life,

85
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:58,995
and that's what Mike's risking
if he goes to trial.

86
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,929
With good behavior,
he could be out in five.

87
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,003
With a better lawyer,
he could be out in zero.

88
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:06,147
We need to find a lawyer
who believes that he's innocent.

89
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:08,243
Well, the evidence against him
is very compelling.

90
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:10,699
You're letting your feelings
for him cloud your judgment.

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,899
My "feelings for him"?
Are we gonna do this again?

92
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,999
Do you realize that
every conversation we have

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,308
winds up being about Mike?

94
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:19,965
"Who's the best lawyer for Mike?
How can we get Mike acquitted?"

95
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,799
I have told you I love you
a thousand times.

96
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Where is all this jealousy coming from?

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Do you know what?

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
I have to catch that plane to Montreal.

99
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,799
What? No, Ian,
we have to talk about this.

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I can't be late. It's business.

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Look, I have provided Mike
with the best lawyer I know.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,491
If you want to get someone else,
then you're on your own.

103
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,306
Whatcha doing?

104
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:54,600
Oh, deciding what to wear
on my first day back to work.

105
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,500
Do I look fat in this?

106
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,978
I think you look good in everything.

107
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,399
Wow. Your father has taught you well.

108
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,999
What about the street fair?

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,499
If you're going back to work,
who's gonna take me?

110
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,600
Mrs. Mccluskey. Won't that be fun?

111
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,600
No.

112
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,699
Do you have to go back to work?

113
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,100
Come on. You and your brothers
will be thrilled.

114
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,900
Don't you get tired of me yelling at you

115
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,100
to clean up your room
and finish your homework?

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah,

117
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,700
But you've been a lot nicer
since you got shot.

118
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Oh. Well, that's good to know.

119
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:32,599
When you think about it,

120
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,400
Me going back to work
is not that big a deal.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,600
We're only losing all time
together in the afternoon.

122
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,300
But every hour counts.
I miss you all day long.

123
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,499
Oh, honey...

124
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,900
jeez.

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,499
Do you really mean that,

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,700
or are you manipulating mommy
into feeling incredibly guilty?

127
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
A little bit of both.

128
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,400
Yep. Your father's taught you well.

129
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,490
The suspense is killing me.

130
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:11,099
Here it comes.

131
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,400
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for...

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,902
the winner of this year's

133
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,100
Little Miss Snowflake pageant is...

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
Sherri Maltby!

135
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,099
I'm in shock. I mean, I knew
she had a shot at the top five,

136
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,700
But to actually win?

137
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,821
I was sure she'd lose
to that little blonde bitch

138
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:41,200
who sang that patriotic medley.

139
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,500
I know. She practically had
sparklers coming out of her ass.

140
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Totally shameless.

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,399
Okay, hon, let's go
meet those reporters.

142
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,099
- What are y gonna tell 'em?
- I owe it all to "beauty by Vern."

143
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,000
Attagirl.

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,899
Oh, Zach.
What are you doing here?

145
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,200
I came to support you.

146
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,899
Oh. Okay, why don't you
support me from the lobby?

147
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,899
I have some networking to do.
My girl just won the pageant.

148
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,700
Oh, yeah, I know, and you're welcome.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What did you do?

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,699
Don't worry. I paid the judges in cash.

151
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,200
There's no paper trail.

152
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,399
You bribed the judges?!

153
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,899
Gabrielle, why are we fighting?
We should be celebrating.

154
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,272
I got a limo outside,
a bottle of chilled cristal.

155
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,321
- Come on. Let's go. Let's party.
- Listen to me,

156
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:28,499
you pimply psychopath,

157
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,399
You and I are never going to "party."

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,699
In fact, the only reason

159
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,499
we're ever gonna be
in the same room again

160
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,600
is if you strangle a cheerleader
and I wind up on the jury!

161
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,300
God, I love it when we banter.

162
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,500
Hello, Alma.

163
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,600
Orson.

164
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,799
Uh, I let myself in.
I hope you don't mind.

165
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
Not at all.

166
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,199
You seem very cheerful.

167
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Oh, I am,

168
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
'Cause the game's over,
and you lost.

169
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,899
I told you what I'd do
if you pushed me away.

170
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,500
Well, I'm afraid that threat
no longer has any teeth in it.

171
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,300
Yes, your mother told me
about Bree's little discovery.

172
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,300
What'd you do with Monique's teeth?

173
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,899
Well, maybe I threw them away.
Maybe I hid them here.

174
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,958
You might find them,

175
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,499
If the police don't find them first.

176
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,899
Oh, I don't think you'll
bring the police into this.

177
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,500
Well, neither will you now.

178
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,800
We're done. Why don't you do us
all a favor and go away?

179
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,699
You shouldn't treat me this way.

180
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,299
Don't bother crying.

181
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,299
Tears might've worked
when we were married,

182
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,499
After you lost the baby.
They won't work now.

183
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
We should have kept trying.

184
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,200
If we'd had a child,
we'd still be together.

185
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,600
I know. That's why I stopped trying.

186
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,300
Good-Bye, Alma.

187
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,100
Well, here's some sucky news--

188
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,300
Ken just quit.

189
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,849
- Your new manager? No.
- Yeah,  I'm screwed.

190
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,799
I'm gonna have to drop out
of the street fair.

191
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,799
Tom, no. You can't. You can't.

192
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,099
The pizzeria opens in a week,
and that street fair

193
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,899
is the best advertising
we're gonna get.

194
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,999
I know, but I can't work it alone.

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,500
Well, you know, hire someone else.

196
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,499
Well, there's no time for that.

197
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,599
The future of the restaurant
is at stake.

198
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,300
It is time to get creative.

199
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,099
Well, I do have one option,

200
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,600
- But it would require some sacrifice.
- Well, whatever it is gonna take.

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You could help me.

202
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,999
What?! No.

203
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:39,899
Look, I'm wearing makeup.

204
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,599
I am holding a briefcase.
What does this suggest to you?

205
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,299
You could call in sick.

206
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,799
I can't call in sick
after eight weeks of sick leave,

207
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,000
Especially when I've been fine
for three of them.

208
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:54,400
Oh! Crap, that's Ed.

209
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,299
Lynette? Lynette, please?

210
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,599
You're the one who said
that we need the street fair.

211
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,965
My boss is waiting for me
outside in his car.

212
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:05,300
What am I supposed to do?

213
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
It's time to get creative.

214
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Oh, there she is.

215
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,200
Hey, guys.

216
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,100
Boy, didn't expect you
to still be wearing a sling.

217
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,199
Yeah, it heals a little slower

218
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,799
when the bullet's still in there.

219
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,200
- Oh. They couldn't get it out?
- No, it's too close.

220
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,400
To what?

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,799
Everything.

222
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
God, I'm so sorry.

223
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,599
Hey, you got a little, uh,
cereal right...

224
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Cereal? I didn't have any, uh...

225
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,100
Oh, I know what that is.

226
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,299
I get nauseous from the pain,

227
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,800
So that's just a little residual vomit.

228
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,099
Lynette, you sure you're ready
to come back to work?

229
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,999
Yeah! Don't be silly. I'm fine.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,199
Come on. Let's go
sell some toothpaste.

231
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,805
All righty! Let's go.

232
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:07,323
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh! No, no! I'm sorry!

233
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:09,274
- Don't touch me, okay?
- Anything we can do?

234
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,800
My pills! My pain pills are in my bag.

235
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,600
Thanks.

236
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,799
Oh! Oh, my pills!

237
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,000
I need my pills,
and now they're all dirty!

238
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,999
See ya next week!

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,900
Thanks for understanding!

240
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:34,199
Hey. Looks like
an interesting book.

241
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,300
What's it about?

242
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,699
Never mind. I'll wait for the movie.

243
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,900
- What's eating you?
- Those two guys you saved me from?

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,399
I know you paid 'em to attack me.

245
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,608
That's a lie.

246
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:48,200
You wanna take a minute
to reconsider that?

247
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,200
Okay. Okay. I needed a favor,
and I wanted you to owe me.

248
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
What favor?

249
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,500
You sure you want to get into this now?

250
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
- Yeah.
- Okay.

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,700
You remember my son Zach?

252
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,700
Vaguely. Why?

253
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,100
Turns out you and I share
more than a cellblock.

254
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Hello, Bree. May I come in?

255
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
What's a garden without a snake?

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,600
I realize I'm not your favorite person,

257
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,300
But I thought you should know
why Alma's moved here.

258
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,000
She wants Orson back.

259
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,700
Thanks for the heads-Up.

260
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,500
Now off you go.

261
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,599
Orson and I may have our spats,

262
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
But I'm still deeply concerned
about the state of his soul.

263
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,699
Adultery is a sin.

264
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,799
I wouldn't worry
about Orson's soul.

265
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
He won't be sleeping with Alma.

266
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
When I said "adultery"...

267
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,300
I wasn't referring to Orson and Alma.

268
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,700
I meant Orson and you.

269
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,499
Excuse me?

270
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,299
Our church doesn't accept divorce.

271
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,600
In the eyes of God,
you're the other woman.

272
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,099
I'm sure you don't see it that way,

273
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,500
But Alma and I do...

274
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,400
and Orson's beginning to.

275
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,599
Are those shoes suede?

276
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Yes. Why?

277
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,100
No reason.

278
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Why the hell didn't anybody
tell me I had a son?

279
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,399
You'd just come out of a coma.

280
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,600
They probably figured
you had enough on your plate.

281
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,582
Well, why are you telling me now?

282
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,799
Zach and I haven't spoken in months.

283
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,700
Every time I've tried to contact
him, he won't return the calls.

284
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,700
I don't know what you expect me to do.

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,099
I barely remember the kid.

286
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,700
Yes, but he remembers you,

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,800
And I think if you reach out
to him, he'll talk to you.

288
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,200
Zach is all I have left in the world.

289
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:05,731
Through everything that's happened,

290
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,200
I've never stopped loving him.

291
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,700
Can you please get him
to come down here and see me?

292
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
That's one hell of a favor.

293
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,200
Man, you got some nerve.

294
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
I know.

295
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,400
It's kind of what got me in here.

296
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,999
Is it Gaby's birthday?

297
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
No, they're probably
from Zach young.

298
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,600
What?

299
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,499
You haven't heard?

300
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,799
He has been begging Gaby
to go on a date with him.

301
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,421
He's been sending her
all sorts of stuff to bribe her,

302
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:41,399
- even a a diamond bracelet.
- Zach young?

303
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,799
Our Zach young?
How does he afford diamonds?

304
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,824
His grandfather left him all that money.

305
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,043
I thought it was in a trust,
and he couldn't touch it.

306
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:51,500
Until he turned 18,
which was a month ago.

307
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,900
So Zach young is loaded, huh?

308
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,399
No. Absolutely not.
Oh, come on.

309
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,799
Mike needs a great lawyer.
Zach can afford a great lawyer.

310
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,599
I don't care. I'm not
going out with Zach young!

311
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,199
It's one little date.

312
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,899
You wouldn't even let your own
daughter go out with him.

313
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,467
You said he was a psycho.

314
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:15,357
He's matured... to the tune
of a billion dollars.

315
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:18,599
Please do this... for Mike.
Susan, do you know what

316
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,700
Your obsession with Mike has cost you?

317
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,199
First you piss off Bree and then Ian,

318
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,399
And--And now you're
pimping me out to a teenager!

319
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,199
Okay, I deserve the pimping remark,

320
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,300
But let's not pretend that,
you know, we're above teenagers.

321
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,000
Gaby...

322
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
you're all I've got.

323
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,199
Oh, fine, I'll do it.

324
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,099
Thank you! This is
a noble thing you're doing.

325
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,599
How can you be so sure
Zach's gonna go along with this?

326
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,299
Oh, 'cause he's a great kid,

327
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,400
And he's gonna want to help Mike...

328
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,391
and you're not gonna be wearing
a bra when you ask him out.

329
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:08,600
Ooh, can you guys just,
uh, take five, please?

330
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,200
Gabrielle, what are you doing here?

331
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,999
Wow, you have your own
recording studio in your house?

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,900
Yeah, I needed a place
to lay some tracks with my band.

333
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,599
You, um, you see that guy?

334
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,700
He used to tour with
the Doobie Brothers.

335
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
How wild is that?

336
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,999
Gee, well...

337
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,800
not as wild as what I'm about to say.

338
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,200
You can take me to dinner.

339
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,599
Seriously? Awesome!

340
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,399
Yeah, here's how it's gonna work--

341
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,099
We drive to the restaurant separately,

342
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,699
We will not have dessert,

343
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,499
And under no circumstances
will you touch me. Capisce?

344
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:41,999
Okay.

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,099
Great. In order for
this magical night to occur,

346
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,799
You're gonna need
to help Mike Delfino.

347
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,199
Mike? What happened?

348
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,796
H'es in jail... for murder.
But Susan swears he's innocent,

349
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,650
And she wants you
to get him a good lawyer.

350
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,100
All right, we have a deal?

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No.

352
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,199
No?

353
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh, I-I would love to help Mike.

354
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,099
It's just that, uh, if I'm
paying for a lawyer, you know,

355
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,300
I would like to have more
than just one meal with you.

356
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,900
I'd like to have a whole day.

357
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,299
A whole day?

358
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,999
Yeah, here's how it's gonna work--

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,999
Um, it's gonna be three meals
with dessert,

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,800
activities of my choosing and a...

361
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
a good night kiss.

362
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,099
Now do we--
Do we have a deal?

363
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,899
Not quite.

364
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,800
The day starts with lunch,
and that kiss off the table.

365
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,300
Did they set bail for Mike?

366
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,300
You know, 'cause I-I could
throw that in, too.

367
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
$1 million.

368
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
It's no biggie.

369
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,600
One call to my accountant,
and Mike's a free man.

370
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,599
Or do you want to tell Susan

371
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,055
that Mike's gonna stay in jail
because you wouldn't kiss me?

372
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,600
Okay, deal, you little skunk.

373
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,399
Here you go.
You can come back for seconds.

374
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,148
Our famous pepperoni pizza.

375
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:05,197
- Here's another canadian bacon.
- There you go.

376
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:08,599
Great. Guess what? Our line
is the biggest one at the fair.

377
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I counted.

378
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,627
You know what I'm starting to think?

379
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:12,432
What?

380
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:15,994
This restaurant is gonna
be a big, fat hit.

381
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,384
Here you go.

382
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Can I talk to you about something?

383
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,099
I think you hurt Lynette's feelings

384
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,000
when you refused to go
to the street fair with her.

385
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,500
She's gonna start to think
you don't like her.

386
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,300
You don't want that,
do you?

387
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,900
Doorbell.

388
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,300
Some of 'em should be left
on a hillside to rot.

389
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,923
I'm Ed ferrara, Lynette's boss.
Is, uh, she around?

391
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,199
Uh, well, actually,

392
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,900
She's at the, uh, uh,
the, uh, doctor's.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,499
- Yeah. Well, could you give her this?
- Oh. Sure.

394
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,572
And tell her to get well.

395
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,377
And she doesn't need
to come back to work

396
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,743
Till she's good and ready.

397
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,694
I will make sure she gets this.

398
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,500
Okay.

399
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,100
Excuse me. Mister?

400
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:23,899
I just wanted to tell you

401
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,600
Our babysitter gets mixed up sometimes.

402
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,600
Lynette's not at the doctor's.

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
She's not?

404
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,100
Nope.

405
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,300
Well... where is she?

406
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:40,200
Excuse me.

407
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:42,999
- Hey.
- Try some of that. Hey.

408
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,599
- Load me up again, would ya?
- Yeah?

409
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,499
I'm gonna go poach
some customers from that

410
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,000
- sausage-on-a-stick guy.
- That, I love it when you're ruthless.

411
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,000
Scavo's pizzeria!

412
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,199
Try the smoked chicken
and sundried tomato.

413
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,599
This crust is fantastic!

414
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,500
It's cornmeal. That's the secret.

415
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,700
It's not your only secret,
is it, Lynette?

416
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,899
Hi, Ed.

417
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,354
How's the arm?

418
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,499
Uh... uh, on the mend,

419
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,099
But I'm gonna be there
bright and early monday morning.

420
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Don't bother. You're fired.

421
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,899
Wait, Ed!
Ed, please don't go.

422
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,099
Yes, I lied, and that was wrong,
but my husband needed my help.

423
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,399
I need your help. You've been
gone eight weeks, with pay,

424
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,094
while the company's
been falling apart.

425
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,654
- Okay.
- And now you pull this on me?

426
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:35,099
Like I said, really, really wrong,

427
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,600
But if you take me back,
I swear I will give you 100%.

428
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,600
So... if we have to work late,
you're gonna do it.

429
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,999
If I ask you to miss
your kid's baseball game,

430
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,300
you're gonna say,
"no problem, Ed"?

431
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,799
You got it, Ed.

432
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Good. I'll see you monday.

433
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,799
Hi. It's--It's me.

434
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,099
Um, listen, we have to talk.

435
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,399
Ian, I'm sorry, too. We've got
to stop fighting like this.

436
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,040
Susan, um, Jane's doctor called me.

437
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,600
She's--She's taken a bad turn.

438
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,099
Oh. Ian...

439
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,726
I'm, uh, I'm on
the next flight out,

440
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,299
but it's not for aew hours,
and Jane's parents are in Rome.

441
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,100
Would, uh, would you go
to the hospital for me?

442
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,999
- The hospital?
- Well, I-I know it's a lot to ask,

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But if something should happen, I--

444
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,900
Well, I don't want her to be alone.

445
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,299
Oh ???

446
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,499
I can't believe you talked me
into that crème brûlée.

447
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,498
Oh, don't feel guilty.

448
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,521
I'm sure we burned it off
on the dance floor.

449
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:57,700
I know! You're such a good dancer!

450
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:58,999
Where'd you learn how to salsa?

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
I've been taking lessons 'cause
I knew it was your favorite.

452
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,599
- When did I say that?
- "Cosmo," '98.

453
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,164
And I knew you liked that merlot
from your "Vogue" interview.

454
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:09,800
You researched me? That's sweet!

455
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,300
In a, uh, stalkery kind of way.

456
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,400
Thanks again for
a surprisingly enjoyable night.

457
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,699
Ssee you around.

458
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,100
Uh... Gaby?

459
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,559
Right, the kiss.

460
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,000
Sorry. I didn't mean
to welsh on ya.

461
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,500
All right.

462
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,200
Pucker up.

463
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,000
- What the hell are you doing?!
- But you said I could kiss you.

464
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,199
- Yes, my lips,not my esophagus!
- For your information,

465
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,399
- I'm a very good kisser,all right?
- By who? The same girl

466
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,499
to use your tongue
like a windshield wiper?

467
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,799
No, by women--
women with lots of experience--

468
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,300
and every single one of them
said that I was a great kisser.

469
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,700
How much did you pay them to say that?

470
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,900
No!

471
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:17,799
- You've paid women for--
- It's none of your business, all right?

472
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,134
It's none of your business.

473
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:21,399
Uh, yes, it is.
You just vacuumed my tonsils.

474
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,349
I deserve to know
where that mouth has been.

475
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,376
You know what?
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

476
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,999
Wait, Zach.
Zach, I'm not mad!

477
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Ok hey, I'm just a little...

478
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,100
grossed out, that's all!

479
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:43,299
No, you heard me.
You heard me, all right?

480
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,899
Read my lips.
Just go, all right?

481
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,899
Go! You've got no right
to be here!

482
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,000
All right!

483
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,599
What, another one?

484
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,799
You organ donor people are vultures.

485
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,399
Um, no, actually, I'm a friend of Ian's.

486
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,700
He asked me to come... for Jane.

487
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,299
Oh, you... you're the girlfriend.

488
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,500
All right, that's okay then.
Come on in.

489
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,500
So, Erika, uh, you'ere fighting
with that guy when I came in.

490
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,400
Have you had a lot of those
organ donor people around today?

491
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Oh, that wasn't about that.

492
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
No, that was Ted.

493
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,700
What, Ian never told you
about Jane et Ted ?

494
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
No. What about them?

495
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,300
Nothing. Forget I mentioned it.
It is not my place.

496
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,800
What?

497
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,000
They had an affair.

498
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,600
Jane cheated on Ian?
When was this?

499
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,900
I hate to dish my best friend
on her deathbed...

500
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,200
but gossip was the foundation
of our relationship, so...

501
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
it was five years ago.

502
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,399
Ian was traveling a lot on business,

503
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,800
Jane was lonely, and along came Ted.

504
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm just stunned.

505
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,499
So I guess they worked it out, right?

506
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Well, Ian took her back.

507
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,199
But if you're asking, did he
ever really trust her again?

508
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
I don't think so.

509
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,600
Poor Ian.

510
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,900
You don't know the half of it.

511
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,400
I mean, to be betrayed by
somebody you loved that much...

512
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:26,359
You're just never the same.

513
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,899
Hey. What are you doing here?

514
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,800
Word on the street is
you're looking for a manager.

515
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,900
Yeah.

516
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,400
Here's my application.

517
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,999
I thought Ed took you back.

518
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,600
He did. I told him I wasn't interested.

519
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:51,700
What?

520
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,400
You're quitting?

521
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,200
I had so much fun at the fair today,

522
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,900
working with you
on something that was all ours.

523
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,699
I want every day to be like that.

524
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,099
Honey, so do I. Are you sure?

525
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,200
I mean, your career's
always meant so much to you.

526
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,499
When I got shot and I was
lying there bleeding,

527
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,299
I wasn't thinking,

528
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,700
"God, I'm really
gonna miss advertising."

529
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,099
I think this could be the best thing

530
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,099
that's ever happened to our family.

531
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,199
We can make our own hours,
we'll be together more,

532
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,099
And, yes, the money
is gonna be a little tight,

533
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,100
But I think this place
could be a gold mine.

534
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,300
In that case, you're hired.

535
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,500
You do, of course, realize
you have to sleep with the boss.

536
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,000
I can do that.

537
00:27:48,593 --> 00:27:49,600
Good.

538
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:57,700
It's a little soon to be
gunning for a promotion.

539
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:04,700
Your mother not home yet?

540
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Uh, I haven't seen her.

541
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,200
Hello?

542
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
What is it now?

543
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,000
Alma did what?!

544
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,900
No, no. I'll be right over.

545
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,300
Wait, wait, what did Alma do?

546
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,899
I just thank the lord
I got here when I did.

547
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,799
But why didn't you call an ambulance?

548
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,700
I thought it best for all
concerned to keep this quiet.

549
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
By the way, she left a note.

550
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,800
She only did this to upset me.

551
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,899
She knows my history.

552
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,799
She knows exactly what buttons to push.

553
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,299
Orson, calm down.

554
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,100
Here.

555
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,000
Our marriage is over.

556
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,700
I will not submit
to emotional blackmail.

557
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:19,162
Are you all right?

558
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,800
I feel dizzy.

559
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,200
Then perhaps you should just...

560
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:27,300
sit.

561
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,200
My God.

562
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,100
Did you poison me?

563
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,100
And kill my only child?

564
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,400
You see how he talks to me?

565
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:51,400
It's my fault. I upset him.

566
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
Sorry about all this.

567
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:58,600
I just needed to get your attention.

568
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,600
Why?

569
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,700
What do you want?

570
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,600
What every mother wants,
dear...

571
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,500
a grandchild.

572
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,399
Wewell, why don't I
give you two some privacy?

573
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Thank you, mother Hodge.

574
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,400
You mustn't struggle.

575
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,700
I want this baby to be born of love.

576
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,400
I've been injecting myself...

577
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:50,089
with hormones

578
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:52,800
To improve our chances.

579
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:59,000
You wait and see.
This is gonna fix everything.

580
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,600
You're crazy.

581
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,299
Crazy for you, mister!

582
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,801
I won't. You can't make me.

583
00:31:05,802 --> 00:31:07,799
Why, yes, I can.

584
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,399
That drink had two
kinds of pills in it--

585
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
One to put you to sleep

586
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,600
and one to keep the part of you I need

587
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,200
nice and perky.

588
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:20,466
Now... how about a little music?

589
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
<i>we're all alone</i>

590
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:27,800
<i>no chaperone can get our number *</i>

591
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:30,299
<i>the world's in slumber</i>

592
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,800
<i> let's misbehave</i>

593
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,490
The doctor was just here.

594
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:41,300
He said her blood pressure's
dropping. She could go anytime.

595
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,900
I, uh, gotta go call her parents.

596
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,999
Hi.

597
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,999
It's me. We just took off.

598
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,699
I'll be there in about six hours.

599
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,299
Sweetie, I don't think
she's gonna make it that long.

600
00:32:05,694 --> 00:32:07,201
Don't tell me that.

601
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,800
You've done everything you could.

602
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:11,999
She knows that you love her.

603
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,259
Well, it's just there's
things I've got to say to her.

604
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:16,385
I've carried around so much anger

605
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:18,406
About something that doesn't
mean anything now,

606
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:19,967
And I need her to know that.

607
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:25,099
I'm gonna put the phone
up to Jane's ear,

608
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,699
and you can tell her
whatever you need to, okay?

609
00:32:29,437 --> 00:32:31,100
Okay.

610
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,599
Hello, Jane, darling. It's Ian.

611
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,263
<i>I never imagined
I'd have to you like this</i>

612
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:47,263
<i>There's so much I want to say.</i>

613
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:04,500
You play that pretty well.

614
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,626
What are you doing here?

615
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,894
I had a good time tonight,

616
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,014
But... I hated the way it ended.

617
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:14,428
Yeah, me, too.

618
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:16,819
Gaby...

619
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:19,650
about those women...

620
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:20,748
forget about it.

621
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:23,708
Give a horny kid a couple million bucks

622
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,732
and the yellow pages,
and stuff is gonna happen.

623
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,671
It's not just them. I...

624
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:30,645
I'm paying everyone
that I know.

625
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,134
Those guys in my band--
They're not my friends.

626
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,955
I'm... hiring them
to hang out with me.

627
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,892
So stop doing it.

628
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:40,916
Stop buying people.

629
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:44,244
Yeah, right, and then
I'd have no one at all.

630
00:33:46,252 --> 00:33:48,521
That's not true.

631
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:50,815
You'd have me.

632
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,579
As a friend.a  friend friend.

633
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:56,872
Not a girlfriend.

634
00:33:57,042 --> 00:34:00,384
I really cannot overstress that.

635
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,145
Come on.

636
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,660
Why do you wanna be my friend?

637
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,711
We have zero in common.

638
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:07,906
I don't know.

639
00:34:09,854 --> 00:34:13,488
Maybe it's because
I think we're both... adrift.

640
00:34:15,532 --> 00:34:17,605
it'd just be nice to have a pal who

641
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,971
gets what I'm going thrgh.

642
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:28,593
Why don't you play me
something you wrote?

643
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:29,617
Yeah?

644
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:31,422
Okay. Can I sing, too?

645
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,910
Sure. Why not?

646
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,159
All right.

647
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:36,105
* Gaby

648
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:38,179
* sweet Gaby--

649
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:41,627
Why don't you just hum it, okay?

650
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:45,858
Hi.

651
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:49,088
Sorry. My book club ran late.

652
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,112
Didn't Orson make you dinner?

653
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:53,317
Oh, no. He's been over at Alma's.

654
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:55,146
He's been there for a few hours now.

655
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,792
What the hell is this?!

656
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:21,300
Oh, Bree. I'm so so sorry
you had to find out this way.

657
00:35:21,301 --> 00:35:23,154
Not as sorry as you are gonna be!

658
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:26,699
- Orson, get up!
- Leave him alone.

659
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,861
He wants to be with me now.

660
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:30,910
Orson, I have caught you cheating.
At least have the courtesy to wake up!

661
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:33,507
Oh, for God sakes.

662
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:39,182
Orson!

663
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:41,310
Orson?

664
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,099
What have you done to him?!

665
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,300
Nothing. You know men.

666
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,020
The minute it's over--
Wham, off to dreamland.

667
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:52,516
He's not sleeping.
He's out cold.

668
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,961
Oh, I knew it.

669
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,600
These are sleeping pills,
and these are...

670
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:06,717
Oh, my God.

671
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,400
You raped my husband!

672
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,500
We made love,

673
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,094
And when our baby's born,
he's gonna come back to me.

674
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,101
- Baby?!
- It's true.

675
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:21,799
I could be expecting right now.

676
00:36:21,803 --> 00:36:23,535
Were you expecting this?

677
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,791
Andrew, I need you to come
over here right away... and,

678
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,050
bring the wheelbarrow.

679
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,400
Hi.

680
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,400
Do... do you remember me?

681
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,700
No.

682
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,300
No, not really.

683
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,280
But I know who you are.

684
00:37:18,898 --> 00:37:21,068
Okay. Good.

685
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,102
What you did,
I'm, um... really grateful.

686
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,210
It's cool.

687
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,700
So if you need anything else,
I guess...

688
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,909
just let me know.

689
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:49,965
Well, I do need something.

690
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:53,177
But it's not for me.

691
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
Take it to the end. Move.

692
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,255
So how you doing?

693
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,900
You look terrific, really mature.

694
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,927
Your mother would be proud.

695
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,400
Thanks.

696
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I've, uh, really missed you a lot,

697
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,173
And I'm sorry for, uh...
for everything.

698
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,550
I hope you can forgive me.
I want us to be friends.

699
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,740
And that's the only reason
you wanted to see me, right?

700
00:38:22,911 --> 00:38:25,000
So we could be friends?

701
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,817
Yes.

702
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,110
Okay.

703
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,568
That's great. That's fine.

704
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,300
Well, there is one other thing.

705
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh. Yeah.

706
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,500
It's just...
Felicia Tillman faked her death.

707
00:38:43,707 --> 00:38:46,488
She's still out there.
You and I, we both know that.

708
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,600
If you gave or lent me some money,

709
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,900
I could hire someone to track her down,

710
00:38:52,317 --> 00:38:53,699
And then I could get out of here,

711
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:56,147
And you and I could
pick up where we left off.

712
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,510
Okay...

713
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,200
you asked me how I was doing.

714
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,828
I'm actually doing great.

715
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,599
I've got the hottest,
most amazing girlfriend

716
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,299
in the entire world,
and I am gonna marry that woman.

717
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,691
I'm gonna buy her
everything she wants.

718
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,300
So...

719
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,524
I have got to learn to say no
when people ask me for money,

720
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,500
Because I got a future wife
to think about.

721
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,800
She's got really expenveve taste.

722
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,600
I mean, I do forgive you, though...

723
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,661
Paul.

724
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,500
Hey, Susan.

725
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,999
Hey. You're back.

726
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,300
Yeah, Zach young posted my bail,

727
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,299
But I'm guessing you had
something to do with it.

728
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Maybe a little.

729
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,800
Is there any way
that I can thank you,

730
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:07,948
You know, for everything you've done?

731
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,200
Actually, yeah, there is.

732
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,262
Good. Good. Just tell me.

733
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,526
I can't see you anymore.

734
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:19,399
I want you to understand

735
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,854
it doesn't have anything
to do with you. It's just...

736
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,700
That's okay. It's not...

737
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,059
I think I get it.

738
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,312
Well, I, uh, I should probably go.

739
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,734
Bye.

740
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,000
Good luck with everything.

741
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,300
Good luck to you and Ian.

742
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>Yes, it can happen so quickly.</i>

743
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,877
<i>Life as we know it can change
in the blink of an eye.</i>

744
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,211
<i>Unlikely friendships can blossom...</i>

745
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,079
<i>important careers can be tossed aside...</i>

746
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,100
<i>a long-Lost hope can be rekindled.</i>

747
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:55,195
<i>Still, we should be grateful</i>

748
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:57,732
<i>for whatever changes life throws at us,</i>

749
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,828
<i>Because all too soon
the day will come...</i>

750
00:42:04,662 --> 00:42:07,300
<i>when there are no changes left.</i>

751
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:11,784
