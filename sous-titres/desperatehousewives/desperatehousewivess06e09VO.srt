1
00:00:00,964 --> 00:00:02,747
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:06,126
- <i>Gaby discovered a secret...</i>
- Your stomach just kicked me.

3
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:09,718
- I want you to run the Miami office.
- <i>So Carlos played hardball.</i>

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,891
- You can't fire me for being pregnant.
- I'm offering you a promotion.

5
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:16,263
If you choose to turn it down
and quit instead, I can't stop you.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,931
- <i>Katherine broke down.</i>
- The man I love chose you. It's over.

7
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:23,184
- Why has this been so hard on me?
- You love him.

8
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:25,565
I found a way to spring
you from this marriage.

9
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:27,169
<i>Karl made a plan.</i>

10
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:29,691
If he violates parole by
associating with a known felon,

11
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:33,617
they can revoke it. All we need to do
is get some ex-con in a room with Orson,

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,905
take some pictures,
and it's bye-bye, Orson.

13
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,744
That's perfect! And then
he'll have to let me go.

14
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,261
<i>Nick made a call.</i>

15
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,830
Agent Padilla?
I'm thinking about coming in.

16
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:46,670
- <i>And evil...</i>
- Did you forget something?

17
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:49,085
- <i>Returned to the neighborhood.</i>
- What are you doing?

18
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,593
<i>Her name was Emily Portsmith,</i>

19
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:01,310
<i>and word of her death</i>

20
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,291
<i>spread quickly.</i>

21
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:08,494
<i>You see,
everyone in town knew Emily.</i>

22
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:12,998
<i>Her family was well known
and respected,</i>

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,916
<i>She'd been popular in school...</i>

24
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:24,322
<i>And her customers
at the coffee shop adored her.</i>

25
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,725
<i>People were shocked
to hear she'd been murdered,</i>

26
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,370
<i>mostly because another
young woman had been attacked</i>

27
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:36,508
<i>just a few weeks before.</i>

28
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:42,602
<i>Yes, everyone in Fairview now knew</i>

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,385
<i>a killer was walking among them.</i>

30
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:51,165
<i>And they would soon learn...</i>

31
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:55,458
<i>He wasn't finished.</i>

00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:13,231
<i>The next day,
the women of Wisteria Lane</i>

35
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,097
<i>got together
for their weekly poker game.</i>

36
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,188
<i>But as it turned out,</i>

37
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:20,552
<i>no one was in the mood to gamble.</i>

38
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:24,264
The girl at coffee shop was strangled,
and Julie was attacked the same way.

39
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:27,892
- There is a madman on the loose.
- I'm afraid to leave my house at night.

40
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:30,720
At least now, you have
a boyfriend to protect you.

41
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:33,815
The man threw out his back
peeling an orange. I'm on my own here.

42
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:36,276
So what do we do
to protect ourselves?

43
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:38,344
Down at the hospital where I work,

44
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:41,960
they offer a self-defense class.
Maybe we should consider taking that.

45
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,111
- That's a good idea.
- I guess we could,

46
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:46,152
but you know my motto...

47
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:48,661
38 special is a girl's best friend.

48
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:50,790
I love the pearl handle.

49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,293
It would look so good
with my white suit.

50
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,545
Susan, you should feel it.
It's so light.

51
00:02:56,403 --> 00:03:00,216
I don't touch guns anymore, not
since I accidentally grazed Katherine.

52
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:02,844
Still going with
"accidentally," are we?

53
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:09,291
We're gonna take a self-defense class.
You wanna come with us?

54
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,899
It might make you feel safer.

55
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:16,591
I was taking out
the trash when I was attacked.

56
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,080
He came out of nowhere,

57
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,528
and I blacked out before
I knew what was happening.

58
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:26,201
If someone really wants
to get you, they can get you.

59
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,599
I'm off.

60
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:41,895
You're sewing Penny's costume?

61
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,773
I'm reading
the sports page while doing it,

62
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,805
so they kinda cancel each other out.

63
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,267
I got you this...

64
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:52,713
A pricey bourbon.

65
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:55,980
It's 8:45 in the morning,
and I'm pregnant. I think I'll pass.

66
00:03:56,721 --> 00:04:00,613
For Carlos. It's a "sorry
I lied about being pregnant" gift.

67
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,260
I don't need that.
I know Carlos.

68
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,409
He loses his temper, then
he calms down and thinks rationally.

69
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,910
- Good-bye.
- I'd still bring the booze.

70
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,865
I'm telling you, I am
too valuable right where I am.

71
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,999
There's no way he's gonna
try and send me to Florida.

72
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,859
What's going on?

73
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,637
Carlos told us about the promotion
in Florida. Congratulations.

74
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,987
You are going to be so missed
around here!

75
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,914
Where you going?
Rita wrote you a good-bye poem.

76
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,331
Can I see you in my office, please?

77
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:44,904
What do you think you're doing?
You know I'm not moving to Florida.

78
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,533
Then we just change the banner to read,
"good luck and so long."

79
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:52,495
It needs to read, "I told you I'm
not leaving. Someone get me a bagel."

80
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:54,746
What can I tell you?

81
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,718
We have an opening for you
in our Florida branch. But here,

82
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:01,504
- your job's already been given to Tim.
- Tell Tim you made a mistake.

83
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:03,095
I can't do that.

84
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:06,009
I guess this leaves you
no choice but to quit.

85
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:09,569
I know what you are doing,
and I am not going for it.

86
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,973
You want me gone,
you're gonna have to fire me.

87
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:15,162
And open myself up to a lawsuit
by firing a pregnant woman?

88
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,519
I don't think so.

89
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:20,291
Then if you don't mind,
I have work to do.

90
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,460
These aren't my kids.

91
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:27,113
Those are Tim's kids.

92
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:28,865
This is his office now.

93
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:30,925
So...

94
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,412
What office will I be using?

95
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:42,368
Are you kidding me?

96
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:44,297
These twins have a bigger office.

97
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:47,227
Enjoy.

98
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,349
How you doing?

99
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:56,851
I'm okay.

100
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,569
Everybody think whoever killed Emily
was the same person who attacked me.

101
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,409
That's what the police are saying.

102
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:12,158
And I think that we should do
everything we can to help them.

103
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:15,453
Meaning what?

104
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:19,242
Maybe now is the time to tell them
about the married man you were seeing.

105
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,293
He had nothing to do with it.

106
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,768
You don't know that.
Men who cheat sometimes have

107
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,944
- more than one girlfriend.
- Mom, listen...

108
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:29,300
There is no way he could ever
hurt someone, much less kill them.

109
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,268
If you're sure.

110
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:38,435
I am.

111
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,230
I mean, why would he attack me
and then wanna get back together?

112
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:45,775
Wait. Have you started
seeing him again?

113
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,405
Even if I did, it is my life, right?

114
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,703
That's right. It is your life.

115
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:01,588
Is it just me, or was life

116
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:04,043
much less
complicated when you were 7?

117
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,248
Sorry I grew up.

118
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,406
Me, too.

119
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:20,788
<i>Police are concerned
that the strangling of Portsmith</i>

120
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:23,068
<i>is connected to a similar attack</i>

121
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:25,781
<i>on a Fairview woman
earlier this year.</i>

122
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,362
<i>Anyone with information
is being asked to call...</i>

123
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:32,488
Just think. If the cops
hadn't wasted so much time on Danny,

124
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,491
they might've caught this guy
before he did this again, right?

125
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:39,746
What?

126
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,246
I was there.

127
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,647
- You were where?
- At the coffee shop.

128
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:49,047
I got there right when
that girl was closing up.

129
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:51,466
- Please be kidding.
- I wish I was.

130
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,287
I'm pretty sure
I was her last customer.

131
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,682
- But did anybody see you?
- No. I don't think so,

132
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:02,398
but that doesn't mean the cops won't
figure out I was there. If they do...

133
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,576
They're gonna wanna come and talk
to you again and maybe run your prints.

134
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:08,593
That's what I was thinking.

135
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,072
I was also thinking that maybe
we shouldn't wait for that to happen.

136
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:19,009
I'm not moving again.
Not this time.

137
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:22,538
I like this place!
I have friends. I have a job.

138
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:25,587
I feel like
a real person here again.

139
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,712
After 18 years of being a ghost,
I don't wanna give that up.

140
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:34,338
Fine.

141
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:39,123
Maybe we'll get lucky,
and the cops just won't come.

142
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:40,615
But honestly,

143
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:43,779
I don't know how much more luck
we got left.

144
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,713
Are you Lamar Benjamin?

145
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,952
- You got a warrant?
- No. I'm not with the police.

146
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,704
My name is Bree Hodge.

147
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:20,845
You know my husband Orson
from the state penitentiary.

148
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:22,348
Do you have a moment?

149
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:25,977
I got nothing but moments.

150
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,454
So you're Mrs. Hodge?

151
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,053
Damn.

152
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,160
Flossy did okay for hisself.

153
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,341
- "Flossy"?
- That's what we called Orson

154
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:48,916
'cause he got us dental floss and
nagged us to use it after every meal.

155
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:51,883
- I see.
- Pain in the ass.

156
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,386
I was glad when someone used it to
strangle a guard and they took it all.

157
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,228
How's Orson doing?

158
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:03,097
To be honest, Lamar,

159
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:05,752
life on the outside's
been a little hard for him.

160
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,687
People can be so judgmental
about men who have served time.

161
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:12,857
And if you're a repeat offender,
you can forget it.

162
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:19,647
I've heard Orson speak very
fondly of his prison friends,

163
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,407
especially you.

164
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,917
Really?
Cause he seemed kinda mad

165
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:26,551
after I used him as a shield
in that yard fight.

166
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,709
He just tells that story
now and laughs and laughs.

167
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:35,239
Anyway, he's been feeling
a little blue,

168
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:38,633
and I was hoping you would pay
him a visit and cheer him up.

169
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:41,594
Sorry.
I'd be breaking my parole.

170
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,890
They catch me hanging out with other
ex-cons, they can send me back to jail.

171
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:49,031
Really? That's a silly rule.

172
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:52,574
Don't worry, though. Our house is
on the end of a very quiet cul-de-sac.

173
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:55,191
No one would even know
you stopped by.

174
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:00,188
And, of course,
I would compensate you...

175
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,575
for your time.

176
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:11,749
And another 3 when you come.

177
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,228
What the hell?

178
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,922
No harm in a little social call.

179
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,593
But you can't tell anybody I came.

180
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,887
When you get to know me better,

181
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:28,200
you'll find I have no trouble...
keeping secrets.

182
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:38,137
- What are you doing here?
- Your mom told me you were upset.

183
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:40,194
I told her I knew how
to make you feel better.

184
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:41,970
Mint chocolate chip?

185
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,742
I know this one's gonna take
a lot more than ice cream.

186
00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:49,427
I keep thinking about him.

187
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,672
He's out there, and...

188
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:55,876
- maybe he's thinking about me.
- Honey, he's not.

189
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:59,236
He knows where I live.
He knows what kind of car I drive.

190
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:02,425
I wanted to go to the library,
but I'm afraid he's gonna follow me.

191
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:05,761
If you're worried about your car,
why don't we switch for a while?

192
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,674
Seriously? I'd drive your fancy car,

193
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,891
and you'd drive
my tiny, little compact?

194
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,869
There's nothing
I would not do for my little...

195
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,938
You have air conditioning, right?

196
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:20,651
Yeah, there's nothing I wouldn't
do for my little girl.

197
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,998
You okay?

198
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,966
I'm just having a bad day.

199
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,373
My life has gotten sort of...

200
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:42,048
complicated.

201
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:43,816
Why?

202
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:48,080
It's...
grown-up relationship stuff.

203
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,722
You wouldn't understand.

204
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,134
But...

205
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:58,022
Since you asked...

206
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,283
So, I think you're really gonna
have fun at Brandon's party.

207
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:06,812
I heard there's gonna be a pony.

208
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,501
You okay?

209
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,952
I'm worried about Mrs. Mayfair.

210
00:13:13,346 --> 00:13:15,995
- Why?
- She's not getting any younger,

211
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,959
and it's really hard
to meet guys in this town.

212
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,879
Where did you hear that?

213
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,589
She told me.

214
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:25,966
She also said

215
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:30,550
mommy stole you from her,
and that makes mommy a bad person.

216
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,291
Buddy...

217
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,312
your mommy is a great person.

218
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,027
Why don't you...

219
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,833
sign Brandon's card.

220
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,956
And, I'll be right back.

221
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:53,536
Mike, watch it.

222
00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:56,078
Did you actually tell
my 6-year-old son

223
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:57,873
that his mother's a bad person?

224
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:04,742
I would've used
more colorful language,

225
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,466
but like you said, he's only 6.

226
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:10,974
You've never really
seen me get angry.

227
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:13,425
But if you want to,

228
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:15,724
just talk to my son one more time.

229
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,312
Then you'll know
what I'm capable of.

230
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:28,529
I love MJ, I would never
do anything to hurt him.

231
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:31,238
One more time.

232
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,242
It's your mother.

233
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,063
Am interrupting anything?

234
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:05,149
Nope. I'm just at the library.

235
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,044
Really.

236
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:08,486
The library.

237
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,863
I thought I'd dive
into an old favorite.

238
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:13,491
And vice versa, I'm sure.

239
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,577
<i>Honey, I don't blame you.</i>

240
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:19,513
You've gone back to that place
because it seems...

241
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:21,749
safe and comforting. Am I right?

242
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:24,502
I guess.

243
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:27,922
But trust me, it's a bad idea.

244
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:31,217
Can we talk later? I only have an hour,
and I really wanna finish.

245
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,845
I want you out of there right now!

246
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,042
I'll see you soon.

247
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,371
You bet you will.

248
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:44,856
You've been a busy girl.

249
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,730
You got the ex-con booked,

250
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,600
hidden cameras all set up.

251
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,245
Come friday night...

252
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:52,530
Showtime.

253
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:56,912
What's the matter?

254
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,245
We should be celebrating.

255
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,049
I just hope we're both
clear that these photos

256
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:03,833
are strictly for blackmail.

257
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,970
Of course. We're not actually
gonna send him to prison.

258
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,108
Unless, I mean, we have to.

259
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:12,716
Even if he calls our bluff,
we are not gonna turn him in.

260
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,486
Excuse me.

261
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:22,231
I'm looking for the person that belongs
to the blue car. She's a redhead.

262
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,899
With a man?

263
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,564
She's with a man.
The redhead's my daughter.

264
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:28,196
Your daughter?

265
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,965
Damn.

266
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,778
- You look good.
- Thank you.

267
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,239
Can you tell me
what room they're in?

268
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:41,537
I may not love him anymore, but I'm not
gonna win my freedom by taking away his.

269
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:46,083
Now you're angry.

270
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:50,834
When you tell me you could
never hurt a man you used to love,

271
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:52,786
it doesn't make me angry.

272
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,093
It just reminds me
why I love you so much.

273
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,593
Don't you worry.

274
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,811
No one's gonna get hurt.

275
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:17,364
Can you tell Carlos I'm here for lunch?
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.

276
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:18,940
I'll tell him.

277
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:34,465
I'd ask you in, but there's enough
oxygen in here for the both of us.

278
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:36,132
No, it's...

279
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:37,744
comfy.

280
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,477
I get that Carlos
is trying to punish me.

281
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:48,604
But enough is enough.
You gotta talk to him.

282
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:51,560
You never even came to
me to tell me you were pregnant.

283
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,076
- This is between you and Carlos.
- I know you're upset,

284
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:56,450
but me keeping my pregnancy
secret wasn't personal.

285
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:57,817
Wasn't it?

286
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,479
Tom and I are still in debt.

287
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:04,079
I needed this promotion, and Carlos
had already passed over a coworker

288
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,581
because she was pregnant.
I couldn't risk your telling him.

289
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,626
Because you thought I'd
tell Carlos, and he'd fire you.

290
00:18:11,663 --> 00:18:14,338
So clearly I wasn't enough
of a friend for you to trust me.

291
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:18,842
But now I'm such a good friend.
I'm the only one who can fix it for you?

292
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:22,304
I'm guessing you're not gonna
talk to Carlos.

293
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:24,032
Good guess.

294
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:43,575
- I can't believe she's dead.
- I know.

295
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,774
I just saw her a few days ago.

296
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,997
We talked about going to the mall.

297
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,412
- Who found her?
- The assistant manager.

298
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:53,924
I was late yesterday.
Thank god.

299
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,231
It would've freaked me out.

300
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:01,425
- We were just talking about Emily.
- Yeah, I...

301
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:03,592
didn't really know her, but...

302
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,723
I guess we're sort of connected now.

303
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:08,683
You would've liked her.
She was super nice.

304
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:12,221
I gotta go home. My mom's so
freaked out that this could've been me,

305
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,960
- she wants me around.
- I'll give you a ride.

306
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:20,320
- We should go, too, Danny.
- No, you go ahead.

307
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:22,865
But... don't you need a ride?

308
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:24,708
No, I'll walk.

309
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,745
I just wanna talk to Julie.

310
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:39,965
You wanna get something to eat?

311
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,676
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

312
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:46,171
Maybe you wanna
go to Emily's funeral together?

313
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:47,556
Everybody's going.

314
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,223
I know you like me,

315
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:53,729
but I can't hang out with you.

316
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:55,522
Why not?

317
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,226
I just can't.

318
00:19:57,954 --> 00:19:59,693
It's complicated.

319
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:03,966
It's 'cause you slept
with my dad, isn't it?

320
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:08,466
- Who told you that?
- I figured out a while ago.

321
00:20:09,254 --> 00:20:11,001
If you know that, why you still...

322
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,729
Because I like you!

323
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:15,826
A lot.

324
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,214
Do you not see how weird that is?

325
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:24,327
It's okay 'cause I've forgiven you.

326
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,620
That's nice,

327
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,245
but it's still weird.

328
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,104
Please, I wanna be with you.

329
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,202
I am so sorry,

330
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:39,566
but that is never going to happen.

331
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,140
Come on, if they're gonna
come, they're gonna come.

332
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:19,453
I feel like I spent my entire
life looking out windows.

333
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,286
Maybe it's time we stop.

334
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,873
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying

335
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,292
maybe it's time
we thought about coming in.

336
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:38,052
Please tell me
you didn't talk to them.

337
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,996
Calm down. I'm not an idiot.
I used a prepaid, and the call

338
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,973
lasted less than a minute. There's
no way they're ever gonna find us.

339
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,255
- They know we're alive!
- Don't you wanna know

340
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:50,574
- if they're ready to make a deal?
- I killed a man.

341
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:53,768
They'll be ready to make a deal when
I got a needle in my arm and my eyes

342
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:56,171
- are rolled back in my head!
- You don't know that.

343
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:59,024
You are never talking to them again!
Do you hear me?

344
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:06,114
I still can't get that image
of Lynette out of my head.

345
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,741
The only thing missing in
that cramped little office

346
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:11,180
was a hamster wheel and wood chips.

347
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:15,560
I figure a couple more days of this,
she'll be ready to pack her things.

348
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,210
She does deserve this, right?

349
00:22:22,564 --> 00:22:24,914
She lied when
she took the promotion.

350
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:27,781
What if her doctor
had put her on bed rest?

351
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,838
What if I needed her
to fly somewhere?

352
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:32,097
She could've put the
whole company in jeopardy.

353
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:36,063
Yeah, but that never happened. And
you said she was doing a good job and

354
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,440
now you're doing all
these mean things to her.

355
00:22:38,883 --> 00:22:42,027
Me? This was your idea.
You wanted to put snakes in her office.

356
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:43,698
Rubber snakes.

357
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:46,939
We are completely justified here.

358
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,740
You're right.

359
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:52,948
You're right, which is why
we have the opportunity

360
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:55,166
to do something
we never do, Carlos...

361
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,333
forgive.

362
00:22:58,981 --> 00:22:59,981
Seriously?

363
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:02,589
Tom and Lynette have been
our friends for 15 years.

364
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,839
They gave us sausage-of-the-month
last Christmas.

365
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:07,925
Those were good sausages.

366
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:12,599
I know Lynette. She would never
set out to intentionally hurt us.

367
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,353
I gotta admit, I do
sort of miss those guys.

368
00:23:17,092 --> 00:23:19,788
You should've seen her when
I was leaving her office.

369
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:22,943
She had this look in her
eyes. She was so defeated.

370
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,160
You should've seen
this look in her eyes.

371
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,162
It was like,
"screw you Lynette. I win!"

372
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:30,469
- So that's when you called the lawyer?
- They're not getting away with this.

373
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:33,459
They are not gonna harass me.
I am gonna sue their ass! And Carlos

374
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:35,726
is being served papers tomorrow.

375
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:38,493
You're really gettin'
worked up here.

376
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:40,877
We are not having angry sex.

377
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:43,064
Just thought I'd ask.

378
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:52,149
What did I tell you about
puttin' away those clothes?

379
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:56,733
I'm serious. Nap time's over!

380
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:11,921
Any woman can be the
victim of a violent crime.

381
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:14,911
That is why it's necessary to
learn how to defend yourself.

382
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,025
A parking lot, a park,
your own driveway.

383
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:21,330
An attack can happen anywhere.
It only takes a few seconds.

384
00:24:21,497 --> 00:24:24,447
Sorry I'm late. I had
three parties to prep for.

385
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,261
How tiring that must be for you,
juggling all those affairs.

386
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:31,219
Okay, everyone, team up.
I want an attacker and a victim.

387
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:33,638
Gaby, you wanna attack me?

388
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:35,932
I don't wanna hurt you.

389
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:38,810
Please. I've eaten burgers
bigger than you. Bring it on.

390
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,710
All right, granny.
Prepare to break a hip.

391
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,860
So... looks like we're partners.
Do you wanna attack me?

392
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,301
I could be persuaded.

393
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:52,568
Now, attackers, I want you
to approach your victim.

394
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,122
Freakishly strong old lady here!

395
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:01,917
I credit the bran.

396
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:05,809
That's very impressive.
But the rest of you,

397
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:09,476
approach your victim from behind.
Place her in a chokehold.

398
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,194
Now, victims, your impulse
will be to pull away. Wrong.

399
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:16,191
You'll just choke harder.
Instead, I want you to push back on

400
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:19,060
your attacker, using your weight
to push him off balance.

401
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:21,386
A little tight.

402
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:22,836
I'm sorry.

403
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:26,404
This feels bad, huh?

404
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:29,532
Being betrayed by someone
you trusted not to hurt you?

405
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:32,501
- What are you talking about?
- I know about you and Karl.

406
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,119
Traitor!

407
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:37,903
Stop it!

408
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,318
You can't talk
your way out of an attack.

409
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:43,989
- Jab with your elbows.
- I am trying to!

410
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:48,715
How could you?! You
know how Karl treated me.

411
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,470
Susan, I am sorry.
If you... Let me explain...

412
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,177
Okay, now,
attacker and victim, switch.

413
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,459
- You heard him! Switch!
- I am not letting you get behind me!

414
00:25:57,626 --> 00:25:59,528
You've already
stabbed me in the back!

415
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:03,545
- Mrs. Delfino, release your victim.
- She is not the victim here!

416
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:08,275
What about Orson?
How could you do this to him?!

417
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,740
You know nothing about
my marriage to Orson.

418
00:26:11,907 --> 00:26:14,510
- He has put me through hell this year!
- Bree, too tight!

419
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:16,885
I know you're angry...
but Karl means more to me

420
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:19,074
than just a fling,
and I am not giving him up.

421
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:23,245
So if that means our friendship is over
then that's your decision, not mine.

422
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:28,920
You're going? We just got started.

423
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,670
I know but I think I've defended
myself enough for one day.

424
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,603
I just got a call from the lawyer. They
are gonna be serving Carlos any minute.

425
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:47,953
You're really going
through with this, huh?

426
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:50,565
We're not bad people, are we, Tom?

427
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:54,168
What Carlos is doing to you
is totally unfair and illegal.

428
00:26:54,335 --> 00:26:58,158
- No, we're good people.
- Right, he started it. Screw him.

429
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,791
What's all this?

430
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,690
Candy, flowers, baby gift.

431
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:13,632
Sort of my way of saying, "I'm sorry,
and here's some crap to prove it."

432
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,632
Really?

433
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,604
I don't want to fight anymore,
and neither does Carlos.

434
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,621
I was hoping we could talk.

435
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:23,683
I am so happy!

436
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:26,767
Here, take it. It's gettin' heavy.

437
00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:28,787
I missed you!

438
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:37,189
Honey, we're having a moment
here. Please don't spoil it.

439
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,356
I'm not what's gonna spoil it.

440
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:44,971
Could you hold on a second?

441
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:47,123
I'm gonna make a quick phone call.

442
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,167
You know what?
I don't care what happens.

443
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,420
Let's not let anything interfere
with our friendship ever again.

444
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:54,881
Remember you said that.

445
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,008
Answer the phone. Answer the phone.

446
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,050
What?!

447
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:12,411
It's Carlos. I wonder what he wants.

448
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:16,589
You know what you said
about our friendship before?

449
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:19,188
Let's just make
a pact that we should...

450
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:20,355
What's up?

451
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,912
- I will never forgive you for this.
- Gaby, please. What about our pact?

452
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,544
We never made a pact!
Here, MJ, catch.

453
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,922
You have to understand.
I was just protecting myself.

454
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,259
- Hello, ladies. What's new?
- Lynette's suing Carlos. Here.

455
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,299
Once you apologized, I
tried to call the guy off.

456
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:47,470
Lynette, you wanted to sue us!
That proves that you are not my friend!

457
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:50,020
- Karen! Here's some candy.
- Trying to cut down.

458
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,105
Really? At your age, why bother?

459
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:55,150
Please, I need to talk to you.

460
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,319
No, you need to talk to my lawyer.

461
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:13,758
Got a project for you.

462
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,760
- Who's this?
- Steve Matthews from legal.

463
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:20,633
You know, since we all seem
to be lawyering up around here.

464
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:23,284
Look, I was just trying
to protect myself.

465
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:24,901
It's just business.

466
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:29,610
This is the department's purchases
and expenses from the last fiscal year.

467
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,313
- I'm gonna need all of that itemized...
- Done.

468
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:35,398
By tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.

469
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,970
I... hate it when I'm
the only one laughing.

470
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:45,639
This is at least two days' work.

471
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:47,506
Not if you work tonight.

472
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,582
Penny's Christmas pageant is tonight.
You know that. You go every year.

473
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:57,278
Lynette, are you telling me that
you're unable to... What was it again?

474
00:29:57,445 --> 00:30:00,715
Unable to perform the assigned task
in a timely manner.

475
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,182
Yeah, that's it.

476
00:30:03,854 --> 00:30:06,943
Tell your undertaker friend
that I will get the assignment done...

477
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,390
in a timely manner.

478
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:11,516
Great. And will you tell Penny
Gaby and I

479
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:14,813
are gonna have to miss her pageant
this year? And we are so sorry.

480
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:28,576
Thank you both for coming. Before
we get started, can I get you anything?

481
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:32,497
Given what you're about to do to us,
I'll take a cigarette and a blindfold.

482
00:30:33,823 --> 00:30:35,023
I have decided

483
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,110
to put aside my rage
and sense of betrayal.

484
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:40,199
I'm here to help you.

485
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,048
- Really?
- Not you.

486
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,381
If you are actually considering having
a serious relationship with this man,

487
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:52,330
then I wanna make sure
that you have all the facts.

488
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:53,947
What kind of facts?

489
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,279
Karl facts.

490
00:30:57,963 --> 00:31:00,863
Tell Bree what you
got me for my 30th birthday.

491
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:04,620
- Who can remember? It was so long ago.
- Nothing!

492
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:07,737
He got me nothing
because he forgot my birthday.

493
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:10,702
- And it wasn't that long ago.
- I don't see the point of...

494
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,621
Now tell her where you
spent our tenth anniversary.

495
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,335
- I'm sorry. What was that?
- A strip club.

496
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,712
That's nothing.

497
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:26,029
Now tell her what you wanted
for your 35th birthday.

498
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,552
Come on.

499
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,674
He wanted me to ask a friend

500
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:32,557
to join us in the bedroom.

501
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:37,061
You kept saying
I was hard to shop for.

502
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:39,424
There he is, Bree.

503
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:42,525
That is the man you
say you wanna be with.

504
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:46,298
Susan, I went into this
with my eyes wide open.

505
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:49,932
I know who Karl was and
who he sometimes still is, but

506
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:52,535
I believe him when he says
he wants to change. And...

507
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,580
isn't that what you're supposed to do
when you love someone?

508
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:01,439
Did you say... "love"?

509
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:08,343
I think I did.

510
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:12,191
I have to ask you one question.

511
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:14,008
Are you drinking again?

512
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,684
Okay, okay, I was just checking.

513
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:19,789
Well...

514
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,538
if that's really the way you feel,

515
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:25,121
then you should be with him.

516
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,987
And you have... my blessing.

517
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,188
Really? You can forgive
me just like that?

518
00:32:32,355 --> 00:32:36,255
You know, I was doing a lot of thinking
since, you know, yesterday,

519
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,022
and I realized that...

520
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,086
it's hard to find... love.

521
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:47,715
And when you do, you should grab it.
And who cares what anybody thinks?

522
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,179
And I really do want you to
be as happy as I am with Mike.

523
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:56,683
Thank you, Susan.

524
00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:02,124
Don't worry, Susie Q.

525
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,148
I'm going to do right by her.

526
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,692
You really think you can change?

527
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,780
Well, it's easy when you've found
a woman worth changing for.

528
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:13,977
I didn't mean...

529
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:18,533
Learned that in self-defense class.

530
00:33:24,342 --> 00:33:27,192
We're taking off.
Wish your little angel luck.

531
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,491
Good luck, sweetie.
Now remember, your dad's

532
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:32,937
gonna videotape your pageant,
and we're all gonna watch it tomorrow.

533
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:36,598
Sweetie, I'm sorry. You
know I'd be there, but...

534
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,839
You have to work.
It's okay.

535
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:51,298
Hey, guys! Wait up!

536
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:58,119
The doctor's putting him
under observation for 72 hours.

537
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,313
It's standard procedure for...

538
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:04,647
a suicide attempt.

539
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,710
It's okay, Mona.
Thanks for everything.

540
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
My baby...

541
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:17,472
what were you thinkin', huh?

542
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:30,568
I'm sorry I called the feds.

543
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:35,646
I was trying
to make your life easier

544
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:38,763
after all the things I'd
done to make it harder.

545
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,261
Look what I've done to this kid.

546
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:49,599
November 10th, 1991.

547
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:53,048
It rained all day. Remember?

548
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:57,421
You went to the diner before
we went to meet up with the others.

549
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:00,761
I had pumpkin pancakes.

550
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:03,566
You didn't have anything.

551
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:05,313
I had coffee.

552
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:08,128
I forget my umbrella in the booth.

553
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:13,276
And then eight hours later,
neither of us existed anymore.

554
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,920
I had to run,

555
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,484
but you didn't.

556
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,637
You gave up a hell of a lot
just so I wouldn't be alone.

557
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:28,687
I'd do it again.

558
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:32,282
I'd do anything for you guys.

559
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:34,465
I hope you know that.

560
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:36,686
I do.

561
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:58,333
Good morning, Lynette. It's 9:00.

562
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:00,881
- Got my reports?
- Almost.

563
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,828
So are you telling me
you're not done?

564
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:06,315
I just need one more hour.

565
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:10,626
If only I needed them by 10:00.

566
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:14,779
Unfortunately, I told you
that I needed them by 9:00.

567
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:17,942
- Was I not clear?
- You were crystal clear.

568
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,931
It was impossible to get
all this work done in a night.

569
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:24,906
- You knew that when you gave it to me.
- Well, it wouldn't have been impossible

570
00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:27,673
if you'd skipped your
daughter's pageant.

571
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:29,902
I know you went.

572
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:33,674
Anyway, this is very painful for me,

573
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,569
but I have no other choice
but to terminate your employment.

574
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,864
You're really going to do this?

575
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,007
I believe
I'm within my legal rights.

576
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:46,662
You need to clear out your personal
belongings within the hour, Mrs. Scavo.

577
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,463
I was up all night on this.

578
00:36:56,365 --> 00:36:57,615
That's a shame.

579
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,593
So Mr. Matthews has some
paperwork for you to sign.

580
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:04,132
You're gonna regret this.
I'm not gonna go quietly.

581
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,760
I don't care how you go.

582
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,000
I just want you gone.

583
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:27,286
Good. You're up.

584
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,248
I'm Mona Clarke. I live down
the street from you and your folks.

585
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,953
I told them I would take
real good care of you.

586
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,270
Would you like some juice, Danny?

587
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:38,571
What?

588
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:41,807
It's not Danny.

589
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:45,697
My name's Tyler.

590
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:54,012
Bye, girls. Thanks for coming.

591
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,359
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to pick up MJ.

592
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,320
But she said you couldn't make it.
She was picking him up for you.

593
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:04,740
- Who? Susan?
- No, your neighbor Katherine.

594
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:06,387
What?!

595
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,705
Did I do something wrong?

596
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:28,960
Hi, daddy.

597
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:32,274
I drove by Eileen's, and I saw
my little buddy standing out there.

598
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:33,728
He looked so forlorn.

599
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:40,594
MJ, go home.

600
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:43,779
I figured you were late at some job,
so I thought I'd do you a favor.

601
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:45,669
Now.

602
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,033
What did I tell you?

603
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,091
I needed to talk to him, Mike.

604
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,009
He deserves to know the truth.

605
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,011
His mother lies to him.

606
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,598
He needs to know that what
you and I had was real.

607
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:14,310
You and I had nothing.

608
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:17,146
How can you say that?

609
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:18,767
It's true.

610
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,710
The whole time I was with you,

611
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:24,195
all I thought about was Susan.

612
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:26,752
Every time I held you,

613
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:29,075
every time I kissed you,

614
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:32,431
all I was thinking was,

615
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,762
God, I wish you were Susan.

616
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:50,706
If you mean it,

617
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,890
then please kill me.

618
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,267
It would be less painful.

619
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:06,697
I don't care enough
about you to kill you.

620
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:21,032
<i>The world is a dangerous place,</i>

621
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,848
<i>and we must learn
to defend ourselves</i>

622
00:40:24,015 --> 00:40:26,173
<i>from those who want to hurt us...</i>

623
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:33,116
<i>that stranger without a name...</i>

624
00:40:38,064 --> 00:40:40,505
<i>an employer who holds a grudge...</i>

625
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:47,416
<i>the husband who won't let go.</i>

626
00:40:49,538 --> 00:40:52,742
<i>Yes, we all try to defend ourselves</i>

627
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,909
<i>so we won't get hurt.</i>

628
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,400
I need an ambulance right away.

629
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:03,476
4356 Wisteria Lane.
Please hurry. I'm losing a lot of blood.

630
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,254
<i>Until the moment we realize...</i>

631
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:12,471
<i>our pain...</i>

632
00:41:14,697 --> 00:41:15,747
<i>can hurt...</i>

633
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,068
<i>someone else.</i>
