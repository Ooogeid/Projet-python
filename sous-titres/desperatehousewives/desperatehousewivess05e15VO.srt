1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,930
- He's in your band.  - This is too dangerous.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,360
There were victims of both violence

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,130
- and hard times.  - We're sort of broke.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,830
- I thought Scavo's was doing well.  - When times get tough,

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,900
people do without things like pizza.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,300
And beneficiaries...

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,230
- The deal closed. I got the bonus.  - of good work...

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,760
and perseverance.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,430
Congratulations on your new job.

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,900
Congratulations on getting me out of your office.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,830
It's not hard

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,600
to spot a mother who works outside the home.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,900
Just look for someone who dresses in a hurry...

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,460
eats her breakfast while rushing to her car...

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,400
and applies her makeup as she drives away.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,430
But the surest way

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,800
to spot a mother who works outside the home?

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,500
- Just look for a child...  - M.J., why aren't you dressed?

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,730
We're gonna be late for our first day of school.

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,360
who gets sick at the worst possible moment.

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,730
Hey, guys. How you doing?

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,930
He's sick. I'm late. Thanks for helping.

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,660
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. I gotta work.  - So do I,

25
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,000
and it's my first day at a new job. I win.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,160
What... 

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,400
Look, I'd really like to help you out...

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,500
and spend some time with my best bud, but, uh,

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,830
Ms. Nelson's septic tank is expecting me at 9:00.

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,630
You're a plumber. Ms. Nelson is not expecting you on time.

31
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,460
In fact, if you show up before dinner, she'll turn cartwheels.

32
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm a teacher. It's different.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,530
Wait, I thought you were just a teacher's assistant.

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,060
Well...

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,660
Listen to me.

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,660
The whole reason I went back to work is so we could both afford

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,530
to give M.J. the things we felt he needed.

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,960
Now I'm doing my part. It's time you do yours.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,460
I'll reschedule Ms. Nelson.

40
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,530
I gotta go.

41
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,530
You get lots of rest and drink plenty of fluids, okay?

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,300
You never left me when I'm sick before.

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,800
Oh, I know, honey.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,300
But mommy has a job now. 

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,900
Come on. We talked about this. You understand, right?

46
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,660
Don't be sad.

47
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,130
I am gonna pick you both up at 6:00.

48
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,060
Yes, it's not hard

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,960
to spot a mother who works outside the home.

50
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
Just look for a woman

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,030
who leaves her house every morning

52
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,760
feeling incredibly guilty.

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,100
It begins just after sundown.

54
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,330
After a long day at the office,

55
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,830
exhausted people start coming home.

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,430
Some are met by faithful pets...

57
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,930
some are welcomed with dry Martinis.

58
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:20,030
Others are greeted with dinner on the table.

59
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,160
Then there are those

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,530
who return from a long day at work...

61
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,660
only to discover...

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,260
unpleasant surprises.

63
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,030
Oh! Good. You got my note. Come on in.

64
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,160
Okay, sure. Uh, where's M.J.?

65
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,330
Here I am, mommy.

66
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,260
Oh, hey, baby. How's my boy?

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,330
I missed you so much. 

68
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you feeling better?

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,030
Yeah. Katherine made me soup

70
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,030
and read me a story

71
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,330
and showed me how to play Blackjack.

72
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,700
Well, are you gonna remember?

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,030
Always double down on a pair of Aces.

74
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,200
That's cute.

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,700
Where's Mike?

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,230
Plumbing emergency.

77
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,230
Ms. Nelson's toilet began erupting,

78
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,060
and I wasn't busy, so...

79
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,430
Uh-huh.

80
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,530
Well, uh, thank you very much for helping us out.

81
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,900
Come on, M.J. It's time to go.

82
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,400
Thank you.

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,460
We already thanked her, buddy.

84
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,660
Let's not make her uncomfortable.

85
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,360
Thank you for having us over.

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,400
We are so honored

87
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
to be the first guests in your new home.

88
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,130
Your stunning new home. I can't believe this.

89
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,160
The theme of my first place was early American Bean Bag. 

90
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Well, it's all Andrew.

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,430
He's the one with the taste. Please.

92
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,160
Uh, he's running late.

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,400
Um, do you know why?

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,930
Ah, he's cleaning up a little mess.

95
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,930
Someone didn't know you couldn't serve

96
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,060
bacon-wrapped shrimp puffs at a bar mitzvah.

97
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,660
I knew. I just thought if they'd tasted mine,

98
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
they might change the rules. 

99
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,900
So would you like something to nibble on before dinner?

100
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,260
Is that cut crystal?

101
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,100
It's exquisite.

102
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Andrew again. He's got expensive taste.

103
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,160
Thank god he brings in the big bucks.

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,960
He does?

105
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,600
Well, he does now, ever since you gave him that raise.

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,630
This is a delicious snack.

107
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,460
Did you make this?

108
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,500
Uh, yeah. It's just...

109
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,830
party mix.

110
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,560
Oh.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,660
- You gave Andrew a raise?  - A tiny salary bump.

112
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,460
"Tiny" is not the word for your extraordinary generosity.

113
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,060
Oh, look! There's pretzels and cereal.

114
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,330
I can see why they call it "party mix."

115
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,330
It's like a party in a bowl.

116
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,560
- When you say "extraordinary"...  - He's exaggerating.

117
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,160
They're children.

118
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,160
It just looks like a lot of money to them.

119
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,800
My god! Is this a... '96 Latour?

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,900
I know. Andrew bought a case of it at a wine auction

121
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,730
to celebrate that huge raise.

122
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,230
Once you've had a few glasses of this,

123
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,930
you're not going to remember this evening at all.

124
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,730
We'll see.

125
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,260
Boy, dinner without the kids...

126
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,260
It's nice to eat without having macaroni thrown at you.

127
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,760
Yes.

128
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Well, we, uh, we really wanted to find a way

129
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
- to thank you both.  - Thank us for what?

130
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,700
Saving our marriage.

131
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,530
Please. It was our pleasure. How did we do that again?

132
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,930
Well, Bradley had been working around the clock,

133
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,930
and I was feeling neglected.

134
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,930
But things are different now that he has Carlos.

135
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,930
We have never felt closer.

136
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,830
And, Gaby, I know I've been relying on Carlos a lot.

137
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,900
I... I hope it's not a problem, his being away from home so much.

138
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,930
Oh, I'll be more willing to forgive

139
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,930
- once his bonus check comes in.  - And the only person

140
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,860
more excited than Gaby about that bonus is her jeweler.

141
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Brad, don't. It's been such a nice night.

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,700
He's gonna hear it tomorrow anyway.

143
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,860
Hear what?

144
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,630
Look, I'm sorry,

145
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,630
but we're forgoing bonuses this year.

146
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,530
Can I get anyone dessert?

147
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,030
Beat it. What?

148
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,530
It's the economy.

149
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,860
Um, our C.F.O. feels we need to do some belt tightening.

150
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,060
But do you know how much overtime Carlos has pulled?

151
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,330
How many trips he's taken? He's killed himself.

152
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,000
For god sakes, don't do this to my jeweler.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,960
But, Gaby, no one's getting a bonus, not even Brad.

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,500
So this was his bonus? A salad and a stuffed chicken breast?

155
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,300
Look, hopefully next year will be better.

156
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,160
We're ready for dessert now.

157
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,500
Wrap up ten lobsters to go.

158
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,160
Emhem.

159
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,630
Tom?

160
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,230
Come here.

161
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,260
We haven't had a customer in about a half an hour,

162
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,260
... so maybe we should just... 

163
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,930
... close up early.

164
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,700
No. I got an idea.

165
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,200
Hey, everybody, hey, take off your aprons...

166
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,760
And come sit near the window.

167
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,500
- What is this?  - It's called psychology.

168
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,800
Come on! Hey! Guys...

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,930
Nobody wants to eat in an empty restaurant, right?

170
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,630
So, guys, this is what we are gonna do.

171
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,760
As soon as you see someone go by,

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,930
... you laugh, act like you're having a great time.

173
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,460
It'll draw them in.

174
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
So now we have pretend customers?

175
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Gee, let's think of something to do...

176
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,530
... with all the pretend money we're gonna make.

177
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,630
Trust me. This is gonna work.

178
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,300
Okay, hey, you guys,

179
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
You're a group of old high school buddies.

180
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,400
You haven't seen each other since the big game.

181
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
And you two... you're on a hot date, okay?

182
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,030
All right.

183
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,500
Hey, look! There's somebody! Laugh! Have a great time.

184
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,360
Awesome. Just like that.

185
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,730
Okay...

186
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,230
As much as I love Tommy Scavo's Improv theater,

187
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,260
- ... we need to face some facts here.  - It's a slump.

188
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,530
We... we... we... we'll ride it out. We've done it before.

189
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,200
- We...  - It's not a slump.

190
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,500
In this economy, people aren't eating out as much.

191
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,000
Between that and Porter's legal bills...

192
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,500
... and paying Bree back,

193
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,000
... we are about a week away from going bankrupt.

194
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,260
Honey, please, have a little faith.

195
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,260
I did, for seven years.

196
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,730
Now I'm gonna be a realist, and I need you to be one, too.

197
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,760
Okay, I understand. You're worried. I am, too.

198
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,760
But we can make it. We just have to be creative.

199
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
But... if we sell this place now,

200
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,860
We can escape with some dignity and maybe even some money.

201
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,260
But if we keep on going like we are,

202
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,130
... we're gonna lose everything.

203
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,130
No!

204
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,230
No.

205
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,400
I am not going out like this.

206
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:08,360
I am not gonna be a failure. Please tell me they just all customers.

207
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,030
So with all the calories we just burned,

208
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,530
... I say we deserve a huge lunch at a fancy restaurant.

209
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,530
You do like to live well, honey.

210
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,560
Well, why not? Life is brief and mostly sucks.

211
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Gotta grab all the good you can...

212
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
... while you're on this side of the dirt.

213
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,060
That was very poetic.

214
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,500
But sure, we'll go any place you want.

215
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,460
Mmm! That was easy.

216
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,460
Well, since I'm on a roll, how about this?

217
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,460
Let's go away this weekend...

218
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,700
Pick a five-star hotel with a great spa and just live it up.

219
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,460
I don't know about that.

220
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,460
I've got a lot of stuff I need to do.

221
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,130
Oh, come on.

222
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,200
Big fluffy robes, long massages.

223
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,160
Do you hear that?

224
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,730
That buzzing.

225
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,860
Uh... No, I don't hear anything. 

226
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,830
- Oh, maybe it... it's...  - Shh! Shh!

227
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,260
I hear it up here sometimes.

228
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,560
What the hell is it?

229
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Hey, you know what?

230
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
I kind of like that hotel idea.

231
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,500
Really?

232
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,260
Yeah. You were right. Life is brief.

233
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,460
Why don't you go call the travel agent and see what's available?

234
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,030
You know, you're kinda sexy when you buckle.

235
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm gonna call right now.

236
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Dr. Heller? Listen, I got your latest text,

237
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,900
... but you know, it's been a few weeks now,

238
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,900
... and people are freaking out about you being gone so long.

239
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
So now there's a staff meeting on the 15th,

240
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,100
... and if you're not back by then, I'm just gonna...

241
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,630
... have to tell people that I don't know where you are.

242
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,630
So will you please just call me?

243
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,900
Hey, Mike. How's it going?

244
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Well, so far, I've broken off...

245
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
... three of these stupid plastic sprinkler heads.

246
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,060
But other than that, I'm great.

247
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
Well, good. Look, I was coming over to ask,

248
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,500
- ... what would you and Katherine think about going camping?  - Oh, man, I love camping. When?

249
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Well, my schedule gets busy on the 15th,

250
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
... so it would have to be before then.

251
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
- I don't know, this weekend?  - Oh, I'm definitely up for it.

252
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
Uh, I'm not sure if Katherine will be.

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,030
Well, if she doesn't go, then Edie won't go, and...

254
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,730
Well, I guess if Katherine knows another girl's coming,

255
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,030
- ... maybe I can convince her.  - Good. Tell her the menfolk will do all the hard work...

256
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,030
Build the fires, dig the latrines.

257
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,030
Hey, I wouldn't mention that, uh, latrine part...

258
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,260
... until we're actually at the campsite.

259
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,000
That's a good point.

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,360
I'll, uh, dig my gear out tonight. It's gonna be fun.

261
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,330
Yeah.

262
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,130
This is gonna be fun.

263
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,530
My, that's a beautiful pen.

264
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,530
Is it a Montblanc?

265
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,560
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, I've always wanted one.  - Ah.

266
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,060
Well, I guess you can afford it now with your new raise.

267
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,200
- Oh, you heard about that?  - I sure did.

268
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,030
Well, the chamber of commerce just called.

269
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,100
They've added 40 people to their guest list.

270
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,600
Damn it. I only planned for a hundred.

271
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,630
- W... we're gonna need tables.  - Relax. They always pull this crap.

272
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,630
So I called the rental company...

273
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,600
... and had them put a few extras on the truck. We'll be fine.

274
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Oh, thank god. But you know what?

275
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,560
We can tell the chamber people...

276
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
... that because it was so last-minute,

277
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,100
- ... we had to bump our fee by 30%.  - I like the way you think.

278
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,730
Ohh. What would we do without him?

279
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,230
Hmm, yes. He's worth every penny you pay him.

280
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,760
By the way... How many pennies is that?

281
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,130
I'm not discussing Andrew's salary with you.

282
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,060
It's none of your business.

283
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,130
You're right. It's not.

284
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,800
So... How much?

285
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Andrew moved into a new home.

286
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,760
I simply gave him a cost of living increase.

287
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
The cost of living in a home...

288
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,230
... with silver pens and rare French wines?

289
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,760
Honey, please don't do this.

290
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,730
Oh, my God. Is he making more than me?

291
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,260
Orson, drop it.

292
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,730
I am not telling you how much Andrew makes.

293
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,830
I'd be happy to give you that information, sir.

294
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,530
Am I speaking to the account holder?

295
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,600
No, I'm her... business partner.

296
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Very well. Account number?

297
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,560
Yes. Um, 8... 5... 9... 7... 3.

298
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,760
Name on the account?

299
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,300
Van de Kamp's old-fashioned foods.

300
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,460
And the password?

301
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,960
Password?

302
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,100
For security purposes.

303
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,860
Um...

304
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,760
Oh. Yes. Of course. It's, um...

305
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,560
Uh, you know... 

306
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,700
Uh, it's... it's completely slipped my mind.

307
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,200
It's the name of her childhood pet.

308
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,460
Oh. Right.

309
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,360
Uh...

310
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,700
Fluffy.

311
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,360
Nope. That's not it.

312
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,500
Fido?

313
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,800
No.

314
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,660
Spot? Rover?

315
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,830
Mittens?

316
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,030
Sorry, sir.

317
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,500
Uh, Marmaduke.

318
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,230
Old Yeller.

319
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,230
I cannot give out any information...

320
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,530
... without the password, which you obviously don't know.

321
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,530
Then ask me a different question.

322
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,430
How about her date of birth? Her social security number?

323
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,430
Good-bye, sir.

324
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,430
How about her real hair color?

325
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,900
Trust me, it's not what you think it is.

326
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,260
If you're looking to get fed, it's gonna be a while.

327
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
No, dad called a family meeting.

328
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,160
Yeah, mom, he said it's about the restaurant.

329
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,930
Oh, boy. I think I know what this is about.

330
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,730
Listen, kids,

331
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,100
Things have been tough down at the restaurant,

332
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,330
And I think your dad has finally decided to sell it.

333
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,230
Wow.

334
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,600
I know.

335
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,630
Is he gonna be okay?

336
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,630
I don't know. That's why we all have to be really supportive.

337
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,730
Are you with me?

338
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,200
Hey, guys.

339
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Good. You're all here.

340
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I love you, daddy.

341
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,260
Not yet.

342
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,760
So... I wanted to talk to you all about our pizzeria.

343
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,860
Just know we're 100% behind you.

344
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,230
That means a lot,

345
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,600
'Cause this was a really rough day for me.

346
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,400
I had to let all our employees go.

347
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,800
So starting tomorrow...

348
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,030
You kids are my new waitstaff.

349
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
Tom, what the hell are you talking about?

350
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,560
I got it all worked out. You and I will handle the days,

351
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,130
And the kids will join us after school and on the weekends.

352
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,100
Um, at the risk of sounding spoiled... No.

353
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,460
Come on! It'll be fantastic. We'll love working together.

354
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,830
Why? We don't even like living together.

355
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,000
Look, labor is our number one cost.

356
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,100
If we can eliminate it, we'll start making a profit again.

357
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
What, you're not even gonna pay us?

358
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,660
I'm 9! Is that even legal?

359
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,330
I think so.

360
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,430
But just to be safe, you're now 15. Happy birthday!

361
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,060
Mom, please do something.

362
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
I thought maybe after our conversation today,

363
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
You'd realize it's time to pack it in.

364
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,130
I have got to do this. I can't walk away from that place

365
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,130
Until I have done everything that I can possibly think of.

366
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,130
- But having the kids work there?  - You said that you were behind me 100%.

367
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,400
Really? That doesn't sound like me.

368
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,730
Lynette...

369
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,300
Okay. Fine.

370
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,830
Kids, we are going to support your father

371
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,460
By working in his restaurant.

372
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,460
You've got to be kidding me.

373
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,460
Just so you know, 30 years from now,

374
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,460
- When you and dad are old and feeble...  - you're putting us

375
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,930
In the cheapest nursing home you can find.

376
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,430
Yeah, I got it.

377
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,160
Mrs. Solis, I didn't realize you were here.

378
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I've got your bracelet all polished

379
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,660
And ready for a night on the town.

380
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,900
Oh, put it on and have a good time.

381
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,730
Turns out I'm not gonna be able to afford it right now...

382
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,730
Unless you can help me out on the price. 

383
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,360
What did you have in mind?

384
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
You give it to me,

385
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,030
And then call your insurance and say it was stolen?

386
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,830
I didn't think so.

387
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,330
I'm really sorry about the bracelet, Mrs. Solis.

388
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,930
Perhaps I can show you something a bit less expensive.

389
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,560
- Maybe some, uh, earrings...  - Oh, will you excuse me a minute?

390
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,000
Ah!

391
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,160
Carlos, get in here!

392
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,630
I got a real shockeroo for you!

393
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,630
You are not gonna believe this!

394
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,700
Brad! Hi.

395
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,360
Uh, what's going on?

396
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,860
He just stopped by with great news.

397
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,860
I'm getting that bonus after all.

398
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,300
Really?

399
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Well, I went to our C.F.O.

400
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
And I told him it just didn't seem fair

401
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,730
That my right-hand man should go unrewarded.

402
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,200
Isn't that great? What kind of guy does that?

403
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,160
Oh, I think I know the kind.

404
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,500
So, Brad...

405
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,300
What sort of bonus are we looking at?

406
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,260
How does 20 grand sound?

407
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,960
Like a great jumping off point.

408
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,900
Gaby.

409
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,500
Oh, honey, you heard Maria the other night.

410
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,230
Your hard work is what's brought them so much closer.

411
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
Pay no attention to my wife.

412
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,430
20 grand is a fantastic bonus.

413
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,060
You know, now that I hear the number out loud,

414
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,460
It does seem a little low, after all you've done.

415
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,800
25 is probably more fair.

416
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,260
Oh, Brad. Come on. Saving a marriage?

417
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
You can't put a price on that...

418
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,330
At least not a small one.

419
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,230
Gaby, will you knock it off?

420
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,800
You're being rude.

421
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,930
You're right. I'm sorry.

422
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,800
It's just... I really wanted to buy this bracelet I saw today

423
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,960
Downtown in this little jewelry shop.

424
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,930
You know the place, honey.

425
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,260
It's right next to the, um...

426
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,860
Lexington hotel.

427
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,060
30!

428
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,460
$30,000.

429
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,130
Are you sure?

430
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,330
Yes! You deserve it. You both do.

431
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,030
I don't know what to say.

432
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,530
You're the only one getting a bonus,

433
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,860
So what I think might be best is

434
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,630
If we all agreed not to say anything.

435
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,300
Do we all agree?

436
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Absolutely.

437
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you two to business.

438
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,200
All this negotiating just goes right over my head. 

439
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,300
Ha!

440
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,430
Thunder Mcfadden. What a hoot.

441
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,130
What's that?

442
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,860
Oh, it's my porn name.

443
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,130
A friend sent me an e-mail.

444
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,130
You take the name of your childhood pet

445
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,130
And the street you grew up on, and mix up?

446
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,560
That's the name you'd use if you were a porn star.

447
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,400
So I'm Thunder Mcfadden.

448
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,630
My buddy here is Snoop Windemere.

449
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,900
Mm. 

450
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,560
Hey, who would you be?

451
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,800
Orson, I'm preparing a buffet for 200.

452
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I don't have time to explore

453
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,630
My hypothetical career in the adult film industry.

454
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,260
Fine.

455
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,260
But you should know that's why people find you so rigid,

456
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,400
Because you can never just let go and have fun.

457
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,130
Coco saugatuck. Happy now?

458
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,900
Sure am.

459
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,960
Thanks, hon.

460
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,430
- Of course it could just as easily be Munchy Cedarhurst.  - What?

461
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,530
Or Taffy Swallow.

462
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,760
We moved around a lot and had three dogs.

463
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,800
Bree, focus.

464
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,060
It has to be your favorite pet.

465
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,660
Like if I asked you, "what's your childhood pet?"

466
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,430
- This is the one you'd say.  - Well, I didn't really have a favorite.

467
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,560
- I loved them all equally.  - Oh, please. If Coco, Taffy and Munchy were

468
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,830
- In a burning building and you could only save one...  - Orson, why are you being so morbid?

469
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,600
No. I-I just want to know your porn name.

470
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,100
Okay, fine.

471
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,500
If I had to pick a favorite, I guess it would be Munchy.

472
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,960
She was a bit rambunctious.

473
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Father sent her to a farm so she'd have room to run.

474
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,360
I cried for weeks and weeks.

475
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,200
Munchy, huh? This was fun.

476
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,900
All right, that's a large mushroom pepperoni pizza

477
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,000
And two salads. I'll get that started.

478
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,400
- Tom, I got need a large...  - Large pep/mush at table nine. I'm way ahead of you.

479
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,830
Thanks. And do you have the calzones for table three?

480
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,460
Oh, crap. Sweetie, I need two dinner salads.

481
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,830
- What's the matter?  - Parker said the only reason you had me make salads

482
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,830
is because it's a job for babies.

483
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,660
Well, clearly, that's not true because you're not a baby.

484
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,660
- You're 15, remember?  - Also, I can't find my band-aid.

485
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,230
Okay, you fill water glasses. I'll make the salads.

486
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,460
- Hey, mom?  - Yeah?

487
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,230
This is for table five.

488
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,830
Oh, thanks.

489
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah.

490
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,660
Uh... You didn't give them enough change.

491
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
Yeah, I know. I figured this out.

492
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,400
You can short people 1%, and they won't even notice.

493
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,960
- If they got a buzz on, 3%.  - Okay, you make the salads. I'll handle the register.

494
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,930
Dude, back off. That's my table.

495
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,430
Not anymore. You can take the 4-top of old farts.

496
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,430
- No way. I...  - What's going on?

497
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,700
- He took my table.  - So? Take another one. What's the difference?

498
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,030
Well, since I'm the only one here who can wait on that table

499
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,700
without knocking over a glass with my pants,

500
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,730
How about I take it?

501
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,830
You handle the cash register. You bus tables. Go on.

502
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,930
Well, look at this.

503
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,030
Everybody's happy.

504
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,530
Things are running smoothly.

505
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,130
Don't worry. I'm not gonna say, "I told you so."

506
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,300
Hey. Katherine said you wanted to talk to me.

507
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,530
Yeah. Come on in. 

508
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,530
You know, you could have just called.

509
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,230
You don't have to use her as an intermediary.

510
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,230
Really? I thought we were using Katherine

511
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,360
for all sorts of things... sending messages,

512
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Raising our kid.

513
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
I don't see what the big deal is.

514
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,030
I have to work, and she has some free time.

515
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,700
- It's better for everybody.  - Well, it's not better for me,

516
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,200
especially when I'm not even told about it.

517
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,560
Fine. Here I am telling you.

518
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,600
I have to work Friday,

519
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,830
So Katherine will be picking M.J. Up from school.

520
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,000
No.

521
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,730
What do you mean, "no"?

522
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,430
Let me remind you, I have custody on Fridays.

523
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,430
Hey, thanks. Let me remind you

524
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,430
That the reason I agreed to custody is

525
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,930
so our son could spend time with his father.

526
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,430
You have a problem with Katherine?

527
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,930
No, she's a peach,

528
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,430
But she's not the one that dragged me to court

529
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,830
To hammer out some custody agreement.

530
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,100
Now if you'd like, we can go back,

531
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,130
And the judge can explain to you

532
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,800
- The difference between you and your girlfriend.  - Okay, you listen to me.

533
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,830
Mommy?

534
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,700
Are you guys fighting?

535
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,060
No, sweetie.

536
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,200
We are just trying to figure out what is best for you.

537
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,060
Aren't we?

538
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,260
I'll see you Friday, buddy.

539
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,760
Looks like I'll be picking you up from school.

540
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,560
Andrew makes twice as much as me?

541
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,030
Who told you that?

542
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,530
A little bird

543
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,230
or should I say a little dog named Munchy?

544
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,530
That's why you wanted to know the names of my pets?

545
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,700
Orson Hodge, you are shameful.

546
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,000
What's shameful is how much you're paying him.

547
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,030
Andrew has been with me since I launched the company.

548
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,830
He runs every aspect of the business.

549
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,130
- He deserves what he's making.  - But I am your husband, for crying out loud.

550
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,930
Yes, Orson, we're all aware of how you got the job.

551
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,530
You know what the real travesty is?

552
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,730
I'm more educated than the lot of you.

553
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,730
- I went to grad school. I'm a dentist.  - No, you were a dentist.

554
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,030
Now you're a caterer, and you're paid fairly

555
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,260
Based on your expertise and contribution.

556
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, this is not about money, Bree. It's about value.

557
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And you're saying I'm worthless.

558
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,030
No, I'm just saying you're worth... less. 

559
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,400
I'm sorry, honey.

560
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,700
I'm just being honest.

561
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,900
Very well.

562
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,900
Oh, since we're being honest, Munchy didn't go to any farm.

563
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
That's what parents tell their kids

564
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,130
When they just had their pets gassed.

565
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,800
Hey.

566
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Hi. You got a minute? I have a really big favor to ask you.

567
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,660
Uh, sure.

568
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,830
I need a little detective work done.

569
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,500
It's about Bradley.

570
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,800
So...

571
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,330
What's going on?

572
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,260
I'm gonna buy a golf club.

573
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,960
A baseball bat would be cheaper.

574
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,730
Maybe I should let you finish.

575
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,060
See, I don't know anything about golf clubs,

576
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,930
But I know Carlos does,

577
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,930
So I was hoping you guys could snoop around

578
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,060
And find out what kind of driver Brad wants.

579
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,930
Oh, it's a gift.

580
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,430
Sure, yeah.

581
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,130
We'd love to help out. 

582
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,500
- So what's the occasion?  - No occasion.

583
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,360
I just want to thank him for being a wonderful husband.

584
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,800
Well, don't spend too much. 

585
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,000
Why don't you just get him a card?

586
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,930
So our marriage counselor said we should get each other

587
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,430
Little gifts now and then to keep things spontaneous.

588
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,860
Oh, you're in counseling. That's great.

589
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,860
We were, but we stopped. We don't need it anymore.

590
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,230
- Are you sure about that?  - Yeah. Brad and I are solid.

591
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,760
Well, ice is solid, too,

592
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,930
Until it cracks and you're drowning in freezing water.

593
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,460
I'd stay in counseling if I were you.

594
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Gaby, I'm home! Can you come in here for a minute?

595
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,300
Brad gives me a huge bonus and you repay him

596
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,300
by telling his wife that they need marriage counseling?

597
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm sorry. I think they do.

598
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Their marriage is none of your business.

599
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
- Besides, I think they're a very happy couple.  - Who? Him and Maria

600
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,330
- or him and the blonde I saw him kissing yesterday?  - What? No way!

601
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,460
Yeah. And Brad saw me.

602
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,700
Why do you think your bonus jumped

603
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,660
from a stuffed chicken breast to 30 grand in a day?

604
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,560
Oh, my god.

605
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,430
This is illegal.

606
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,560
I'm getting a bonus no one else is getting based on blackmail.

607
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,830
You're welcome.

608
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,360
I can't believe you did this.

609
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,960
Well, thank god you came to your senses.

610
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,330
All right, let's get in there and tell her.

611
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,500
No, we can't tell her. We'd have to give the money back.

612
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,600
Don't we have a moral responsibility to tell her?

613
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
It's like you said...

614
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,730
Their marriage is none of our business.

615
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,200
He's the one who's cheating.

616
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,700
If we say anything, it'll just make things worse.

617
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
We're the good guys here, Carlos

618
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,630
Really? Cause it sure doesn't feel like it.

619
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,300
It's open.

620
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,300
Susan, you got our message.

621
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,300
Yes, and imagine my surprise,

622
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,800
cause the last time I talked to Mike,

623
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,730
he promised me he was picking up M.J. From school.

624
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,730
Oh, mrs. Nelson had another plumbing emergency.

625
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,500
Apparently this new oat bran diet she's on...

626
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
I don't need the details. I had a long day.

627
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I just want to pick up my kid.

628
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Mommy, we had paninis for dinner. You want one?

629
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,200
No, thank you. Let's go.

630
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,700
But we were gonna make brownies for dessert.

631
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,700
But we can make brownies at home.

632
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,100
The box kind? Katherine says those aren't real brownies.

633
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,960
Except when your mommy makes them with love.

634
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,830
Good save.

635
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,260
Let's go.

636
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,100
Susan?

637
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,460
Look,

638
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,460
I know you were surprised to find M.J. Here again today,

639
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,130
But I really was trying to do you a favor.

640
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,130
Well, I don't need you to do me any favors.

641
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,360
What I need is for everyone to just stick to the plan.

642
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Monday, Wednesday, Friday... Mike watches his son.

643
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,400
He doesn't pawn him off on his girlfriend.

644
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,200
I had a really fun time.

645
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,430
Big group coming in. It is now officially Saturday night.

646
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,130
Finally.

647
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,460
Oh, great. They're kids.

648
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,460
- 1 plate of spaghetti and 15 baskets of free bread.  - Stop being such a downer.

649
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,760
We're finally making a go of this place.

650
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,430
All you want to do is complain. 

651
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,900
- We're taking a break.  - N-not now. We just got a big party.

652
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,500
Good luck with that. We're outta here.

653
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What's going on here?

654
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,100
- Those kids go to our school.  - And you know who that big guy is?

655
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Kevin Mcdermott. The guy called me "Jesus" for a year

656
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,730
'Cause I wore sandals one day.

657
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,660
If he sees me wearing this, I'll never hear the end of it.

658
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,260
- Fine. Don't wear that apron. That's...  - No, I'm not waiting

659
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,100
On a kid who's gonna make fun of me on Monday morning.

660
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,600
- It's humiliating enough having to work here.  - Humiliating?

661
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,100
- Guys, easy.  - No, you're... you're not humiliated

662
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
When you use the money that we make here

663
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,100
- To buy your clothes.  - Tom, it's fine. I'll take the table.

664
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,430
No, no, no, no, no, no. Your mother can't wait

665
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,430
- On this whole restaurant by herself.  - Well, then you do it.

666
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,800
Porter, I'm your father and your boss,

667
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,260
And I'm telling you right now to go take that table.

668
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,060
Or what, you're gonna fire me? Go for it.

669
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,730
You think this is a joke? This is my life!

670
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,560
- Tom!  - You worry about being embarrassed?

671
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,830
- I have put everything I have into this restaurant!  - All right, that's enough!

672
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,000
Let go of him! Let go of him! Let go of him!

673
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,160
Guys?

674
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:34,300
I just sat a 12-top. Who's taking it?

675
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,700
I will.

676
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,160
I started getting our accounts in order.

677
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,260
If we're gonna sell this place,

678
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,100
We should probably know exactly how much it's worth.

679
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:42,200
I think this can all wait until morning.

680
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,860
Don't you?

681
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,830
Hey. I just booked us into the Brunswick Inn

682
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,830
For this weekend.

683
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,060
Great.

684
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,230
Prepare to be pampered!

685
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,830
Oh, shoot.

686
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,830
This weekend isn't gonna work.

687
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,330
Mike really wants us to do that camping trip

688
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,330
That we've been talking about.

689
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,130
Camping? Have you met me?

690
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,130
I figured you were gonna say that.

691
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,130
I just can't blow him off.

692
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,000
This is the only weekend that works for him.

693
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Then you're on your own.

694
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,430
- Have fun wiping with leaves.  - Oh, Edie?

695
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,800
Please don't tell Katherine that you're not coming.

696
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,000
All right? Mike really wants her there,

697
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,130
And if she hears that you're not going, she won't either.

698
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,300
Will you take me

699
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
To the Brunswick Inn next weekend?

700
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,460
Yes.

701
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,200
Then I won't say a word to Katherine.

702
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,900
Hey. When did you two get here?

703
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,560
Just a minute ago.

704
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
They said they have something personal

705
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
They want to talk to us about.

706
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,160
Oh, really? What is it?

707
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,530
We're pregnant.

708
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,560
Oh, wow.

709
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,700
Yay!

710
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,860
I know. We are so happy.

711
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,960
But that's not all.

712
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,960
See, even though

713
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,500
We've only known each other for a short time,

714
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Your friendship has meant a lot to us,

715
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Which is why Maria feels strongly

716
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,560
That you should be the baby's godparents.

717
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,600
Do you hear that, Carlos?

718
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,800
Godparents.

719
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,860
Yay!

720
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,330
You are such good people, so kindhearted and decent,

721
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,330
And that is the kind of influence

722
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,930
That we want in our baby's life.

723
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,300
How could we say no? 

724
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,560
Oh!

725
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,930
Oh!

726
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,860
Oh. I see you got your bracelet after all.

727
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,460
Oh, yeah.

728
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,660
Uh, but I'm not enjoying it as much as I thought I would.

729
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,030
Okay, lunch and a movie. You are one lucky boy.

730
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

731
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,530
Try not to get any crumbs on the couch.

732
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,430
What's wrong?

733
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,460
It's peanut butter, no crusts...

734
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,400
Your favorite.

735
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,300
I want a panini.

736
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,660
I don't know how to make paninis.

737
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,660
It's just turkey and cheese.

738
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,730
Do we have any provolone?

739
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:03,400
No, we do not have any provolone.

740
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,760
Can we borrow some from Katherine?

741
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,430
Absolutely not.

742
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,200
In this house, we do not eat pretentious cheeses.

743
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,430
We eat honest American peanut butter.

744
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,660
Now watch your movie,

745
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,360
And I'll be back in a minute.

746
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,930
Will you make me a panini?

747
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,760
Uh, well, sure, sweetie.

748
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,860
Does your mommy know you're here?

749
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,960
Hey, sweetie. How was your sandwich?

750
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,130
M.J.?

751
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,760
M.J., honey, where are you?

752
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,260
M.J., where are you?!

753
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,730
M.J.!

754
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,500
M.J.!

755
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,900
What is he doing here?

756
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,230
He wanted a panini, said you knew.

757
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,100
M.J., go wait outside on the porch.

758
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,100
I need to talk to Katherine.

759
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,800
You can take the sandwich.

760
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,930
Look, he showed up on my doorstep.

761
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,430
He seemed hungry.

762
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,760
You think I don't feed my kid?

763
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,200
Okay, well, maybe he just wanted to come see me.

764
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,900
Yeah, 'cause you make it like Disneyland over here,

765
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,200
With your paninis and your Blackjack.

766
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,760
You're trying to do everything you can

767
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,730
- To make him think that you're the other mommy.  - What?

768
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,230
You're trying to get your hooks deeper into Mike

769
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,230
- By showing him how much his son loves you.  - Susan, I am being nice

770
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,630
To the child of the man I'm dating.

771
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,360
- How does that make me evil?  - No, not evil. Devious.

772
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,060
Well, you know, I hate to tell you,

773
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
But your big plan is not gonna work,

774
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,600
'Cause from now on, M.J. Is either at my house or Mike's.

775
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,100
- He is no longer allowed to be here.  - Yeah, uh, that's gonna be tricky.

776
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,400
Well, that's the way it's gonna be, whether you like it or not.

777
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,700
No, it's gonna be tricky because Mike's moving in here.

778
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,100
What?

779
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,600
First of the month,

780
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,600
He's giving up his place and moving in with me.

781
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,930
So M.J. is going to be spending a lot of time here,

782
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,330
Whether you like it or not.

783
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,130
Orson, I'm glad you're here.

784
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,130
I was doing a recount of the goblets

785
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,130
For the Hopkins wedding reception,

786
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,130
- And we're short by about 30...  - Oh.

787
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,730
So I have to run over to the supplier

788
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,230
- And pick up the rest. Could you hold down the fort for me?  - Sure. No problem.

789
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,260
- Thanks.  - Hey, you know, Andrew? It never would have occurred to me

790
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,260
To do a recount of the goblets.

791
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,760
Bree's lucky to have

792
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,100
Someone as conscientious as you working here.

793
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Wow. Thank you, Orson.

794
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,560
That... that means a lot to me.

795
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:31,700
It begins just after sunrise.

796
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,900
After a good night's sleep,

797
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,200
People leave their homes to go to work.

798
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,600
They do this so they can provide

799
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,530
A better life for their families...

800
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:49,500
So they can afford to buy nice things...

801
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,530
And have a reason to get up in the morning.

802
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,000
And when their exhausting work is done,

803
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,460
People come back home again...

804
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,800
And some begin counting the days...

805
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:12,530
Till their next vacation.

806
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


807
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
