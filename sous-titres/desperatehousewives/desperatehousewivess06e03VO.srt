1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,122
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,526 --> 00:00:05,088
I'm getting married,
and I don't wanna screw it up,

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,438
'cause enough of those screwups,

4
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:10,980
- you just end up alone.
- <i>Gaby discovered that old flames...</i>

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,034
- That can happen.
- <i>... can leave embers.</i>

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,428
Do you at least know why he steals?

7
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:20,259
- I steal to hurt you.
- <i>Bree's tortured marriage...</i>

8
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:22,601
I'm not your wife anymore.
I'm your captive.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,482
Don't you feel any remorse?

10
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:27,230
Guilt is a small price
to pay for happiness.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,875
<i>Led her into an affair with Karl.</i>

12
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,865
What happened to the good girl?

13
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,659
She decided guilt's a small price to pay
for happiness.

14
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>Lynette revealed
a closely guarded secret.</i>

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,634
No one else can know about this.

16
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:42,162
- I'm pregnant.
- You are?

17
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:46,713
- Something's happened to Julie.
- <i>And when a crime was committed...</i>

18
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,480
- How does a fish get caught?
- He opens his mouth.

19
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:51,516
<i>A suspect emerged.</i>

20
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:04,831
<i>There's a certain kind
of woman you see in the suburbs.</i>

21
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:09,564
<i>She waits for the school bus
in her bathrobe.</i>

22
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:14,498
<i>She stops by the post office
with curlers in her hair.</i>

23
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:20,610
<i>She goes to the market
in sweatpants and a T-shirt.</i>

24
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:24,220
<i>This woman is a housewife,</i>

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,490
<i>and she doesn't bother
trying to be beautiful</i>

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,660
<i>because...</i>

27
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,765
<i>it's a waste of time.</i>

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,546
I was trying to hit Celia.

29
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:35,864
Get better aim!

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,221
Ana, help me clean this mess.

31
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:42,135
Don't up your volume on me.

32
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:45,433
Juanita, finish those vegetables.
Don't make me count to three.

33
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:51,067
Don't give me that look,
you sawed off little...

34
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,161
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:58,774 --> 00:01:59,906
What a surprise.

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,959
I was so busy back in the kitchen
I didn't even know you guys were here.

37
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,251
- How are you?
- I'm usually better

38
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,351
when I don't have
creamed spinach all over me.

39
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,001
So, are you working here?

40
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,464
Nothing wrong with waitin' tables.
Could you get us more bread?

41
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,590
Maybe I could bring
you some dessert on the house.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,804
I'll just go ask the owner.
Wait. That's me.

43
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,558
Honestly? You own this place?

44
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,519
I bought it with the money I got
in my divorce settlement.

45
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:31,855
Really? You're divorced?

46
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,441
Almost a year now.

47
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:37,193
Oh, my God.
Are these your kids?

48
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:40,530
This is Celia and Juanita,
and this is our niece Ana.

49
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,910
I can see the family resemblance.

50
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:47,758
She's my niece.

51
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:52,042
It must've been a windy day when
the apple fell from that tree.

52
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:58,339
It was great seeing you again.

53
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,008
You, too.

54
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,058
Still don't see any bread here.

55
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:07,411
I'll be right back.

56
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,451
<i>Yes, there's a certain kind of woman</i>

57
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,042
<i>you only meet in the suburbs.</i>

58
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,921
<i>She will try to look beautiful</i>

59
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:20,565
<i>if she has someone
to look beautiful for.</i>

62
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,710
<i>On this street,</i>

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,735
<i>the day begins with a cup of coffee.</i>

64
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,428
<i>Most need it to wake up.</i>

65
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:47,281
<i>Some can't read
their morning paper without it.</i>

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,786
<i>A few like to drink it
on their way to work.</i>

67
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,405
<i>Then there are those</i>

68
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:57,137
<i>who just want something
to hold in their hands</i>

69
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,350
<i>while they discuss the neighbors.</i>

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,701
Danny had me fooled.
He seemed like a pretty nice kid.

71
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,614
Except for the strangling.

72
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:07,475
Sorry.

73
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,584
It's okay. I'm just happy that
Julie's safe and they caught the guy.

74
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:31,308
Go inside.

75
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,696
I'm confused.

76
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,731
The police had Danny Bolen
in custody.

77
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:40,598
Danny was never under arrest.

78
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,986
They were questioning him,
but they had no grounds.

79
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:45,405
That sounds like his lawyer talking.
Are you?

80
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,241
You know how much I love Julie,

81
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,159
but they have no evidence
and I couldn't just let him sit there.

82
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,209
If he didn't do it, why would he need
to fake his alibi?

83
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,702
- Because he's a kid and he was scared.
- This is not a good idea.

84
00:04:56,869 --> 00:05:00,650
I just gotta say this. I can't even
imagine what you've been going through.

85
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,742
I am begging you,

86
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:06,551
as my friend and neighbor,
don't defend him.

87
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,384
It's my job.

88
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:14,267
Then I don't know
how you sleep at night.

89
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,304
Susan, wait.

90
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:19,993
Can we please just talk about this?
We can go inside, just the two of us.

91
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:23,943
You wanna talk?
Let's do it in the open.

92
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:26,368
Everybody!

93
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,991
Her son tried to kill my daughter.

94
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,590
And while he's here,
nobody on this street is safe.

95
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:46,758
- What is this?
- Bacon and cheese burrito.

96
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:51,095
You couldn't find any croissants
or pain au chocolat?

97
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:54,724
It's a Motor Lodge on the interstate.
I was lucky to find a burrito.

98
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:57,691
People always talk about
the moral hazards of cheating.

99
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,958
No one warns you about the food.

100
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:08,330
You want me to book
this place for tomorrow?

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,150
Sorry, I have an event.

102
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:12,578
Wait. I think I do, too.

103
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:16,584
How's this then? We'll go
to Vegas for the weekend?

104
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,834
Las Vegas?

105
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,347
Why not?

106
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:23,580
I'll lose my shirt in the casino, we'll
head upstairs, and you can lose yours.

107
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,539
I can't disappear
for a whole weekend.

108
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,999
- My husband would notice.
- Say you're visiting family.

109
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:37,350
I'm sorry, but I don't see us
having romantic getaways.

110
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:43,731
That's the sort of thing a woman
does with a man she's in love with.

111
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,784
And we don't have those kinds
of feelings. I get it.

112
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,747
But you are a delightful diversion.
And in order to keep things delightful,

113
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,059
I think it's best we not put
unreasonable demands on each other.

114
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:58,805
Okay, fine.

115
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,169
You could've said, "pass the sugar."

116
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,839
I didn't want to make a demand.

117
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:15,813
I know you've been concerned 'cause
I've been so sick in the mornings. So...

118
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,930
I wanted to let you know why.

119
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,518
I'm pregnant with twins.

120
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:29,152
Now that the celebration's
over, any questions?

121
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,363
Aren't you
gonna be the world's oldest mom?

122
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:36,248
There's a woman in Mongolia
who's got me beat.

123
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:39,203
- Any other questions?
- I have more of a statement.

124
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,381
You two are so irresponsible.

125
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,863
You should've been using
birth control.

126
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,913
You're in college. Do you know what
the odds are now that you'll graduate?

127
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,130
Like, zero.

128
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,229
You, you have a new job,

129
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,562
one that you'll have to quit once
the baby comes. I hope you're happy.

130
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,151
You've just destroyed your
futures for a few minutes of pleasure.

131
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:10,189
Not to mention, it's so gross
you're still doing it.

132
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,575
You're excited about this?

133
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:20,495
Getting
two little babies to play with.

134
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,873
If they're boys, I'm outta here.

135
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:33,469
You have to understand,
even though they've released Danny,

136
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,747
it doesn't mean
he's not still a suspect.

137
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,189
So what do we do?

138
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:39,752
The police are gonna start
digging in your background,

139
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,038
so I need to know
what they're gonna find.

140
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,810
You're from New York, right?

141
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,365
But instead of wasting your time
poking around in the past,

142
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,138
you need to back up Danny's story.

143
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:53,611
Check out the liquor stores,
see if anyone saw him.

144
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:56,441
I will, but police gonna talk to
your old neighborhood,

145
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:58,945
see if he's got any run-ins
with the law, with girls.

146
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,809
Is there anything
I need to know, Danny?

147
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:04,814
Not a thing.

148
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,170
But I still need
to establish character.

149
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,340
I'll need to get in touch
with some old teachers, friends.

150
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,259
You don't need to do all that.

151
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,751
What are we doing here?

152
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:23,430
I can't defend a client
I know nothing about.

153
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,601
Why can't you answer
a few simple questions?

154
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:28,932
You wanna know why?
Because this family has secrets!

155
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,550
Big dark secrets that we can't
talk about, not even to our lawyer.

156
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,493
Who cares if it makes
me look guilty, even if I'm not?

157
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,810
Knock it off!

158
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:44,787
This conversation was privileged?

159
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:54,758
I don't know if you heard,

160
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,550
but this morning
the police released Danny Bolen.

161
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,969
- I heard. You must be worried sick.
- I am.

162
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:03,514
Clearly, he's unstable.
Who knows what he might do next?

163
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:05,735
What are we gonna do about it?

164
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,186
You ever hear about
that old man on Maple Drive?

165
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,921
People found out he used to be
an accountant for the Nazis,

166
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,299
and they threw garbage
all over his yard.

167
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,486
That's right. And he moved.

168
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,984
But then it was bought by some
ex-hippie who painted the house pink,

169
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,366
so it was a pyrrhic victory at best.

170
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:27,294
I'm just bringing this up because
I don't want people on this street

171
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:29,498
thinking that they're safe
when they're not.

172
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,878
Could you give me a hand for a sec?

173
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:42,386
What are you doing?
Mona Clarke's got a big mouth.

174
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,015
If you get her worked up,
she's gonna tabout Danny to everybody.

175
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,447
So?

176
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,992
So we don't want an angry mob
showing up at the Bolens' house,

177
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,856
especially if we aren't sure
Danny attacked Julie.

178
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:58,069
He lied about his alibi. Why
would he do that if he was innocent?

179
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,330
- That's a good point.
- And how can I live with myself

180
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,577
if someone else's daughter
gets attacked and I have said nothing?

181
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,895
I get it.

182
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:12,250
This whole thing would be a lot easier
if the police just had some proof.

183
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:17,922
Maybe we should get them some.

184
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:35,583
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

185
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,401
I thought I should do it
in person, out of respect.

186
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:47,029
Your niece came to my restaurant.

187
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,358
She asked me for a hostessing job.

188
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,454
And I think she'd be great.

189
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:54,870
But given our history, I wanted
to make sure you were okay with it.

190
00:11:57,168 --> 00:12:00,901
Because I wouldn't do it if
it would make you feel uncomfortable.

191
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:03,001
That's the last thing I'd want.

192
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:04,414
Like I said,

193
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,345
given our... history.

194
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:10,704
Why don't you stop saying
"given our history"

195
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:12,935
and just say "I banged your wife"?

196
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,876
It's not that
I haven't forgiven you.

197
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:22,047
It's just that every time I see you,
I wanna put my fist in your face.

198
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:26,324
Did you park in the building?
'Cause we validate.

199
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:29,212
You know what?

200
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,374
I think this was a bad idea.

201
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,373
Besides, Gaby probably wouldn't
have liked it anyway.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,801
- What?
- Come on.

203
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,524
Her niece working for me...

204
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:44,492
I think she would've freaked out.

205
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:45,738
You know...

206
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:47,675
given our history.

207
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:56,390
Hold on a second.

208
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,900
Ana working for John? Are you nuts?

209
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,200
You're the one who's been saying
she should get a job.

210
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,109
At the mall hocking soft pretzels,
not working for...

211
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:10,159
Your ex-lover?

212
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,571
How can you not think it's awkward?

213
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:17,833
Because that was years ago.
We're past all that, right?

214
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:20,297
Of course we are.

215
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,425
It's just... the whole thing
makes me uncomfortable.

216
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:25,341
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to say no.

217
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:28,188
I knew it. You're jealous.

218
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:30,721
Jealous? Of who?

219
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,516
Your beautiful niece
working for your ex-lover.

220
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,018
- What?!
- You still have the hots for him.

221
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,843
Don't deny it. I saw you.

222
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:42,691
"Really? You're divorced?"

223
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,126
First of all, you just
reminded me why I hate mimes.

224
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:50,625
Secondly, is that why you're
letting Ana work for John?

225
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,020
- You were testing me?
- Yeah, and you failed.

226
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,065
Carlos, you are way out of line.

227
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,814
Deny it all you want,
but I know what I saw.

228
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:00,598
You wanted to look pretty
for your ex-lover.

229
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,965
He was also my ex-gardener.
Can't you call him that?

230
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:13,889
It's so long since
I've seen you two together.

231
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:16,430
I was starting to wonder
if you'd split up.

232
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:20,727
- We're still married.
- Try getting away from this one!

233
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:22,905
Arm.

234
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,621
I know you're unhappy,
but we haven't been out in months.

235
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:27,611
Could you make an
effort for one night?

236
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,281
You are absolutely right.

237
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:38,210
Get me one of
those crab puffs, then we'll mingle.

238
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:41,589
- Sweetheart, this is just what I'm...
- Crab puff.

239
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:47,629
What are you doing here?

240
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:49,758
- What do you mean?
- Are you following me?

241
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,724
I'm a member of the club.

242
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:55,598
I had no idea that this was
the event that you were talking about.

243
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:58,976
You expect me to believe that
you showed up at a dinner dance alone?

244
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:02,321
- Actually...
- I know you have feelings for me,

245
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:05,733
but I would hate to see them
turn into some kind of... obsession.

246
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,468
Hey, hon. Find our table?

247
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:13,240
You were saying?

248
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:19,538
Aren't you going to introduce me?

249
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:21,999
This is Candace.
She's an old friend.

250
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,460
Don't you mean
that you're her old friend?

251
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,179
Why don't we go find our table?

252
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:30,835
Bree, if we don't
run into you again... good.

253
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:32,718
He doesn't mean to be brusque.

254
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,279
He's a little eager
to rush through dinner so we can get

255
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,224
to the Motor Lodge.

256
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:41,310
Motor Lodge?

257
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,914
He wanted to go earlier,
but I said no.

258
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:45,451
Lobster first,

259
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,149
then "dessert."

260
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,462
Why don't we start putting
that lobster in your mouth right now?

261
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:54,953
Good-Bye, Bree.

262
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,791
- You two know each other?
- Candace was a dental patient.

263
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:07,461
I Still think of you every time
I put in my night guard.

264
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,887
There's room at our table.
Would you care to join us?

265
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,342
I mean, we're going
to be leaving soon.

266
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,685
That Motor Lodge can wait.

267
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,728
That way, Orson and Candace
can catch up

268
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,057
and you and I
can have a little talk, too.

269
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,716
Sure. That sounds like fun.

270
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:26,438
Karl and I go get a couple apple
martinis and we'll come right back.

271
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,268
Lovely girl, i't she?

272
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,315
With a little secret though.

273
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:41,453
Her two front teeth? Veneers.

274
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:45,231
I'm guessing those aren't
her only side by side enhancements.

275
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,550
She's actually very sweet.

276
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,099
Shame to see her mixed up
with a dog like Karl.

277
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,423
You have to pity any woman
who makes that mistake.

278
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:55,782
Yes, you do.

279
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,809
Get in!
Get in!

280
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,741
- What are you doing?
- Stay low!

281
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,375
Let's try that again.
What are you doing?

282
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:32,114
Surveillance.
I am gonna nail that Danny Bolen kid.

283
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,917
- I thought the police were...
- The police are useless.

284
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:40,017
So I'm keeping a log
of all his comings and goings.

285
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,853
If he leaves, and another girl
gets attacked,

286
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,853
he won't be able to lie
and say he was home.

287
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:49,791
I got a few minutes to kill.

288
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:58,466
By the way, I was gonna call you.

289
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,617
- You haven't told Gaby I'm pregnant?
- No. Why?

290
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:05,542
I haven't had a chance
to tell Carlos yet,

291
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,332
- and he should hear it from me...
- Get down!

292
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,547
You think I'm nuts, don't you?

293
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:21,595
I think you're a mother.

294
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,118
Thank you.

295
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:27,986
Although speaking as
a fellow mother...

296
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,526
Do you remember
what happened to Porter?

297
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:33,544
Everyone in town was so sure

298
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:36,576
he set that fire
and killed those people.

299
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:41,031
People can be sure,
and they can be wrong.

300
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:45,077
I'm not wrong.

301
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:58,565
- What are you doing?
- Following him. Buckle up.

302
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,839
No, I can't! I have to put
a meatloaf in the oven!

303
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,359
Wait! Wait! I forgot my...

304
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:21,201
So, Candace, what do you do
for a living?

305
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:22,784
I'm a dancer.

306
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:26,498
What kind?
Jazz? Ballet? Lap?

307
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,961
Actually, Candace was a rockette.

308
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:36,216
It must've been exhausting, spending
so much time with your legs in the air.

309
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,682
I... love this song.
Would you care to dance?

310
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,227
Sorry, my shoes are killing me.
Ask Candace. She's the pro.

311
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:48,896
I'd love to.

312
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,320
Have fun, you two!

313
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:57,362
You loathsome pig. You're supposed
to be cheating with me, not on me.

314
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,962
I asked if you were free.
You weren't. I called Candace.

315
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:02,579
What's the problem?

316
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:06,288
It's just that she's so... cheap.
She's beneath you.

317
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:09,374
Not yet, but she will be.

318
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,795
Bravo!

319
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:18,300
Well done! If her dress
were any lower, it'd be a belt.

320
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,110
Gosh, Bree, could this
be jealousy I'm hearing?

321
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:23,788
I'm not jealous. I'm appalled.
And as long as we're together,

322
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,172
I will not have you
running around with other women.

323
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,394
But we're not together.
I'm just a diversion, remember?

324
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:32,332
A little fling to spice up
an afternoon.

325
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,319
And if that's all I am to you, fine.

326
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:37,194
But you don't get to say what I can do
when the afternoon's over.

327
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,739
Are you gonna take her
to our motor lodge tonight?

328
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,031
Just try and stop me.

329
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:05,264
Excuse me. Someone over
at the table was looking for you.

330
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,809
- What the hell happened here?
- Orson tripped.

331
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:29,234
Really, sweeth.
You need to be more careful.

332
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:31,801
I'm so sorry.
The floor was slippery.

333
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:36,075
- Are you all right?
- I think I broke my nose.

334
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:38,362
I should go to the emergency room.

335
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:41,805
Dear. And you had such
lovely plans for the evening.

336
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:54,187
Is carlos done with his meeting yet?
I really need to talk to him.

337
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:57,069
Got a sec?

338
00:21:57,502 --> 00:21:58,901
Never mind.

339
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:04,582
Something wrong?

340
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:07,200
How would you like a parking space
closer to the entrance?

341
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,870
I'd love it.
You closed the door for that?

342
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,324
No, I closed the door to ask if
you would like to be my new senior VP.

343
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:16,914
Seriously?

344
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:23,345
I am...

345
00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:25,689
so flattered. And I would...

346
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:28,390
- love to say yes. It's just...
- I know.

347
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,931
More responsibility,
more hours away from home.

348
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:33,265
But you get a company car
and an eense account.

349
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,188
Which is very generous, but I
still can't accept because...

350
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,150
And a 50% salary bump.

351
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:41,672
Because it doesn't have
a 50% salary bump.

352
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,695
But now that it does, I'm in.

353
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,693
- When do I start?
- Tonight.

354
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,959
We're having dinner
with a big potential client.

355
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:50,160
He is bringing his wife,
so please bring tom.

356
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,536
Sure.

357
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,873
Wait.

358
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,335
Weren't you gonna
give this promotion to Judy?

359
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:01,115
I was.

360
00:23:01,408 --> 00:23:04,508
But between you and me,
I found out she's pregnant.

361
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,257
Overheard her on the phone.
I saw what was coming...

362
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:11,174
Doctor's visits, sick days,
maternity leave.

363
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:16,600
That can be annoying.
But isn't denying a woman a promotion

364
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,731
because she's pregnant
a tiny bit illegal?

365
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:24,194
Only if she finds out. And, I mean,
who's gonna tell her, my new senior VP?

366
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:25,828
Hell, no.

367
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:29,449
She's too busy thinking about
that big bump she's got coming.

368
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:41,558
Yes?

369
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,738
I've been thinking about last night,

370
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:48,869
And you, Karl, Candy...

371
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,494
And it finally hit me
what was really going on.

372
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:57,415
- What are you talking about?
- The oil on the dance floor...

373
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:01,398
That was no accident. You
put it there. You wanted candy to fall.

374
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:05,652
- That's ridiculous.
- Admit it.

375
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:09,072
You were jealous of that girl from
the moment Karl walked in with her.

376
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:13,070
Orson, you're not making any sense.
Why would I be jealous of Karl's date?

377
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,954
Because she was
dancing with me, of course.

378
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,140
I suppose I should be mad at you

379
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:24,004
for nearly breaking my neck
but I'm too relieved.

380
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:25,881
Relieved?

381
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,283
If watching me dance with a pretty girl
can make you that crazy,

382
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,428
then you obviously
still care for me.

383
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,380
There's still hope for us.

384
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:36,516
You are reading way
too much into one impulsive act.

385
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:39,089
Argue all you like.

386
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,565
A woman doesn't pull a stunt like that
over a man she's not in love with.

387
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,500
Karl? Hi, it's Bree.

388
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,001
I am thinking...

389
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:09,531
Maybe I'm ready
for that weekend in Las Vegas.

390
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:23,980
I'm a friend of Danny's
from school. Is he in?

391
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:26,733
- You got a name?
- Sorry. Eddie.

392
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:29,754
There's an Eddie here.

393
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:38,389
It's a nice house.

394
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,462
You know what happened here, right?

395
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:45,669
What are you gonna do?

396
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,275
- What's up?
- My brakes are shot.

397
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:51,756
Is there any chance
you could take a look at 'em?

398
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,210
I don't feel like it.

399
00:25:54,377 --> 00:25:58,098
Come on. You've been moping around
the house all day. Go. Help your buddy.

400
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,916
I'm glad one of us has a friend.

401
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:10,819
I was the supermarket earlier.

402
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,906
Everybody was looking at me like
I had their grandmother in my trunk.

403
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:18,695
While you were out,
three hate calls in one hour.

404
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:23,874
I don't know. I'm startin' to think it's
time to get out of the Bolen business.

405
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:34,301
We cannot change our names and run
every time there's a little trouble.

406
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:37,262
This is more
than a little trouble, babe.

407
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:42,851
I don't care. We are not putting
Dannybthrough all that again.

408
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:47,881
And maybe this hasn't worked out
they way we'd hoped.

409
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:51,346
But until I say otherwise,
we are Nick and Angie Bolen.

410
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:21,793
Can you go into the basement
and get me a work light?

411
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Thanks.

412
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,067
Got a second?

413
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:32,943
Sure.

414
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:38,365
I'm really sorry
about what happened to Julie.

415
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,743
Thanks. Actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

416
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:44,955
I didn't hurt her, Mrs. Delfino.

417
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,333
But you did fight with her.
I mean, Mrs. Mccluskey saw you.

418
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:53,171
What were you fighting
with her about?

419
00:27:54,802 --> 00:27:56,202
I'm sorry. That...

420
00:27:56,369 --> 00:28:00,169
lawyer told me that I shouldn't talk
to anybody about this stuff.

421
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:06,495
I know that Julie
thght she was pregnant.

422
00:28:09,095 --> 00:28:11,898
- What?
- You didn't think I knew that, right?

423
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,280
- Is that what you fought about?
- I didn't know.

424
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,783
- Is that why you attacked my daughter?
- I didn't even know that.

425
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,243
You're lying.

426
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,343
- You're lying!
- Please, just leave me alone.

427
00:28:42,835 --> 00:28:44,077
What are you doing?

428
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,183
I know that you did it.
I can see it in your eyes!

429
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:50,228
- Mom! Dad! Help me!
- Admit that you did it!

430
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,063
Admit it! Admit it to me!

431
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,110
- Get the hell away from him!
- Are you gonna attack me?

432
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,575
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- He did it! You know that he...

433
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:05,660
Ma! Careful!

434
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,121
You come near hiain,
I swear I will kill you.

435
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,199
You can't protect him forever.

436
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:14,034
People know what he is now,
and he's gonna be punished.

437
00:29:28,344 --> 00:29:30,101
What the hell happened to my car?

438
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:39,858
Hi, uncle Carlos. Your clients are here.
I put him at our best table.

439
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,392
Thank you, sweetie.

440
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,439
Are you sure about this?

441
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:48,149
About being senior VP.
With a 50 % salary bump?

442
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,939
But did you hear the way
he described the job in the car?

443
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:54,824
- It sounds like a killer schedule.
- I can handle it.

444
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,941
And you get to stay in school.

445
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:58,880
Remember your big dream?
Our future?

446
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,607
Of course. But how are we
gonna keep it a secret?

447
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:04,135
Carlos is gonna find out
about this thing eventually.

448
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:08,151
By then, I will have proved
I can do the job,

449
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:09,891
Pregnant or not.

450
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:12,232
Please?

451
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:13,520
Okay. I'm in.

452
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:16,161
But you gotta prove it fast.

453
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,626
Remember last time you were
pregnant with twins?

454
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:20,438
Every part of you swelled up.

455
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:23,590
It was like sleeping next to a body
they dragged out of the river.

456
00:30:24,412 --> 00:30:26,124
You said I was beautiful.

457
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,491
I had to.
You were twice my size.

458
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:33,623
This is a 2004 Barolo
From my vineyard in Piedmont.

459
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:35,407
Your vineyard?

460
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:39,543
That's why I insisted
on this restaurant. Carry my label.

461
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,383
I love business,
but wine is my passion.

462
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,260
None for me tonight.

463
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,429
Why not?

464
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:52,016
Well... I wanna keep
my head clear for business.

465
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,865
No business talk. Tonight is about

466
00:30:55,032 --> 00:30:58,273
getting to know each other
over good food and fine wine.

467
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,945
His wine. So drink up.

468
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:07,115
Well, I guess a little
wouldn't hurt.

469
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:14,959
So...

470
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:19,335
What do you suggest
to go with your wine?

471
00:31:19,715 --> 00:31:21,206
Let me see.

472
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,837
The carpaccio sounds
like a nice starter.

473
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,691
You liked it, huh?

474
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,269
It was delicious.

475
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:38,963
Lucky for you, it's a big vineyard.

476
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,232
Thank you.

477
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:47,946
Look! One of the Pointer Sisters!

478
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:55,644
Sorry.

479
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,082
It was... just a nun.

480
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:08,217
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

481
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,771
- What the hell?
- I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

482
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,980
I mean your clothes. Didn't I see
that shirt in the hamper this morning?

483
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,566
I gave it a sniff.
It has another day in it.

484
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,985
This is an important
business dinner.

485
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,396
Yeah, but it's also
John Rowland's restaurant.

486
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,449
If I made myself pretty, you might think
I was doing it just for him.

487
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,077
God help me.
Is that what this is about?

488
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,585
Well, I didn't want to run the risk
of failing another test.

489
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:40,579
- Go change. You made your point.
- Not quite.

490
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:43,905
For the past 11 years,
I have stood beside you

491
00:32:44,072 --> 00:32:46,756
when you were poor and blind
and knocked me up twice.

492
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,821
At this point in our marriage,
if you still feel the need

493
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:52,788
to test me,
then you're the one who's failed.

494
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,016
You're right.

495
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,034
I'm sorry.

496
00:33:01,304 --> 00:33:02,304
Thank you.

497
00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:05,816
And for the record, I only took
my clip off and shook out my hair

498
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,233
because I ran into somebody I knew.

499
00:33:08,484 --> 00:33:11,484
I would've done it
if it was Lynette Scavo, okay?

500
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,448
So do you think
you can go home and...

501
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:17,787
Don't worry. I have clothes
and makeup in the car.

502
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:21,482
Good, because that shirt
did not have another day in it.

503
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,830
Who is this?

504
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,180
What is your name?

505
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:39,100
You got a big mouth
for a guy with no name.

506
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:42,125
You listen to me.

507
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,248
You come anywhere near my family,

508
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:47,615
I will personally bash your
brains in... assuming you have any!

509
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,238
You okay?

510
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:56,249
I'm fine. Just another moron
with some empty threats.

511
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:00,715
And what if they're not empty?

512
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,048
Do you know where your father
and I keep the gun?

513
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,485
Look, you're old enough
know this stuff.

514
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:16,218
Just in case someone should try
to come in here and hurt you...

515
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:18,185
I can take care of myself.

516
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:22,519
Well, just in case you can't
take care of yourself...

517
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:28,650
There is a loaded
.38 Smith & Wesson in a box

518
00:34:29,392 --> 00:34:31,069
in the second drawer in my dresser.

519
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,469
You got that?

520
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,452
What are you smiling at?

521
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:41,149
It's just...

522
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,416
It's not your typical
mother/son conversation.

523
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:51,152
You know I've always felt bad
about the way we've had to raise you,

524
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:52,632
being on the run and all.

525
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:56,760
If it weren't for me,
you coulda had a normal childhood.

526
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:59,924
Ma, you don't ever have
to apologize to me.

527
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:06,145
I'm glad you're not like other moms.

528
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:08,459
Thanks, baby.

529
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,208
I just wanna be a good one.

530
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:17,588
Remember...

531
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:20,101
Aim for the head, not the legs.

532
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,646
So patti comes downstairs,

533
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:28,940
and sitting under the christmas tree

534
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:32,088
is the cutest golden retriever
puppy you ever saw.

535
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,133
It was the best present I ever got.

536
00:35:36,354 --> 00:35:39,004
- Do you like dogs, Lynette?
- I love 'em!

537
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:42,146
But Penny is allergic, so we got...

538
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,313
fish.

539
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
Fish suck.

540
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:47,803
Swim, die, flush... New one.

541
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,893
Swim, die, flush... New one.

542
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,942
You know what dog I'd really like
is the reima-Waner.

543
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:58,031
- Weimaraner.
- A window-Hammer.

544
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:00,658
- Weimaraner.
- Rammerjammer.

545
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,118
Make him stop.

546
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:05,529
You know,
I wanna tell you something,

547
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,623
but I'm afraid
it's gonna come out wrong.

548
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,378
Your boobs look great in that dress.

549
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:16,329
Well, tom, how could that
possibly come out wrong?

550
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:19,885
You'd be surprised.

551
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,764
Well, you'll have to excuse Tom.
He's a bit of a lightweight.

552
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,559
And your wine is so delicious,
he couldn't resist.

553
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,352
But look at you. You had at least
a bottle, and you'd never know.

554
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,357
Might as well finish this off.

555
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,945
If she has one more glass,
I'm gonna puke.

556
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:00,510
I just talked to bob.

557
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,055
- Why would you do that?
- He asked me to stop by...

558
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,480
Because he wanted to tell me
that the police

559
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:11,097
have evidence that clears
Danny Bolen.

560
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:13,675
What?

561
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,653
They've got a shot from
a security camera at Fairview Liquors

562
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,111
That puts him there
at the time Julie was attacked.

563
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:22,533
- How would they know that?
- There was a time stamp.

564
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,230
They don't know
the exact time of the attack.

565
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:28,203
The camera shows him sitting
in the parking lot drinking beer

566
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,664
for over an hour.

567
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:33,209
He couldn't have done it.

568
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:37,768
I can't believe this.

569
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,844
That means that Julie's attacker
is still out there.

570
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,234
And I've been going
up and down the street

571
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,310
telling erybody
that Danny Bolen did it.

572
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:53,606
Your daughter was hurt.

573
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,858
You wanted somebody to blame.
People get that.

574
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:00,431
I'm so sorry.

575
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,114
Well, I'm sure
the Bolens will understand.

576
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,306
No, not just to them.

577
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,284
To you.

578
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:10,246
What are you talking about?

579
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:14,698
Uou woke up
the morning after your wedding

580
00:38:14,865 --> 00:38:17,465
and found yourself
married to a madwoman.

581
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:19,601
I have been...

582
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:24,969
just totally obsessed with
finding Julie's attacker, and...

583
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:27,376
I said, "for better or worse."

584
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:34,168
So we start with the worse.

585
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:48,911
Glad this night's over.
I'm exhausted.

586
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:50,153
Me, too.

587
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:52,525
You coming to bed?

588
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:55,842
I'll be up in a sec.
I'm gonna turn off some lights.

589
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:50,476
<i>On this street,</i>

590
00:39:50,643 --> 00:39:53,464
<i>the day begins with a cup of coffee.</i>

591
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,814
<i>Some drink it while recalling
a lover they once cared for.</i>

592
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:07,288
<i>Some pour it, thinking of
the boss they must lie to.</i>

593
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,220
<i>Others sip it,</i>

594
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:15,204
<i>contemplating a man
they might be in love with.</i>

595
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:20,917
<i>But for one woman,
on this particular morning,</i>

596
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,210
<i>that cup of coffee has to wait...</i>

597
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:30,937
<i>because she discovers
a neighbor in trouble.</i>

598
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:34,541
<i>She goes to help,</i>

599
00:40:35,044 --> 00:40:38,144
<i>not only because
it's the right thing to do,</i>

600
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:43,065
<i>but because it's the only way
she can think of...</i>

601
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,053
<i>to ask for forgiveness.</i>

602
00:40:48,435 --> 00:40:50,085
<i>And once it is given...</i>

603
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:53,621
<i>the day begins.</i>
