<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,620
My back. I threw it out.

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,414
Jeez, are you crying?

4
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:06,530
Just a little.

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,781
<i>Edie got an unexpected visitor.

6
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:09,821
Remember my little boy?

7
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:11,735
I didn't know your son
was coming for a visit.

8
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:13,920
His father just dumped him
here for four weeks.

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,840
<i>Gaby became the object
of Victor's desire.

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,890
Have you not noticed? I'm a catch.

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,550
I have noticed,
and I'm throwing you back.

12
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,650
<i>And as Mike struggled
to recall his past,

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,040
<i>Ian's jealousy spurred him to action.

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,300
Will you be my wife?

15
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,377
Yes!

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,550
God, I'm so nervous.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,610
Don't be.

18
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,559
They're going to adore
you as much as I do.

19
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:41,810
Thanks. I needed to hear to that.

20
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:43,715
Darling... thorns.

21
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:46,268
I'm so sorry.

22
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,086
<i>If there was one thing
Ian Hainsworth was sure of,

23
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,670
<i>it was that his love for
Susan Mayer was indestructible.

24
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,090
<i>He knew this because
it had been tested again...

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,133
<i>and again...

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,270
<i>and again.

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,860
<i>Still, Ian had found a way
to forgive Susan her...

28
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,610
<i>occasional lack of grace.

29
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,475
Here they come.

30
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,848
<i>The question now on his mind was,

31
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>would his parents
be able to do the same?

32
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:24,650
- Father.
- My dear boy.

33
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,030
This is my fiancée Susan.

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,133
These are my parents,
Graham and Dahlia.

35
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,230
Delighted.

36
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,448
You weren't exaggerating.
She's a vision.

37
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:34,379
It's so great
to finally meet both of you.

38
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:35,690
This is for you.

39
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:37,158
Be careful, mother!

40
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:39,210
Thorns.

41
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:41,520
Ian, I know how to hold a rose.

42
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,655
Yes, of course.
I just didn't want Susan to...

43
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,250
you're right. Sorry.

44
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,615
Anyone hungry?

45
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,710
Yes.

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,155
So one puts the meat
atop the burning coals.

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,850
How wonderfully primal.

48
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,685
Yes, I'll feel like some gloriously
rough-hewn cowgirl enjoying her...

49
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:03,200
What's the word?

50
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:04,350
"Vittles"?

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,402
No, that can't be right.

52
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,010
No,it is. It's vittles.

53
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,310
So, can I get you
something to drink?

54
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:12,480
I'd adore just a thimble of gin.

55
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,290
No, you stay, darling.

56
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,366
I can manage.

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,533
Well, it seems to be going
rather well...

58
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:22,590
Touch wood.

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,624
Were you worried?

60
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:27,031
You know, introducing one's fiancée to
one's parents is always a bit fraught.

61
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,340
You don't have to tell me.

62
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,641
The first time I met Dahlia's parents
was a complete disaster.

63
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,090
We were at tea...

64
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,917
and there was
this plate of small cakes.

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,390
And I offered one to her mother,
I tipped the plate,and plop!

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,618
A scone fell right
into her ladyship's teacup.

67
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,040
Earl grey everywhere!

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,030
On the cloth, her mother's skirt...

69
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,390
You must have been mortified.

70
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:50,210
I was. It was an absolute debacle.

71
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:53,189
Guys?

72
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:55,620
Don't worry.

73
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,250
She's all right.

74
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:03,547
<i>Yes, Ian Hainsworth knew
his love for Susan was indestructible.

75
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,190
<i>Unfortunately for his mother,
chiffon was not.

00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:50,433
"Dress Big"

81
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,570
<i>In every housewife's closet,

82
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,057
<i>There's a treasured article of clothing
that she refuses to part with.

83
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:05,162
<i>It might be an old cheerleader uniform
that symbolizes her youth...

84
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,180
<i>or the last bikini she wore
before she had children...

85
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,050
<i>or a pair of expensive pants
she prays will come back in style.

86
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,980
<i>But for Gabrielle solis, every
piece of clothing was a treasure

87
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,845
<i>carefully selected,
beautifully maintained and utterly...

88
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,721
<i>irreplaceable.

89
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:39,283
I can't believe you
bought another bustier.

90
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:40,340
I know.

91
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,311
I should never shop for lingerie
when I'm horny.

92
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,248
It's like buying groceries
when you're hungry.

93
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:45,250
In a slump,huh?

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,737
How long's it been?

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,177
About three weeks,
and I am dying.

96
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,540
You know, I'm this close
to seducing my gardener.

97
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,810
Been there,done that.

98
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,000
That scrumptious teenager of yours.

99
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:57,870
- Hey, do you think--
- He's married.

100
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:59,542
Damn.

101
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,889
How about that Victor Lang?

102
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,722
- Have you two...
- No. God, no.

103
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:06,428
As a matter of fact, I think
I'm dumping him after dinner tonight.

104
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:07,500
Why?

105
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,770
He's rich. He's gorgeous.

106
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,190
He's probably gonna be mayor.

107
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,640
I mean, what more do you want?

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,020
I don't know.
He's just too... arrogant.

109
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,230
He acts like I'm some trophy
he's already won.

110
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,600
It's infuriating.

111
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,197
Yeah, that's awful.

112
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,209
Can I do him?

113
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,340
Stop it.

114
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,070
You cannot be that hard up.

115
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,060
Did I mention my gardener's 62?

116
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,320
What the hell is this?

117
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,480
Oh, my God!

118
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,535
No!

119
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,476
Honey, where's your uniform?

120
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,380
Crap. I left it at home again.

121
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,580
Yeah, I figured you would...

122
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,659
again.

123
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,740
That's why...

124
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,310
I pulled an extra one
from the back.

125
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:08,770
Thanks.

126
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,780
- Are you sure it's the right-
- Yep, your size.

127
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:14,180
Listen...

128
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,320
I was thinking, wouldn't it be better
if the staff wore a uniform,

129
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,080
And you and I wore regular clothes?

130
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,310
That's way it's like,
"hi.Welcome to scavo's.

131
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,920
We're the scavos."

132
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,510
Yeah, but I like wearing the uniform,
and when you don't,

133
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,580
It looks like we all work for you.

134
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:31,040
Good point.

135
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,079
Okay, here's another good point--
I hate orange.

136
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:34,160
Since when?

137
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,230
Since always.

138
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:36,427
You know my closet.

139
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,680
Surely you've noticed
I don't own anything orange.

140
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,307
- No,I hadn't really--
- Orange says,

141
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,161
"beware.Something
bad's gonna happen."

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,490
That's why they use it for life vests
and traffic cones and convicts.

143
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,870
Also, it washes me out completely.

144
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,970
You're wearing the uniform.

145
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,000
Are you speaking as my husband
or as my boss?

146
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,670
Definitely your boss.

147
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,026
Your husband--

148
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,230
too damn scared of you.

149
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,360
As well he should be.

150
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,255
<i>As Edie walked home,

151
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:13,510
<i>all she could think of was
her nonexistent love life...

152
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,890
Pass it to me, carlos!

153
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,660
<i>And how much she wanted
back in the game.

154
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,889
<i>It was just then she saw someone
she might like to play with.

155
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:31,867
Hi!

156
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,070
Did you see that, Edie?

157
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,570
Kid's looking good,huh?

158
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,592
Looking real good.

159
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:37,680
Can we play another game?

160
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,880
No,it's lunchtime.

161
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,936
You go wash up.

162
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,540
- Bye, carlos.
- Bye.

163
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,320
You have been so great with Travers.

164
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,402
Let me take you out for steak tonight.

165
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,960
You don't have to pay me back.

166
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,692
I'm having more fun than he is.

167
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,300
Well, then...

168
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,988
we'll just have to arrange
for another playdate.

169
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,440
Anytime.

170
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,189
Look who's back.

171
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,660
Yes. Let's try this again, shall we?

172
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,920
- Dahlia, I am so sorry about the--
- Please, not another word.

173
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,530
Chiffon at a barbecue?

174
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,070
I was asking to be immolated.

175
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:15,790
A drink with dinner, mother?

176
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,010
Oh, God, yes.

177
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,980
Oh, not that chair.
That's the wobbler.

178
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,530
I'm saving up for a new set.

179
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,653
Here,sit here.

180
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,810
Ian tells us you have
a young daughter.

181
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,470
Won't she be joining us?

182
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:31,410
Julie? No, she's at
her father's this weekend.

183
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,842
Is something wrong?

184
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,190
It's just that Ian told us that
your husband had been gone for years.

185
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,300
We assumed you were a widow.

186
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,388
No, Karl's alive and kicking... sadly.

187
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,003
So you're a... divorcée?

188
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,410
What happened?

189
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,600
Did he beat you?

190
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:56,060
No. Of course not.

191
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,580
She had ample grounds, mother.

192
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,460
Karl was a shameless womanizer.

193
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,500
So it was just adultery.

194
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,271
Just adultery?

195
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:07,587
To my way of thinking,
men are, by nature,weak.

196
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,420
I think Graham will back
me up on that.

197
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,740
Really,Dahlia.

198
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,839
If you want your marriage to last...

199
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,050
when your husband strays,

200
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,690
you extract some suitable penance...

201
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,770
and get on with it.

202
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,001
Punish the sin,but love the sinner.

203
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,577
Yeah, well, with Karl, I was more,

204
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:31,750
"Divorce the ass and seize the assets."

205
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,740
So you better watch out.

206
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,520
Betrayal makes me vengeful.

207
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,582
Well, that's good to know.

208
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,410
Yes, it certainly is.

209
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,489
Apparently, the water heater
in the attic had burst.

210
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,900
Everything is ruined--
my clothes, my shoes, dresses.

211
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,850
Why are you smiling?

212
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,470
We have different perspectives.

213
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,700
You see ruined clothes,

214
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,704
and I see a woman who
could suddenly use a rich boyfriend.

215
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,700
You will never be my boyfriend.

216
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,130
Gaby, how much longer are yougonna
pretend you're not crazy about me?

217
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,950
Not much longer.
This is our last date.

218
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:09,860
Didn't you say it was our last date
on our last date?

219
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,409
I mean it this time.

220
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:13,290
Well, do me a favor--
mean it next time.

221
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm getting an award tomorrow
at the rotary club.

222
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,865
Bor-Ing.

223
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,950
Come on, I want my date to be
the most beautiful woman in the room.

224
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,780
Is that supposed to flatter me?

225
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,172
Only if you've never seen
the women of the rotary club.

226
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:26,380
Shut up and get me a sweater.

227
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,070
Have you even noticed
how cold I am?

228
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,110
Noticed?

229
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,337
It's made my whole evening.

230
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,710
Sweater-- now.

231
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,555
How about a nice,
cashmere cardigan?

232
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,070
Oh, my God!

233
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:48,416
What?

234
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,960
Look at this!

235
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,030
There's Lacroix and Ungaro
and vintage Gaultier.

236
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,745
Yeah, I don't really know
much about fashion.

237
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,510
They can hear you.

238
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,980
Oh,my God! There's another
rack back here!

239
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,120
This all your ex-wife's stuff?

240
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,800
She's storing it here
until her new house is ready.

241
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh,my God!

242
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,040
She wears my size!

243
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,570
It's amazing.
Nobody wears my size.

244
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,300
Well, I guess I have a type.

245
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,400
And normally that
would creep me out,

246
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,160
Except it means that I can borrow this
one-of-a-Kind Undari for our date!

247
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:23,590
Heel,girl.

248
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,660
- This belongs to my ex.
- So?

249
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,360
I don't think she'd appreciate me
loaning her clothes to my girlfriend.

250
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,940
Okay,"a", I'm not your girlfriend,

251
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,030
and "b", she's not gonna
find out unless you tell her.

252
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,420
Come on!

253
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,900
A dress this gorgeous
is meant to be seen.

254
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,550
Every day it hangs in the closet,
an angel loses its wings.

255
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,640
Well, that's very cute, but
the answer's still no.

256
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,080
Come on. Let's go.

257
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,143
I just wanted
a moment to say good-bye.

258
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,570
So in the next scene,
the guy wakes up,

259
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,490
and the girl Julia Roberts,
Sandra Bullock, one of those--

260
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:17,130
Is standing there
holding a tray of pancakes.

261
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,250
What happens then?

262
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,150
I keep telling you,
I don't remember.

263
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:22,170
What's the difference?

264
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,370
It's just some stupid movie I saw.

265
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,660
Yet every time you remember it,
you feel sad or upset.

266
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,600
I think something happened
at that movie or just afterwards.

267
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,130
Who did you see it with?

268
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,813
Well, it's obviously some chick flick...

269
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,140
so probably Susan.

270
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,416
Why not ask her about it?

271
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,401
Maybe she can tell you
what happened.

272
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,421
No,I don't want to bother her.

273
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,520
She just got engaged.

274
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,960
Mike, this therapy isn't just about
recovering your memories.

275
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,860
It's about you getting closure.

276
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,241
Now the emotions you're feeling

277
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:54,489
won't be resolved until
you know whathey're about.

278
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,350
I don't know.

279
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,750
Come on. Talk to Susan.

280
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,360
What could it hurt?

281
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,636
That's awesome.
I love model airplanes.

282
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,786
- So you'll help me put it together?
- <i>Sure</i>.

283
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,290
I'll see you tomorrow after school.

284
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,696
Can you come at 7:00 instead?

285
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:10,749
Why so late?

286
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:13,542
Mom says I can't play till
I finish my homework.

287
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,190
He's coming.

288
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,471
So can I stay up and
watch my show now?

289
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,578
You can stay up as late
as you want, champ.

290
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,264
Tomorrow...

291
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,090
you are going
to have an early night.

292
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:33,290
Your father's been up
there 20 minutes.

293
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,990
- Are you sure he's ok?
- He's fine.

294
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,350
He always lies down after dinner.

295
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:39,890
He says it helps his digestion.
Relax. It's going very well.

296
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,769
I set your mother on fire.

297
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,065
And you've been relentlessly
charming ever since.

298
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,086
Trust me,when she looks back at tonight,
she won't even remember the fire.

299
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,690
But she may remember this.

300
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,390
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?

301
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:59,290
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

302
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,923
At least this blouse made
it through dinner.

303
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,104
Let me get you a towel.

304
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:17,104
I hope you don't mind.

305
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,537
Dahlia has a birthday coming up,
and I saw this hanging there,

306
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,690
And I thought, "a robe!

307
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,553
Well, there's a notion.

308
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,665
So I just tried it on...

309
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,668
to get a sense of the drape.

310
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,394
Were you also thinking
of getting her a lace bra?

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,690
Oh, dear God!

312
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,990
Please don't mention this
to any of my family.

313
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,090
Just take the robe off.

314
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,325
And whatever
you have on underneath...

315
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,315
consider that yours.

316
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,133
Be reasonable, dear.
I'm only trying to protect you.

317
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:54,390
From Susan?

318
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,890
She doesn't care about my money.

319
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,190
She's never asked me for a cent.

320
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,830
Your logic is as wobbly
as the dining room chairs

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,690
She can't affordo replace.

322
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,835
I love Susan, and
I won't ask her to do this.

323
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:08,490
Hello. Mother's fine.
I found her a sweater.

324
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,790
- So, what won't you ask me?
- Nothing.

325
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,857
I was wondering if
you'd object to signing a document

326
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,781
that says should you
and Ian part ways,

327
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,339
you'll accept a cash settlement and not
go after the money he inherits from us.

328
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,503
You mean a prenup?

329
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,627
Please try to understand.

330
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,499
Our country estate has been
in our family for generations.

331
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,471
We want it preserved for
the children we hope Ian will have,

332
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,182
Not lost in some pricey divorce.

333
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,456
Well, who's getting divorced?

334
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,241
I'm in this for keeps.

335
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:48,449
I'm sure you said the same
to your first husband

336
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,490
Before you bolted
with all you could carry.

337
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:55,290
Mother, Susan is not signing anything.

338
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,159
Fine.

339
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,836
Then we'll leave it
all to your brother.

340
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,090
Do you think Nigel's
going to give you a grandson?

341
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,047
He's an alcoholic homosexual.

342
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,176
With a castle at stake,
he can learn a new skill.

343
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,696
Okay, stop this.

344
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,473
We invited you here to
celebrate our engagement.

345
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,211
Now I'm divorced,
and Ian's disinherited?

346
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,353
- Have I missed anything?
- We'll be going soon.

347
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,703
Please, don't be offended.

348
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,406
All of us go into marriage convinced
that everything will be perfect.

349
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,008
God knows I did.

350
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,148
And then one day, I found a bill
for some expensive lingerie--

351
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,556
Bustiers, peignoirs--
none of it in my size.

352
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,990
Certainly opened my eyes.

353
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,490
But I'm not like my father.

354
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,590
Trust him, he's not.

355
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,337
I'm sorry, Ian.

356
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,821
Hey, guys.

357
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,025
Hey, mrs. Scavo.

358
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:02,890
I'm sorry. We were just
taking a quick break.

359
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,175
We'll get back to work.

360
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:06,175
No, don't be silly.

361
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,892
Who am I-- Tom?

362
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,590
I'm one of you guys.
Sit down.

363
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,790
You know what we could use?

364
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,589
A good old-fashioned bitch session,
get some stuff off our chests.

365
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,114
So what's bugging you guys?
Okay, I'll go first.

366
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:31,390
How do we feel about these uniforms?
A little..."eh"?

367
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:35,868
They're okay.

368
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,780
But, why do we have
to pool our tips?

369
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,690
Why can't we just
keep what we earn?

370
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,470
Good point.

371
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,379
But right now we're talking about
these ugly-ass uniforms.

372
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,735
You know what bugs me?

373
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,451
No health benefits.

374
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,326
I'm kind of worried about
this mole that I found--

375
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:56,370
Focus, people! The subject is shirts.
It's killing morale.

376
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,006
- Well, I kinda like 'em.
- Really, Kim?

377
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:00,796
'Cause...

378
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,787
I heard one of your customers say
that when halloween comes around,

379
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,787
we should stick a candle
in your mouth.

380
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,581
See? Morale.

381
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,082
You guys need to stand up
for yourselves.

382
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,290
It's your right--

383
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:17,516
No,it's your obligation to go to
management and demand new shirts.

384
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,708
And if management doesn't like it,
you tell him he can go screw!

385
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,560
Break's over, people.
I'm gonna go find tom and talk.

386
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:30,496
Good.

387
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,011
I can't believe you tried
to undermine me like this.

388
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,497
Well, you gave me no choice.

389
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,031
It's just a uniform.

390
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,729
Why can't you wear it?

391
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,578
- Because I need to win one, tom.
- What?

392
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,686
You keep ordering me around and
disagreeing with me and ovruling me,

393
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,003
and I'm sick of it.

394
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,571
We have to do things my way
at least every once in a while.

395
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,220
This was the deal, Lynette.

396
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,286
You agreed. I'm in charge here.

397
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:04,389
You're in charge at home.

398
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,997
Except we're never home.
We live here.

399
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:08,390
Our marriage happens here.

400
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,775
Okay, you know what?
We can't talk about this now.

401
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,470
We open in ten minutes.

402
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:16,490
- Maybe later we can--
- Later I'll be asleep,

403
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,665
and then I will be back here
before you wake up.

404
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,517
We gotta deal with this now.

405
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,314
Okay, all right...

406
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,490
we're gonna deal with this now.

407
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,199
I'm gonna get ready
for the dinner rush,

408
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,790
And you're gonna wear
the damn uniform.

409
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:42,170
What?

410
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,092
I'm going home.

411
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,290
You're walking out on me?

412
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,596
I told you orange meant
something bad was gonna happen.

413
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,970
Hi. Remember me?

414
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:13,290
I had dinner here the other night.

415
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,383
Anyway, I was driving through
your neighborhood after having,

416
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:16,443
Like, three iced teas,

417
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:19,673
And I really have to go to the bathroom.
Do you mind?

418
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:45,390
You and I are gonna
be so happy together.

419
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,893
I feel 10 pounds lighter.
Thank you.

1
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,017
Hey, you got a minute?

2
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,439
I, uh, I need your help
with something.

3
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:32,166
- I should probably get these inside.
- Please, I...

4
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:34,537
I need to ask you about a movie.

5
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:40,003
And so the last part I remember,

6
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,352
the girl is putting these
raw pancakes in front of him,

7
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,190
and then something
else funny happened.

8
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,249
I don't remember.
It was just a stupid chick flick.

9
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,490
Mike, it wasn't a movie.
That was us.

10
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:53,411
What?

11
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:59,016
That was the first night
that we spent together.

12
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:00,716
I wanted to surprise you.

13
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,317
With raw pancakes?

14
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,114
Well, they weren't all raw.

15
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,305
I was trying to spell "Mike,"
and the "m" was goopy,

16
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,535
but the "ike" was delicious.
You loved it.

17
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:10,695
I did, huh?

18
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,990
Actually, no, it was gross.

19
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,245
But you were really sweet.

20
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,766
You just gave me a lot of
kisses and said not to worry,

21
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:18,793
I'd get a lot of chances
to make you pancakes 'cause...

22
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,680
'Cause I was planning on spending
the rest of...

23
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,429
my mornings with you.

24
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,502
You remember.

25
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,290
I should go 'cause, um,
Ian's parents are here.

26
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:47,464
it's nice to see you.

27
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:49,329
Thank you both for coming.

28
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,412
You know, I know I've said it ten times,
but you look fantastic.

29
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,575
And my offer still stands.

30
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,692
You do not have to pafor my dress.

31
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,021
Come on.You only needed it
for my luncheon,

32
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,233
and it looks like it cost a bundle.

33
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,085
Trust me, it was a steal.

34
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:08,791
I'm gonna go powder my nose,
and then you can start showing me off.

35
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,772
Heads-up-- I just saw your ex-wife.

36
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:15,372
What is she doing here?

37
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,942
Some friend of hers
is getting a plaque, too.

38
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,146
You want to duck out
after your speech?

39
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:21,287
Are you kidding?

40
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,322
I can't wait till she gets a good,
long look at Gaby.

41
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,212
I love your dress.

42
00:23:40,726 --> 00:23:41,749
Thanks.

43
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,295
It's one-of-a-kind, isn't it?

44
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,650
Yeah, couture.

45
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:47,026
Undari?

46
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:49,616
Good eye.

47
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,602
Well, I do have an unfair advantage.

48
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,062
I bought it.

49
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,778
So you're, uh...

50
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,749
Well, first, let me just say you
have amazing taste.

51
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,471
if we had met in any other context,
we would so get along.

52
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,350
I left those clothes with Victor
so he could store them,

53
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:11,417
not loan them to his sluts.

54
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:16,352
Okay, you're mad, so I'm just gonna
blow right by that slut crack.

55
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,867
I want my dress back now.

56
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,448
Okay, let's be reasonable.

57
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,472
You can't wear two dresses to one lunch.

58
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,245
It's not like I have a spare in the car.

59
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:25,547
Not my problem.

60
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,168
Give me back the dress.

61
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:28,853
Go ahead.Yell all you want.

62
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:31,465
You can't force me
to take off this dress.

63
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:33,626
This is pepper spray.

64
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,213
In three seconds,
your eyeballs will be on fire.

65
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:42,200
Could you help me with the clasp?

66
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:46,647
Hello, Samantha. I heard you were...

67
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:48,403
Isn't that Gaby's dress?

68
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:54,466
Gaby? You in there?

69
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:58,669
Hey, Victor.

70
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:03,281
You're probably wondering
why I've been in here so long.

71
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,629
Funny story--
I ran into your ex-wife.

72
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,794
Yeah, she brought me up to speed.

73
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,438
Okay, it's time for bed, Travers.

74
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,200
But I wanna show carlos my new turtle.

75
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,897
Right. I'm tired.

76
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,462
That's okay, buddy.
I gotta get going anyway.

77
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,473
Hey, you haven't even
finished your wine.

78
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:36,877
Sorry, early day tomorrow.

79
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,948
Come on, kiddo. I'll tuck you in.

80
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:59,662
Sleep tight, Travers.

81
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,055
Oh, no! I'm such a klutz.
I think I broke it.

82
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,141
Nah, nah, it's just a flap.
I can fix that.

83
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,325
Uh, Edie?

84
00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:18,437
I can't see what I'm doing here.

85
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:20,634
I'm sorry.

86
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:28,031
Maybe I should watch so that
if it breaks again, I can fix it.

87
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,364
Okay, so this hinge needs
to go in at this angle...

88
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,843
so that the flap works.

89
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:36,142
See?

90
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:38,075
God, you're so mechanical.

91
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,282
Edie, what are you doing?

92
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,568
Learning about flaps.

93
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,082
Nah, I think you're coming on to me.

94
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:48,621
Maybe.

95
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,449
Okay, Edie, no. Come on.

96
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:54,733
We're close friends,
and I don't want to ruinhat.

97
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,527
Oh, we're not that close.

98
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:58,443
Let's just do it and
see where it goes.

99
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,600
Okay, you know what?
It wouldn't go anywhere.

100
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,935
Why not?

101
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,982
'Cause... I'm looking for a girl
who wants to settle down

102
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,088
and be in a serious relationship,

103
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:10,560
and you're not that type.

104
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:13,865
What type am I?

105
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,403
You're...the fun type,

106
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:20,122
who likes to dress sexy
and go out and meet new people,

107
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,797
and then go out the next night
and meet another...

108
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:24,622
new people.

109
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,432
Do you think I'm promiscuous?

110
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,735
I'm just saying, for
a house on a cul-de-sac,

111
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:30,221
this place sees a lot of traffic.

112
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:33,643
Just because I'm popular doesn't mean
that I'm incapable of

113
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:35,634
a lasting commitment.

114
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,417
Look, you can't even
commit to your kid.

115
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:38,550
He's here for a month,

116
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:41,156
and you keep dumping him
on neighbors so you can go shopping.

117
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,052
That is, when you're not
using him for sex bait.

118
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,284
Get out of my house.

119
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:58,197
tom, it's me again.

120
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,109
You should've been home
30 minutes ago.

121
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,337
I know. You're still mad.

122
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,376
I am, to so why don't you come home
and we can be mad together?

123
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,878
See you soon.

124
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,468
So what kind of orange is this shirt?

125
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,757
Like a salmon or a coral?

126
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,025
Oh, cheese doodle.

127
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,424
Exactly, and I'm supposed
to wear that every damn day.

128
00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:19,014
Please. It's not that bad.

129
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,155
I once worked at
this fish-and-chip place.

130
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,962
I had to wear an eye patch
and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder.

131
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,480
"Would you like to hear arrr specials?

132
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,242
" why dot you just tell tom
to pick another color?

133
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,057
This isn't about the shirt anymore.

134
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,032
This is about us working together.

135
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,800
Every day it's a battle.

136
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,743
It's hurting our marriage.

137
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,572
You know what?

138
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,796
I'll just tell tom I need to step back.

139
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,099
You mean quit?

140
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:45,681
Yeah. We could hire
a manager or something.

141
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:50,320
How do you think
tom's gonna feel about that?

142
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,416
Well, once he decides
to stop hiding, I can ask him.

143
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,395
You know what?
I'm tired of waiting.

144
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,064
I'm gonna go down there
and I'm gonna talk to him.

145
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,793
See you guys later.

146
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,908
So I guess this means
we're babysitting the kids, huh?

147
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,201
Guess so.

148
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,923
I'm an idiot. Would you guys mind...

149
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,635
We got it. Just go.

150
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:33,600
Come on!
I know you're still here.

151
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,299
You realize what time it is?

152
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,053
I know! You're mad.

153
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,158
But you just...
you can't avoid me all night.

154
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,211
oh, my God!

155
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,926
Okay, okay, you're breathing.

156
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,951
That's good. That's great.

157
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,460
Hello? Hi. There's something wrong,
yeah, with my husband.

158
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,051
I don't-- I don't know.
He's unconscious.

159
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,001
357 Hawthorne place.

160
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,599
Okay, could you please hurry?

161
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,378
Thank you.

162
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,710
Listen to me.

163
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,941
I forbid you to die.

164
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,526
If you leave me with a mortgage
and a restaurant and five kids,

165
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:39,556
I swear I will track you into

166
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:42,439
the deepest pit of
hell and make you pay.

167
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,866
Do you hear me?

168
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,581
Come on, baby...

169
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,223
oh, please.

170
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,301
So that's it?
He threw out his back?

171
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,613
Oh, thank God.

172
00:30:57,784 --> 00:30:59,747
I'm guessing he passed out
from the pain.

173
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:01,510
But I wanna be clear.

174
00:31:01,604 --> 00:31:03,415
A ruptured disc is very serious.

175
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,782
He'll need surgery.

176
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,876
It'll be a while before
he's back on his feet.

177
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,283
How much of a while?

178
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,559
Three months.

179
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Three months?

180
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:13,036
Even then, he'll need to go easy.

181
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:15,467
What sort of work does he do?

182
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,124
We run a restaurant.

183
00:31:17,928 --> 00:31:20,210
He shouldn't go back
for four or five months.

184
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,616
Restaurant work is very stressful.

185
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,251
Yeah, it is.

186
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,262
What's that?

187
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:38,580
It's the prenup
my parents want you to sign.

188
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:41,729
And you brought it to bed?

189
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,537
okay, romance tip number one--

190
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,837
sorry.I just can't get
that off my mind.

191
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:49,935
I keep thinking,
why all thisngodly fuss?

192
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,300
Susan's not in this for money
and heirlooms.

193
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:54,960
Thank you.
I don't want your family's stuff.

194
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,057
What am I gonna do with half a castle?

195
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,276
Exactly.

196
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:00,537
So why not just sign it?

197
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:04,135
Well, I mean, looking at it rationally,

198
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,077
what's the difference between making
the promise you just made to me

199
00:32:07,202 --> 00:32:09,345
and making the same promise on paper?

200
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:14,204
Well, the difference is huge.

201
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,562
I mean, one way
you're trusting me, and...

202
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:21,693
and the other way,
you're trying to make it official.

203
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,751
But isn't that what marriage is--
making your love official?

204
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:30,031
Do you really want to start our life
together making me feel like...

205
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,496
I'm on probation?

206
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,994
You know that I trust you.

207
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,577
This isn't about my fears.
It's about my parents.

208
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,623
Really?

209
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,062
I think it's about someone else.

210
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,449
He just wanted me to help him
remember something.

211
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,301
Who?

212
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,461
I saw you watching us.

213
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,301
We were just talking.

214
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:56,653
I never thought anything else.

215
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,541
Okay, I'll sign it.

216
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,072
W-well... at least read it first.

217
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,789
I don't need to.
I trust you.

218
00:33:21,254 --> 00:33:22,347
Hi, Mike.

219
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:24,923
So tell me.
I've been dying to know.

220
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:26,234
Did you talk to Susan?

221
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,735
Could she remember what the movie was?

222
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,014
Actually... no.

223
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,199
Well, hang in there.

224
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:34,340
We'll figure it out.

225
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,080
It's just a matter of time before
everything starts coming back.

226
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,142
Here, have a seat.

227
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,313
Listen, you've been really helpful
the last few months, but I

228
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,780
think I'm done here.

229
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,694
Mike, I know this can be
a frustrating process.

230
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,072
But if you give up now, there are so
many memories that could be lost to you.

231
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,684
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

232
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,926
Oh, my God.
How many did you take?

233
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,059
Sorry. I wanted options.

234
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,820
Stop judging me.
I was hopped up on couture.

235
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,507
You know, it's not funny.
Samantha called her lawyer.

236
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,497
What? Yeah.
Over a dress?

237
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:18,932
God, what a bitch.

238
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:21,708
Don't call her that.

239
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,399
She threatened me with mace
and then slugged you.

240
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,564
Now you're on her side?

241
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:28,783
I didn't marry an angry woman.
I just divorced one.

242
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:31,465
What happened? Did you have
some little mistress on the side?

243
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:32,565
Worse.

244
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:35,275
I treated her like
she was the mistress.

245
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,504
I set her up in a nice house,
I gave her an allowance...

246
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,108
and then I came and
went as I pleased.

247
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:48,993
She was always there when I needed her,
but if she needed me, well...

248
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:53,282
and if she wasn't happy,

249
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:56,617
she could always go out
and buy a nice new dress.

250
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,169
You saw the closet, so you know
just how happy she was.

251
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,284
What?

252
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:12,870
I've known you for two weeks,

253
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:16,520
and this is the first glimpse
of a guy I could actually like.

254
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,938
A clueless,
emotionally stunted workaholic?

255
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:23,035
A guy who can admit he screwed up,

256
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:25,578
one who's not trying to impress me
every second of the day

257
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:28,128
with how perfect and charming he is.

258
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,685
I wouldn't mind seeing
more of that guy.

259
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,686
Well, his schedule's wide open.

260
00:35:34,026 --> 00:35:35,823
How about dinner tomorrow night?

261
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,156
I'd love to.

262
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:40,588
Although what am I gonna wear now?

263
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,674
Doesn't matter.

264
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:47,915
'Cause I'm just gonna
talk you out of it.

265
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,214
Look who's back--
mr. Cocky.

266
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,301
He never leaves for long,
does he, that guy?

267
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:07,882
Are there any points you'd like
to discuss before you sign?

268
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,347
I'd like you to say,
"we don't need this. We trust you."

269
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:16,234
But you don't, so I'll sign it.

270
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,405
And once I do, I am going to earn
your trust by being a good wife to Ian.

271
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,621
Well, we're sure you will be.

272
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,411
Sign all three copies, please.

273
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:35,285
I mean it. I am going to be loving
and faithful and above all, honest.

274
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,529
There'll be no secrets with Ian.

275
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,760
I'll tell him everything.

276
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,632
Well, we applaud your candor.

277
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:51,941
What I'm trying to say is,
there'll be no topic that I need to...

278
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,371
skirt,

279
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:59,502
no issue that I won't... address.

280
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:07,680
I won't conceal my true thoughts
under garments of secrecy.

281
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,133
Good for you.
Now if you'll just sign--

282
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,190
For God sakes, Dahlia. Anyone can see
she's not a fortune hunter.

283
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,500
Graham, what are you doing?

284
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,785
She is willing to sign.

285
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:20,230
Which proves she can be trusted.

286
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:26,482
I'm sure you'll be a good wife to Ian.

287
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,246
You can count on it.

288
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,872
Thanks for the flowers.

289
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,648
You're welcome.
Come on.

290
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:04,448
You know, about Travers--
you can see him if you want.

291
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,467
- He misses you.
- I miss him, too.

292
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,878
And just so you know,
he's at a sleepover,

293
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:14,984
so I didn't leave him alone
with a six-pack and some matches.

294
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,540
Look, Edie...

295
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:20,160
What I said about you
the other day was--

296
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,287
Dead-on.

297
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:24,131
You nailed me, carlos.

298
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,571
Maybe not the way
that I wanted you to,

299
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:27,746
but still...

300
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,842
but I had no right to judge you.

301
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,293
Besides, the guys, the clothes,
the partying-- that's you.

302
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:36,806
I mean, that's the Edie that we love.

303
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:40,145
Well, I'm glad you love her,
because I'm getting pretty tired of her.

304
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,945
- Come on.
- I'm a 40-year-old party girl.

305
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,369
Do you think that I don't know
that my days are numbered?

306
00:38:48,598 --> 00:38:50,368
I don't know what
you want me to say here.

307
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,832
Don't say anything. Just...

308
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,601
stop seeing the person that I've been
and start seeing the person I could be.

309
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:01,966
Look at me,

310
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:05,250
not the Edie that I show the world.

311
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,257
In fact...

312
00:39:11,612 --> 00:39:12,994
let's lose her.

313
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,750
Forget the blouse that
she wears because

314
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,349
she knows it shows off her cleavage.

315
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,581
Edie, what are you doing?

316
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,034
And the skirt...

317
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:28,955
that's so short,

318
00:39:29,273 --> 00:39:32,411
because she knows
that guys love long legs.

319
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,096
And the heels...

320
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,073
the ones that make
her legs look even longer.

321
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:40,446
Edie, please.

322
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,476
Forget the bra

323
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,651
that holds her breasts a little higher
than they are on their own these days.

324
00:39:53,002 --> 00:39:54,149
And the panties...

325
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,645
the ones that hide
the scar from my c-section.

326
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:12,822
This is it.

327
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,650
Hi, carlos.

328
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,065
I'm Edie.

329
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,552
I might not be the woman that
you thought I was under all of that...

330
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,323
but I'm real,

331
00:40:30,244 --> 00:40:31,392
and I'm here.

332
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,481
And I'm asking for a chance.

333
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,451
Hey, Andrew.

334
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,305
Thanks. He's gonna be okay.

335
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,073
No. No, absolutely not.

336
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,224
We will open tonight as usual.

337
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:08,394
Hey, it's gonna be fine, Andrew.

338
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,277
I will take care of it.

339
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,685
It's my job now.

340
00:41:14,274 --> 00:41:16,721
Okay. See you soon. Bye.

341
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,607
<i>In every housewife's closet
there's an article of clothing

342
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,848
<i>that tells you more about its owner
than she would want you to know.

343
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:36,000
<i>It might be a shirt that she despises
but wears without complaint.

344
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:44,892
<i>Perhaps it's some lingerie she knows
isn't hers but refuses to discuss...

345
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,329
<i>or a dress she once loved...

346
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,022
<i>that she can no longer bear to look at.

347
00:41:57,587 --> 00:42:03,145
<i>Yes, you can learn a lot about women
from what they choose to wear.

348
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,402
<i>You can learn even more by
what they choose to take off,

349
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:11,877
<i>and who

350
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,953
<i> they take it off for.
