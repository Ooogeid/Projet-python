<i>Previously on
Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:06,423
- Preston buy this for me in Paris.
- That woman is a gold digger.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,466
<i>There was a shocking announcement.</i>

4
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,218
You proposed?

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,470
She's the one. I know it.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,316
The other night was a mistake.

7
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:16,173
<i>A surprising move.</i>

8
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,197
<i>A dangerous disclosure.</i>

9
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:22,647
I'll tell you where she lives
when I get my 1,000$.

10
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,024
- <i>A stunning discovery.</i>
- What are you doing

11
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,531
- with a picture of Rex?
- He was my father.

12
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:30,108
<i>And a welcoming embrace.</i>

13
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:38,421
<i>You should never trust
family photos.</i>

14
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>They are designed to be misleading.</i>

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,792
<i>A mother's bright smile</i>

16
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,861
<i>may hide
a lifetime of disappointment.</i>

17
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:49,931
<i>A son's sweet expression</i>

18
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,507
<i>could conceal boundless rage.</i>

19
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:55,814
<i>A daughter's sedate pose</i>

20
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:59,547
<i>might obscure years
of un-lady like behavior.</i>

21
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:04,136
<i>And as for that father
with the air of dignity,</i>

22
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:06,107
<i>there's always the chance...</i>

23
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:09,569
<i>he has another family elsewhere.</i>

24
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,742
- I don't know what to say.
- I'm not surprised.

25
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,745
It's a shocking bit of news,
to say the least.

26
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:21,692
- So you're my brother?
- Half-brother,

27
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:22,874
to be precise.

28
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:25,697
I can't believe this.

29
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:28,922
You have every right to be upset.

30
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,421
Your father should've told us about
this years ago.

31
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:34,888
But please don't be angry with Sam.
It's not his fault.

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,848
I'm fine. I just need
to be by myself for a while.

33
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,727
Of course. We understand.

34
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,855
If you don't mind,
I'll hug you later.

35
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,890
Take your time.

36
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:52,955
He certainly handled that
better than I expected.

37
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,361
When the shock wears off,
I think we'll end up good friends.

38
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:59,239
And wait till you meet Danielle.
Her flight comes in tomorrow,

39
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,038
and I just know the two of you
are really gonna hit it off.

40
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,938
Don't you agree, Orson?

41
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,918
Yes, I'm sure.

42
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,422
Sam, would you mind locking up
the test kitchen?

43
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:11,965
Happy to.

44
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,099
Again, thank you for everything.

45
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:24,875
When did you speak to Danielle?

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,259
An hour ago, and she was just
as stunned as Andrew,

47
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:30,828
but when I said I was
gonna have a little dinner for Sam,

48
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:32,807
she was determined to be here.

49
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:35,739
You've certainly wasted no time
welcoming Sam to the family.

50
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:39,159
Why not? That skeleton's been kept
in the closet long enough.

51
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:40,780
I understand.

52
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,416
And I agree that Andrew and Danielle
should try to make a connection to Sam.

53
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:46,271
He's their blood relative.

54
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,290
I'm just not sure why
you're so excited by it.

55
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:50,462
Excited?

56
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,213
I'm ashamed.

57
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,049
Ashamed?

58
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,723
Rex kept that boy
in the shadows for years.

59
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:59,471
I can't look at Sam without feeling
overwhelming guilt.

60
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,974
- You have nothing to feel guilty for.
- It doesn't matter.

61
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,259
Rex is gone, and someone
needs to make it up to him.

62
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:07,688
He is a Van De Kamp,

63
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:10,779
and I am gonna see to it
that he is treated like one.

64
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,443
<i>Yes,</i>

65
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:17,238
<i>be careful
when looking at family photos...</i>

66
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:20,738
<i>Like certain members of the family,</i>

67
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,605
<i>they are not to be trusted.</i>

Hey MJ, have you gone in
and gotten your candy yet?

77
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:08,415
You better hurry up, 'cause I already
saw some kids selling candy outside.

78
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,542
- It doesn't matter.
- Why not?

79
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:14,074
'cause I'm not gonna win.
I never win anything.

80
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,298
You promised him he'd win?

81
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,751
He was about to cry.
What was I supposed to say?

82
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:23,596
How about, "If at first
you don't succeed, try, try again"?

83
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,142
He tries all the time.
He never wins anything.

84
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:31,204
He's horrible at sports.
He's lousy at card games.

85
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:35,024
Let us not forget his humiliation
at that spelling bee.

86
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,485
Why did he think
"Kayak" had a "Q" in it?

87
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:42,073
My point is that I want him
to feel good about himself.

88
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,979
Every child should win
something at least once.

89
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,412
See,

90
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,137
you win everything.

91
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:51,666
I know what it's like to lose.

92
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,406
Dear God,
not the jump rope competition.

93
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:57,939
It was sixth grade,
and there was a jump rope competition.

94
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,717
It was down to me
and Barbara Briscoe.

95
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,451
She had asthma,
and it was dandelion season,

96
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:06,879
and her eyes were swollen,
and she was jumping blind,

97
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,293
until...

98
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,880
her mom...

99
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,714
gave her an antihistamine shot...

100
00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:15,055
which is technically a steroid...

101
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:16,970
and she was juiced!

102
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:25,074
So are you gonna be
supportive or not?

103
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,040
Yes, I will,

104
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,111
if you promise

105
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,312
to never tell that story again.

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Was good?

107
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:44,609
If I had any government secrets,
they'd be yours.

108
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,491
<i>Irina? I'm sorry.
I need to get the laundry.</i>

109
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,313
<i>Hold one second.</i>

110
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,432
<i>I am yet to get decent.</i>

111
00:05:58,253 --> 00:05:59,755
- Come in.
- Thanks.

112
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:04,218
I thought I made that bed
this morning.

113
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,066
I...

114
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
take nap.

115
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,290
Feel much better.

116
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,127
I'll bet you do.

117
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:24,690
I will see you downstairs.

118
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:29,644
Man, that was close!

119
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,224
Crap.

120
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,924
Your father and I

121
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:35,270
told you
no sleeping together in this house,

122
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,105
and here you are, openly defying us.

123
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,732
Not openly. We were hoping
to get away with it.

124
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,184
That is not funny.

125
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:44,075
Your 11-year-old sister
is in the next room.

126
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:46,915
I don't want you setting
that kind of example.

127
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,180
Dude, look out.
Mom's back from the store.

128
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,581
This is what I was looking for.

129
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,341
I better get dressed.

130
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,902
Preston, get back here!

131
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,346
I don't want
a repeat of this, Irina.

132
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:07,885
Do you understand?

133
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,746
Why don't you just speak truth?

134
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:15,256
If Preston was seeing another girl,

135
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,348
you would not much care.

136
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,480
You just don't like me.

137
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:21,345
That...

138
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,645
is not true.

139
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,834
I'm still getting to know you,

140
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,912
and I am sure that over time,

141
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:31,832
I will come to think of you
as a valued member of our...

142
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,805
Here's what I was looking for.

143
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,591
You were right.

144
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,582
That was more refreshing
than taking a nap.

145
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:46,316
I told you.

146
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:51,586
Honey?

147
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,637
Don't dress in front of the window.

148
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,225
I'm afraid of what your body
could to do Roy's heart.

149
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:02,384
- Did you ever call him back?
- Yeah, this morning.

150
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:05,897
Mrs. McCluskey had her surgery,
and apparently, she's cancer-free,

151
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:07,862
so Roy's throwing
a party to celebrate.

152
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,449
That's so sweet.
I hope you told him we'll be there.

153
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:13,743
Can we talk about that?

154
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:19,218
I told him we'd go,
but I don't think we should go...

155
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,292
together.

156
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:23,659
What do you mean?

157
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:25,847
Except for Susan,

158
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:28,007
people don't really know
what's going on.

159
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:30,636
You know what's funny?

160
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:31,898
Neither do I.

161
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,598
So... what is going on between us?

162
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:39,394
Are we friends with benefits?
Are we just dating? What?

163
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,526
Do we have to put a label on it?

164
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,364
I just want to know
how you're feeling.

165
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,428
I really like you.

166
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,615
That's how I feel.

167
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,129
Can't that be enough for now?

168
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,017
It could be,

169
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:03,023
but it could also
be pretty wonderful

170
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:05,795
to let people know
how happy we make each other.

171
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,087
I... don't know.

172
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:12,801
I was right about the nap.

173
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,966
Hello, ladies! Hide the booze.
We have a guest.

174
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,167
Hit it.

175
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:28,071
Hi. My name is Juanita Solis,
and I'm in the third grade.

176
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:30,410
You're losing 'em.
Get to the pitch.

177
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,262
"Won't you support me?

178
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:34,699
"I am selling candy
so I can stay in school

179
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,160
and not end up on the street
selling drugs."

180
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,809
I'll take it from here.
It's a fund-raiser.

181
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:43,708
3 bucks a bar.
Whip out your wallets.

182
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,512
I'd hate to see Juanita on crack,
so I'll buy one.

183
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:49,483
- Me, too. Do you have caramel?
- One lousy bar?

184
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:51,591
It's a contest.
Juanita plans to win.

185
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,348
Come on. Need I remind you
of all the crap I've bought

186
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,889
from your kids over the years?
And I do mean crap,

187
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:00,850
not like this quality processed sugar
I am peddling today.

188
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,938
MJ is playing in the other room.
Why don't you go join him?

189
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:09,306
Here's the thing...
before you got here,

190
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,487
Bree and Lynette agreed to buy
eight bars from MJ.

191
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,656
It's okay. They can buy
from Juanita, too.

192
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,909
It's a little more
complicated than that.

193
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:22,884
MJ is having a bit
of a self-esteem crisis lately,

194
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:25,458
and he feels like
he's on a losing streak,

195
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,270
so I really, really need
him to win this one.

196
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,277
You understand, right?

197
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:32,798
Of course.

198
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,092
- Thank you.
- I understand. I just don't care.

199
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:38,676
- Excuse me?
- Juanita's having a crisis of her own.

200
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,682
She's new to Oakridge, and she's
having trouble making new friends.

201
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:45,493
As you know, the winner gets a party,
and they can invite whoever they want,

202
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:48,397
which could go a long way
in helping her fit in.

203
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,701
You understand, right?

204
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:53,601
Sure. Of course.

205
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,867
It's just,
he's never won anything before.

206
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,786
She has no friends.

207
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:07,917
So... what are we doing?

208
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,182
It seems to me
if we buy the same amount

209
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:13,461
from both of you,
it'll just be a wash,

210
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,841
so we don't need to buy any at all.

211
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,674
Get out your wallet.

212
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:29,492
I was so shocked to hear
you had lung cancer.

213
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:32,921
- I didn't even know you smoked.
- I didn't. That's the thing.

214
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:36,362
People think you have to be a smoker
to get it, but you don't.

215
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,204
A girl your age was having
the same surgery I had,

216
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:42,760
- never smoked a day in her life.
- You could be that girl, Gaby.

217
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:46,594
Let's get a drink,

218
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:48,665
since we're dying anyway.

219
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,991
- Remember...
- We're not a couple.

220
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:55,327
I know. We're on a
covert lesbian mission.

221
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,636
I'm sorry. I just want people
not to figure out we're together.

222
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:00,384
It'll blow their minds.

223
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,179
Please.
You stabbed yourself and blamed Mike,

224
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:05,433
and this will blow their minds?

225
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,935
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi, Tom. Having fun?

226
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:10,187
Best cancer party ever.

227
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,649
I was talking to Karen's doctor.

228
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,652
You made quite the
impression on him.

229
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:18,279
Me?

230
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,906
He begged me to introduce you.
Do you mind?

231
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,491
Why would I?
We're only roommates.

232
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:29,031
And here's your change. Enjoy.

233
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:31,574
Willy Wonka!

234
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:35,286
Selling candy
at an "I survived cancer" Party?

235
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:36,456
Tacky.

236
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:38,895
Chocolate is filled
with antioxidants,

237
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:41,736
which, as we all know,
fight disease.

238
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,180
So you could say
that I just saved a life.

239
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,826
Yeah, right. The competition
is between the kids.

240
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:49,738
They're supposed to be doing
the selling, not the parents.

241
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:51,980
Speedo season is a month away,

242
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,899
and you have the nerve
to sell this to my husband?

243
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,532
<i>... he was a doctor.
She was a surgeon.</i>

244
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,411
I always knew I'd go to med school,

245
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,566
that incredible feeling
of helping people.

246
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:12,750
Plus, they give you that pad, and
you can write any prescription you want.

247
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,616
Beautiful and laughs at my jokes.

248
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:19,265
Two more cocktails,
and I may be proposing.

249
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,858
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

250
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:24,845
Will you excuse me, David?

251
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,499
... and she never smoked
a day in her life.

252
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,851
You could be that girl, Lee.

253
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:36,649
It's one thing to hide our relationship.
It's another to flirt right in my face.

254
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,481
I wasn't flirting.
He was flirting with me.

255
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:42,098
I saw your face.
You were enjoying it.

256
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,807
Listen up, everyone.
I just want to thank you all for coming

257
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:49,543
and to say to Karen,
thank God you're all right, baby.

258
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:53,070
Thanks, everybody.

259
00:13:53,404 --> 00:13:56,013
And I also want to thank
the big guy upstairs.

260
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:58,446
Now if we could all take a moment

261
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:01,549
to remember the people who
weren't as lucky as I was.

262
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:05,594
<i>Make up your mind, Katherine.
Are you gay or straight?</i>

263
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,608
I don't know! Just because
I enjoy having sex with you

264
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,717
doesn't make me a lesbian!

265
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:17,898
Look at this.

266
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:21,527
I wonder what Rex would say
if he saw us here all together.

267
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,238
Probably,
"Who's the guy in the wheelchair?"

268
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:28,284
So, Sam, mom tells me
you got some fancy degree?

269
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,848
His MBA, which he earned
while working two jobs

270
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:34,039
- and nursing his sick mother.
- I just did what I had to do.

271
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,543
Don't be so modest. He also
spent a summer in Micronesia,

272
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,869
- helping to dig wells.
- It was challenging,

273
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,047
but I really wanted to work
with the poor.

274
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,841
Sounds like my first job.

275
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,926
You worked in the food court
at the mall.

276
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:47,685
The outlet mall.

277
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,946
Trust me. I know what it's like
to work with poor people.

278
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,475
They're always late.

279
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,315
Rex and I always hoped the
children would take an interest

280
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:58,334
in working
with those less fortunate...

281
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:01,901
We saw an opportunity to disappoint
them once again, and we grabbed it.

282
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:05,968
So...

283
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:08,656
My father was interested
in charity work.

284
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:10,409
- What else?
- So many things...

285
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:13,232
Travel, history, the arts.

286
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,331
He especially loved music.

287
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:17,451
Really? Me, too.

288
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:19,704
- I play the guitar.
- You do?

289
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,295
Stay right there.

290
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,900
That was lovely.

291
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,569
- I'm really rusty.
- Yeah, I could hear that.

292
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:47,745
This is pretty cool.

293
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,032
I'm actually playing
my dad's guitar.

294
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,824
It's just been sitting in
that closet for years, gathering dust.

295
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,538
In fact, why don't you keep it?

296
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,331
- What?
- What?

297
00:15:57,882 --> 00:16:00,584
Why not? You should have something
to remember your father by.

298
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,878
Wait a minute.
What if I want it?

299
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,743
What if Danielle wants it?

300
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,233
- I don't want it.
- Don't you have a flight to catch?

301
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,469
You've never shown
any interest in that thing.

302
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,555
It's my dad's guitar.
I'm plenty interested.

303
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,224
- But you don't even play.
- I do so.

304
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,352
I took lessons.

305
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:20,646
By all means...

306
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:23,948
we'd love to hear.

307
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,509
Jingle bells

308
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,733
Jingle bell...

309
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,327
Jingle

310
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:38,421
all the...

311
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,592
way.

312
00:16:41,763 --> 00:16:42,813
What fun...

313
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,664
What fun indeed.

314
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,630
Would you please
give Sam the guitar?

315
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,218
If Andrew wants it that badly...

316
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,887
He doesn't care about the guitar.
He's being unreasonable.

317
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:58,017
You're giving out my dad's stuff to
a total stranger and I'm unreasonable?

318
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,936
Sam is a member of this family.
Now give him the guitar.

319
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:04,556
I've got an idea.
Why don't we split it?

320
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,081
I must apologize.

321
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:25,591
My presence here is clearly causing
unhappiness. I think I should go.

322
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:29,835
No need to apologize. You have
behaved with the utmost dignity

323
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:32,968
in the face of unthinkable rudeness.
Thank you.

324
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:39,463
Yeah, I know.
He's the perfect son.

325
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,227
Problem is, he's not yours.

326
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,947
So... we talking yet?

327
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:05,728
What the hell?

328
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:09,205
I'm gettin bored of the silent treatment
so you might as well shoot me.

329
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,194
You had no right to tell her.

330
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,259
I know my mom. There was no other
way she was letting go of Danny.

331
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:21,781
So are we over this? Because if not,
I'd really prefer a bullet in my head.

332
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:24,701
It used to be just you,
me and Patrick knew.

333
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:26,689
Now your mom. What if he finds out?

334
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,399
She is not gonna tell him.

335
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,410
Ange, I love that boy.

336
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:35,270
I was the one in the delivery room.
I was the first one to hold him,

337
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:37,366
- even before you.
- I know.

338
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,244
I can't let him find out from
somebody else. I've gotta tell'im.

339
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:43,163
You are his father.

340
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,764
You gave up
your life to protect him.

341
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,252
You're the only father
he needs to know about.

342
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,959
Maybe you're right.

343
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:02,641
Please get this the hell out of here,
before someone gets hurt?

344
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,991
I didn't think you'd do it,
but I'm not stupid.

345
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,949
<i>It's Patrick Logan.
Just got into town.</i>

346
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,661
I was hoping to drop by,
you know, for the information?

347
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:24,872
How about tomorrow night?

348
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:27,339
See you then.

349
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:30,745
And I've got a case
of selective Alzheimer's,

350
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:32,662
so don't forget the cash.

351
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,535
It's Susan Bremer.

352
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:42,931
I know. It's been a long time,
not since graduation.

353
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:46,584
So, listen, do you remember the night
that you got caught streaking,

354
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:50,100
and I had to bail you out of jail,
and you said you owed me one?

355
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:52,367
Well, I hope you like chocolate.

356
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:56,445
Is that Mrs. Solis?

357
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:05,746
Tina, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

358
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,799
Is she selling candy?

359
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,128
Among other things.

360
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:16,298
I'm gonna lose
this contest, aren't I?

361
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:20,511
You're gonna win,
'cause mommy's done playing fair.

362
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:30,145
Irina and I were talking,
and we feel really bad about yesterday.

363
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,650
Look, we don't wanna come
down too hard on you guys.

364
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,901
We're just not comfortable having

365
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,153
a couple of unmarried kids

366
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,447
sleeping together in our house.
You understand.

367
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:45,147
That is why Preston
must tell you something now.

368
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,664
Irina and I have decided
to get our own apartment.

369
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,250
- What?
- That way it'll be our place,

370
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,550
and we can do whatever we want.

371
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,960
We're getting married
in six months anyway. Why not?

372
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,127
Why not?

373
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:00,843
Lynette, you wanna take this one?

374
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:03,755
I think it's a...

375
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:04,972
terrific idea.

376
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:07,641
They're not kids anymore.

377
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,144
They're old enough
to make this decision.

378
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,730
Thank you, Lynette. It's good
to know we have your support.

379
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,192
- See you later.
- Okay.

380
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,154
Have fun.

381
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,463
What are you doing?

382
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,117
We're supposed to pull 'em apart,
not push 'em together.

383
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,843
Do you remember that
apartment we moved into

384
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,788
when we were saving for this house?

385
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,082
That dump? Yeah.
It was the size of a closet.

386
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:35,043
Remember how we treated each other?

387
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:38,193
I remember a lot of
yelling and throwing stuff.

388
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,300
God, there were a few times
I was afraid that we were gonna...

389
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,550
Break up?

390
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,878
You are devious and evil,

391
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:53,928
and I have never been
more in love with you!

392
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:58,901
Susan Delfino, you are so busted!

393
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,069
Gaby, what are you doing here?

394
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,193
Alice Gibson told me
what you were up to,

395
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,681
but I couldn't believe
you would sink so low.

396
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:07,927
I don't know
what you're talking about.

397
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:11,568
Okay, folks. We're on a break.
Somebody's gotta take their meds.

398
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:13,285
No, not yet! Not yet!

399
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,063
Will you stop at nothing
to win this competition?

400
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,713
- That's funny, coming from you.
- Me? I have nothing to be ashamed of.

401
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,967
Well, let me jog your memory...
construction site, cold wind, no bra.

402
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,413
- You saw that.
- Yeah.

403
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,224
Did I not tell you
how important this was to MJ?

404
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,279
And I told you about Juanita. But
apparently, your son's problems are

405
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:36,271
- more important than anybody else's.
- That is not what I'm saying.

406
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,190
Whatever. We are done here.

407
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:42,042
And just so you know,
I am taking the gloves off.

408
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,155
Well, why not?
You've taken off everything else.

409
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,241
Candy for sale!

410
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:50,185
Help a young boy walk again.

411
00:22:58,188 --> 00:23:00,617
I haven't seen you since
the party. How you doing?

412
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:03,084
Still humiliated. Thanks for asking.

413
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,967
Come on. It wasn't that bad.

414
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:11,040
My sex life was laid bare
for the entire neighborhood.

415
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:12,599
What could be worse?

416
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:17,042
Let's see. You could have thrown a party
to celebrate getting over cancer

417
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:19,523
and had a couple of lesbians
steal your thunder.

418
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:21,407
Sorry about that.

419
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:25,362
But it's not funny, knowing
everyone is out there judging me.

420
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:28,767
Let me ask you somethin'.

421
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,450
Do you really like this girl?

422
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:32,952
I don't know.

423
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:36,748
I think I might.

424
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:40,675
Then why do you give a damn
what anyone else thinks?

425
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:43,452
People just stopped seeing me
as the crazy lady on the street.

426
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:46,675
I'm not ready for them to start seeing
me as the middle-aged lesbian, okay?

427
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:50,100
Well, if you care that much
about what people think,

428
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:52,175
you've got two choices...

429
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:55,850
dump the girl or move someplace
where people don't gossip,

430
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,667
if such a place exists.

431
00:23:59,027 --> 00:24:02,931
- It's not much of a choice.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

432
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:07,771
I get it.

433
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,759
Thank you.

434
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:12,434
Break it up.

435
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,800
This is how rumors get started.

436
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:22,634
What smells so good?

437
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:25,213
That's borscht.
Irina is making dinner.

438
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:29,347
You kids have been so busy looking for
your apartment, we've hardly seen you

439
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,887
- the last couple of days.
- You find something you like?

440
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,687
Put down a deposit
on a place yesterday.

441
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:41,622
Don't be freaked out about the size.
You two will have so much fun...

442
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:44,524
that you won't even notice
how small it is.

443
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,611
It's not small. Three
bedrooms and a balcony.

444
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:51,782
How are you going to afford a 3-bedroom
apartment while you're going to college?

445
00:24:52,904 --> 00:24:54,743
You tell them. I serve borscht.

446
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:58,445
- Tell us what?
- Well, you're right.

447
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:00,795
We can't afford anything
nice on our budget so,

448
00:25:00,962 --> 00:25:03,543
I'm gonna put off
college and get a job.

449
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,464
Say... something!

450
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:11,168
You sure you thought
this thing through?

451
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:14,763
Because, you know, you need to have
a college education to get a good job.

452
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,103
- I already got a good job.
- You did? Where?

453
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,434
The Meatpacking Plant. I'm a gutter.

454
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:23,146
- A gutter?
- I'm the guy who scoops out all...

455
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,107
Yeah, yeah! I know what it is.

456
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,485
Well, did you know I get paid
14 bucks an hour, plus benefits?

457
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,871
Seriously?

458
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:32,657
What, is it a union job?
Those jobs are hard to get.

459
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,898
You'll probably get
a discount on steaks, too.

460
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:37,920
Your son just announced
that he's giving up college

461
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:40,430
so he can be the guy
in charge of guts,

462
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:42,833
and all you can say is,
"Oh, boy. Free meat"?

463
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,627
This is good job.
The money is a lot. What is problem?

464
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,203
Maybe in Russia,
it's every mother's dream

465
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,720
for her son to see what the
inside of a cow looks like,

466
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:54,649
- but not in my home!
- Calm down.

467
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:57,639
You could be a doctor!
You could be a lawyer!

468
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,889
Why are you so intent
on throwing your life away?

469
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:03,565
He is going to support his wife.

470
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:05,730
That is what men do
for women they love.

471
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,108
He's not in love!

472
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,358
He's blinded by a piece
of self-serving euro trash

473
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:15,684
who would sell her own mother
for a pair of designer jeans!

474
00:26:40,135 --> 00:26:42,335
- Thanks.
- What's with the bike?

475
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:45,665
Eddie thinks he can get me a couple
of shifts down at the coffee shop.

476
00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:48,899
And since you guys are too
cheap to buy me a car...

477
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,400
Your first job.

478
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,818
Look at you.

479
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,804
- What happened to my little boy?
- I grew up.

480
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:02,329
- That's kinda the way it works.
- No, I know. I know. It's just...

481
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:07,820
You never think it's gonna go
as fast as it does.

482
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:11,406
You're so busy just getting through
the day. You don't realize they're...

483
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:13,278
starting to add up.

484
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:18,392
What's wrong?

485
00:27:18,823 --> 00:27:21,374
- What? What do you mean?
- You got that look that says...

486
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:24,613
"I got somethin' to tell you
and it ain't gon' be pretty."

487
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,394
Yeah, well, you know me, right?

488
00:27:26,918 --> 00:27:29,147
Of course I do.
You're my dad.

489
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:36,857
So what's up?

490
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,786
You're right. I am your dad.

491
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,130
Forget about it.

492
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:51,836
Work on your bike.

493
00:27:56,705 --> 00:27:58,205
Congrats on the job.

494
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,436
- Who is it?
- Patrick Logan.

495
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,111
Hope you like roses.

496
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:24,953
I'm sorry I couldn't get
an address or anything.

497
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,803
- You got me everything I needed.
- Good.

498
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:29,843
So...

499
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,625
then I guess...

500
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:36,151
Of course.

501
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:45,161
I know you...

502
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:48,092
been looking for Angie
for a long time but,

503
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,645
there's not gonna be
any trouble, right?

504
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:52,605
Trouble?

505
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:55,442
Well, you're not gonna, like,
hurt her or anything?

506
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,695
She took something of mine.
I want it back.

507
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:03,853
It's just...

508
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,182
I like Rose,

509
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:09,039
and I don't ever want to hear that
something bad's happened to her kid.

510
00:29:12,857 --> 00:29:15,307
You should get that money
to the bank.

511
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:17,625
This place doesn't seem
very safe to me.

512
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:20,050
What are you talking about?
Look at all those locks.

513
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:25,055
But what if someone
were to come up this fire escape?

514
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,766
That window's always locked.

515
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:31,401
You think that's gonna stop them?

516
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:40,852
What are you doing?!

517
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:44,199
They reach through,
unlock the window...

518
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:49,818
And now you're in trouble.

519
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,503
May I speak to you?

520
00:29:56,968 --> 00:30:00,309
How will this conversation end?
With beef Stroganoff on my head?

521
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:03,134
I am sorry.
Please to forgive.

522
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:05,466
I want us to be friends.

523
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,097
Really?

524
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,699
Think how hard it is for Preston,

525
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:12,268
caught in the middle
between our fighting,

526
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:15,068
when he wants us
to love each other only.

527
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:16,314
Yes?

528
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:20,008
I don't want to put Preston
in the middle, but I am his mother,

529
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:23,154
and I will fight for his best
interests till the day I die.

530
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:25,816
You mean you will fight me.

531
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:29,119
You understand English just fine.

532
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,122
Now you should understand.

533
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,874
I told Preston I want to
move up wedding to next week,

534
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,253
and he said yes.

535
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,048
Next week? The wedding is not
for another six months.

536
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,744
We cannot wait that long.
It is too hard for Preston

537
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,582
to choose between
a mother and a girlfriend,

538
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:51,850
so once I am his wife,
choice will be much easier.

539
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:55,120
No, you can't do this.

540
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,787
You met each other six weeks ago.
Preston barely knows you.

541
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:00,455
But you do, yes?

542
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:02,864
You think you know all about me,

543
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:05,131
and in much less time than that.

544
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:10,587
There.

545
00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:13,538
From one Mrs. Scavo to another.

546
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,055
I found some of your father's
old yearbooks up in the attic.

547
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:23,715
I thought you might enjoy
looking at them.

548
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:26,223
He played football?

549
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,928
Yes, and he was
student body president.

550
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:31,467
So what else
can you tell me about him?

551
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:33,850
Even my mom didn't
really know him that well.

552
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:36,794
He was...

553
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:39,045
incredibly smart,

554
00:31:39,825 --> 00:31:40,825
funny...

555
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:44,478
and so graceful.

556
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:49,657
What's wrong?

557
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:54,289
I just never get to
talk about Rex anymore.

558
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:57,606
Since I remarried, it just
doesn't seem appropriate.

559
00:31:58,397 --> 00:31:59,897
I hadn't realized...

560
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:04,047
how much I miss him.

561
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:09,344
You can talk to me about him
anytime you want.

562
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:13,205
You have his smile.

563
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:26,978
What are you doing out here?

564
00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:29,948
Mostly kicking myself.

565
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:32,784
I can't believe
how I acted at dinner.

566
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,647
Well, it was a fraught situation.

567
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:38,162
There was bound
to be some sort of scene.

568
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:40,279
Look, I know he's my brother,

569
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,500
I know I should try
to like him, but...

570
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,257
there's something about
him I just don't trust.

571
00:32:48,462 --> 00:32:51,051
- I know what you mean.
- You do?

572
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:54,544
He's trying awfully hard
to get close to Bree.

573
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:58,726
- I, for one, would like to know why.
- You think he has an agenda?

574
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:02,814
We all have agendas, Andrew.
Mine is to protect your mother.

575
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:06,568
And what do we really know
about Sam?

576
00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:09,339
Just the stuff he tells us.

577
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:12,824
It seems a bit too good
to be true, doesn't it?

578
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,969
Maybe... my agenda should be
to find out everything I can.

579
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,060
Why shouldn't you?

580
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:22,791
He's your brother.

581
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,465
Quick question.
How is MJ Doing?

582
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:31,801
I'd like to see a little
more effort in math.

583
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,131
Not in class. I mean
the candy drive. Today's the last day.

584
00:33:35,298 --> 00:33:38,917
Susan, you should be so proud.
He is a selling machine,

585
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,311
way out ahead of the whole school...

586
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,311
Except for Juanita Solis.

587
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:46,781
But don't worry.
She is just two bars ahead.

588
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:49,344
You better get him out there.
Gaby Solis told me

589
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:52,347
she's taking Juanita to sell
outside a weight loss clinic.

590
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,552
Can I go now? My mom wants
to pick me up a couple minutes early.

591
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,096
Does she?

592
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:22,967
Sure, sweetheart.

593
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:26,481
Why don't you just help Vanessa
put her brushes away first?

594
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,029
What is that?

595
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,047
Did someone bring a cell phone
into my classroom?

596
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,594
Is this your cell phone?

597
00:34:58,988 --> 00:35:02,338
Come on now. It was in your bag.
Whose else could it be?

598
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:06,187
Yours. My mom gave it
to you for your birthday.

599
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:12,777
So are you saying that you stole it?

600
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:18,199
Now you're yelling at me. Someone just
bought herself three hours of detention.

601
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:29,738
Hi, Principal Hobson.
Everything okay?

602
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Detention?

603
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:37,374
We only have a few hours left
to sell candy. Who gave her detention?

604
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:39,465
She did, huh?

605
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:46,195
Thanks for letting me know.

606
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:55,857
You must be getting thirsty,
walking around in this heat.

607
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:59,224
Doesn't a nice, big, ice-cold
cup of soda sound good?

608
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,399
I have something that belongs to you.
<i>Check your cell phone.</i>

609
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:38,903
- He's supposed to be out selling.
- He was.

610
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,991
Then you gave my daughter detention.
Bad move.

611
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:46,287
- All right, what do you want?
- Let her go, and I let him go.

612
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,456
- I don't trust you.
- I don't blame you.

613
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:52,001
Bring him here.
We'll make the exchange.

614
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,303
Fine. But I'm warning you,

615
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,340
if there is one chocolate bar
missing from that girl's box,

616
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,415
<i>you'll answer to me.</i>

617
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,268
Your mom will be here soon.
Don't worry.

618
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,105
You'll be out selling
your candy in no time.

619
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,481
I hope so.

620
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,942
I gotta win.

621
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:20,630
You know, Juanita, there are
other kids that want to win, too.

622
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:21,797
I know.

623
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:24,784
I just want my mom
to be proud of me.

624
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:28,454
Your mom is proud of you.

625
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:33,454
Sometimes I think she's embarrassed
because I don't have any friends.

626
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:35,921
Every day I come home, and she asks,

627
00:37:36,374 --> 00:37:38,524
"Did you make any friends today?"

628
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,636
She just wants to make sure that
you're happy, sweetie. That's all.

629
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:45,367
I guess.

630
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:50,248
I just wish I could make friends
as easy as she does.

631
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,260
I try and I try, but I just can't.

632
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,278
We would have gotten here sooner,
but your son can't hold his soda.

633
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,156
Juanita, come on.
We got candy to sell.

634
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:08,369
Mom, we gotta go, too. Otherwise,
Juanita's gonna beat me.

635
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:11,017
Sweetie...

636
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,008
I know you want to win,

637
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:19,811
but let's talk about
what winning really means.

638
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:31,976
I've rehearsed this
speech a hundred times.

639
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:35,438
Well, I think I know how it ends.

640
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,964
I can't live my life with

641
00:38:40,657 --> 00:38:43,525
everyone in the neighborhood
watching me

642
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:46,021
and judging me. I...

643
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,826
care too much
about what people think.

644
00:38:51,492 --> 00:38:52,997
So you want me to leave?

645
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:59,799
But if you wouldn't mind...

646
00:39:01,196 --> 00:39:02,896
I'd like to go with you.

647
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,660
Seriously?

648
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:10,354
I want to figure out
what we have here,

649
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,079
and once I know...

650
00:39:14,212 --> 00:39:16,662
maybe I won't care
what anyone thinks.

651
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,693
You know what I think?

652
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,238
What?

653
00:39:27,256 --> 00:39:29,356
I've always wanted to see Paris.

654
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:40,777
And the winner of this
year's candy drive is...

655
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:42,171
Juanita Solis!

656
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,782
We did it!

657
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:53,018
You did it.

658
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:56,709
Now go invite your
brand-new friends to your party.

659
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,984
- Tell me. Was it close?
- Really close

660
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,029
until the last day, when Juanita
sold 40 bars and MJ didn't sell any.

661
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,241
Really?

662
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:11,244
That's weird.

663
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:22,461
- I'm sorry you didn't win.
- That's okay.

664
00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:28,259
I'm curious about something. How come
you didn't sell any candy yesterday?

665
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,370
My mom says it's a secret.

666
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:35,057
She says it's only a good deed
if we don't tell.

667
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:46,902
You should listen to your mother...

668
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:51,737
Because she is a winner,
just like you.

669
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,705
<i>There are a lot of ways
to win in this world.</i>

670
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:01,245
<i>Some battles are won</i>

671
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:03,912
<i>with a hasty retreat.</i>

672
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,175
<i>Some victories are claimed...</i>

673
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:11,022
<i>by those willing to cheat.</i>

674
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,062
<i>Some opponents are defeated...</i>

675
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,166
<i>with nothing more than a smile.</i>

676
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:22,278
<i>Of course, for some,</i>

677
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,438
<i>it's not enough to win.</i>

678
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:27,456
<i>Someone else...</i>

679
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,073
<i>has got to lose.</i>
