00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:02,330
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,625
<i>It was a joyous occasion until...</i>

3
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:08,853
- Did I miss anything?
- I'm asking you nicely to leave.

4
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:11,423
If you don't, I will drag you
out of this church myself.

5
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:13,651
I don't love these babies.

6
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,899
<i>Lynette struggled
with her pregnancy.</i>

7
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:17,429
Stop saying that.

8
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:20,863
- <i>Gaby made a commitment...</i>
- I am now officially your guardian.

9
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,517
- <i>And Bree...</i>
- I'm married.

10
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:26,479
- To a man who's blackmailing you.
- <i>Jumped in with both feet.</i>

11
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,482
- We could be happy here, right, Danny?
- <i>New neighbors...</i>

12
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:31,610
Would you like to go to a movie?

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,777
<i>Moved in.</i>

14
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:35,488
- Please let me explain.
- Go to hell.

15
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:37,616
- What's gotten into him?
- He's a teenager.

16
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:39,045
Go look for him.

17
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:42,537
<i>And evil made an
appearance on Wisteria Lane.</i>

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,998
<i>The first time Karen
Mcluskey saw Roy Bender, </i>

19
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:55,050
<i>she did something
she didn't expect to do.</i>

20
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:57,558
<i>She smiled.</i>

21
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,134
<i>The next time they met, </i>

22
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:04,203
<i>Roy did
something he didn't expect to do.</i>

23
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:07,086
<i>He smiled back.</i>

24
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:11,528
<i>After a week of sly flirtations, </i>

25
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:15,327
<i>Karen and Roy did something
no one expected them to do.</i>

26
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,203
<i>And they did it twice.</i>

27
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,642
<i>With each passing day, </i>

28
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:28,501
<i>Karen began to feel something
she hadn't felt in years, </i>

29
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,264
<i>and she realized she needed to know</i>

30
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:33,505
<i>if Roy was feeling the same way.</i>

31
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,520
Has it been an hour yet?

32
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,537
14 minutes.

33
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:44,182
Your doctor
said you need to walk an hour a day.

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,257
The little snot nose--

35
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:49,354
I'd like
to drop dead just to piss him off.

36
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:51,500
Don't even joke about that.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,985
I like having you
around. I like it a lot.

38
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:57,778
You remember to put the seat down.

39
00:01:57,948 --> 00:02:00,281
You can drive at night. A
girl could get used to that.

40
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,565
How many minutes has it been now?

41
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:07,448
I'm trying to tell you how I feel.

42
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,138
I didn't expect this.

43
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:12,587
I always thought that...

44
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,932
You just get one big love in this
lifetime,

45
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,936
and that was my husband Gilbert.

46
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:19,450
And after he died,

47
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,804
I figured the rest of my life
was about making meatloaf for one.

48
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:25,225
Then you come along and...

49
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:28,614
Hell...

50
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:30,770
I love you, Roy.

51
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:38,325
Isn't there anything
you wanna say to me?

52
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,905
You know how I feel.

53
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:44,200
A woman needs to hear the words.

54
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,163
All right. Here we go.

55
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,415
What the hell?

56
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:54,692
Oh, my god!

57
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:56,429
Are you all right?

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,009
We gotta call 9-1-1!

59
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:05,368
<i>For a moment, mrs.
Mccluskey didn't move.</i>

60
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,267
<i>And whether it was her boyfriend's
discovery of Julie Mayer</i>

61
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:13,498
<i>or her realization that
he wasn't going to say the words</i>

62
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:15,879
<i>she desperately needed to hear, </i>

63
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:21,328
<i>Karen Mccluskey suddenly
felt the urge to...</i>

Ten Minutes Earlier

67
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,175
<i>It was
a shame what happened that day, </i>

68
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,592
<i>considering
how nicely the morning had begun.</i>

69
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,246
<i>One neighbor was out reading the sports
section, </i>

70
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,228
<i>delighted
to see that his team had won.</i>

71
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:53,014
<i>A child
was playing with her new doll, </i>

72
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:56,459
<i>thrilled
to discover just how durable it was.</i>

73
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:01,931
<i>And a woman was walking
with the man she adored, </i>

74
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:04,312
<i>determined to say she loved him</i>

75
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,572
<i>for the very first time.</i>

76
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:11,409
<i>Yes,
up until the screaming started, </i>

77
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,058
<i>people thought
it was going to be a wonderful day.</i>

78
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:40,905
Good. You're up.

79
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:45,245
- Good mornin'.
- Good morning.

80
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,619
Did you go to sleep with a
breath mint in your mouth?

81
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:56,157
This is our first morning waking
up as husband and wife again.

82
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,511
I wanted it to be perfect.

83
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,403
It couldn't be more perfect.

84
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:05,300
Yes, it could.

85
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:09,470
Here's a breath mint for you.

86
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,929
Did we
really get married last night?

87
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,722
Either that, or we paid a lot of
money to watch our friends get drunk.

88
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:23,626
- Come here, Mrs. Delfino.
- All right.

89
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,613
We have a honeymoon to get started.

90
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,240
Hey, whatcha doin'?

91
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,534
Nothing, sweetie.

92
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:36,037
Why don't you go play in
your room for ten minutes?

93
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:37,290
Ten?

94
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,666
I wanna play in here.

95
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:44,672
Of course you can.

96
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:47,411
In fact, I can't think of a better
way

97
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,576
to start our new life together--

98
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:51,916
all of us here, Julie's home.

99
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:55,535
You know, the last couple years,
when I used to think about

100
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:57,588
what I needed to be happy,

101
00:05:58,614 --> 00:05:59,760
this was it.

102
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:04,011
This was the picture
I had in my head.

103
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:11,061
Hey, Danny. It's Anna.

104
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:13,701
Did you get my
message about going to the mall later?

105
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:16,746
That's cool.
How about tomorrow?

106
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,387
Me, too. The mall blows.

107
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:23,624
Give me a call if you wanna hang.

108
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,216
Shot you down?

109
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,178
I could
get Danny Bolen anytime I want.

110
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,265
Let me know if you need any help.

111
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,111
Not that I need your help, but...

112
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:41,646
What do you got?

113
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:45,692
Here's the secret to landing
a guy--you have to ignore them.

114
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,493
<i>You</i> ends the conversation.

115
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,196
<i>You</i> are too busy to get together.

116
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:51,990
And?

117
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,606
And that's it.
Trust me, it works.

118
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:58,663
- How do you think I played this one?
- You did not play me.

119
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:02,105
Like a fiddle. You know how
many runway shows he sat through

120
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:04,043
before I would even
look at him? Six.

121
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,296
- It wasn't that many.
- Six.

122
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:10,466
And when he finally asked
me out, I said, "okay."

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,970
But then at the last minute, I
backed out, saying I didn't feel well.

124
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,847
You weren't really sick?

125
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:19,940
God, no. I had a pedicure
and then went to Sardi's for drinks.

126
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,437
After that, he was my slave.

127
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,397
I rented a yacht that day!

128
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:26,864
Really? That's hilarious.

129
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:28,693
A week later, he gave me this.

130
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:30,862
I lost that deposit!

131
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,531
Eat your waffles! I'm teaching!

132
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:42,926
Look at you.

133
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,680
I know. Martha friggin' Stewart.

134
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:49,699
Hey, Ana. I'm not much of a

135
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,156
a mall guy.

136
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,976
But I'll see you around.

137
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,338
- Mornin'.
- Where were you last night?

138
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:02,078
- Out.
- Where "out"?

139
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,563
I drove around lookin' for you.

140
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:07,617
I couldn't sleep.

141
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:09,982
I went a lot of places.

142
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,492
Happy now?

143
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:14,010
Don't be a wiseass.

144
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:16,699
- We were worried about you.
- Nick, go take your shower.

145
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,464
12 oranges for a half a cup
of juice?

146
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:31,923
That's worth it.

147
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,591
No, thanks.

148
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:36,677
We're sticking with
the moody teenager thing?

149
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,337
Come on. What'd you do last night?

150
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:43,559
I already told dad.

151
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,970
- I went out.
- Danny, it's me.

152
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:51,388
What did I do when Peter Spadaro pushed
you off the swing set in first grade?

153
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,028
I threw a slushee in his mom's face.

154
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:57,996
Clearly, I have your back.
Talk to me.

155
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,871
I went out drinking.

156
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:09,544
There's nothing else to do here.

157
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:17,756
I know this move has been hard on
you, but try to make the best of it.

158
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,972
Trust me, it takes a lot
more effort to be unhappy.

159
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,189
Thanks for being honest.

160
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:32,733
And that's for drinking.

161
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,074
Mom, was that you throwing up
in the bathroom this morning?

162
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:43,494
I was feeling a little nauseous.

163
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,857
Sick in the morning.

164
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,208
If you weren't so old,
I'd say you were pregnant.

165
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,290
Okay, guys,

166
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,117
here's the deal.

167
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,357
I had some bad seafood last night.

168
00:09:58,185 --> 00:09:59,385
We had chicken.

169
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,318
I mean after that. I went out

170
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:05,174
to get gas, and I had...

171
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:06,173
Clams.

172
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:10,108
I don't remember where I ate them.

173
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:12,211
I just saw this sign "Clams",

174
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:15,449
and I thought, "I haven't had clams
for a while." so I went in

175
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:18,490
but they were bad,
which is why I was throwing up.

176
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:25,411
My point was,
next time, please flush.

177
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,663
And I'm done with my oatmeal.

178
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:41,981
What?

179
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:45,473
We said we weren't gonna tell the
kids until after the first trimester.

180
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:46,989
That's next friday.

181
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:50,645
You actually know the day.

182
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:52,561
You're really into this.

183
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:53,814
Someone has to be.

184
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:57,551
I'm not telling anybody until we're
absolutely sure everything's okay.

185
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:01,072
Really? Are you sure that's the
only reason you're not telling them?

186
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:14,919
I can't open my eyes
all the way. Who is it?

187
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,838
Did someone have too much wine?

188
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,259
I don't know.
I was too drunk to notice.

189
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:25,888
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm just looking for Bree.

190
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,266
She's not here.

191
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:31,067
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

192
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:33,354
I just woke up, and
she was already gone.

193
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,989
She's not in the test kitchen?

194
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,984
I wanted to let her know
I'm taking the morning off.

195
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,371
I'm sure she'll understand,

196
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,197
given all you've been through.

197
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:44,991
What do you mean?

198
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,910
Mike and Susan getting married.

199
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,037
I'm not upset about that.

200
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:51,288
Really?

201
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:56,134
- Good. I'm glad.
- It's not as if it's gonna last.

202
00:11:57,613 --> 00:11:58,504
Excuse me?

203
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:04,260
Mike doesn't really love Susan.
He feels sorry for her.

204
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:06,596
He'll be back.

205
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,226
My thoughts exactly.

206
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:17,148
That... Was amazing.

207
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,102
Who knew you were such a wild woman?

208
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:23,112
I'm not.
I've never done this before.

209
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:26,222
You are a fast learner.

210
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,436
Sex for me has always had to have an
emotional,

211
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:32,870
romantic or even
spiritual dimension.

212
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,401
I can see now you can take all
of that away and it's still...

213
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,461
Marvelous recreation.

214
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,839
- The best there is.
- Except when you tried to--

215
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,841
- I'm sorry.
- I mean, really.

216
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:45,217
Some people like it.

217
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,304
You've done this a lot...

218
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,246
You don't stay this good
by skipping practice.

219
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,851
God, you're a pig. Kiss me.

220
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:01,233
Hold that thought.

221
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:07,184
That's weird. It's Mike.

222
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:12,432
Karl, listen.
There's no easy way to say this,

223
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:15,027
but something's happened to Julie.

224
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:31,024
She was just lying there.

225
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:34,058
- What if we hadn't found her in time?
- Thank god you did.

226
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:40,169
How could this happen?
Julie's the nicest girl in the world.

227
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:42,632
I know. Who'd want to hurt her?

228
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:07,558
I gotta go. We'll call
you as soon as we hear anything.

229
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:09,593
Tell them we'll
take good care of M.J.

230
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:15,099
This is insane. How could
someone strangle Julie?

231
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,518
And on our property.
It could've been me.

232
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,438
I've never had much
upper body strength.

233
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,834
I'd love to say
he means well, but...

234
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,728
What are you looking at?

235
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:35,832
This horrible thing happened.

236
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,788
We're all trying
to make sense of it.

237
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,049
Where are they?

238
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,807
Tthey were out here...

239
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,801
For a minute.

240
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:51,466
When you think about it, how
much do we know about these people?

241
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:54,221
Not much. They're from New York.

242
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:56,345
- They have a son...
- Danny,

243
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,991
who I saw coming out of a movie

244
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,853
with Julie.

245
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:03,355
Seriously? Like a date?

246
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,170
Sure looked that way.

247
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,358
When women are attacked, the police
look at the husbands

248
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:10,234
or the boyfriends first.

249
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:14,462
Maybe it's time that we get
to know our new neighbors.

250
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,448
They are all looking at our place,

251
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:25,044
and I do not think they
are admiring our azaleas.

252
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:28,157
- Why are they staring at us?
- Let's see.

253
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,721
We're the new people, Mrs. Mccluskey
saw you fightin' with Julie,

254
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:34,303
and she turns up almost dead.

255
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:37,004
Are you kidding me? I had
nothing to do with that.

256
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:39,350
- I like Julie.
- Then what were you fightin' about?

257
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,182
Nothin'.

258
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:43,479
It's personal.

259
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:46,354
You're not gettin'
how serious this is.

260
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,086
If that old lady talks to
the cops, we got problems.

261
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,738
Just tell me where you went
last night.

262
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,619
I keep trying to remember.

263
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,117
I think I was at the park.

264
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,372
- I drove by it. You weren't there.
- I drank a lot. It's a little fuzzy.

265
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:04,333
That's great, Danny.

266
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:06,669
That's really great.

267
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,297
If anybody asks,
he was home with us.

268
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:12,925
No, because if anybody
saw him out, we're done.

269
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,840
Maybe the old lady
won't talk to the cops.

270
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:17,793
Maybe I won't need an alibi.

271
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,900
People are already
lookin' over here!

272
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,103
Maybe that is because we are hiding
in our house like guilty people.

273
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,583
I am going to make
Susan and Mike a manicott'.

274
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:34,382
And then we are going to get out
there and start hugging people.

275
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,535
The cops are going
door-to-door asking questions.

276
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:45,266
Won't be long before they're here.

277
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:49,128
- What am I gonna tell them?
- The truth--

278
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:51,964
that you saw that
Bolen kid fighting with Julie.

279
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:55,807
It was just a couple of
words. They're kids. They argue.

280
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,511
If I start pointing fingers...

281
00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:00,472
- You're telling 'em what you know.
- What if I'm wrong?

282
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,101
I can't have another family
on this street hating me.

283
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,415
- Who hates you?
- The gay guys.

284
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:08,606
I've said stuff.

285
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:11,835
Listen to me.

286
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,279
You know you've gotta
do the right thing.

287
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,245
But you don't have to do it alone.

288
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:21,455
I'm gonna be right here with ya.

289
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,433
And...

290
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,832
There was something I wanted to say
before,

291
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,141
and I didn't get the chance.

292
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,631
If you got hit by a bus,

293
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,502
I'd really miss you.

294
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:38,802
That's it?

295
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:44,600
You're showering alone tonight.

296
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:47,102
All right, I love you.

297
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:48,896
There.

298
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:50,722
I said it.

299
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,570
Do you mean it, or is that just
your beta-blockers talkin'?

300
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,013
We'll find out in an hour.

301
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:04,046
Anyone who
would want to hurt your daughter?

302
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,451
I told you. She's a great
kid. Everybody loves her.

303
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,592
- Where is that doctor?
- He'll be here as soon as he can.

304
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:12,670
Was she dating anyone?

305
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,803
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

306
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:20,010
If she was dating, I would know.
He said he would be here.

307
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,318
Mrs. Delfino, I know how
difficult this is for you.

308
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:26,809
Really? Has your
daughter been attacked?

309
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,041
You know what? How about we
do this after she talks to the doctor?

310
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:39,602
How is she?

311
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:42,574
We don't know yet.
Nobody's talking to us.

312
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:44,951
Do you need somebody
to take care of M.J.?

313
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,140
Bob and Lee are watching him.

314
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,744
- Mrs. Delfino?
- Dr. Hill, what is going on?

315
00:18:49,914 --> 00:18:52,134
She's still unconscious.
I'd like to run some tests,

316
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:53,975
make sure
there's no internal bleeding.

317
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,175
- What kind of tests?
- Blood work, x-rays.

318
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:59,529
- Can we go with you?
- Of course.

319
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,639
- Can I talk to you?
- We really need to move here.

320
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:08,837
I don't think you
should give her an x-ray.

321
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:10,985
Lynette, just let him do his job.

322
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:14,302
Julie's pregnant.

323
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:16,279
What?

324
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:19,111
She might be. She's not sure.

325
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:21,822
What are you talking about?

326
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,367
She told me.

327
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:29,969
It's no problem. I
can give her an M.R.I.

328
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:32,866
There's no radiation, so
it's safer for the baby.

329
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,112
Hey, guys.

330
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:49,224
What's up?

331
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,289
We're just taking some
food over to Mike and Susan's.

332
00:19:55,982 --> 00:19:57,611
We feel so
awful about what happened.

333
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,944
You talk to the guys. I'm gonna get this
over there while it's still hot.

334
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:05,120
After what happened, we're thinking of
starting up a neighborhood watch.

335
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,242
- Are you interested?
- Yeah, of course.

336
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,286
Great.

337
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:13,874
Danny must be pretty shaken up. He's
pretty close with Julie, isn't he?

338
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,668
I think we're all pretty shaken up.

339
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,130
Weren't they dating, though?

340
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:23,533
No, just friends.
She was helpin' him with some tutoring.

341
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:24,676
Really?

342
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:28,209
'Cause some people saw
them at the movies together.

343
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,558
Like I said, just friends.

344
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:37,064
So this neighborhood watch thing--
is there gonna be a meeting?

345
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:42,486
We'll let you know.

346
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:47,665
Is this really
about the neighborhood watch?

347
00:20:47,835 --> 00:20:50,953
'Cause it seems like the only
one you're watching is my kid.

348
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:53,173
Honey!

349
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:55,499
It's your mother.

350
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:58,168
We're done.

351
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:00,400
Right, guys?

352
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:02,903
Thanks.

353
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,107
That didn't look like
it was going so good.

354
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:10,041
They were asking about Danny.
It's like you said they would.

355
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:12,911
Then it is time to
get our son an alibi.

356
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:22,067
I saw you drive in.

357
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:26,363
I wanted to come home and take a shower
before I head back to the hospital.

358
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:29,561
I know things have been...

359
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,911
Awkward lately.

360
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:35,831
But I heard about Julie,
and I wanted to do something.

361
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:37,291
Thank you.

362
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:40,716
I know Susan will appreciate it.

363
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:51,673
- How is Julie?

364
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,229
We don't know.
They're still doing tests.

365
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:57,284
God. I can't imagine
what you're going through.

366
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,876
You have to stay strong, Mike.

367
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,245
Wait. What are you doing?

368
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:19,041
Just letting you
know I'm here for you.

369
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:26,924
Anytime.

370
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:32,055
Come on in.

371
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:37,231
Ana, there are two detectives here
who wanna ask you some questions.

372
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,086
What about?

373
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:41,527
We're investigating
the Julie Mayer assault.

374
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,443
Where were you last night
at approximately 11:00?

375
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,603
I can answer that.
She was in her room.

376
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,742
We have a very strict
10:00 p.m. curfew.

377
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:50,619
Actually, I was out.

378
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,581
What? I saw you go into your room.

379
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,501
Yeah, and then I climbed down
the trellis and I met a friend.

380
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,380
- Can I borrow your mace?
- Please, ma'am.

381
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:04,633
My tax dollars pay for it.
I should get to use it.

382
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:08,283
Who was the friend you met?

383
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,350
Wait, Danny Bolen? As in the guy
who blew you off this morning?

384
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,561
Yes. He's a friend.
I want him to be more than a friend.

385
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:20,143
Mr. Bolen said that you
stopped by a liquor store.

386
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:23,013
She's 16. She doesn't drink.

387
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,980
Yeah, we bought some beer.

388
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:29,786
How about a taser?
You guys must carry a taser.

389
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,558
Can anybody verify your whereabouts?

390
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
Well...

391
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,130
Thanks for your time.

392
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,203
You know why kids are like this now?

393
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,222
Because you people won't
let us hit them anymore.

394
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,424
If I find this bastard
before the cops do,

395
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:56,830
he won't need a trial 'cause
I'll kill him with my bare hands.

396
00:23:56,997 --> 00:24:00,752
I know you're mad. I don't want
to hear anger in this room.

397
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,130
We need to stay positive
for Julie's sake.

398
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:06,715
Do we even have a clue who did this?

399
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:08,901
A jealous boyfriend, maybe?

400
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,180
Was she even seeing anyone?

401
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,250
No, not that I know of.

402
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:18,339
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no. Come on in.

403
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:19,796
How is she?

404
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:21,590
Still unconscious.

405
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,421
We're waiting for the test results.

406
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:34,093
You know, I need to talk to Lynette.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

407
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:40,604
She must never ever
know I slept with you.

408
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:44,084
Bree, my daughter was attacked.

409
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:47,243
I've got more to worry about
than Susan getting mad at us.

410
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,142
Of course. I'm sorry.

411
00:24:52,887 --> 00:24:55,574
Look, I know we said we'd
get together this week, but,

412
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:58,538
till this all gets sorted out,
I need a little time.

413
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:01,164
I completely understand.

414
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:11,165
I do want to see you again. Really.

415
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:15,555
- Just not now.
- Okay.

416
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,733
Dad?

417
00:25:33,092 --> 00:25:35,177
So what did they say?

418
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:38,912
The doctors still don't know.
But she's not pregnant.

419
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:42,791
I'm so sorry about that. I
just had to say something.

420
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:48,544
What made you think
that she might be?

421
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:49,885
She told me.

422
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:54,762
A few days ago,
I was out in my yard.

423
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,599
I was upset.

424
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:00,200
Julie saw me and asked
me what was wrong.

425
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,820
We started
talking about stuff, and...

426
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,802
It just came out.

427
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:06,745
And you didn't just...

428
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:09,812
Just immediately pick
up the phone and call me?

429
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:11,994
She asked me not to.

430
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:20,799
So who's the guy?

431
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:24,456
- I don't know.
- She didn't say?

432
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:25,758
All she said was

433
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:28,545
she'd gotten involved with someone
and that it was complicated.

434
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:32,466
Complicated? And that's
the word she used?

435
00:26:37,216 --> 00:26:38,216
Because...

436
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,876
"complicated" means "trouble," so...

437
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:44,106
you knew that she was in trouble,

438
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:46,521
and you chose not to come to me?

439
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:49,514
Like I said, Julie asked me not to.

440
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:52,755
You are my friend, not hers.
After everything we've been through,

441
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,454
I cannot believe
you would betray me like that.

442
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:56,921
That's not fair.

443
00:26:57,088 --> 00:27:00,063
My daughter is hooked up
to a machine,

444
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,853
and a guy who is
complicating her life...

445
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,709
a guy that I didn't even know about...
might've put her there,

446
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,725
so I don't need to be fair.

447
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:20,183
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- No problem.

448
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,950
How are those
two little precious ones?

449
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,642
What?

450
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:29,393
My kids.
You threw me off with "precious."

451
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,317
They're the least of my problems.
We've taken in a teenager.

452
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:36,050
- Sorry to hear it.
- She's been using this

453
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:38,733
to sneak out at night. That's why
I want you to take it down.

454
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,576
- She climbed down this trellis?
- That's what she said.

455
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:45,453
Okay. It's just that
it's pretty beat up.

456
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,333
I wouldn't have thought it could
hold much more than those roses.

457
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,207
But then again,
why would she lie? I'll get my tools.

458
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:16,998
I'm telling you,
she opened her eyes...

459
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:20,350
for at least 10 or 15 seconds.
She called me "dad."

460
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:22,284
- I believe you.
- What does it mean?

461
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,800
In layman's terms, drifting in and out
is better than fully comatose.

462
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,397
Our main concern is the
intracranial swelling.

463
00:28:29,564 --> 00:28:32,466
In fact, if she wakes up, we
may choose to induce coma.

464
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,604
- Why would you do that?
- The swelling will heal faster

465
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:38,816
if she's unconscious.
But I'm confident she'll recover.

466
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,053
Thank God. I should find Susan.

467
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:47,514
- Good lord. They need me in the ER.
- Before you go, one quick question.

468
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:50,061
When Julie wakes up,
will she remember what she saw

469
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,663
or heard during
the brief moment she was awake?

470
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,640
- I don't see why not.
- But people in comas dream, don't they?

471
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:58,359
She could wake up thinking
she saw something odd when really

472
00:28:58,526 --> 00:29:01,240
- it was just a bizarre dream.
- Not very likely.

473
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,563
Her brain is swollen. That
has to cause hallucinations.

474
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,730
I once thought Lauren Bacall was in my
bedroom, and that was just a high fever.

475
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:13,896
Ma'am, there's been a
bus crash. I need to go.

476
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:15,752
I'm sorry.

477
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,840
Talk to your friend. You may
be surprised what she remembers.

478
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:31,061
- Liar!
- What?

479
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,793
There is no way
you crawled down that trellis,

480
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,843
because I just tried to,
and it collapsed on top of me.

481
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,494
- What's your answer to that?
- I don't know.

482
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,447
Pull back on the carbs
and try again in two weeks?

483
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:48,503
This is serious.
Why would you lie to the cops?

484
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,883
Did Danny ask you
to cover up for him?

485
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,668
I'm not covering up anything.
Danny didn't do it.

486
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,356
The police think he did.
You don't know this kid.

487
00:29:57,523 --> 00:29:59,623
I know him better than the cops.

488
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,218
You're just mad because
I didn't take your advice.

489
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:05,229
What are you talking about?

490
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:08,974
You told me to play hard to
get, which is totally lame.

491
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:11,810
I figured out a way
to make him owe me.

492
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:16,356
Aiding and abetting? This is
your solution on how to land a guy?

493
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:22,404
- Who are you calling?
- The police.

494
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,860
Julie Mayer is lying
in a hospital bed right now

495
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:27,534
and Danny might have put her there.
You're telling the truth.

496
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:36,244
You're back.

497
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:39,643
- I brought you your favorite biscotti.
- You are so sweet.

498
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,923
- And I hear Julie's doing better.
- Much better.

499
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,385
She's just sedated now.
The doctors are very optimistic.

500
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,262
Oh, my, that is good news.

501
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,370
You know, I wanted to tell you again
how much I enjoyed your wedding,

502
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:56,229
especially the part where
you and Katherine made peace.

503
00:30:56,894 --> 00:31:00,763
- I'm glad someone enjoyed that.
- But you are friends again, right?

504
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,486
I mean, you said all those lovely
things to her in the church.

505
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,443
But it wasn't enough for Katherine.

506
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,563
You know, I don't know where she
gets off being the injured party.

507
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,017
She took Mike from me first.

508
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:14,375
But you and Mike were
divorced at the time.

509
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,690
And Katherine was very lonely.

510
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:19,061
Rule number one
of the female code...

511
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:21,878
never sleep
with your friend's ex-husband.

512
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,307
Well, perhaps she should've seen
that you still had feelings for Mike.

513
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:30,386
It would've been different if
she'd slept with... let's say

514
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:32,494
for instance, Karl.

515
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:36,340
Like that would ever happen.

516
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,713
No, Katherine's a lady.

517
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,771
She's not one of those dumb skanks
that would fall for Karl's come-ons.

518
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:46,404
So you agree it would be different?

519
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:48,149
Much different.

520
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,949
Worse.

521
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,243
Worse? Why worse?

522
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:57,275
Because Karl hurt me.
He cheated and lied.

523
00:31:57,442 --> 00:32:01,442
I mean, any friend who would know
all that and sleep with him anyway?

524
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,160
I would never talk to her again.

525
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:08,232
I don't blame you for
defending Katherine. But...

526
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:12,141
I just don't need a friend
like her in my life,

527
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:15,141
especially
when I have a friend like you.

528
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,693
Orson. Come in.

529
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,211
I'm getting everybody
to sign a get well card.

530
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,878
- We're sending it over to Julie.
- That's nice.

531
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:32,747
I suppose I should sign it
somewhere inconspicuous,

532
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:34,536
given recent events.

533
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:38,314
I suppose.

534
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:39,931
By the way,

535
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:44,229
this morning when I said that
Mike and Susan wouldn't last?

536
00:32:46,476 --> 00:32:48,526
I know you thought I was crazy.

537
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,929
I didn't think that... Exactly.

538
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:55,765
Well...

539
00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:57,437
FYI,

540
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:01,185
I stopped by their house today
with a casserole.

541
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:04,148
Mike was there... Alone.

542
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:08,583
Let's just say he was grateful.

543
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,905
Very grateful.

544
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:13,533
Why wouldn't he be?

545
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:19,122
God, you have no ear for innuendo
at all! He made a pass at me.

546
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:24,085
With Julie in the hospital
and his marriage one day old?

547
00:33:25,082 --> 00:33:26,082
Well...

548
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:29,589
It may be the first day, but...

549
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,160
he's clearing having
second thoughts.

550
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,119
Please don't tell Bree. I'd hate
for this to get back to Susan.

551
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:58,077
I hear Julie opened
her eyes. That's great.

552
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,997
Yes. Yes, it is.

553
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm sorry you're mad at me.

554
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:07,810
Yeah, I'm not mad.

555
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:12,299
I just can't...

556
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:15,386
understand why
she went to you instead of me.

557
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,729
That day that Julie found me crying?

558
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:29,375
The reason she opened up to me
was because I told her that...

559
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,468
and no one else
can know about this...

560
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,405
I'm pregnant.

561
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,458
You are?

562
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,204
That's amazing.

563
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:45,287
Wait. Why were you crying?

564
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,611
Let's see... I'm in my 40s,

565
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:52,900
my husband is back in school,

566
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:55,203
I'm the sole breadwinner,

567
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:57,908
I don't...

568
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,455
know how I'm gonna do
this whole baby thing again,

569
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:03,622
and...

570
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:06,379
Also because...

571
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,149
What?

572
00:35:14,818 --> 00:35:18,698
Because I can't quiet
that one voice in my mind

573
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,612
that keeps saying...

574
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,520
Maybe I shouldn't.

575
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:35,505
Oh, honey.

576
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:52,400
You can do whatever you
think it is you need to do.

577
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:56,296
I know.

578
00:35:57,146 --> 00:35:58,406
Lucky me.

579
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:01,885
It's weird. Everybody

580
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:04,329
talks about a kid being a gift.

581
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,073
It's the only gift where
you puke for nine months

582
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,168
before you receive it and then
scream the day it arrives.

583
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,535
That's true.

584
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,800
But they are a gift, Lynette.

585
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,170
I know that because...

586
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:27,817
I spent the last few hours
thinking that I was...

587
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:29,781
gonna lose mine.

588
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,845
I realized that I would...

589
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:39,323
Trade everything I own, I would
give everything I ever will have,

590
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,734
for just one more day

591
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,228
as Julie's mom.

592
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:53,562
But I'm not telling
you what you should do.

593
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,100
Actually, you are.

594
00:37:02,563 --> 00:37:04,113
And I'm glad you did.

595
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:21,665
I had some briefs to finish, but I'd
rather work here than at the office.

596
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,710
Bree. You're still here?

597
00:37:23,877 --> 00:37:27,180
She's kept me company all day.
Is she a saint or what?

598
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,220
Thanks for calling me back.

599
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:32,542
I'm just checking on MJ.

600
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:41,092
This has been the
longest day of my life.

601
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:47,682
I thought I needed
some time to myself.

602
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:50,148
I was wrong.

603
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:55,329
I need you.

604
00:38:02,874 --> 00:38:04,924
I booked our room at the motel.

605
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:06,865
Here's the key.

606
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:13,088
If you could come by,
even for just an hour...

607
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:16,723
It would mean a lot to me.

608
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,670
Please.

609
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:32,310
I don't want to be alone tonight.

610
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,890
Neither do I.

611
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,599
- You got a minute?
- I think I know why you're here,

612
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,100
and believe me,
I am as ticked off as you are.

613
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:59,564
Danny should've never kept
your niece out so late.

614
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:01,557
When I found out,
I kicked him so hard,

615
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:03,915
he's still trying
to get the shoe out of his butt.

616
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:06,636
- It'll never happen again.
- It never happened at all.

617
00:39:07,592 --> 00:39:08,596
What?

618
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,664
Ana wasn't with Danny last night.
She never left the house.

619
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:14,827
What are you talking about?
She snuck out. Danny bought her beer.

620
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:17,494
- They both fessed up.
- Ana was lying.

621
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:21,651
- Why would she lie?
- Because your son told her to.

622
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:25,048
Well,
maybe she was changing her tune

623
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:27,695
cause she didn't want
to get in trouble with you.

624
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:30,265
She's covering for Danny.

625
00:39:30,697 --> 00:39:33,444
I don't know what you're implying
but he's a good kid.

626
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:36,249
Your niece is the one that's been
hounding him day and night.

627
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,226
I'm just trying to be nice here.

628
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:41,227
I'm giving you a heads up that
ana's taking her story back.

629
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,740
Let's slow down here, okay?

630
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:47,681
Can I at least talk to the girl
before she goes pointin' fingers?

631
00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:50,798
Too late. She's talking
to the police right now.

632
00:40:07,213 --> 00:40:08,809
Baby, I screwed up.

633
00:40:10,393 --> 00:40:11,617
What happened?

634
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,297
I never should've told you
to ask that girl for an alibi.

635
00:40:14,464 --> 00:40:17,164
- Did she talk to the cops?
- They should be here any second.

636
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,647
- But I didn't do anything...
- We don't have time.

637
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:22,482
You're a suspect.
They have the right to question you.

638
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,867
Just listen to me. Tell 'em
you will not waive your miranda rights.

639
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:28,544
And we will have a lawyer
down there as soon as we can.

640
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:31,080
Remember,
how does a fish get caught?

641
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:32,697
He opens his mouth.

642
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:41,942
<i>It had been a horrible day,</i>

643
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:46,549
<i>and people in the neighborhood
were doing their best to recover.</i>

644
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,910
<i>One mother was about to share
some good news with her family</i>

645
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:56,412
<i>when her son saw a flashing
light in the window.</i>

646
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,276
<i>Another was busy grounding her niece</i>

647
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:04,462
<i>when she noticed the police car
pulling up across the street.</i>

648
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:10,896
<i>A woman was planning a
rendez-vous with her lover</i>

649
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:15,882
<i>when she saw a young man
being taken out of his house.</i>

650
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:24,482
<i>Within moments, everyone had heard</i>

651
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,481
<i>the son of one housewife</i>

652
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:31,652
<i>was suspected of strangling
the daughter of another.</i>

653
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,969
<i>Yes, it had been a horrible day.</i>

654
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,814
<i>And the thought occurred
to one old woman...</i>

655
00:41:50,981 --> 00:41:52,654
<i>the days ahead...</i>

656
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,898
<i>could be worse.</i>
