1
00:00:00,426 --> 00:00:02,423
 <I>Previously On...</I>

2
00:00:02,473 --> 00:00:04,838
 <I>Susan's New Boyfriend</I>
 <I>Met The Family.</I>

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,489
Who Are <I>You?</I>
Hi.

4
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:09,163
I'm Mike, The Ex-Husband.
Ah.

5
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:11,765
 <I>Gaby's Life</I>
 <I>Was No Longer Glamorous.</I>

6
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:14,246
It's Official.
I've Lost Everything--

7
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:15,988
First, Our Money,
Then My Figure,

8
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:19,347
Now The Last Threads
Of Our Social Standing.
Gaby, We Have A Home,

9
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:21,795
And We Have
Two Beautiful Little Girls.

10
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,507
 <I>Danielle's Decision</I>
 <I>Was Devastating...</I>

11
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:27,829
Please, Just Don't Take Him!
Benjamin Is All I Have.

12
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,730
You're Just Gonna Have
To Find Something Else.

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,808
 <I>And Edie's New Husband</I>
 <I>Showed A Dark Side.</I>

14
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:35,622
I Would Consider It
A Personal Favor
If You'd Apologize To Edie.

15
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:36,258
No.

16
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:40,051
Now It Seems To Me
That A Woman Like You
Would Like To Keep The Few
Friends That She Haseft.

17
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,961
I Think You'd Better Go.

18
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:44,929
Why Would
You Bring Me Flowers?
'Cause You Got A Computer,

19
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,415
And I Need To Find Out
Some Stuff About Edie's Husband.

20
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,829
 <I>(Mary Alice) Benjamin Katz</I>
 <I>Was 6 Years Old,</I>

21
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:59,554
 <I>And There Were A Lot Of Things</I>
 <I>He Didn't Understand.</I>

22
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:05,881
 <I>He Wasn't Sure Why</I>
 <I>The Woman You Call "Mommy"</I>
 <I>Isn't Always Your Mother.</I>

23
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:13,510
 <I>Or How The Man</I>
 <I>Who Was Always There For Him</I>
 <I>Could Suddenly Be Taken Away.</I>

24
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:17,705
 <I>Or Why You Could</I>
 <I>Go For A Ride...</I>

25
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:20,824
 <I>And Never Come Back Home.</I>

26
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:26,618
 <I>Yes,</I>
 <I>There Were A Lot Of Things</I>
 <I>Benjamin Katz</I>
 <I>Couldn't Understand,</I>

27
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:30,477
 <I>And No One Seemed In A Hurry</I>
 <I>To Explain Them.</I>

28
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:34,463
(Bree)
Here They Come, Finally.

29
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:37,396
You Know, Bree, Things Will Be
A Little Strange At First,

30
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,396
So Please,
Be On Your Best Behavior.

31
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:41,463
I Do Not Require Lectures
On Tact.

32
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:43,962
I Know. It's Just That
We've Missed Benjy So Much,

33
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:45,896
And It's Taken
So Many Olive Branches
To Get Them To Come Back.

34
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,078
I'm Aware
Of What's At Stake, Orson.

35
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,472
Good. So If You Feel An Impulse
To Criticize Something,

36
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:52,166
You'll Keep The Thought
To Yourself.

37
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,116
Hi!

38
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:57,395
(Chuckles Nervously)
I've Already Started.

39
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:01,804
Danielle! What A Delightfully
Ethnic Ensemble.

40
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,779
Hey, Mom, Orson.
Hi, Danielle.

41
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,233
Oh, I Want To Meet
My Husband Leo.

42
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:10,174
It's Nice To Finally Meet
Both Of You In Person.
Lovely To Meet You, Leo.

43
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:11,492
Hey, Who's This
Little Linebacker?

44
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:14,641
Hi, Benjy. Remember Me?
I'm Not Sure.

45
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:19,215
That's Okay. That's What
This Visit Is For, Right?

46
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:20,730
Getting To Know Each Other.

47
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,525
Now We Have You For
The Whole Weekend, Right?

48
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:24,985
Yep, Whole Three Days.

49
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:27,222
Oh, Good.
'Cause We've Made Lots Of Plans.

50
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,695
We're Gonna
Take You To The Circus
If It's Okay With Your Folks.

51
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:31,576
Can I Go, Danielle?

52
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:34,674
"Danielle"? Did He Just
Call You "Danielle"?

53
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:36,494
Well, It Is My Name.

54
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,440
Yes, I'm Aware Of That.
I Picked It.

55
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:44,641
I'm Just Concerned
People Might View It
As A Sign Of, Um, Disrespect.

56
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:46,612
By "People," You Mean You?

57
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:50,328
Uh... Leo. Look At All
The Luggage You Have Here.

58
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:52,953
I'll Give You A Hand Here.
Okay.
Oh, Thanks.

59
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:55,428
Um... Let Me Be Clear.

60
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:57,673
(Lowers Voice) I Do Not
Want Him Calling Me "Bree."

61
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:00,699
Oh, Don't Worry. I Told Him
To Call You "Granny."

62
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:07,450
 <I>Yes, Benjamin Katz</I>
 <I>Was Only 6 Years Old,</I>

63
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:10,109
 <I>But Even</I> He <I>Could Understand</I>

64
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,967
 <I>This Was Going To Be...</I>

65
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:14,220
 <I>A</I> Long <I>Weekend.</I>

Ugh. Hey. Hon.

79
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,564
How Was The Park?
Wait. Hold On.

80
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,476
Mommy Just Found
Her First Gray Hair.

81
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,365
I Need You To Grab It, Yank It
And Never Speak Of It Again.

82
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:08,947
Oh. Look At Your Face.

83
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,550
It's Scratched.

84
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,297
What Happened?

85
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:14,498
Nothing.

86
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,364
And Your Shirt Is Ripped.

87
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:19,103
That's The Second Time
This Week.

88
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,819
Is Someone Picking On You?

89
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,746
Who Is It?

90
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:29,671
Is It Jeffrey Hixon,
That Weird Kid Who Eats Paper?

91
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,264
Is It Timmy Crowley?

92
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:35,664
His Mom Slept In Her Car
Last Night.

93
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:37,615
Who Knows
What's Going On There?

94
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:41,364
Is It That Boy
From Your Birthday,

95
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:43,252
The One Who Slugged
The Pony?

96
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,931
Oh, Sweetie.
I Know You're Upset,

97
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:50,264
But You'll Feel Better
If You Talk About It.

98
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:54,107
And There's Nothing You Can't
Tell Me. I'm Your Mommy.

99
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,985
I Wanna Talk To Daddy.

100
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,868
Okay.

101
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:05,064
We'll Give Him A Call.

102
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,097
(Man) Okay!

103
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,706
You're Not Gonna Find
Another One In This Condition.

104
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:14,918
I Mean, The Car Is A Classic.

105
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:17,264
Well, What Do You Think,
Nabila?

106
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:19,698
Eh. I Like It.
I Don't Love It.

107
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:21,097
(Carlos) Tell You What.

108
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,405
Gaby And I Want
To Find Our Car A Nice Home.

109
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:27,843
So I'm Prepared To Knock
A Grand Off. What Do You Say?
I Say Knock Off 5 Grand,
And We'll Talk.

110
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:30,436
Oh, Come On. It's Already
Priced Way Below Blue Book,

111
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:32,735
Not To Mention It's Mint.
This Is Not Mint.

112
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:36,002
Hey, Can You Not See This Ding
In The Bumper Here?

113
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:40,512
Okay, This Car Goes Zero To 60
In 5 Seconds.

114
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:42,341
By The Time Someone Says,
"Wow, A Ding,"

115
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,107
You're In The Next County.
4 Grand,
You Got Yourself A Deal.

116
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,007
Deal.

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,274
What? No! No, No Deal!

118
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,940
The Nondriving Blind Guy
Does Not Speak For Me.

119
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:53,840
Would You Excuse Us?

120
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:56,907
Gaby, We've Been Trying
To Move This Car For A Month.

121
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,508
We Need The Cash.

122
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,441
(Sighs) God, Isn't There
Any Way We Can Keep It?

123
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:04,828
I Mean, This Car's
The Last Thing I Have
That Tells The World,

124
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:06,441
"I'm Better Than You."

125
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:09,062
Sorry, Babe.
We Have To Pay The Mortgage.

126
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:11,353
We Can't Afford To Be
Better Than Anyone.

127
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,332
Here.

128
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:21,807
Take Good Care Of Her.

129
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,298
Actually, It's Not For Us.
It's For Our Nanny.

130
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,694
Okay, That One Hurt.

131
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,307
Hey.

132
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:38,640
So What'd You Dig Up
On Mr. X.?

133
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:39,807
You Mean Dave?
Yeah.

134
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,773
Nothing Yet.
It's Been Two Days.
What Gives?

135
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,907
Well, For Starters, When
I Search For "Dave Williams,"

136
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,773
I Get
A Million And A Half Hits.

137
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,130
To Narrow It Down,
I'm Gonna Need More Information,

138
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,705
Like Where He Was Born,
Where He Went To School.

139
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,485
Did He Serve Time
In The Military?
Oh, Believe Me,

140
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:56,696
If He Served Time,
It Was In The State Pen.

141
00:06:58,174 --> 00:06:59,874
Hey! Dave!

142
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:01,375
Morning, Ladies.
(Tires Screech)

143
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,802
(Under Breath)
Sick Bastard.
How Are You?

144
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:05,647
Hey, Katherine,

145
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:07,421
Your Sprinkler System
Working Okay Now?

146
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:09,808
Like A Charm.
And Thanks Again.

147
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,993
I've Never Been Able
To Get That To Work.
Oh, I Hear Ya.

148
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:15,441
To Program Those Things,
You Need An Engineering Degree.

149
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,312
Oh, Yeah?
You Got One Of Those?

150
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,074
Anyway...
Really Appreciate It.

151
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:22,464
Take Care.

152
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,341
I Just Can't
Go Through With This.

153
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:29,907
He--He Just Strikes Me
As So Nice.

154
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,907
That's Supposed
To Comfort Me,

155
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,733
Given Your Track Record
With Men?

156
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,141
Katherine, Please.

157
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:39,241
The Guy Is Bad News.

158
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:42,274
I Can't Prove It,
But I Feel It In My Bones.

159
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:44,251
And I Can't Sit Around
Doing Nothing When I Know

160
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,911
That Edie's Waking Up
Every Morning Next To Him.

161
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,574
If Anyone Finds Out
We're Doing This...

162
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,141
No One Will Know.

163
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:56,295
And When They Do,
They'll Probably Thank Us.

164
00:07:56,508 --> 00:08:00,650
Because I'm Telling Ya,
This Guy Is Up To Something.

165
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:07,107
Cleaning Out The Old Garage--
My Deepest Sympathy.

166
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:09,740
Hey, Dave.
You--You Settling In Okay?

167
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:11,307
Yeah. Yeah.

168
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:13,740
Well, They Finally Delivered
My Flat Screen.

169
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,974
I Was Dying Without It.
I Mean, It Is 65 Inches.

170
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:19,007
Wow. Sweet!

171
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,141
Hey, W--The Play-Offs Are On.
You Should Come Check It Out.

172
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:24,307
It's Like Being
Right On The Field.

173
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:25,374
Yeah...

174
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:27,374
Um, Lynette's
Really Busting My Hump

175
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,541
About Clearing
This Place Out, So...

176
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:30,740
Well, Maybe Later.

177
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,293
The Game Doesn't Start
For A Couple Hours.

178
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,849
We Could Order
One Of Those Giant Sandwiches.
Sorry, But, You Know,
Check Back With Me,

179
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,265
Make Sure I Survive
This Whole Thing.
Okay.

180
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,773
Hi, Dave.

181
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:40,840
Hi.

182
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:42,341
Hey, Tom?

183
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:43,874
Yeah?

184
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,773
Why Are There Two Piles?

185
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:48,474
Well, That's The Pile
That I'm Throwing Away,

186
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:50,363
And, Uh, This Is The Stuff
I Still Need.

187
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,657
You Need Unopened Mountain
Climbing Equipment From 1986?

188
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:57,382
You Don't Climb Mountains.

189
00:08:57,608 --> 00:09:00,807
Not Yet, But Someday.
I Mean, You Know... Who Knows?

190
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,840
(Laughs) <I>I</I> Know. You Get Winded
Just Climbing Out Of The Tub.

191
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,707
You're Never Gonna Climb
A Mountain.

192
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,174
(Scoffs) You Know What Else
You're Never Gonna Do?

193
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,807
Learn German,
Make Your Own Beer Or...

194
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,441
Have 8 Minute Abs.

195
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:15,707
Come On, Not The Ab-Tastic.
Toss It, And Keep Tossing

196
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Until This 2-Car Garage
Can Hold At Least One Car.

197
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,010
Please Tell Me You're Not
Getting Rid Of Your Bass.

198
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,561
No Point
In Hanging On To It.

199
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,774
I Mean, Being In A Band Is Just
One More Thing I'll Never Do.

200
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:33,958
Before He Moved,
Mike And I,

201
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,055
We Used To Get Together
On Saturdays And Just... Jam.

202
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:38,672
Man, That Was Fun.

203
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:43,174
You Know, I Play The Drums.

204
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,360
Maybe You And I
Should Jam Sometime.

205
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,293
I Guess We Could.

206
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,830
Maybe Even Later Today?
Just...

207
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,644
Yeah! Yeah, You Know What?
Just Give Me A Couple Hours.

208
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,711
I Gotta Stash
These Old "Playboys." (Laughs)
I'll See You Later.

209
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,802
Now Remember, You Can't
Just Start Grilling Edie,

210
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:20,669
Or She'll Get Suspicious.
We Have To Be Subtle.

211
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:24,237
I'll Just Follow Your Lead.

212
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:25,763
Okay.

213
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:29,052
Sorry I'm Late.

214
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,985
What A Great Idea!

215
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,729
I Haven't Done This In Ages--
A Fun Lunch With The Girls.

216
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,115
Yeah, It's Fun.

217
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,086
Where Was Dave Born?

218
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,676
What?

219
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:41,893
(Chuckles Nervously)
We Were Just Wondering

220
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:44,976
Where He Got
His Great... Manners.

221
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:47,752
He's Got That Gentle Bearing
Of A... (Southern Accent)

222
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:49,838
Southern Gentleman.

223
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:52,169
No, He's From Somewhere
In The Midwest.

224
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,819
"Somewhere"?

225
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,860
You Don't Know
Where Your Husband Grew Up?

226
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,631
Well, He Showed Me A Picture
Of His Childhood Home Once.

227
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:01,479
It Had A Cow In It.
(Sighs) I Lost Interest.

228
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,037
Honestly, Edie, How Can
You Be Married To A Guy

229
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:05,670
And Not Know These Things?

230
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,189
You Know What?
What?

231
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:10,188
I Think It's Time To Order.
Where's Our Waitress?

232
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,139
I'll Be Right With You,
Mrs. Mayfair.

233
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,843
Oh, No Problem, Debbie.
You Take Your Time.

234
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:16,756
She Is Such A Sweet Girl.

235
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:19,051
She's Saving Money
For College.

236
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:23,096
Speaking Of Which...
Where Did Dave Go To College?

237
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:25,897
Come On, Debbie!
While We're Young!

238
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:27,820
I Don't Know.

239
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,795
All Right.
What About High School?

240
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:32,501
Why Are You Asking Me
All These Questions?

241
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,417
I Just Think It's Odd That
You're Married To Some Guy--

242
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,958
You Don't Know
Anything About Him.

243
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,657
Other Than The Fact
That He's A Lovely Man.

244
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:43,046
He... (Chuckles Nervously)
Fixed My Sprinkler.

245
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:47,978
I Don't Want
To Talk About This Anymore.

246
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:49,731
I'm Going To The Ladies' Room.

247
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:56,262
Well, Your Subtle Approach
Got Us Nowhere.

248
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,174
I've Been Through A Lot
With This Baby.

249
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,007
I Hate To Sell Her,
But, You Know,

250
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,654
With My New Sports Car Coming,
I Don't Really Need It.

251
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:05,936
Yeah. Here She Is.

252
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:11,913
How's It Look?

253
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:13,840
Be Glad You're Blind.

254
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:15,458
We Have To Be Practical.

255
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,521
We Just Need Something To Get Us
From Point "A" To Point "B."

256
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:20,692
Now Let's Buy The Thing.
Okay, Just Let Me Handle This.

257
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,178
So... Do We Have A Sale?

258
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,607
I Don't Know, Andrew.

259
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,284
I Mean... We <I>Like</I> It.
We Don't <I>Love</I> It.

260
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,803
Yeah, Well, No One Buys A Car
Like This And Loves It.

261
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,858
It's All About The Price.
And You're Not Gonna Do Better.

262
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,679
Yeah, About That Price--

263
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,695
You're Gonna Have To Drop It.
I Mean, Look At All These Dents.

264
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,687
Yeah, It's Also Missing
Three Hubcaps,

265
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:45,622
And It's Got A Hanger
For An Antenna.

266
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,039
Full Disclosure--
It's A Piece Of Crap.

267
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:49,826
You Want It Or Not?

268
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:52,206
Well, I'll Tell You What.

269
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,332
Since Your Mom And I Are
 <I>Dear Friends,</I>

270
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,706
I'll Take It Off Your Hands
If You Knock Off $300.

271
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:59,343
And Since My Mom And You
Are <I>Dear Friends,</I>

272
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,769
I'll Resist The Urge
To Flip You The Bird.

273
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,839
Andrew!

274
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:06,927
Unless You Lower This Price,
We're Walking... Right Now.

275
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:08,621
See Ya.

276
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:10,272
(Scoffs) I Mean It.

277
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:12,303
This Is It.

278
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:13,370
Fine.

279
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:14,836
Fine.

280
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:25,283
Okay, Fine. Knock Off $200,
And We'll Give You Cash.

281
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:27,470
No.
$100.

282
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,537
No.
Wh--

283
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,884
(Scoffs) Will You At Least
Have It Washed?

284
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:34,583
I'll Empty The Ashtray.
Final Offer.

285
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:37,103
(Scoffs) Damn You.

286
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:46,752
You Beat Me Again!

287
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:50,836
Curse You And Your Diabolical
Checkers Prowess.

288
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:52,110
All Right, Orson.

289
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,225
Don't Overexcite Him
On The Upholstery.

290
00:13:55,221 --> 00:14:00,038
So, Danielle, What Would You
Like Me To Make As A Side Dish
For Your Welcome Home Party?

291
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,733
I Can Do Anything So Long As It
Complements Beef Tenderloin.

292
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:06,234
Actually, We Don't Eat Meat.
We're Vegetarians.

293
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,234
Excuse Me?
So Is Benjamin.

294
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,300
Oh. Well... Since When?

295
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:22,508
Since I Realized That Meat
Was A Byproduct Of Murder.

296
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:27,505
Would It Be More Acceptable
If I Shopped For
A Suicidal Pork Loin?

297
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,145
Bree, It's No Big Deal.

298
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:31,742
I'll Just Make
A Nice Risotto.

299
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:33,249
This Isn't About Dinner.

300
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:37,457
This Is About
Her Nutty Liberal Politics
Getting In The Way
Of Our Grandson's Nutrition.

301
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:42,234
He Gets All The Protein He Needs
From Cheese And Beans And Tofu.

302
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,561
Well, This Isn't <I>Just</I>
About Nutrition.

303
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:46,766
Do You Want Him
To Be Teased At School

304
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,054
Every Time He Pulls Tofu
Out Of His Lunchbox?

305
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:53,049
Actually,
That Won't Be An Issue.

306
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,367
Danielle Is
Homeschooling Him.

307
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:57,756
Excuse Me?

308
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,534
 <I>You're</I> Teaching Him?

309
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:02,556
Yes. I Take It
You Have An Opinion?

310
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:05,220
So Instead Of Sending Him
To A Proper School,

311
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,993
You're Gonna
Give Him The Benefit
Of Your Straight "C" Average?

312
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:09,150
Hey, He's Only 6,

313
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,877
And He's Already Reading
At A Third Grade Level.

314
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,900
Well, What Happens Next Year
When He Overtakes You?

315
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:17,567
Uh, Bree... Ahem.
Best Behavior, Remember?

316
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:21,781
I Am Sorry,
But Am I Supposed To Sit By
While She Degrades His Body
And His Mind?

317
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,318
(Danielle) Fine.

318
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,434
Criticize My Parenting
All You Want.

319
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,334
I Don't Care,

320
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:32,634
Because <I>You</I> Don't Get To Decide
How He's Raised Anymore.

321
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,300
 <I>I'm</I> His Mother.

322
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:41,100
And By The Way,
Mark Your Calendars,

323
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,191
'Cause Seven Years
From Next Saturday--

324
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,192
Benjamin's Bar Mitzvah.

325
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:01,634
Hey! (Laughs)

326
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,467
(Chuckles) Hey.

327
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,187
Isn't This Cool? Dave Brought
His Drums Over So We Could Jam.

328
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:10,742
Your Boy Is Pretty Good.
Yeah, And We Figured Out
We Got Bass, We Got Drums.

329
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:13,833
Mike Plays Guitar.
I Think Orson Plays Keyboards.

330
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,586
You See Where
I Am Going With This?
I Do,
But I'm Hoping I'm Wrong.

331
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:19,571
We're Gonna Start
A Garage Band!

332
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:22,039
And I Wasn't!
Maybe If We Get Good Enough,

333
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,633
We Can Even Get, Like,
A Couple Of Gigs.

334
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,258
How Fun Would That Be?
"Gigs"?
Did You Just Say "Gigs"?

335
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,873
Now All's We Need Is
A Little Time To Practice--

336
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,639
A Few Nights A Week,
Some Weekends.

337
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,277
What?
Well, Yeah,

338
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:36,840
Just Until We Get The Rhythm
Section All Dialed In.

339
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,618
 <I>Okay,</I> I Need To Dial You In
To Some Gigs You Already Have,

340
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:44,517
Which Are Running A Restaurant,
Being A Husband And A Father.

341
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:47,803
And I Thought
You Were The One Who Said
You Wanted To Spend
More Time With Your Family.

342
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,517
But We Could Play Clubs.

343
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:54,285
I Mean, He's Just Having
A Little Fun, Lynette.

344
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:55,834
Guys Need To Blow Off Steam.

345
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:58,434
Could You Just...
For A Sec?

346
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,517
Come On. You Know I'm Right.
You're Far Too Busy For This.

347
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,478
You Can't Just
Decide For Me Like That.

348
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,830
I Mean,
If I Wanna Play Bass,

349
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:17,328
I Will Play Bass.

350
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,247
I'm Not Hurting Anybody.

351
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,359
Those Of Us With Hearing
Beg To Differ. (Laughs)

352
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:23,062
Okay, You Know What?

353
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:24,969
Please Leave
Our Rehearsal Space.

354
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:27,508
Oh, Come On, Tom.
This Is Not Your--

355
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,829
(Juanita) It's Mine!
No!

356
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:42,135
Give It! Give It!
No! No!

357
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,546
Give It To Me! It's Mine!
Don't!

358
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,590
Guys! Hey!
Knock It Off Back There.

359
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,329
Oh, God. What Now?

360
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,813

361
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,513

Yo

365
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,034
I Took It To A Mechac,
Who Told Me The Radiator's Shot.

366
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,484
Oh. That. Yeahhu(Chuckles)

Oh, And, Uh,
Try Not Going Up Hills

372
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,776
And Stay In The Shade
As Much As Possible.

373
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:43,617
Okay, I-I Can't Drive Around
Avoiding Gravity And The Sun.

374
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,050
Well, Sorry.

375
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,450
If You Want A Car With No Flaws,
Buy A New One.

376
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:50,484
 <I>Or</I> I Could
Get The Radiator Fixed,

377
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:53,591
Which Is Gonna Cost $300,
Which <I>You</I> Are Paying For.

378
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:57,450
Remember Full Disclosure?
Crap?

379
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:00,484
This Is Your Car.
It's Your Problem.

380
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,879
Okay, You Know What? That's It.
I Wanna Talk To Your Mother.

381
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,976
Uh, Well, She's In A Meeting
Right Now.

382
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,517
Can I Take A Message?
Damn It, Andrew.

383
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:11,842
You Tell Bree To Call Me
By The End Of The Day.

384
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,993
May I Ask
What It's Regarding?

385
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,498
All Right, We'll Talk About It
More Later, Buddy.

386
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:23,168
Why Don't You Go On Outside
And Play For A While?
Okay.

387
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:29,070
Well, What Did He Say?
Well, He Still Won't Tell Me
Who's Picking On Him,

388
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,463
But He Did Ask Me
To Teach Him How To Fight.
He's Only 5.
I Don't Want Him Fighting.

389
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,086
I'm Sorry, But Every Boy

390
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,030
Has To Learn How
To Throw A Punch Eventually.

391
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,194
You Know, If You Wanna
Give Him A Leg Up,

392
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,593
You Could Teach Him
A Little Capoeira.
Capo-What?

393
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,685
Oh,
It's A Brazilian Martial Art

394
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,516
That Incorporates Dance.

395
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:48,644
Yeah, 'Cause There's
Nothing Scarier

396
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:52,477
Than A Guy Coming At Ya
With Jazz Hands.
That's Funny, But Actually,

397
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,330
The Dance Part's To
Catch Your Opponent Off Guard.

398
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,460
Like That?
No, There's
A Little More Nuance To It.

399
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,173
Ooh!
Like <I>That.</I>

400
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:02,043
Where's The "Dance" Part?
(Grunts)

401
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,310
Oh! (Laughs)
 <I>There</I> It Is, Ginger!

402
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:07,015
You Know What, Boys?
Not In The House.

403
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,236
Oh, My God!

404
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,225
Give It Back! It's My Ball!
It's <I>My</I> Ball Now.

405
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,876
Hey! You Leave Him Alone.

406
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:21,510
Oh! Honey!

407
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:25,257
Is That Who's Been
Picking On You? Juanita Solis?

408
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,677
Well, She Is Going To Get
A Big Surprise,

409
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,277
Because Your Daddy

410
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,977
Is About To Turn You
Into A Killing Machine.

411
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,644
Uh, M.J., Can I Talk
To Your Mom For A Second?

412
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:42,244
What?

413
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:44,286
I Can't Teach Him
To Hit A Girl.

414
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,810
That's Not Just Any Girl.
You Saw Her.

415
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:48,843
She Could Take Down
A Small Deer.

416
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:50,644
It Doesn't Matter.

417
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:52,544
If It Wears A Skirt,
It's Off-Limits.

418
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:54,110
That Is Sexist.

419
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,444
If Feminism Means Anything,
It's That It's Okay

420
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:59,143
For A Big, Mean Girl
To Get Her Butt Kicked.

421
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:03,217
You, Teach Him
One Of Those Brazilian
Kung Fu Cha-Cha Things.

422
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:04,977
I'm With Mike.

423
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,544
You Can't Hit Girls.

424
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:09,743
Ah! Couple Of Wusses.

425
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,477
I'll Handle It Myself.

426
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:15,745
Oops!
Didn't See That Coming.

427
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,992
Just For That, I'm Breaking
My Rule About Not Hitting Girls.

428
00:21:21,338 --> 00:21:23,241
Gaby, We Have A Problem.

429
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,829
I Just Saw Juanita
Push M.J. Down.

430
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:26,026
Really?

431
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:27,111
Really.

432
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:30,636
It's Not The First Time.
Juanita's Been Bullying Him.

433
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:33,184
Wow. I'm Sorry.
I'll Talk To Her.

434
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,434
(Sighs) Thank You.

435
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:37,638
And Don't Worry. No One Will
Hear About This From Me.

436
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:39,120
Hear What?

437
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:42,205
That M.J.'S Getting Beat Up
By A Little Girl.

438
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:45,240
A <I>Girl.</I>

439
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:50,322
Are You Suggesting That Juanita
Is Fat For Her Age?

440
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,797
Gaby, Juanita's Fat
For <I>Your</I> Age.

441
00:21:52,824 --> 00:21:54,790
(Scoffs) Yeah?
Well, Let's Face It.

442
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:56,790
M.J. Could Get Beaten Up
By A Kitten.

443
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,390
You Know What?

444
00:21:58,423 --> 00:22:01,390
Maybe You Could
Teach Your Daughter

445
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:03,898
How To Use Her Words
And Not Her Fists.

446
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:08,657
Yeah? Or Maybe You Could
Teach Your Son To Grow A Pair!

447
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,956
What You Looking At?

448
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:22,290
Oh, Just Some Old Pictures.

449
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:25,112
Can You Guess
Who That Little Girl Is?

450
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,790
That's Your Mom Way Back
When She Was Your Age.

451
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:33,490
What's She Eating?

452
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:35,890
Oh! Uh, A Hot Dog.

453
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,613
No Way.

454
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:40,158
Oh, Yes.
Your Mother <I>Loved</I> Hot Dogs.

455
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,066
Every Day At Lunchtime,
She'd Say To Me,

456
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,621
"Mommy, I Want A Hot Dog."

457
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:46,795
How Come
She Doesn't Eat Them Now?

458
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:48,794
Well, Because
She's All Grown-Up.

459
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:52,641
You See,
Hot Dogs And Hamburgers
Are What Make
Little Boys And Girls

460
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:54,590
Grow Up To Be
Big And Strong.

461
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,260
And Now That She's Grown-Up,
She Doesn't Need Them Anymore.

462
00:22:57,513 --> 00:23:00,019
Doesn't Mommy Want <I>Me</I>
To Be Big And Strong?

463
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,879
I've Been Asking Myself That
All Day.

464
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:06,020
Maybe She's Afraid
If You Get Big,

465
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,997
You'll Leave Home
And Go Play For The Red Sox.

466
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:12,022
But I Want To Get Big.
I Want To Play Baseball.

467
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:15,203
Oh. Well...

468
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:17,518
In That Case...

469
00:23:22,303 --> 00:23:23,609
Can I?

470
00:23:23,843 --> 00:23:26,609
You Have To Promise
Not To Tell Your Mommy.

471
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:27,827
Okay.

472
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:35,046
Well, What Do You Think?

473
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:38,222
It's Like Tofu,
Only Better.

474
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,073
Yes.

475
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:42,005
Yes, It Is.

476
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,503
Two, Three, Four!

477
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:52,805
 <I>When Tom Scavo Threw Himself</I>
 <I>Into His New Hobby...</I>

478
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:58,332
 <I>His Wife Told Herself</I> <I>It Was A Phase,</I>

479
00:23:58,382 --> 00:23:59,919
 <I>And It Would Pass Quickly.</I>

480
00:24:02,784 --> 00:24:06,019
 <I>But Three Hours Later,</I>
 <I>She Realized</I>

481
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,789
 <I>It Could Not</I>
 <I>Pass Quickly Enough.</I>

482
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:14,353
 <I>So Lynette Began To Plot</I>

483
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:18,106
 <I>Against Her Husband's</I>
 <I>Instrument Of Torture.</I>

484
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,625
Ooh! Careful, Honey.

485
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,341
Sorry.

486
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,772
You Could Break
Your Dad's Guitar And...

487
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:28,885
 <I>It Was At That Moment</I>
 <I>Her Daughter</I>

488
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:33,402
 <I>Provided Her An Idea</I>
 <I>For A... Simple Accident...</I>

489
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:38,748
 <I>And... A Clean Alibi.</I>

490
00:24:46,812 --> 00:24:47,800
(Tom) Damn It!

491
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,743
Hey, Is Everything All Right?
Oh, My!

492
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:54,942
It Was Lying
In The Middle Of The Floor!

493
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:58,309
How In The World
Did That Happen?
Has Penny Been Playing
In Here Again?

494
00:24:58,342 --> 00:25:00,442
I've Told Her
A Million Times!

495
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:03,109
Now I'm Sure It Was An Accident,
Tom. Please Don't Yell At Her.

496
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:05,175
This Was A $1,600 Bass.

497
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:07,454
I Can't Afford
To Replace It.

498
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,316
Penny Lynn Scavo!

499
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,476
Where Is She?

500
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,775
Oh, Tom!

501
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:15,726
She's Up In Her Room.

502
00:25:22,565 --> 00:25:24,915
I'm Gonna Go Play Outside.

503
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:27,333
Oh! Wait.
Your Forgot Your Whistle.

504
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:29,298
Okay, Sweetie.

505
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,765
This Is Just To Be
On The Safe Side.

506
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,129
If Juanita Comes Around,
You Just Blow It.

507
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:36,477
I'll Be Right There.
Okay.

508
00:25:36,477 --> 00:25:37,505
Good Boy.

509
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,884
(Whistle Tweets)
Hey, Give Me Back My Whistle!

510
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:57,723
Juanita Solis, Don't You Move!
You Are In Big Trouble!

511
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,377
What's On Your Head?

512
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:02,473
Never Mind.

513
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,742
What Did You Do To M.J.?

514
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:07,340
He Wouldn't Let Me
Blow His Whistle.

515
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,759
So Your Solution
Was To Push Him Down?

516
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,303
Do You Think That's Nice?

517
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:15,132
How Would You Feel
If Someone Did That To You?
I Wouldn't Care.

518
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:17,494
Oh, Really?
You Don't Think It Would Hurt?

519
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,849
Even If It Did...

520
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:22,254
(Whines) I'm Not A Crybaby
Like M.J.

521
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:30,542
I'm Sorry.

522
00:26:30,735 --> 00:26:33,267
Juanita, I Just Wanted You
To See How It Felt.

523
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:34,952
Are You Okay?

524
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,230
Susan, I Saw That!

525
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,668
Kids, Get Inside!

526
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:41,954
Okay, First Off,
It Wasn't As Bad As It Looked.

527
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:44,316
Really? 'Cause It Looked Like
You Body-Slammed My Daughter.

528
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:47,183
I Barely Tapped Her.
She Was Milking It.

529
00:26:47,183 --> 00:26:50,083
That's Your Defense? You Were
Only Assaulting Her "A Little"?

530
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:52,649
I Was <I>Trying</I> To Teach Her
Not To Be A Bully--

531
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:55,116
Something She Should Have
Learned From Her Mother.

532
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,697
Well, I'm Sorry. I Was Too Busy
Trying To Explain To Her

533
00:26:57,697 --> 00:27:00,618
Why M.J. Doesn't Wear A Dress
Like All The Other Little Girls.

534
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:02,739
This Conversation Is Over.

535
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:05,705
Tell Bob And Lee That I'll Pay
For The Dent In Their Lawn.

536
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:10,372
You Did Not!

537
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:12,071
I Did.

538
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:15,672
You Know What?

539
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:18,505
We've Both Been
Incredibly Childish Here,

540
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:20,458
And It Is Time One Of Us
Took The High Road,

541
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,587
So I Am Now
Going To Walk Away.

542
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:25,338
Please Take Note
Of This Conflict Resolution

543
00:27:25,372 --> 00:27:28,305
And Try To Pass The Lesson
On To Your Daughter.

544
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,336
You Can Dye That Hair
All You Want,

545
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:32,477
But The Gray's
Just Gonna Keep Coming.

546
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:45,887
And They Call <I>Me</I> White Trash.

547
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,772
Hey.

548
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:55,772
You Got A Minute?
Yeah. Sure. Come On In.

549
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:00,572
I, Uh, I Heard There Was
A Little Accident.

550
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:03,071
So...

551
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,756
I Got This For Tom.

552
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:07,839
You Bought Tom A New Bass?

553
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:10,435
It's Not As Smooth
As His Old One, But It's Good.

554
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:12,532
We Can't Accept This.

555
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:15,588
It's Mostly Selfish On My Part.
I Was Having Too Much Fun.

556
00:28:15,588 --> 00:28:17,039
Well, Sorry.

557
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,659
But Maybe You Could
Go Skateboarding With Orson.

558
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:21,856
All Right.

559
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:23,160
Forget About Me.

560
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:26,156
Tom Was Having Fun.

561
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,054
And From What I've Seen,
He Needs It.

562
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:34,184
And What Makes You Think
You Know What My Husband Needs?

563
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:36,724
Just Something That I Saw
The Other Day,

564
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,816
When You Were Making Him
Get Rid Of All His Things.

565
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:41,746
You Mean His Junk?

566
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:43,105
It May Be Junk To You,

567
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:44,246
But To Tom...

568
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:47,194
Well, That Was Stuff
He Was Gonna Get Around To.

569
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,301
You Know What
A Midlife Crisis Is?

570
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:56,566
I'm Married To A 45-Year-Old Man
Who Has A Red Convertible.

571
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,903
Yeah, I Think I Know.

572
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:02,127
But You Know How It Happens?
A Man Gets To A Certain Age,

573
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:06,140
And He Realizes...
He's Gonna Die Someday.

574
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,258
Really Die.

575
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,048
And What's Worse Is That He's
Everything He's Ever Gonna Be.

576
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:16,823
He's Never Gonna Be Rich.

577
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:19,992
He's Never Gonna
Climb A Mountain.

578
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:24,792
Now Some Guys Do Bad Things

579
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:27,317
When They Get Those Thoughts
In Their Heads.

580
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:29,158
By Comparison,

581
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:31,712
Playing In A Garage Band--
Well...

582
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,825
It Seems Pretty Harmless.

583
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:40,992
So... Now My Marriage
Is In Trouble,

584
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:44,091
And You're Gonna Save It
By Giving Tom A Bass?

585
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:47,450
No. No. I'm Not.

586
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:51,911
 <I>You</I> Are.

587
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:09,992
Most Of The Guys In My Class
Went Into Corporate Law,

588
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:12,953
But I Wanted To Do Something That Would Influence
Environmental Policy.

589
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,226
That's How He Ended Up
At The E.P.A.

590
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:24,959
So, Leo,
Where Did You Study Law?

591
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,192
Cornell.

592
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:27,959
Now I'm Jealous.

593
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,226
I Always Wished That I'd Gone
To A School Like Cornell.

594
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,458
But... It Just Wasn't
In The Cards For Me.

595
00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:34,359
How About You, Dave?

596
00:30:34,393 --> 00:30:37,259
Me? No.
Wasn't In My Cards, Either.

597
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,859
So Where <I>Did</I> You Go?

598
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:42,026
After Listening To Leo,
I'd Be Embarrassed To Tell You.

599
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,192
So... E.P.A.

600
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:45,825
What's Your Opinion
On Global Warming--

601
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:47,226
Fact Or Fiction?

602
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:48,825
Hold On, Darling.

603
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,792
Mrs. Mccluskey
Asked You A Question.

604
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:53,259
Tell Her
Where You Went To School.

605
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:59,857
Oh, Edie, I Think She Was
Just Making Conversation. So--

606
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,047
Okay, Then Why Don't You
Tell <I>Me</I> Where You Went?

607
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:05,090
After All, I Am Your Wife.
Shouldn't I Know?

608
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:17,162
Actually,
I Didn't Go To College.

609
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:21,797
I Took A Job
Out Of High School

610
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:25,051
Because My Family
Was Having A Hard Time.

611
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,329
Not Having A Degree
Is Something That Has Always

612
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:30,663
Been Embarrassing To Me,

613
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:34,034
Especially When
I'm With People Who <I>Do.</I>

614
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:40,405
So, My Darling,
Is There Anything Else

615
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:42,520
You'd Like To Quiz Me About
In Public?

616
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,692
My... Childhood Stuttering?

617
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:47,100
My Dad's Drinking Problems?

618
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,507
No. I'm... Good.

619
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:01,447
I Came To Say I'm Sorry.

620
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,826
You Attacked My Child
And Then Me.

621
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:05,511
Why Should I Even
Listen To You?

622
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:08,360
I Brought Booze.

623
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:10,752
Come On In.

624
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:15,027
Like, I Have This Rule--

625
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,661
No Toy Guns.

626
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:19,627
Except <I>Everything</I>
That M.J. Picks Up--

627
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:23,127
Whether It's A Hairbrush,
A Hanger, Everything--

628
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,260
He Pretends It's A Gun.
Well, What Do You Expect?
He's A Boy.

629
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,327
That's My Point!

630
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,561
I Know Nothing
About Raising Boys.

631
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:33,093
And I Think M.J.
Has Figured This Out,

632
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:36,360
So He Goes Straight To Mike
Whenever There's A Problem.

633
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:38,460
But That's Okay.
Mike's A Great Dad.

634
00:32:38,494 --> 00:32:41,927
Yeah, Sure,
On Alternate Weekends.

635
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,756
That's Fine...

636
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:46,167
Until... (Sighs)
M.J. Needs His Daddy,

637
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,777
And His Daddy's Not There.

638
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:51,113
Susan, It's Not Your Fault.

639
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:54,294
Well, We Split Up,

640
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:57,427
So It's At Least Half My Fault
Any Way You Slice It.

641
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,972
Well, If It's
Any Consolation,

642
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:03,227
Carlos Is A Hands-On,
Full-Time Dad,

643
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,527
And I Still Feel Like
I'm Not Getting The Job Done,

644
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:09,327
Like... I'm Not
Preparing Them Enough.

645
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:12,327
Preparing Them For What?

646
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,887
For How Hard Life Is.

647
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:15,342
I Mean, I Have To Admit,

648
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,641
When You Told Me
Juanita Was Bullying M.J.,

649
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:19,748
My First Thought Was,
Thank God!

650
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,633
Let <I>Her</I> Do The Pushing,

651
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,737
Just As Long
As She's Not A Victim.

652
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:28,194
Well, I Don't See
Any Kid Of Yours Being A Victim.

653
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:30,582
(Laughs) You're
The Strongest Person I Know.

654
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:34,672
I Used To Be.

655
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,853
Look At My Life, Susan.

656
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:40,071
I...

657
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,589
I've Been Beaten Down.

658
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:48,155
Well, I Thought
I Had You Beaten Today,

659
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:51,022
And The Next Thing I Knew,
I Was Eating Grass.

660
00:33:53,589 --> 00:33:55,844
Today Doesn't Count.
Today I Was Mad.

661
00:33:56,522 --> 00:33:58,333
Well...

662
00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:01,144
Maybe You Need To Get Mad
More Often.

663
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:06,701
Maybe You're Right.

664
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,388
This Is Nice.

665
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,522
We Should Rumble
All The Time.

666
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:15,405
To Susan Mayer--

667
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:17,088
Good Mom.

668
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,522
To Gabrielle Solis--

669
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:21,188
Another Good Mom.

670
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:25,157
(Juanita) Mommy, We're Hungry!

671
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,203
So?! There's Waffles
In The Freezer!

672
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:31,776
And Get Mommy Some Ice!

673
00:34:34,735 --> 00:34:36,140
Isn't This Nice?

674
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,616
For The First Time In Years,

675
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:40,721
My Family Is All Here
Under The Same Roof.

676
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,555
Here's To Many More Meals
Together.

677
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:46,022
Yes.
(Edie) Aw. Welcome Home.
Cheers.

678
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,909
I Don't Feel Good, Danielle.

679
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,389
(Under Breath) "Danielle"?

680
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,378
I Think I'm Gonna Be Sick.
Let's Get You
To The Powder Room.

681
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:03,989
Here We Are--

682
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,779
Mushroom Risotto.

683
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:07,929
There's An Unfortunate
Coincidence.

684
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:10,161
I'm So Sorry, Mom.
I'll Clean It Up.

685
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:13,067
No, Um, You Take Benjy Upstairs.
I'll Get It.

686
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:15,798
Orson, Could You Get The Mop,
Please?

687
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:20,741
Oh, My God. Is That Meat?

688
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:22,439
No!

689
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:23,688
Of Course Not.

690
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,570
Does This Look Like Meat
To You?

691
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:27,646
It's... Hard To Tell.

692
00:35:27,646 --> 00:35:29,019
Just So We're Clear,

693
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:31,738
What I'm About To Throw Up
Is A Western Omelet.

694
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,578
That Is Not Meat. (Chuckles)

695
00:35:33,605 --> 00:35:36,471
That Piece Right There--
That's Definitely Meat!

696
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:38,238
Still Waiting On That Mop.

697
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,305
(Scoffs) What Did Grandma
Give You To Eat?

698
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,371
She Said Not To Tell.

699
00:35:46,572 --> 00:35:49,605
You Gave Him Meat
And Then Told Him To Lie?!

700
00:35:51,772 --> 00:35:54,271
I Gave Him A Hot Dog,
All Right?

701
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,672
He Liked It So Much,
He Asked For Another.

702
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:58,258
 <I>Two</I> Hot Dogs?

703
00:35:58,258 --> 00:35:58,864
All Right,

704
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:01,557
I'll Concede The Second One
Was Clearly A Mistake.

705
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,820
Come On, Leo.
We're Leaving.

706
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:08,433
No! Danielle, Please.
I'm Sorry, Orson.

707
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,709
She's Made It Impossible
For Us To Stay In This House.

708
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:13,022
(Orson) Danielle, Wait, Wait.

709
00:36:17,705 --> 00:36:20,221
Well, We Can Still Drink,
Right?

710
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,362
Oh, Yeah.

711
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:27,553
Well, I've Apologized
Till I'm Blue In The Face,

712
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,579
But They're Still Leaving
In The Morning.

713
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:36,602
Now <I>You're</I> Not
Speaking To Me, Either?

714
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:39,968
They're Just Mad.

715
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,960
Things Will Be Better
Next Time.

716
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:45,261
You Honestly Think
There'll <I>Be</I> A Next Time?

717
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:47,907
It Took Us Three Years
To Talk Them Into This Visit.

718
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:49,509
To Ruin It.

719
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:53,213
Orson, I'm Truly Sorry.

720
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:56,089
It's Just, Seeing...

721
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:58,655
All These Mistakes
That She's Making With Benjamin,

722
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:00,722
It's Just So Hard For Me.

723
00:37:00,755 --> 00:37:03,122
You Know What Hard For <I>Me?</I>

724
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,055
When I Left For Prison,

725
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,496
Benjamin Was In My House,
He Was In My Life.

726
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:13,487
He Called Me "Daddy."

727
00:37:13,655 --> 00:37:16,758
And When I Came Home,
He Was Gone.

728
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:21,189
And You Think
That's <I>My</I> Fault?

729
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:23,489
 <I>Yes,</I> I Do.

730
00:37:23,523 --> 00:37:26,022
Orson, You Weren't Here.

731
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:29,576
She Came Back.
She Was Married To A Lawyer.

732
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:32,535
And Don't Forget,
She <I>Is</I> His Mother!

733
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:34,976
I Tried To Fight, But--

734
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:36,962
You Should've Fought <I>Harder.</I>

735
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:40,406
I Was On My Knees.
I Was Sobbing.

736
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,113
She Said "No" And Then
Ripped Him Out Of My Arms.

737
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,658
(Whispers) You Have No Right
To Say That To Me.

738
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:59,393
You Kind Of Blindsided Me
Tonight.

739
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:03,443
I Know. I Am <I>So</I> Sorry.

740
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:08,479
I Was Clearly Uncomfortable.

741
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:11,562
I Don't Understand
Why You Kept Pressing Me.

742
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:16,979
Honestly, It Was All
Karen Mccluskey's Fault.

743
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:20,313
Really? How So?

744
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:23,009
Well, She Kept Asking Me All
This Stuff About Your Background

745
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,613
And Why I Don't Know
More About You, And... (Sighs)

746
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:29,662
I Should've Just Never
Let Her Get To Me.

747
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:34,783
It's Okay, Sweetie.

748
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,940
Now I Understand.

749
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:44,040
Kind Of Sad
When You Think About It.

750
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,174
What Do You Mean?
Oh... Maybe You Guys
Don't Notice

751
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:49,241
Because You're
So Used To Her.

752
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,627
But Her Behavior
Reminds Me Of My Grandmother,

753
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:55,295
When We First
Started To Notice...

754
00:38:56,187 --> 00:38:57,952
The Dementia, That Is.

755
00:38:58,373 --> 00:39:00,533
You Think Karen's
Going Senile?

756
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:03,492
I Remember
My Poor Grandmother...

757
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:07,074
Started Getting So Paranoid.

758
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:10,953
She Thought People Were
Breaking Into Her House And...

759
00:39:11,568 --> 00:39:13,582
Stealing Her Things.

760
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,802
We Finally
Had To Put Her In A Home.

761
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:22,222
I Just Hope
That Doesn't Happen To Karen.

762
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:39,934
I Want My 300 Bucks.

763
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:43,127
I Told You. It's Your Car.
You Deal With It.

764
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:45,435
That's It? No Compassion?

765
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:48,314
No, "Hey, Let's Split The Bill
And Call It Even"?

766
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:51,469
Look At It This Way.
You're Not Losing 300 Bucks.

767
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,415
You're Gaining
A Valuable Lesson--Buyer Beware.

768
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:58,703
True. Now Here's
A Valuable Lesson For You.

769
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,023
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

770
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:08,599
What The Hell
Is Wrong With You?!
Give Me My Money,

771
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,965
Or Next Time
We're Trading Paint.
You're Bluffing.

772
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:13,622
I Am Tired Of Being A Victim,
Andrew.

773
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,925
And Trust Me,
That Is No Bluff.

774
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:21,063
(Brakes Screech)
Hey! You--You Touch My Car,
And You're Paying For It.

775
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:24,743
Luckily, I'm Insured. (Gasps)
Oh, Wait. Our Policy Lapsed.

776
00:40:24,743 --> 00:40:26,670
Hope <I>You've</I> Got
Good Coverage.

777
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:31,948
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait, Wait.

778
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:34,660
I'll Get My Checkbook.

779
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,290
I Prefer Cash.

780
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,707
 <I>Bullies...</I>

781
00:40:43,802 --> 00:40:46,567
 <I>Any Adult Will Tell You</I>
 <I>The Playground</I>

782
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:49,460
 <I>Is Not The Only Place</I>
 <I>To Find Them.</I>

783
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:54,207
 <I>Everywhere You Look,</I>
 <I>You Can Find People Unconcerned</I>

784
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:57,441
 <I>Or Unaware</I>
 <I>Of The Pain They Inflict.</I>

785
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:00,974
 <I>It Might Be A Neighbor</I>

786
00:41:00,974 --> 00:41:03,808
 <I>Preying On The Suspicions</I>
 <I>Of Her Friend...</I>

787
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:06,949
 <I>Or A Daughter</I>

788
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:10,006
 <I>Punishing The Choices</I>
 <I>Of Her Mother.</I>

789
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:17,569
 <I>Or A Housewife Seeking Justice</I>

790
00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:20,037
 <I>From The Man Who Sold Her</I>
 <I>A Car.</I>

791
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:23,135
 <I>Yes...</I>

792
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:25,712
 <I>There Are Bullies Everywhere.</I>

793
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:30,042
 <I>And The Worst Are The Ones</I>
 <I>Who Take Advantage Of You</I>

794
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:32,710
 <I>Without You Ever Knowing...</I>

795
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:35,578
 <I>What They've Done.</I>
