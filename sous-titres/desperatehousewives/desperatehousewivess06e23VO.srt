00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:02,586
<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,088
Why didn't you tell me
you were having money problems?

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,258
- <i>Susan made a difficult decision.</i>
- You can't sell your house.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,093
We're not selling. We're renting.

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,221
- <i>Bree was blackmailed by Sam.</i>
- I'm talking about

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,807
your son running down
Carlos' mother.

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,394
I want you to sign over
your company to me.

8
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:21,812
<i>Patrick got what he needed,</i>

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,149
<i>to force Angie to do what he wanted.</i>

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,276
You're gonna make me another bomb.

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,487
<i>But Angie managed
to send out a call for help...</i>

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>And Lynette discovered</i>

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,777
<i>that Eddie was the killer.</i>

14
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:42,761
<i>In those first awful moments,</i>

15
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:46,463
<i>all Lynette Scavo
could think of were her children.</i>

16
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:50,822
<i>The moment
her daughter began to walk...</i>

17
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,085
<i>The day her son
won the spelling bee...</i>

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,462
<i>And that time her twins
scared her with a frog.</i>

19
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:07,776
<i>Yes, this is what
Lynette thought about...</i>

20
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:10,806
<i>While a disturbed young man</i>

21
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>was holding her hostage.</i>

22
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:16,503
Please.

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,936
Don't talk to me, Mrs. Scavo.
I really need to think.

24
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:20,705
I know you must be scared.

25
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:23,150
But I am your friend, Eddie.

26
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,462
I want to help.

27
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,335
What can you do?
You can't do anything.

28
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:29,698
I can tell people what a mean,

29
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,114
angry drunk your mother was,
how she abused you,

30
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:35,887
how defenseless you are.
You almost didn't have a choice.

31
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,937
And what about the others?

32
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:41,643
- What others?
- The other girls I killed.

33
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,650
Still think you can help me?

34
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,777
I don't want to hurt you.

35
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,866
We'll drive till
we're in the middle of nowhere.

36
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,499
I'll drop you off,

37
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,204
and by the time you find
anyone to tell, I'll be gone.

38
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,652
I don't know what else to do.
I can't have you going to the police.

39
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,335
I can't go anywhere.

40
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:09,281
<i>Yes.</i>

41
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:13,494
<i>All Lynette could think about
were her children...</i>

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,429
My water just broke.

43
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,473
<i>Especially the child</i>

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,327
<i>she was about to give birth to.</i>

00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,025
<i>Teresa Pruitt used to be a nurse.</i>

48
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:43,359
<i>For 33 years, she worked
in the maternity ward</i>

49
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,940
<i>at Fairview Memorial hospital.</i>

50
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,021
<i>She spent her days
caring for newborn infants...</i>

51
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,451
<i>and looking after brand-new mothers.</i>

52
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:05,551
<i>It was a job she had loved
with all her heart.</i>

53
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,085
<i>But that was many years ago.</i>

54
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,936
<i>Now Teresa Pruitt was back</i>

55
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:17,085
<i>at Fairview Memorial...</i>

56
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:21,079
<i>But this time as a patient...</i>

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,588
<i>A patient</i>

58
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,427
<i>with a secret.</i>

59
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:30,332
Hello, Teresa.

60
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:32,726
I came as soon as I could.

61
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:34,894
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

62
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:37,300
It's my time.

63
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:39,677
You're very brave.

64
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:42,868
I wish that were true,

65
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,024
Father.

66
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:51,567
Did you know I used to be a nurse

67
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:53,441
in this hospital?

68
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,736
Yes. You just retired
a few years ago, right?

69
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,720
I didn't retire.

70
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,407
I quit out of guilt.

71
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:03,868
What do you mean?

72
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,740
I did something awful.

73
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,416
Do you want to take confession?

74
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,261
Confessions are private,

75
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:18,883
and the people who run this hospital
need to know what I did...

76
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:22,878
Because they have to make it right.

77
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:30,616
Excuse me.

78
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,149
I need to see Nick Bolen.
What room is he in?

79
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,526
I'm sorry.
Visiting hours don't start until 9:00.

80
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:39,070
But this is an emergency.

81
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,466
Ma'am, he just came out of a coma.

82
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:44,784
Unless you're immediate family,
you need to come back at 9:00.

83
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,421
I get it.

84
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:50,284
You're just following the rules.
You're a nurse

85
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:53,286
an underpaid, underappreciated nurse

86
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:56,632
who might need some help
making ends meet.

87
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:58,897
So what do you say to...

88
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,246
$12?

89
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:06,681
Wait. I'm gonna need
$10 for parking.

90
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,269
How about gum?
Do you like gum?

91
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:12,770
Come back later.

92
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:19,172
Hey, Lorna,

93
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,814
- Dr. Burke needs you in radiology.
- Thanks.

94
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:36,294
You with the ponytail.
I gotta see Nick Bolen.

95
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:37,754
Are you family?

96
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,923
Forget about it.
I'm his wife Angie.

97
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:41,288
Really?

98
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,426
Then who's that
blonde lady who's been here?

99
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:47,013
His whore?! She was here?
I'm having her whacked!

100
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:49,218
I could be wrong.

101
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:51,059
Maybe I should get my supervisor.

102
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,262
Do I look like
I got time for supervisors?

103
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:55,338
I got sauce on the stove,
ziti in the oven

104
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:57,725
and a mustache that needs
to get bleached. Let's go!

105
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,500
Come on! Let's go!

106
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:09,869
Thank you.

107
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,416
Did we get hammered
last night or what?

108
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,651
No, you got hammered.

109
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:20,588
Pres and I just followed you around
apologizing to everyone.

110
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,704
Another thing
we won't be telling your mom.

111
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:27,390
- Think I woke her up when I came in?
- When you came in?

112
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:31,216
When you jumped up on the coffee
table and sang "margaritaville"?

113
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,140
- Maybe.
- Guys.

114
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,237
I just checked on mom,
and she's not there,

115
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,714
and the bed looks like
it hasn't been slept in.

116
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:44,570
She did hear me. She must have
stormed out of here first thing.

117
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,038
But why didn't she wake you up
and yell at you?

118
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:49,098
Have I been stabbed?

119
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:54,637
You're back.

120
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:56,833
What happened with Sam?

121
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:59,919
And did you tell him
his services were no longer needed?

122
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:03,297
I tried to. He responded
by blackmailing me.

123
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:05,174
What?

124
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,177
He knows what
happened to Mrs. Solis.

125
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:16,060
- What does she have to do with this?
- I'm talking about Carlos' mother.

126
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,146
What happened to Carlos' mother?

127
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,939
Ten years ago,

128
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,027
she died after being hit by a car
that Andrew was driving.

129
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,822
How did he find out?

130
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:30,856
- Danielle told him.
- What? Why?

131
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:34,537
I don't know. I think it was some
idiotic attempt to bond with him.

132
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,987
Wait a minute.

133
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,170
You never told Carlos and Gaby?

134
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:41,717
Of course not. That would
have destroyed the friendship,

135
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:44,505
not to mention Carlos would
have sent Andrew to jail.

136
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:46,924
So what does Sam want?

137
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,224
My company,

138
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:51,137
- and I'm going to give it to him.
- Are you crazy?

139
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,806
- If I don't, he'll go to the police.
- Let him.

140
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:56,603
I'm not letting you give
up everything you've worked for

141
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,103
just cause that psycho
has something over on us.

142
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,730
- They will send you to prison.
- Maybe it's time I paid

143
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,691
- for what I've done.
- Absolutely not.

144
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,845
Bree, you can't give in to blackmail.
It's not right.

145
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,263
And if Andrew
wants to take responsibility...

146
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,950
This is really just
between me and my son.

147
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:16,412
Would you mind?

148
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:19,563
Of course not.

149
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:34,078
What's going on?

150
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:36,682
Why am I wet?

151
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,519
Beats me. I'm not a doctor.

152
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,568
- Gaby, what are you doing here?
- Angie's in trouble.

153
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,334
Look, she wrote me this note.

154
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:48,361
Danny and I held hostage.
No cops. Get Nick.

155
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:50,113
I don't understand.

156
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,532
There was a guy with her.
He said was her brother.

157
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:55,910
She doesn't have a brother.

158
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:58,214
Is it Patrick Logan?

159
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:00,706
You know about Patrick?

160
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,183
She told me everything.

161
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,409
What are you doing?

162
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,727
- I gotta get him outta there.
- Wait. Are you crazy?

163
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:11,384
In your condition?
Why can't we just call the cops?

164
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,715
Because the second
Patrick feels cornered,

165
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,632
Angie and Danny are dead.

166
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,185
Are you gonna be all right?

167
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,316
You're gonna have to drive me
to help me get him outta there.

168
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,129
I know. I'm sorry. I'm putting
you in a dangerous position.

169
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:31,498
Forget about it.

170
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,118
So you're done?

171
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:43,597
When you push the detonator,

172
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,334
you got 30 seconds till it blows.

173
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,339
You got what you wanted.

174
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,883
You gonna let us go now?

175
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:54,013
Not yet.

176
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:57,513
You're coming with me to Oregon.

177
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,726
You didn't say anything about that.

178
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:03,561
What if the bomb's a dud?

179
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:06,939
You did run off with
another man and take my son.

180
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:09,497
I've got some trust issues.

181
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,694
Will you at least let Danny go?

182
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:17,358
See, if the bomb doesn't go off,

183
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:20,222
I'll put a bullet in your head

184
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,976
and then come back and kill him.

185
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:28,812
So...

186
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,576
You sure you're done?

187
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:38,153
I guess I could take another look.

188
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:42,690
YARD SALE!

189
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,028
My grandson's visiting.
He'll love this.

190
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:50,316
How about we give you 100 bucks?

191
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:53,381
Look at the price tag. 50 cents.

192
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:56,845
Please, Susan. Let us help you. I don't
need my arthritis medication this month.

193
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:59,062
Look, I can almost make a fist.

194
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,412
Thank you, but we're not looking
for a handout. Just a hand.

195
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,244
I just got off the phone with Lee.
He thinks he might have found a renter.

196
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:09,779
- Already?
- That's a good thing, isn't it?

197
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:13,581
It's great.
Stranger living in my house...

198
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,927
how much for this dining room set?

199
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:21,848
I paid $1,200 a year ago.
You can have it for $300.

200
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,183
I'll give you 50 bucks.

201
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,770
I thought you weren't looking
for a handout, just a hand.

202
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:30,532
That's not a hand. That's a finger.

203
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:33,694
I'm not Neighbor Kinsky right now.

204
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,987
I'm Business Kinsky.
So I'm gonna be frank.

205
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:39,574
You don't have a pot to pee-pee in right
now, and our neighborhood knows it.

206
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,498
What's it gonna be?

207
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:44,078
Have a heart.
The woman needs the money.

208
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,234
Keep out of it, McCluskey.
You know the yard sale game.

209
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,292
If you lost the stomach
for it, walk away.

210
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,087
- You walk away.
- Excuse me?

211
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,618
You're nothing but a vulture.
I want you off my property.

212
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,160
Lookie here.

213
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,433
I'm on a public sidewalk.
Now what you gonna do?

214
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:12,152
I am not "Neighbor" Delfino.

215
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:16,006
I am "Woman who's about to move into an
apartment behind a gas station" Delfino,

216
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:17,889
and if you don't get out of my face,

217
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,115
I am gonna ram this thigh master
down your throat.

218
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,618
Fine. $300.

219
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,704
Sold.

220
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,140
I found some aspirin.
Will that help?

221
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:40,443
This isn't a headache.

222
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,229
These are contractions.

223
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:45,097
I need you to take me to a hospital.

224
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:47,767
I can't, you'll
tell someone about me.

225
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,754
I swear to God.
I don't care about you right now.

226
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:53,242
All I care about is this baby.

227
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,830
Please.

228
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,962
Porter, I found her.
She's at Eddie's.

229
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:05,187
If I'm not back in 15 minutes, it means
she did not accept my apology, and

230
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:07,402
it was fun being your dad.

231
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,578
I'm trusting you here.

232
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,773
Thank you. You have my word.

233
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,768
<i>Eddie! It's Tom!</i>

234
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,549
<i>I need to talk to Lynette.</i>

235
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:22,802
Quiet.

236
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,847
<i>I can see your car.
I know you're in there.</i>

237
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,904
<i>I get it. You're giving me
the silent treatment. When you cool off,</i>

238
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,314
I will be home

239
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,752
with a gigantic bouquet
of your favorite flowers.

240
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,076
I had to do that.

241
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:06,154
- I'll take you to the hospital now.
- It's too late.

242
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:08,218
This baby is coming now.

243
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:12,834
And you...

244
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,895
have to help me deliver it.

245
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,572
- Mr. Chase, you got a minute?
- Sure, father. Come on in.

246
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:27,533
I just came from
Teresa Pruitt's bedside.

247
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,701
She passed.

248
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:32,029
I'm sorry to hear that.
I remember her fondly.

249
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:33,706
She was one of my best nurses.

250
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,963
Before she died,
she told me something...

251
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:40,921
An awful secret that she'd
been living with for years.

252
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:44,735
Father, I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your business,

253
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:47,136
but aren't those things
supposed to be confidential?

254
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:49,681
She wanted you to hear this,

255
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,600
but I think you
should sit down first.

256
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:02,283
Unless you wanna be carried into the
truck, you need to get off that chair.

257
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,778
I see. Like you're the mover. Funny.

258
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,366
Have you seen T-Rex?

259
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,807
The dinosaur? Check in the boxes.

260
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:14,027
We sold it to Roy.

261
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,083
- You put it in the "sell" pile.
- What's a "sell" pile?

262
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,838
I want my T-Rex!

263
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,480
Buddy, I'm sorry. We sold it,
so there's no way we can...

264
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:26,884
We're getting it back.

265
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:30,137
- What are you doing?
- Loving my child.

266
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,035
Thank you, Mommy.

267
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:37,519
I don't think
you should have promised him that.

268
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,271
Roy bought it for his grandson.

269
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,946
It's bad enough that we are dragging him
from the only home he has ever lived in,

270
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:45,986
moving across town where he
doesn't know a single soul.

271
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,438
If that silly dinosaur
brings him a moment's comfort,

272
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:52,365
then we need to march over there
and take it back.

273
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,873
What the hell... We're moving.
Let's go piss off some neighbors.

274
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:04,547
And somehow the dinosaur
got into the pile,

275
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,995
and now MJ is begging us
to get it back.

276
00:16:07,162 --> 00:16:10,620
- Sorry for the confusion, Roy.
- No, I get it. It's just...

277
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:13,055
I already gave it to my grandson.

278
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:16,687
I remember when we gave it to MJ...

279
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:19,872
right after his puppy died.

280
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,367
Let's go get it before
you take out your violin.

281
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:31,490
I guess the excitement of getting
a new friend wore him out.

282
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,285
- I'll wake him up.
- You don't have to do that.

283
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:38,163
Why don't you just slip it out of
his arms? And we'll leave a note.

284
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:40,535
- A note?
- And cash.

285
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:43,380
- Mike, give the man some cash.
- No, we're not taking money.

286
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,796
He's got tons of other toys.
He'll be fine.

287
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,482
God, he's deaf.

288
00:16:57,536 --> 00:16:58,851
Shouldn't we stop this?

289
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:04,619
Just let it play out.

290
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,716
There you go.

291
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:14,700
You are now the sole owner of
Mrs. Van De Kamp's old fashioned foods.

292
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:18,579
Of course, my lawyers
will have to approve this.

293
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,499
Of course, and you'll
see there's a codicil.

294
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,167
If you breathe one word of Andrew's
involvement in that incident,

295
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:27,453
you'll be forced to pay
me all sorts of money.

296
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,549
Don't worry. I'm much better at
keeping secrets than your daughter.

297
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,784
One can only hope.

298
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:39,224
I didn't want it to be this way.

299
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:44,374
And I understand
if you need to hate me.

300
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,838
I don't hate you, Sam.
I feel sorry for you.

301
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:54,643
You came into my life
hoping to be a part of my family,

302
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,687
and all you're leaving with is a client
list, some mixing bowls and my name.

303
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:02,099
You'll soon see that's not enough.

304
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:07,402
You'll always have a hole in your heart
because you don't care about anybody,

305
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:12,158
and I have a horrible feeling that
no one will ever really care about you.

306
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,635
Would you please be a dear and close
the door on your way out of my life?

307
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:30,969
I'm gonna put the bomb in the trunk,

308
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:34,958
and that's how long you have
to say good-bye to our son.

309
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,430
You can't go with him.
He's never gonna let you come back.

310
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,781
I don't know how this is gonna play out,
but whatever happens,

311
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:05,436
you gotta know,
that I was out of choices.

312
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,296
Car's loaded.

313
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,151
Come on.

314
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,870
We got a bomb to explode.

315
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,158
I gotta push again.

316
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:23,662
You have to look.
But it's so gross!

317
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,384
I don't care.
You're going to to have to catch her.

318
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,781
I see something!

319
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:35,852
I think it's the head!

320
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,262
Wait. There's something
around her neck!

321
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:42,238
What?

322
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,139
I think it's the umbilical cord.

323
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:49,296
She's turning blue.

324
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,874
Listen to me. You have to...

325
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,363
hook the umbilical cord
with your finger

326
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,365
- and pull it over her head.
- I can't.

327
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,285
- You have to!
- No, Mrs. Scavo, I'm serious!

328
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,685
Listen to me.

329
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:06,742
You have the chance

330
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:08,223
to save...

331
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,416
a life.

332
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,669
Please!

333
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,071
Is it done?

334
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,175
Yeah. I got her.

335
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:37,069
She's okay?

336
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:47,206
Thank you.

337
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,748
I know.

338
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,383
Where is he?

339
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:01,593
I'm sorry, sweetie.

340
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,648
T-Rex is extinct.

341
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,697
Yeah, buddy. I'm sorry
we couldn't get him back for ya.

342
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,435
But he's mine. That's not fair.

343
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,660
That's life.

344
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:16,650
Life isn't always fair.

345
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:20,183
Sometimes you can be a good person
and you can do the right thing,

346
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,906
and life still won't give
you your dinosaur back.

347
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:27,646
In other words,

348
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,345
we're gonna take you to pizza world,

349
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:32,584
and you can play
all the video games you want.

350
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,853
Life didn't take your dinosaur.

351
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
I did.

352
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,856
So please, just let me have it.

353
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,635
I resent you. I love you,
I respect you, but you know what?

354
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:59,067
You blew it!

355
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,111
And thanks to you, I have to leave

356
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,780
the home where I raised
my children. Look.

357
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,993
This is how tall Julie was
when she started kindergarten.

358
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,293
And this is her in junior high.

359
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,116
And this is MJ.

360
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:15,083
The day we brought him home
from the hospital and stood him up.

361
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,300
And this...

362
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,754
This is where I thought he'd get to.

363
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,370
Here.

364
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,470
In this house...

365
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:28,847
And now I'm never gonna know,
and it's all your fault.

366
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,495
There it is.

367
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:43,153
We're gonna get it back.

368
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:48,424
I promise.

369
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:53,094
And in the meantime...

370
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,749
Well... that's done.

371
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,811
It's Sam's company now.

372
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,261
So you did it.

373
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:21,108
You actually gave up a business
you spent eight years building.

374
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,852
What other choice did I have?
I can always start a new company.

375
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:27,569
What I cannot do
is send my son to jail.

376
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:31,088
You sent me to jail.

377
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,485
You insisted I turn myself in.

378
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:37,443
You said it was the only
way you'd take me back.

379
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,043
That was a completely
different situation.

380
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,670
Really?

381
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:47,124
I ran over Mike and told no one.
Andrew ran over Carlos' mother

382
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,136
and told no one.
How is that different?

383
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:54,182
- Andrew was a child at the time.
- He's not anymore.

384
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:56,643
Orson, please.

385
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,753
I don't mean to upset you.
I'm just curious

386
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,370
why you're not demanding
Andrew do the same thing as well.

387
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:07,446
Fine, I was wrong. I never should have
asked you to make that sacrifice.

388
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,396
I don't want an apology.

389
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,619
I respected you
for demanding better of me.

390
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:17,331
You showed me
you had principles and ideals.

391
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,084
You insisted I live up to your
standards, and I loved you for it.

392
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,171
What are you saying?

393
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,576
From the moment you told me
what Andrew had done

394
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:30,063
and what Sam was threatening to do,
I saw this as a test,

395
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,919
and I hoped worth all my heart
that you would pass it,

396
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:35,015
but you have failed miserably.

397
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:37,463
Where are you going?

398
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,420
Pack my suitcase. I'm leaving.

399
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,930
What?

400
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:43,357
You are not the woman
I thought you were.

401
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:48,303
For God sakes, Orson.

402
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,364
He's my son. I have no choice.

403
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,369
We always have a choice,

404
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,871
and I no longer choose
to be your husband.

405
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,243
All right, I'm gonna go around back,
see if I can climb in a window.

406
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,470
You can keep Patrick
occupied for ten minutes?

407
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,118
Honey, you're talking to a woman
who never paid for a drink. Please.

408
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,727
You okay?

409
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,588
Yeah. Just a little light-headed.

410
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,605
Just give me a second.

411
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:32,781
By the way, thank you. I can't believe
you're helping us out like this.

412
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,473
I don't know. I guess it's...

413
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,650
I guess it's because I know
what it's like to have secrets, too.

414
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,330
It's a lonely feeling.

415
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,610
And that night on the plane
when Angie told me hers,

416
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,310
I promised I would help her...

417
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:50,452
whatever it takes.

418
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:58,949
Don't pass out.

419
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:02,190
Come on! I can't do this alone.

420
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,992
She's so small.

421
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,850
Not for long.

422
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:14,239
They grow up so quickly.

423
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,575
I wish I could see her grow up.

424
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
So...

425
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,041
I'm gonna go now.

426
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,190
If you could just...

427
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:31,410
wait a while
before you call the police.

428
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:38,847
Wait.

429
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:42,565
That day you left my house,

430
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:45,267
you told me your life would
have turned out different

431
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:46,688
if I had been your mom.

432
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:51,073
So I'm gonna be your mom... now.

433
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:52,861
Will you listen to me?

434
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:59,808
I don't think you should leave.
I think you should stay here

435
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:01,369
and call the police.

436
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
I can't.

437
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,874
Yes, you can.

438
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,627
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

439
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,670
Honey...

440
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:13,673
Don't you see you're already there?

441
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,863
No matter where you run to,
in your head,

442
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,028
you will still be angry.

443
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,572
You'll still be in pain.

444
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,443
And as long as you want
to keep hurting people,

445
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,062
you will never be free.

446
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:29,145
I'll be good.

447
00:27:29,312 --> 00:27:30,607
- I swear.
- But...

448
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,455
people will never see
that you're good

449
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:35,487
unless you show them.

450
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:39,545
Please, if you pick up the phone,
they will know.

451
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,010
And I will be so proud of you.

452
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:05,016
Will you call them for me?

453
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:07,769
Of course.

454
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,827
Why don't you hold the baby?

455
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:50,307
Fairview Hospital? I need to know
how to bring someone out of a coma.

456
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:55,571
I'm not sure if it's a coma.
Somewhere between a coma and a nap.

457
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:59,571
How should I know if he's clammy?
I left him in the car.

458
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:04,576
- Susan, what's up?
- Just came to say good-bye.

459
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,775
- Okay. All right. See ya.
- No. I mean, this is it.

460
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:10,023
Tomorrow's moving day,
and it's gonna be crazy,

461
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,252
so I didn't want to rush
through our good-byes.

462
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,961
Good for you.
I'll catch ya when I catch ya.

463
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:20,693
Damn it!

464
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,033
I'm sorry. I'm just so choked up
about you leaving.

465
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,354
I just couldn't deal with it.

466
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:34,424
Really?

467
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,901
You know who else is gonna
be devastated? Angie.

468
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,031
Yes. She's totally
broken up about this.

469
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,573
You've gotta say good-bye.

470
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:47,884
Seriously? I mean,
I like her and everything. I just...

471
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,823
- We've had our problems.
- Just neighbor stuff.

472
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,583
Well, I tried to crush
her son with his car.

473
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,653
- One of her favorite stories.
- And then she attacked me with a bat.

474
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,370
She's Italian.
That's love. Now come on.

475
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,593
You know, Angie once told me
that a good-bye doesn't mean anything

476
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,373
if it doesn't last ten minutes.

477
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,603
Really? I don't think
Angie and I have ever had

478
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,599
a conversation that
lasted more than...

479
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,723
It's getting late. Let's go.

480
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,269
Yeah, these aren't gonna
draw any attention.

481
00:30:26,436 --> 00:30:29,661
Not as much as a bullet in the head
if you try to run.

482
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:41,256
It's my neighbor, Susan.

483
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,640
Someone really needs
to thin this herd.

484
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:45,844
Get rid of her.

485
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,305
Susan. What's going on?

486
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,560
Tomorrow's moving day.
I just came to say good-bye.

487
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:57,856
Bye.

488
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,527
Don't you want my new address?

489
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:08,168
Relax, Ange. This will be over
before you know it.

490
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:15,483
It's okay, Danny.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

491
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:35,755
Why are we stopping?

492
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,396
What's the range on this thing?
About 200 yards?

493
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,065
Why?

494
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:54,491
Patrick, what are you doing?

495
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,713
When I woke up that morning

496
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,106
20 years ago,

497
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,211
and you were gone,

498
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:03,057
I was devastated.

499
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,965
I tried to forgive you,
but I couldn't.

500
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:11,262
After all, you didn't just betray me.
You betrayed everything we believed in.

501
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,334
So I decided

502
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:15,767
one day

503
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,810
I would find you...

504
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:20,104
and I would punish you.

505
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:23,399
And today is that day, my love.

506
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:25,902
Where's the bomb?

507
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:32,415
There's 30 seconds from the time
I push this detonator

508
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:34,744
till the explosion...
that's what you said, right?

509
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,497
- Tell me where the bomb is now!
- It's in your house.

510
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,709
And if you want to save our son,
I suggest you get moving.

511
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:53,304
- Come on. Hurry. I gotta help my mom.
- I'm trying!

512
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,028
It's in the detonator.

513
00:33:12,342 --> 00:33:13,342
You bitch.

514
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,688
Gaby. We can't take this.
This is too much.

515
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,938
I insist.

516
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,359
Although I am gonna need $10
for parking.

517
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,970
So...

518
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:54,282
this is good-bye.

519
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,577
Forever, right?
I mean, that's how this works?

520
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:03,446
You know what's funny?

521
00:34:03,797 --> 00:34:06,697
Nick had to drag me here
kicking and screaming.

522
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:10,469
He told me it would be
a good place to blend in because

523
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:14,336
people wave at you from behind
their little picket fences, but,

524
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:17,138
they would never get involved.
They don't care.

525
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:21,687
Thank God you proved him wrong.

526
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,106
Take care.

527
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:40,078
So we better hurry.
Bus is leaving in five minutes.

528
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,613
We should give him his ticket.

529
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,096
This is a ticket to New York.

530
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:53,132
I thought the plan
was to go to Atlanta.

531
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:55,510
That's our plan.

532
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,249
- No way.
- Listen to me.

533
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,225
I want to be with you guys.

534
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,039
And we wanna be with you,
but we have to stop being selfish.

535
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:06,306
She's right.

536
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,439
It's time we let you live your life.

537
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:11,317
You're gonna have
so much fun in New York.

538
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,317
You get to be with Ana.
You can see grandma.

539
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:16,280
And you can finally stop running.

540
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,867
But I'll still get to see you guys
every once in a while.

541
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,955
Right? I mean, Patrick's dead.

542
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,332
The FBI is still looking for us.

543
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:31,036
I don't think I can do this.
I'm not ready for...

544
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,280
You are gonna be fine.

545
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:38,142
Because you...

546
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,722
You have turned into
one hell of a man.

547
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:46,617
If I am...

548
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:50,398
it's cause you were my father.

549
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:38,563
Why is all of Orson's stuff gone?

550
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,736
He left me.

551
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:47,248
What? Why?

552
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,624
He feels I'm a hypocrite.

553
00:36:51,095 --> 00:36:52,210
That's ridiculous.

554
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,421
He's right. I am.

555
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,800
Is there anything I can do?

556
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,250
There is.

557
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:07,700
You can give me your permission
to do something I should have done

558
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:09,167
a long time ago.

559
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:15,890
This is bad.

560
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,735
What if we don't say anything?
The nurse is dead.

561
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:22,240
- Nobody else knows.
- The priest knows.

562
00:37:22,884 --> 00:37:25,076
I don't suppose we
could buy him off.

563
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,161
Just a suggestion.

564
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:30,462
If this leads to a lawsuit,
we have no defense.

565
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:32,083
This could ruin the hospital.

566
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:37,497
- Jack, what's wrong?
- I know one of these families.

567
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:39,795
They live two blocks from me

568
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:41,312
on Wisteria Lane.

569
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:44,679
Then maybe you're the best person
to tell them.

570
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,620
And how do I do that?

571
00:37:47,992 --> 00:37:50,943
How do you tell parents
the child they've been raising...

572
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,710
the child they love...

573
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:54,621
isn't really theirs?

574
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,460
Hey there. What's going on?

575
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:06,123
Susan trying to sneak off
without saying good-bye.

576
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,773
The more I thought about it,
the more I realized it's not a big deal.

577
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,040
I'm just moving across town. I'm gonna
see you all Friday for poker.

578
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,455
You better, if we don't hear from you
once a week, we will hunt you down and

579
00:38:16,622 --> 00:38:18,838
- bring you back. You know that, right?
- I do.

580
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:21,637
So who's renting your house?

581
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:23,467
Lee found a guy.

582
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,804
It's just not gonna seem right,
someone else in your house.

583
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:30,298
Well, whoever the guy is,

584
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:33,203
he is very lucky,
'cause he's about to get himself

585
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,230
three of the most wonderful
neighbors a person could ask for.

586
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,669
You know, sometimes when
you see people every day,

587
00:38:42,836 --> 00:38:45,208
you forget to tell them
how much they mean to you

588
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,875
so for the record...

589
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:50,328
I think the three of you
are such good people.

590
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,917
And you've made me a better person,
and I thank you for that.

591
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:01,756
I hate to interrupt,
but we really gotta get going.

592
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,495
I should go check on Tom
and the baby. I'm sure one or both

593
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:06,590
- will need to be fed.
- Go, go.

594
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:08,907
I'll call you all in the morning.

595
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:13,851
Honey, what's wrong?

596
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,100
What Susan said...

597
00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:20,608
it's not true.
I'm not a good person.

598
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:22,985
That's silly. Of course you are.

599
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,890
No, I'm not.
There's something I need to tell you

600
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:29,533
I should have told you
years ago but I didn't.

601
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,260
You sound so serious. What is it?

602
00:39:34,168 --> 00:39:36,958
It's the kind of thing
that could end our friendship.

603
00:39:39,352 --> 00:39:40,461
Can we go talk?

604
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:54,642
You ready?

605
00:39:57,913 --> 00:39:59,355
Drive away slow, okay?

606
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:10,457
<i>As they pulled away,</i>

607
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:15,498
<i>Susan looked out
on the street she loved so much...</i>

608
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,835
<i>A street where parents
could raise their children...</i>

609
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,299
<i>Where retirees
could enjoy their golden years...</i>

610
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,937
<i>Where good friends
could share horrible secrets...</i>

611
00:40:33,906 --> 00:40:34,906
<i>Yes,</i>

612
00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:36,973
<i>Susan looked on this street</i>

613
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,334
<i>and vowed she would be back...</i>

614
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:43,439
<i>But as she did so,</i>

615
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:46,536
<i>she didn't notice
the car that passed her...</i>

616
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,706
<i>A car carrying Wisteria Lane's...</i>

617
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,604
<i>newest resident.</i>

618
00:40:57,927 --> 00:41:00,186
So I have some paperwork
for you to sign over here,

619
00:41:00,353 --> 00:41:02,626
and once we get this done,
I can give you the keys.

620
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,465
And I just know
you're really gonna like it here.

621
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:10,343
People are friendly,
relatively quiet.

622
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:14,216
It's just a lovely neighborhood.

623
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,742
I know the neighborhood very well.

624
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,320
The truth is, I used to live here.

625
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,239
Then I guess everyone
will be surprised to see you again.

626
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,240
They absolutely will.
