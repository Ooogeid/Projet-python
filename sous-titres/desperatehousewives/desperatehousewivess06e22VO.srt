00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,154
<i>Eddie added his mother
to his list of victims.</i>

3
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:07,424
How'd it go?

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,482
It would go a lot faster
if we could get his mother in here.

5
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:12,053
Nobody's seen her for days.

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,552
<i>Bree saw a disturbing side of Sam.</i>

7
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,452
I'm afraid of him.

<i>Susan attacked
Mike's financial problems.</i>

9
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:23,033
So is this everything?

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,608
<i>Gaby got the truth.</i>

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,111
- I got involved with a bad guy.
- You're not talking about Nick?

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,780
Danny's father... A really bad guy.

13
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:36,286
- Grab all you can in a couple of bags.
- Not without you. I'll send Danny.

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,915
- <i>And Angie faced her worst fear.</i>
- Are you gonna kill me?

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,201
Can we discuss it in the morning?
And if you decide to run away,

16
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:46,833
say good-bye to Nick, because, he won't
be around much longer after you're gone.

17
00:00:57,063 --> 00:01:00,255
<i>Angie Bolen was having
trouble sleeping.</i>

18
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,459
<i>She kept dreaming about her life</i>

19
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:05,907
<i>and the choices she had made.</i>

20
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,239
<i>After all,</i>

21
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:13,737
<i>it was her decision
to drop out of college.</i>

22
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:17,728
<i>It was her idea</i>

23
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:21,183
<i>to join a group of Eco-terrorists.</i>

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,597
<i>She let herself fall in love...</i>

25
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,122
<i>with their charismatic leader.</i>

26
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:35,723
<i>And she agreed</i>

27
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:38,297
<i>to build him a bomb.</i>

28
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:44,517
<i>Angie knew her choices
had been bad ones.</i>

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,407
<i>How else could she
have ended up here...</i>

30
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,867
<i>With a man she despised?</i>

31
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,226
Good mornin'.

32
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,201
How long you been sittin' there?

33
00:01:58,683 --> 00:01:59,783
For a while.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,956
I've been admiring your scar.

35
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,583
It is so beautiful.

36
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:08,906
What are you doing?

37
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:10,806
You should be proud.

38
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:13,007
It's a symbol of
what we accomplished.

39
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:16,302
We killed a guy. I'm not so proud.

40
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,889
What's one life compared to the planet?
What we did was noble.

41
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,325
Tell that to his wife.

42
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,106
When did you stop loving me?

43
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:32,401
Was it while
we were still together, or,

44
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:34,404
was it after Nick took you from me?

45
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:37,991
My wrist hurts.
Uncuff me.

46
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:39,659
Answer the question.

47
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:46,735
- I never loved you.
- That's a lie.

48
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:52,037
In fact, I'm thinkin' there's
a good chance that you still do.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,290
Don't touch me.

50
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:57,385
Maybe if we made love,
you'd remember.

51
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,142
We could,

52
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:02,307
but you might not like it
when I vomit into your mouth.

53
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:05,101
You do realize I could kill you.

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,100
But you won't,

55
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:09,272
'cause you need me for somethin'.

56
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:10,857
That's true.

57
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:16,362
Don't just keep me in suspense.
Tell me.

58
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:20,867
You're gonna make me another bomb.

59
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,454
You can never make me do that.

60
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:27,624
<i>Yes,</i>

61
00:03:28,924 --> 00:03:32,830
<i>Angie Bolen had made
some bad choices in her life.</i>

62
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:37,675
You're gonna be surprised
by what I can make you do.

63
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,890
<i>And she now</i>

64
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,511

69
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,247
<i>someone had been killing women
in the town of Fairview,</i>

70
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:11,381
<i>and he hadn't a clue
as to who it was.</i>

71
00:04:13,222 --> 00:04:14,237
For months,

72
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,934
he had pored over autopsy photos...

73
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,490
<i>Read psychological profiles...</i>

74
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:25,574

Really?

80
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,868
- We'll be right there.
- What's up?

81
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,996
Some kids came across a woman's
body buried in the woods.

82
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:49,914
Strangled?

83
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:51,987
We'll find out.

84
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:55,154
Forensics is over there
right now digging her up.

85
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,801
Hey, Eddie. We need to talk.

86
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,300
Did I do something wrong?

87
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,725
I went to your house
to see your mom.

88
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:11,245
You did?

89
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,730
Why?

90
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,249
I wanted to ask her
to come to therapy with you.

91
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,276
Dr. McCarthy thought
it might be helpful.

92
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,613
What did she say?

93
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,256
Actually, she wasn't there.
I don't want to worry you,

94
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:29,078
but her neighbor said
no one has seen her for days.

95
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:34,513
Look...

96
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:38,204
I'm sure that must sound
like a big deal to you, but,

97
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,771
this has been going on
my whole life.

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,052
She's off on another bender,
and in a week or two,

99
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,108
she'll come back,

100
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,681
like nothing ever happened.

101
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,151
So we don't need to call anyone?

102
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:53,853
You think she's okay?

103
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,274
It's only a matter of time
before she turns up.

104
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,156
My plane's in an hour.

105
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,593
I wish you weren't
gonna be gone for your birthday.

106
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,688
The girls are gonna be
so disappointed.

107
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:12,393
The commission on this deal
is worth 40 grand.

108
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,166
I will dry their tears
with dollar bills. <i>Bon voyage.</i>

109
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,399
And don't worry, I'll have
your favorite dinner waiting.

110
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,550
That's okay, babe. We can just
go out to dinner and celebrate.

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,427
But I make you lasagna every year.

112
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:30,330
I know. I just don't want you to have to
go through all the trouble. That's all.

113
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:34,894
- I gotta go.
- Hold it!

114
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:38,982
You do like my lasagna, don't you?

115
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:42,235
Sure, I do.

116
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,320
- Liar!
- Excuse me?

117
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,350
You were doing that thing you
do when you lie.

118
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:49,957
- What thing?
- Like I'm gonna tell you.

119
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:53,590
I don't believe this. You've been
eating my lasagna for 11 years.

120
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:58,042
Actually, The ficus in
the dining room has been eating it.

121
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:00,753
- What?
- But on the bright side, it's thriving.

122
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,089
So you're saying I make great mulch?

123
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,258
I just never wanted
to hurt your feelings.

124
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,509
Until today.

125
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:09,584
I've gotten older.
My stomach's gotten weaker.

126
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:12,682
I'm sorry, baby. You just don't
make it the way mama used to.

127
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,967
That's because your backstabbing
mother didn't have the decency

128
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:19,731
- to give me the recipe before she died.
- She was run over by a car!

129
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,607
Well, isn't that convenient?

130
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:23,507
Lasagna's a tough dish.

131
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:25,194
But I love your guacamole.

132
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,196
I buy that at the store.

133
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,223
Like only you can.

134
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,915
So,
figure out my financial mess yet?

135
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:39,991
I've been going over these invoices
for three days, and I'm confused.

136
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,101
The payments don't cover
half of what you've billed.

137
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:46,424
- That's 'cause not everybody's paid.
- Why not?

138
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:49,187
They don't have the money.

139
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,380
Times are tough.

140
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:54,515
A lot of my customers are struggling
just to make ends meet.

141
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,919
Wish I knew what that was like.

142
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,102
Wait. I do.

143
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:00,646
They'll pay when they can.

144
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,068
I love that I married a guy who wants
to unclog the world's toilets for free.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,238
But now it's time the people
pay the piper for the pipes.

146
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:11,506
It's not that easy.

147
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:14,820
I've known these people for years.
I can't just go shake 'em down.

148
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:16,864
You're right.

149
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,540
- I'll do it.
- You?

150
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,548
How are you gonna do it?

151
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:26,022
Look at me. Big brown eyes,
quivering lips.

152
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,217
Once I tell them how our life is
falling apart, trust me, they'll pay.

153
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:31,803
No, Susan, this will never work.

154
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,390
Fine.

155
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:40,405
But I don't know
what we're gonna do.

156
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,024
We barely have enough money
to pay our bills this month.

157
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,008
The insurance is due.

158
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:51,531
And God forbid
MJ get in an accident.

159
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,701
- Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
- Still don't think it'll work?

160
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,705
- You're scary.
- Can I go get our money?

161
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,018
Be my guest.

162
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,160
Last year, when I wanted to go fishing,
but you wanted to go skiing

163
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:10,881
- and you started crying...
- It's best we don't discuss that

164
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:12,927
until we're out
of this financial crisis.

165
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:18,562
I'm not scared of Sam. If you're afraid
to fire him, I'll do it.

166
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:21,306
I don't want to provoke him.
The man is clearly troubled.

167
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,563
And there's no telling
how violent he could get.

168
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,565
We're not intimidated.
Are we, Orson?

169
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:29,358
Just how violent are we talking?

170
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,447
We'll do whatever
it takes to protect mom.

171
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:35,866
But I am in a chair.
I don't know how good I'd be in a fight.

172
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,035
This thing tips over
in a stiff wind.

173
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:41,289
Don't worry, Orson.
We'll think of something else.

174
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,293
- What are you doing?
- Did that hurt?

175
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:49,589
That's all I got.

176
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,967
You don't need to fight.
You're more of a strategist.

177
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,178
Okay, fine.
We don't want to fight.

178
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,598
Why don't we hire someone to rough
him up? I know a couple ex-marines.

179
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:01,058
- How do you know any...
- Don't ask.

180
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,604
- What about money?
- What about it?

181
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,231
If we can't fire
Sam or scare him away,

182
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,394
maybe he'll respond to cash.

183
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,821
Yes, he's always talking about how
he never had anything growing up.

184
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,149
I think, one little severance package,
and we could be rid of this problem.

185
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,910
Brilliant idea, Orson.

186
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:21,662
You call
writing a check "brilliant"?

187
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,510
Anything?

188
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,171
Sorry.

189
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,388
I'm Detective Booth.
This is Detective Furst. Can we come in?

190
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,141
Sure. What's this about?

191
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,852
Do you know an Irina Kosokov?

192
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,898
Unfortunately, yeah. And whatever
you think she did, she did.

193
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:50,441
I'm sorry?

194
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,737
She's a conniving, manipulative little
grifter who put my son through hell.

195
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,113
She's dead.

196
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:00,493
What? Are you serious?

197
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:03,955
- We found her body earlier today.
- She was murdered.

198
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:07,627
What's going on?

199
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,140
These are policemen.
It's about Irina.

200
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:15,697
That didn't take long. That little bitch
couldn't even get out of the country...

201
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:17,344
- before she...
- She's dead.

202
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,220
Was taken from us too soon.

203
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,389
Is your son Preston home?

204
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,554
He's camping with his brother. But,

205
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:26,269
thank you so much for coming by.
He's gonna be devastated.

206
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,769
Actually, we're gonna
need to talk to him.

207
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:31,232
Wait, you don't think
he had anything to do with this?

208
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,042
We found a letter
that Ms. Kosokov had written to him.

209
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,529
Sounds like things ended
pretty badly between them.

210
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,620
He broke off the engagement. But
he wouldn't do that and then kill her.

211
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:44,777
It's an extra step. Wouldn't you skip
the breakup and get to the killing?

212
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:48,165
- Why won't you stop talking?
- I want to, believe me.

213
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:51,043
- Just get him in as soon as you can.
- Sure.

214
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,793
- I'll call him right now.
- Thank you.

215
00:11:56,645 --> 00:11:57,675
I'm telling you,

216
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:00,655
there's no way Preston
could have hurt that girl.

217
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:03,139
You guys should concentrate
on finding the real killer.

218
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,927
Don't worry. We'll find him.

219
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:21,657
Brings back memories?

220
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm not doing this.

221
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:27,473
I don't expect you to start today.

222
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,457
I'm still waiting on one more piece.

223
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:31,751
It's not gonna happen.

224
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,133
There's this development in Oregon.
They're planning to clear-cut

225
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,615
4 000 acres of old growth.
We gotta stop them.

226
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:40,301
And who cares if we kill
a few loggers in the process, right?

227
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,301
Saving the world's messy.

228
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,681
You used to be able to see that.

229
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,557
You know what I see now? A fake.

230
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,010
- What?
- You're a phony.

231
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:52,104
The only cause
you ever believed in is you.

232
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,608
- I'm trying to save the planet!
- God. You still have that ego.

233
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,790
- I was trying to save you, too!
- Thanks for caring,

234
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:01,614
but Nick saved me, and he showed me
what a coward you really are.

235
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:06,123
Do you really wanna start
talking about Nick right now?!

236
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,700
How does it feel,

237
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:12,567
knowing you'll never be
half the man he is?

238
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,886
<i>Angie, open up. It's Gaby.</i>

239
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:17,755
She won't go.

240
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,715
I'm not going. I see your car.

241
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:25,135
You've got one minute
to get rid of her,

242
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:28,292
or there's gonna be one less
neighbor at the block party.

243
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:32,682
Come on in.

244
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,732
I need a lasagna recipe for Carlos.

245
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,527
Hi. I'm Anthony, Angie's brother.

246
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,786
You never told me you had a brother.

247
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,399
I'm sure she hasn't
told you lots of things.

248
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,195
What kind of lasagna does Carlos like?
Meat? Vegetarian?

249
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,619
Have you seen Carlos?

250
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,071
What's all this?

251
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:55,918
- Somebody kill a toaster?
- Angie's fixing my remote control,

252
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:59,075
Giving it a little extra power.

253
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,838
- You know how to do that?
- Sure.

254
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,909
She was an engineering
major in college.

255
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,764
I have an appliance at home
that could use some extra power.

256
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,976
And once I get to know you better,
I'll tell you which one.

257
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,854
Got that recipe yet?

258
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,772
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

259
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,483
- What does this say?
- Ten fresh tomatoes.

260
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,588
- Can't I just use sauce from a jar?
- You can't just use sauce from a jar!

261
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:28,160
You're right. No one will ever know
the difference. See you later.

262
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:30,448
Nice meeting you.

263
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,739
And a little word of advice, never
compare your wife to your dead mother

264
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,054
if you wanna get laid
on your birthday.

265
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:40,796
You know how to make a bomb
and you haven't used one on her yet?

266
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,466
I admire your restraint.

267
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,305
You wanted to see me?

268
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:53,058
I did. Please, have a seat.

269
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,106
Did you know that Rex set up
a trust fund for Andrew and Danielle?

270
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,252
No, I didn't.

271
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,177
He wanted to be sure they
had a nest egg to draw from

272
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:06,739
in case something happened
to him, which it did.

273
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,964
Why are you telling me all this?

274
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,414
Rex set up two trust funds.

275
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:15,593
He seems to have forgotten
he had three children,

276
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,310
And that's not right.

277
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:29,011
That's a lot of money.

278
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:32,643
Well, it's my way of apologizing
for my husband's

279
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:34,183
poor memory.

280
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:39,645
I've never expected anything like this.
Thank you.

281
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:40,971
You're very welcome.

282
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:44,678
And I hope you know how
much I have appreciated

283
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,154
the time you spent with
us and the work you did.

284
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:54,328
Truly, I wish you the very best.

285
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:57,540
That sounds like a good-bye.

286
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:01,615
Now that you have all this money,
you don't need to work here.

287
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:04,792
A young man with your skills should
feel free to go out into the world and

288
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,159
make his mark.

289
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,612
- But I like it here.
- Unfortunately, I no longer need you.

290
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,828
You see, Andrew and I
have made up, and,

291
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:14,598
I'm giving him your job.

292
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,267
What?

293
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,688
Don't be angry.
This is, after all, a family business.

294
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,566
But I'm part of the family.

295
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,653
Not... really.

296
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,777
What are you doing?

297
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:39,039
You can't buy me off.

298
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:43,305
I belong here.
I'm a Van De Kamp.

299
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,340
And if you ever insult me again...

300
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:52,079
you're gonna wish you hadn't.

301
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,896
Excuse me. Are you Jake Walker?

302
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:07,151
Hi. I'm Susan Delfino,
your plumber's wife.

303
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:11,961
Mike's done us a few solids over here.
He's a good man.

304
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,339
And a proud man,

305
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:18,329
which is why he hasn't told you
that his business is really hurting.

306
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:22,371
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- We're gonna need you to pay your bill,

307
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:24,438
for the work he completed...

308
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,915
- four months ago.
- I wish I could,

309
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,714
but, it's a bad time.

310
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,131
You okay?

311
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,038
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:43,467
It's just, we're having
a bad time, too.

313
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:46,478
We can't cover our bills,

314
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:48,442
and the health insurance is due.

315
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:51,801
And God forbid...

316
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:54,391
our son get in an accident.

317
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:58,953
I wouldn't worry.
Kids bounce back.

318
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,916
"Kids bounce back"?
That's your response?

319
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:09,254
My wife lost her job.
My truck needs a new transmission.

320
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:12,174
- Maybe we could set up a payment-
- My daughter needs braces.

321
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,510
- Even if it's just small...
- Nifit...

322
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,597
Nifit? That's not an excuse.
That's just a sound.

323
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,910
I don't know how to tell you.
I don't have the money. Okay?

324
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,439
So just leave me alone.

325
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:31,068
I'm not gonna leave you alone.

326
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:35,163
You owe me money,
and I'm not gonna rest until I get it.

327
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,961
I am gonna make sure everyone in
your life knows what a deadbeat you are.

328
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:41,094
When you go to work tomorrow,
I'll be there.

329
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:43,677
When you go bowling with
your buddies, I'll be there.

330
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:46,741
And when you go to your video
store to get your porn, I'll...

331
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:50,693
I'll write you a check.

332
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,219
Thank you.

333
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,978
With the price of college
tuition being what it is,

334
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,028
and my mother had that
gallbladder operation,

335
00:19:09,393 --> 00:19:11,730
we're just a little
tapped out at the moment.

336
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,547
I'm sorry to hear that.

337
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,656
But Mike did repipe
your entire second floor, didn't he?

338
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:20,776
Yes. And I want to pay,

339
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,328
but we just don't have the money.

340
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:25,868
That's too bad.

341
00:19:26,818 --> 00:19:28,208
These are awfully cute.

342
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:34,339
My husband gives me one every year
on our anniversary.

343
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,091
They're my babies.

344
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,500
- That's so sweet.
- Please be careful.

345
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,097
I don't
like it when people touch them.

346
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,224
You know what I don't like?

347
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,977
I don't like when people
take advantage of my husband.

348
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,369
It makes me feel all...

349
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,648
clumsy.

350
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,443
I guess I could maybe pay you half.

351
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,867
Okay, the whole thing.
Let me get my wallet.

352
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:03,846
We'll be waiting!

353
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,774
I know I'm late in paying
for the water heater,

354
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,533
but I'm on a fixed income.

355
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,045
There just isn't any money
left at the end of the month.

356
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:17,216
For me to even pay for my medicines,
I've had to cut down to two meals a day.

357
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,302
So even though I'd like to help,

358
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,569
I can't. I've got nothing.

359
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,398
You got a nice watch.

360
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,409
Damn right, "Wow"!
No cereal for dinner tonight, baby!

361
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,247
Mrs. Crowley, paid!
Jim Peterson, paid!

362
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,459
And the ones that couldn't pay,
I took it in booty.

363
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:55,081
A clock?

364
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:56,812
Earrings.

365
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:58,131
A menorah?

366
00:20:58,673 --> 00:20:59,973
Sterling silver.

367
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:04,596
Mrs. Gottleib has a toilet
that flushes, doesn't she?

368
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:08,559
What happened to batting your eyes
and shedding a few tears?

369
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:11,755
Playing the victim gome nowhere.

370
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,522
Everybody had an excuse,
and I bought it.

371
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:17,905
And then, all of a sudden,
I snapped.

372
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:20,943
Rage just started pouring out of me.

373
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,383
It was like my inner
bully had been released.

374
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,916
And one by one,

375
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,834
I brought those deadbeats
to their knees!

376
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,129
For the first time in my life,

377
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:34,725
I have gotten a taste of power.
And you know what?

378
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,295
I like it.

379
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,041
You do know that's not a twist-off?

380
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,549
That hurts.

381
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,386
I can't tell you what a rush it is
to have this adrenaline

382
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,013
pouring through me.

383
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:50,836
I have an idea.

384
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:53,228
Let's go upstairs right now
and have bully sex.

385
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:55,656
I said now!

386
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,482
We can't.

387
00:21:58,742 --> 00:22:01,104
Why not? I want to celebrate.

388
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:03,238
I brought home all this money today.

389
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,616
We're getting closer and closer
to the finish line.

390
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:09,215
Well...

391
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,698
The IRS just moved the finish line.

392
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,170
I know. We're screwed.

393
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,286
You know what?

394
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:26,678
Old victim Susan might
have agreed with you, but...

395
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,529
New bully Susan is not
gonna take this lying down.

396
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:36,485
The way I see it,

397
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:39,708
the IRS is a government agency,

398
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,673
and the government only exists
because of the taxes that we pay.

399
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,865
So that makes me your boss.
And as your boss, I am telling you

400
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,165
that we need an extension.
Do I make myself clear?

401
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:01,448
I am a terrible bully.

402
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,982
- Yes, you are.
- He didn't have to tack on

403
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:08,211
all those extra penalties.
Did you know they could do that?

404
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:10,768
See, I didn't,
or I never would have...

405
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:11,935
I figured.

406
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,100
So what do you think we should do?

407
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:17,531
I don't know.

408
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,719
Between the taxes and the rest
of the bills, we're still screwed.

409
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:24,738
We got nothing to fall back on.

410
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,667
We've got the house.

411
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,926
Good. You're here.
Come on in.

412
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:53,974
I thought you wanted to go
over the quarterly inventory.

413
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,787
Yes, but then some old
friends dropped by.

414
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:59,544
Sam Allen, I would like you
to meet Detective Turner

415
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:01,273
and sergeant Clemente.

416
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:04,443
So... you're policemen.

417
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:07,988
Used to be. Bree catered
our retirement parties.

418
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,888
And did an amazing job.

419
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:12,701
Boy, do we owe her big.

420
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,167
Have a seat. Have some tea.

421
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:18,321
No, thanks.
I'm not really a big tea guy.

422
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:21,838
Come on. Take a load off.
We got room here on the couch.

423
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,466
So...

424
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,655
the officers were just sharing
some stories from their

425
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:33,347
days on the force.
Tell him the one you just told me.

426
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,516
About the guy who was
hassling the nice lady?

427
00:24:37,698 --> 00:24:38,810
Listen to this.

428
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:40,819
This guy was so crafty,

429
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:44,702
knew just what to say to scare the lady
without technically breaking the law.

430
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,917
Our hands were tied.
Nothing we could do.

431
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:51,156
That must have been so frustrating.
Scone?

432
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:52,881
Thanks.

433
00:24:53,048 --> 00:24:54,748
It was very frustrating.

434
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,420
Of course, if we encountered
the same situation today, we'd...

435
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,475
handle it very differently.

436
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:01,642
How?

437
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,155
We'd sit him down
for a nice chat. And,

438
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:06,359
if he wouldn't listen to reason,
then,

439
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:09,341
there are...
measures we could take.

440
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:15,504
Sounds like a Mickey Spillane novel.
What kind of measures?

441
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,481
Well...

442
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,833
You mind?

443
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,963
You pick up a phone book,

444
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,980
aim for the Adam's apple...

445
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:30,802
Let your fingers do the walking.

446
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:32,769
Or here. Help me out here.

447
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:36,769
You... dislocate those two fingers

448
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,860
and smack him on the hand.

449
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:40,247
Pop 'em back in.

450
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,416
And there's no evidence.

451
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,337
Goodness. It's hard to believe
you'd actually do such a thing.

452
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:51,633
If I had to. I mean, if the situation
came up, I would hope that the...

453
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,180
threat would be enough.

454
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:57,075
Absolutely.

455
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:05,508
You're looking a little pale.

456
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:08,191
Would you like some more tea
or perhaps a macaroon?

457
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:10,563
No. I...

458
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,281
think... I... should be going.

459
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,390
Do you want us to give you a ride?
I mean,

460
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:20,247
we go right past

461
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:22,271
474 Ash street.

462
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:25,639
I'm good.

463
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:34,647
I don't know why tea parties
have fallen out of fashion.

464
00:26:34,814 --> 00:26:36,646
They're so much fun.

465
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:44,874
Do what you can
to keep your brother's spirits up.

466
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,191
Drive safely.

467
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:48,448
I'll see you soon.

468
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:55,259
What's with the backpack?

469
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:58,105
Yeah, I've been thinking
that it might be good If I...

470
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:00,827
- move back home for a little while.
- Why?

471
00:27:02,603 --> 00:27:05,584
Irina's dead. Your family
needs time to deal with that.

472
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:08,001
You don't need me hanging around,
getting in the way.

473
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,046
To be honest,
I already think of you as family.

474
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:15,118
Come on. I've only been here
a couple of weeks.

475
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:18,962
Your first morning here, you asked
if you could take out the trash.

476
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:22,224
Believe me, you were in my will
by 3:00 that afternoon.

477
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:26,853
Seriously, I think you should stay.

478
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:30,244
I want to, but...

479
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:33,749
my mom's gonna be back
from her bender any day now,

480
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,487
and I should be there.

481
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,909
That's so sweet of you. Your mom's
lucky to have a son like you.

482
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:44,454
You know...

483
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:48,625
Once you make sure she's okay,
you can always come back.

484
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:54,131
I don't think that's gonna happen.

485
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:58,218
Is something wrong?
Did you not like it here?

486
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,345
No. No, it was fantastic.

487
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,798
I should just go. That's all.

488
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,062
Can I give you a hug good-bye?

489
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:20,867
I can't help thinking,

490
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:24,703
I would've turned out so different
if you were my mom.

491
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:44,198
What do you mean
you're moving off the lane?

492
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:45,724
You can't sell your house.

493
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,785
We're not selling. We're renting.

494
00:28:47,952 --> 00:28:50,866
I don't care. Either way,
you're not gonna be living here.

495
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,683
Lynette, say something.

496
00:28:53,212 --> 00:28:54,862
You're very persuasive.

497
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:57,610
I don't understand
why you have to do this.

498
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:01,281
Well, we dug ourselves
in pretty deep financially.

499
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,744
We'll be fine.
It's just gonna be for a while.

500
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:08,981
Checkbooks.

501
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,303
I love you for that, but no.

502
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,047
We got ourselves into this.
We can get ourselves out.

503
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,381
Where will you go?

504
00:29:19,144 --> 00:29:21,384
We found an apartment
near the school.

505
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,637
And there's a park
around the corner.

506
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,556
And it's close by, so we'll
still be able to see each other.

507
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,834
I hope so. Cause people
always say that and then...

508
00:29:33,726 --> 00:29:35,392
Well, I mean it.

509
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
So do we.

510
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,470
What are you doing here?

511
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:21,778
What are you talking about? You
texted me. You told me to hurry home.

512
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,228
God, that wasn't me.
Danny, get out of the house now.

513
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,033
What's going on?

514
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,203
Just go, Danny. Go.

515
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:32,823
What's the rush?

516
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:39,916
Remember that piece
I said was missing?

517
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:42,928
It just arrived.

518
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,900
So I've been thinking...

519
00:30:57,271 --> 00:30:58,773
What are you doing here?

520
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,294
You know, about
what your cop friends said about

521
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,530
how effective threats can be.
I think they're right.

522
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,599
- Get out.
- I will,

523
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,453
but not before we do
a little business.

524
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:14,164
What kind of business?

525
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,292
I want you to sign over
your company to me.

526
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:19,013
What?

527
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,695
I'm talking about
your catering clients,

528
00:31:21,862 --> 00:31:24,201
your cookbooks,
the frozen food line...

529
00:31:24,368 --> 00:31:25,383
All of it.

530
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:28,344
Are you insane?
Why would I do that?

531
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:33,387
Remember the dinner you threw
to welcome me to the family?

532
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:36,654
Well, Danielle had
a little too much to drink.

533
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:38,421
I hear that's genetic.

534
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:41,030
Anyway, she got pretty chatty.

535
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:44,235
Kept asking me why I wanted
to join a family with so many secrets.

536
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:47,781
What did she tell you?

537
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:51,346
The same thing I'm gonna
tell some of my cop friends.

538
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:55,622
And while I'm at it, I should
probably tell Carlos Solis, too.

539
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:59,834
I don't know
what you're talking about.

540
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,169
I'm talking about Andrew,

541
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:07,123
your son,

542
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,903
getting into a car

543
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:11,462
and running down Carlos' mother.

544
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:17,839
So should we draw up the papers now
or wait till morning?

545
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:26,778
It's a lot to take in, I know.

546
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:29,447
I don't believe you.

547
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:33,584
Look, I'm just trying to let you know
that when you're ready,

548
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,788
I want us to have a traditional
father-son relationship.

549
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:40,915
Are you serious?

550
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:44,405
I know.

551
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:46,172
That sounded ridiculous.

552
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,633
And I'm sorry I had to tie you up.
Believe me,

553
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,036
this is not
how I wanted this to happen.

554
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:55,749
But I have something important to do.
Once I'm done, I'll untie you,

555
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:57,993
and we'll have time
to get to know each other.

556
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,103
If you ever untie me, I'll kill you!

557
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:04,065
You're mad. I get it.

558
00:33:07,804 --> 00:33:09,946
But eventually,
you realize who you're mad at.

559
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,741
It's not the guy who spent
20 years looking for you.

560
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:19,372
It's the people who spent
20 years lying to you.

561
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:34,429
- What did you say to Danny?
- Just a father/son chat.

562
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,347
I swear, if you ever hurt him...

563
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,018
God, everybody makes me sound
like such a villain.

564
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:42,162
So...

565
00:33:42,928 --> 00:33:44,478
how's my bomb coming?

566
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:48,359
It would go a lot faster
if could use two hands.

567
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:55,164
Well, we are on a deadline.

568
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:00,413
Not her again.

569
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,213
I come bearing gifts.

570
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:11,038
You've got 20 seconds
to get her the hell outta here.

571
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:17,108
Sorry to barge in,
but I did a test run,

572
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:19,140
- and I really need your opinion.
- Now?

573
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,442
This has to be the
best lasagna in the world,

574
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:24,020
so when I shove it down Carlos' throat,
he'll know I care.

575
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,020
She'll try it later.
Thanks for stopping by.

576
00:34:27,754 --> 00:34:28,954
I'm not going.

577
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:31,628
She won't go.

578
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,111
- Let me just cut a piece.
- Two seconds.

579
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:36,282
'cause don't forget,
Danny's waiting for you.

580
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:39,758
Be right back, Gaby.

581
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:53,909
Well, I can tell you this much,
it smells great.

582
00:34:56,565 --> 00:34:57,565
Come on.

583
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:01,104
This is my first magazine cover.

584
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:03,907
And this is me when I did <i>Vogue</i>.

585
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:08,231
That's my daughter Juanita.
I don't know how that got in there.

586
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,163
And now the runway years.

587
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:15,530
You're keeping your friend waiting.

588
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,700
Be right there.

589
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,590
Jeez. You scared the crap outta me.

590
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:38,469
I'm about to kill your neighbor.
You might want to get her outta here.

591
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:46,978
- I gotta hand it. You did a great job.
- Really? You're not just saying that?

592
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,328
Fantastic. But would you mind
taking the rest back?

593
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,450
I'm just trying to watch my weight.

594
00:35:57,814 --> 00:35:58,814
I get it.

595
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:01,951
You're trying to
cut out all the crappy food.

596
00:36:07,546 --> 00:36:09,646
Did Mrs. Bolen like the lasagna?

597
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:13,613
Well, she said she did, and then
she pretended she was on a diet.

598
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:18,142
Well, I guess I can take a hint.

599
00:36:31,614 --> 00:36:35,067
Honey, do you really think this is
the time to be cleaning out your purse?

600
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:39,981
Our son is being interrogated
for murder. I have a lot of rage in me.

601
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:42,950
Would you rather I channel
it into this or you?

602
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:46,913
I'd put the emergency tampon
in the zipper pouch.

603
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,289
Thank you.

604
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:54,420
Pres, how'd it go?

605
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,590
They just wanted to confirm the timeline
I was in Europe this past year.

606
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,173
That's it?

607
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:01,766
I guess they think the guy
who killed all those girls

608
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,341
while I was gone is the same
one who strangled Irina.

609
00:37:04,508 --> 00:37:06,641
Thank God.
So you're free and clear?

610
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,184
You okay?

611
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:13,189
I just keep thinking, Irina would still
be alive if I hadn't brought her here.

612
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:17,497
I'll meet you at the car.

613
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:18,964
Sweetie, when...

614
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:22,060
Let him go. This whole thing
has really hit him hard.

615
00:37:22,227 --> 00:37:25,157
How about Porter and I take him out,
shoot a few games of pool,

616
00:37:25,324 --> 00:37:26,679
see if he wants to talk?

617
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:28,946
Okay. I'll see you back at home.

618
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:40,481
Did you hear they found
a second body in the woods?

619
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:42,927
They think it's some local woman...
Barbara Orlofsky.

620
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:44,874
Orlofsky?

621
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:48,349
Wasn't that that woman we throw
in the drunk tank about once a month?

622
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,330
That's her.

623
00:38:04,256 --> 00:38:05,616
What are you doing?

624
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,076
We were hungry.

625
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,452
So you picked it out of the trash?
You're worse than raccoons.

626
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:12,915
Sorry.

627
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,960
Since you had some,
what'd you think?

628
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:22,049
Yeah? Well, the French toast you made me
for mother's day wasn't so hot either.

629
00:38:26,964 --> 00:38:28,556
What the heck is that?

630
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:48,993
What are you doing here?

631
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,294
Sweetie...

632
00:38:52,783 --> 00:38:54,283
It's about your mom.

633
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:57,710
Look, I know you're worried

634
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,441
she's passed out drunk
somewhere in an alley, but,

635
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,256
you can relax. I just spoke to her.

636
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:06,219
You just... spoke to her?

637
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:10,681
Like, a half-hour ago.
She's at my Uncle Pete's, in Florida.

638
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,978
In fact...
I was just getting ready to...

639
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,073
fly down there...
and... we're gonna...

640
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,275
try to check her into rehab.

641
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:24,570
So if you don't mind...

642
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:28,303
Thank God.
They must have gotten the name wrong.

643
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:35,248
What are you talking about?

644
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:41,128
Well, I was just at the police station
with Preston.

645
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:44,695
They found another body,
and they said it was your mom's.

646
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:53,908
But...

647
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,149
You just talked to her, right?

648
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:00,816
They made a mistake.

649
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:18,082
You didn't just talk to her.

650
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:23,713
And your mom's not
in Florida, is she?

651
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:28,155
I really wish you hadn't come here.

652
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:33,993
<i>People make choices every day.</i>

653
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:38,205
And those choices...

654
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:40,864
are what define us.

655
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:48,702
Some of us choose to be loyal,

656
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,327
though we're angry and hurt.

657
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:59,029
Some of us choose to be brave,

658
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,111
though we're frightened
out of our minds.

659
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,254
Others choose to strike out

660
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:11,064
when they could have walked away.

661
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:15,854
But what about those poor people

662
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:18,617
who are trapped by circumstance?

663
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:21,771
What happens to those

664
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,303
who have no choices left?

665
00:41:27,872 --> 00:41:31,991
To Be Continued...
