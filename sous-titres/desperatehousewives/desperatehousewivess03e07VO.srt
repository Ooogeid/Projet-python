29
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:40,650
i've been thinking, harvey,

30
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,517
that if you loved
this monique woman so much,

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,517
maybe you should
be with her.

32

 <i>that this unremarkable exchange</i>

again last night.

61
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,501
oh, hon, again?
i haven't had it for months.
i don't know why it came back.

62
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,667
well, somebody
just bought her old house.

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,733
maybe that
triggered something.
it was awful, as always.

64
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,733
i saw she was in pain,
and i just walked away and...

65
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,499
there was nothing
you could do.

66
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
and that's what i did--nothing.

67
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:58,617
hey, is that
the new neighbor?

68
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,699
oh, he's cute!

69
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,568
edie said
he's a bachelor...

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,568

who lives
with his invalid sister.

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,301
you can stop now.

72
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,468
should we go
introduce ourselves?

73
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,800
yeah, let's give him
the scoop on the neighborhood.

74
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:13,483
(chuckles)

75
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:17,417
do you think he knows mary alice
shot herself in his living room?

76
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:22,117
then again, he probably
wants some time to unpack.

77
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,217
orson?
if you have a moment,

78
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,117
there's something
i'd like your thoughts on.
certainly.

79
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,783
what is it? the menu
for our holiday open house?

80
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,783
no, it's the police report

81
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:41,017
from the night
you beat your first wife.

82
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,084
i'm still
working on the menu.

83
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,917
i assure you,
i did not beat my wife.

84
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,917
she suffered these injuries
in a fall.

85
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,850
oh, how did she fall?
i pushed her.

86
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:56,151
it was self-defense.
she attacked me.

87
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,950
why would she attack you?

88
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,618
(sighs) she spilled some
red wine on a white tablecloth.

89
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,033
she was trying to clean it up
with dish soap.

90
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:04,001
when i pointed out
her mistake,

91
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:06,001
she started screaming,
"shut up, shut up!"

92
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,867
and striking me repeatedly
with a saut?pan.

93
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,533
well, look...

94
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,934
the police
dropped the charges.

95
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,201
where did you get this?

96
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,433
carolyn.

97
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,901
well, of course.
who else?

98
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:25,201
if she paid this much attention
to her own marriage,maybe harvey wouldn't cheated on her.

99
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:26,782
harvey cheated?

100
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:30,251
yes, with some flight attendant
named moniqu

101
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:35,750
darling, i could never
strike a woman.

102
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,684
well, you <i>do</i> believe me,
don't you?

103
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:49,384
all right,
i accept your explanation.

104
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:53,284
i just wish there were
fewer things for you to explain.

105
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,783
by the way,
to remove a red wine stain,

106
00:05:57,817 --> 00:06:00,251
you sprinkle salt
to absorb it.

107
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:05,651
that's just what i was saying
to alma when she clocked me.

108
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:08,217
(brakes squeal)

109
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,217
(car door shuts)

110
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,284
whoa,
what fresh hell is this?

111
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,084
hey, tom--

112
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:16,917
whoa, whoa, whoa! you have
stepped onto my property,

113
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,650
and you've talked to tom.

114
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,350
that's two rules you've broken,
and i'm not sure

115
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:24,317
that top doesn't make three.
would you tell your lunatic wife
i'm not talking to her?

116
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,584
you're the lunatic
if you think

117
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:29,517
i'm letting you
anywhere near my husband.
just drop kayla off and go.

118
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:33,184
kayla won't be visiting today.
we're moving.

119
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:36,417
and here's where you can
send the child support.

120
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,317
mexico?

121
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,349
mm, an old friend of mine
got me a sweet job

122
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,999
dancing at a nightclub
in tijuana.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,250
great,
and you're taking kayla?

124
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,917
thank your wife.

125
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,717
she's been itching to get rid
of us ever since we got here.

126
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,217
(gasps)
she finally got her way.

127
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:01,517
wave bye-bye
to your daddy, honey.

128
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:06,767
nora, can't--
can't we just talk about this?

129
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:11,100
oh, we're not allowed to talk.
remember?

130
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,100
she's tom's daughter.

131
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,334
you can't just take her
out of the country.

132
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,667
watch me.

133
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,534
(engine starts)

134
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,834
(judge) does either party
have anything to add

135
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,882
before i rulon the division
of assets and alimony?

136
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,917
no, we're confident that
your ruling will reflect

137
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,783
the pain and suffering
endured by my client.

138
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:38,217
your honor, does the definition
of "suffering"

139
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:42,451
encompass the seduction
of my client four days ago?

140
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:44,850
excuse me?
she thought he was
coming into some money

141
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:48,451
and hoped to stall the divorce
until she could claim her share.

142
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:51,217
how dare you!
that is a vicious lie.

143
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:54,351
 <i>(gabrielle)</i>
 <i>oh, carlos, give it to me!</i>

144
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:57,917
 <i>carlos! yes! yes!</i>

145
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,384
 <i>carlos--</i>
you recorded
our lovemaking?

146
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,783
it's all right here, your honor.
when she climaxes,

147
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,484
she actually starts
screaming out dollar amounts.

148
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:10,917
mrs. solis...
would you like to respond?

149
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,384
as a matter of fact,
i do have a few thoughts.

150
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:17,917
carlos, you're a dead man!do you hear me?!
oh, the ruling seems fair to me.

151
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,417
you get the house.

152
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,417
(chuckles)
i just get everything in it.

153
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:23,217
i said <i>dead!</i>

154
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:25,351
no alimony. that's a drag.

155
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:27,351
but, hey,
you like to work, right?

156
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:28,866
come on, just give me
one clean shot at him.

157
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,367
i'm willing
to do the time!

158
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,099
mom, i was
packing your suitcase,

159
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,516
and you're totally
out of toothpaste.

160
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,217
do you want me to go
to the store and get some?

161
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,817
what is this?

162
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,550
oh, um,
it was austin's, okay?

163
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,917
edie's nephew? since when
are you friends with him?
uh, we are not friends.

164
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,318
i was tutoring him,
he brought beer,

165
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:53,550
i told h to throw it out,
and he did. end of story.
did you have any?

166
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,384
(scoffs)

167
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:57,984
oh, i cannot believe
your timing.

168
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,984
i'm about
to fly off to paris,

169
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,351
and you're inviting boys over

170
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:05,084
oh, that's it! go to your room
and finishing packing.this conversation's over.

171
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:07,951
laughs) last time i checked,
i was the parent.

172
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:10,217
yeah, well, the last time
 <i>i</i> checked, i was the daughter

173
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:13,017
who never gave you
any reason to doubt her.
okay, i-i know i--

174
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:13,950
and don't play
the parent card with me.

175
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,984
i just finished packing
 <i>your</i> suitcase,

176
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:18,251
doing <i>your</i> laundry
and balancing <i>your</i> checkbook.

177
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:21,017
and now i'm going to the store
to buy <i>your</i> toothpaste.

178
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,967
well, a simple
"no, i didn't drink any beer"

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,401
would've sufficed.

180
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:31,933
(sighs)

181
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,467
bree! you haven't
returned any of my calls.

182
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,134
i've been worried.

183
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,967
have you told the wife-beater
you're leaving him yet?

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,434
sorry, no.

185
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:42,334
turns out he has an explanation
for the police report.

186
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,016
oh, come on.

187
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,451
there's never a good reason
for hitting a woman.

188
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,417
i used to think that, too.
then i met you. good day.

189
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,617
i'm trying to help you.

190
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:53,784
you're living in a fool's paradise.
well, i guess that makes us neighbors.

191
00:09:55,618 --> 00:09:56,883
what's that
supposed to mean?

192
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:00,299
it means you should stop
worrying about <i>my</i> marriage

193
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
and start worrying
about your own.

194
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:08,300
(tires squeal)

195
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,901
don't play coy with me.

196
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,901
you've got something to say,
then just say it.

197
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:22,168
okay. does the name "monique"
mean anything to you?

198
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,916
hey, i found this site

199
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,417
that offers
really cheap fares to tijuana,

200
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,816
but should i even be thinking
of going to tijuana?

201
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:34,383
it's fine with me,

202
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,650
soon as you figure out a way
to leave your genitals here.

203
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:38,650
what are you saying,
lynette?

204
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,949
i'm not allowed
to visit my daughter? what?

205
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:44,183
see? this is exactly
what she wants.

206
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:48,982
she takes kayla,
and i get blamed.

207
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,717
well, screw her.
let's sue for custody.

208
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,516
full ctody?
you--you'd go for that?

209
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,183
you bet i wod.

210
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:58,916
kayla will be much better off
without "crazy" in her life.

211
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,416
so will we.

212
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,416
i'm--i am right there
with you.

213
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,683
i just--i never thought
you'd want a fifth kid.

214
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:07,249
i don't, but i didn't want
the first four,

215
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:09,882
and they're
starting to grow on me.

216
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:22,982
hey, look whose
plastic handcuffs got taken off.

217
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,448
okay, you' clearly
still a little miffed

218
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:27,916
about the settlement.

219
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,616
but come on, be fair.

220
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,449
i did buy most of the stuff
in this house, honey.

221
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,483
(glass shattering)

222
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,232
what the hell
are you doing?!

223
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,848
oh, i'm helping you pack.

224
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:49,350
think of all the money you're
gonna save on bubble wrap.

225
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:53,083
hey! do you know
how much that was worth?!

226
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:54,682
aah!

227
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:56,716
do you know
how much <i>i</i> was worth?!

228
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,517
when we met, i was
on the coverf magazines.

229
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,517
i had
a career and a future,

230
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,517
but i gave it all up for you,
and what did i get in return?

231
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,949
if you break one more thing,
so help me...

232
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:10,350
what?
what are you gonna do?

233
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:20,049
(banging on wall)

234
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,416
(glass shatters)

235
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,782
(gasps)

236
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:27,550
carlos,
have you lost your mind?!

237
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,016
well, you're helping me
pack my stuff.

238
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,849
i'm helping you
remodel your house.

239
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,883
(grunting)

240
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:38,116
you know,
i don't know about you,

241
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,649
but i always thought

242
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:42,383
there should be a window
that was right there.

243
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:46,016
(grunting)

244
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:51,550
we can stop this right now,
or we can keep on playing.

245
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,250
your call.

246
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:57,883
(glass shatters)

247
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,583
toothpaste, mouthwash...

248
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,583
did somebody get
an anonymous e-mail?

249
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:11,465
said the boy with
the economy-sized acne cream.

250
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:14,033
there you go again,
checking out my basket.
ugh, go away.

251
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,266
do you know how much trouble
your stupid beer can got me in?

252
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:17,366
well, then let me
make it up to you.

253
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,499
i'll carry your stuff.

254
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,000
(scoffs) whatever.

255
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,466
(sighs)

256
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,733
(cell phone rings)

257
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:46,000
yeah?
harvey, it's me.

258
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,000
hey, hon, i'm in the middle
of something here, so, um...

259
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,232
i know about monique.

260
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,599
um, could you
excuse me a second? thanks.

261
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:01,033
 <i>(woman) attention, shoppers,</i>
 <i>welcome to fields market...</i>

262
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,499
look, i don't know
who you've been talking to,

263
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,499
but, um--

264
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,266
did you love her?

265
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,933
she was just a friend,

266
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,366
and she disappeared
eight months ago.

267
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,133
the police
just found her body.
eight months ago.

268
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,633
that's right when you
fell into that big depression.

269
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,167
and i kept thinking,

270
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,133
"why is harvey so blue?
how do i cheer him up?"

271
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,133
that was about her,
wasn't it?

272
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:26,433
it's over. she's dead.

273
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,232
but if she weren't,

274
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,933
who would you be with--
me or her?

275
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,733
she's dead.

276
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:43,332
(woman) that'll be $12.99.
i'll take your fields card.

277
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:48,966
(sighs)

278
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,833
couldn't keep your wallet
in your pants?

279
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,599
mr. bigsby?

280
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,766

281
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,433
i gotta go.

282
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:05,633
(line disconnects)

283
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,933
(car engine starts)

284
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,599
mommy, look at us!

285
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,433

286
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:27,700

287
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,933

295
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,833
i packed a large tube
and some dental floss.

296
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,666

297
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,299

298
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:02,866

301
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,466

305
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:21,700
so back off.

306
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,800
it's the fashion capital
of the world.

307
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,533
uh, while i'm working,
you can take my credit card and buy some new things.

oh, that's rough.

326
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,949

friends with him.

327
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,432

and soon she'll be listening

330
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,999
to that rock 'n' roll music
everybody's talking about.

331
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,100

00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,383
a month?
it was a $10 bottle of whiskey.

341
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,565
exactly. you weren't even smart
enough to steal the good stuff.

342
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,166
harvey, don't walk away.

343
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,033
come on.
let's sort this out.

344
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:09,067
hey, nora. how's tricks?

345
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,533
i thought it was your car
i saw in the lot.

346
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:14,533
you're a conniving bitch.
ah, i see you've heard
from our lawyer.

347
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:18,465
so it's not enough
that you run me out of town.

348
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,466
you gotta
steal my damn kid.

349
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,948
carolyn,
what are you doing here?
i've been thinking, harvey,

350
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:26,482
that if you loved
this monique woman so much...

351
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:29,482
even you have to admit kayla
would be better off with us

352
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,516
than in a dingy apartment
over a tijuana strip club.

353
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,416
believe me, lynette,
you do not wanna screw with me.

354
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,349
you went after my husband.

355
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,383
if anye should be afraid,
it's you.

356
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,550
(gunshot)

357
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,483
(screams)

358
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:47,982

359
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:49,183

360
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:53,216

362
00:18:57,982 --> 00:19:01,016

364
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:08,783

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,333
don't move. get down.

366
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,984
you can't be serious.

367
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:22,583
we have tickets.
the plane leaves in two hours.

368
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:23,817
i'm sorry.

369
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,783
i know, julie picked
a lousy time to rebel.

370
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:29,233
i'm... i just can't
fly off and ignore it.

371
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,334
you're overreacting.

372
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,967
it's an adolescent prank,

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,167
and you're turning it
into some great bloody crisis.

374
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,167
you have
a lot of meetings anyway.

375
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,967
wel go some other time.

376
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,100
i can't
leave julie right now.
we'll take her with us.

377
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:42,601
oh, <i>that's</i>
responsible parenting.

378
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,234
stealing whiskey?

379
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,567
"that's it, young lady.
i'm taking you to paris."

380
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:48,150
ah, ah, but that's
just some ruse.

381
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:49,150
once we get her
on the plane,

382
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:51,717
we'll make her fly coach--
middle seat, no mercy.

383
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,750
i'm sorry.

384
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:59,217

she's at the back.

391
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,084

392
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,317

you're going with that?!

455

 <i>information is very thin</i>
 <i>at this time.</i>

456

i told you
she'd have food.

467
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:26,266

might be thinking this is all my fault.

468
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:29,334

00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:37,967
he humiliated me.

473
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
first he cheated on me
with a stewardess named monique.

474
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:42,700
how clich?is that?

475
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,933
and then
he told people about it.

476
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:48,167
now there are
news trucks out there.

477
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,067

00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,800
she hurt me,
so i hurt her back.

569

577
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,500
i wanted kids so badly,

578
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:06,400

580
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:11,566
he said it made her fat.

581
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,366
harvey likes them lean.

582
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,132
i run 4 miles a day.

583
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:19,100

00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:23,450
 <i>i'm breaking my diet!</i>

out there. what do i do?

587
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:29,083
just keep her calm,
tell her you're sorry

588
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:30,366
and see if you can get her

589
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,333
to release the kids
and old people.

590
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:34,200

600
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,966

601
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:58,467
 <i>well, i was distracted.</i>

602
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,966

00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,700
don't lie to me, harvey!

608
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:14,133

of your whores, isn't she?

609
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,567
 <i>(edie) oh, fantastic!</i>

610
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,800
carolyn, i swear--

611
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:20,200
shut up.

612
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:22,734
i hope you're having
a good time in there, whore,

613
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:24,767
'cause i got a bullet
for you, too.

614
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,300
(exhales deeply)

615
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,734
god, what a nightmare.

616
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,567
you know what
the weird part is?

617
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,467
what?

618
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,533
i keep thinking about
that crazy lady in the market,

619
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,600
and i understand her.

620
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,667
i-i could <i>be</i> her.

621
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,200
come on.

622
00:31:57,866 --> 00:31:59,966
no, i mean it.

623
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:02,966
the rage that i have felt
in these past six months...

624
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:05,800
if i had had a gun
in the courthouse today...

625
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,567
you could never shoot me.

626
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,416
i don't know what
i'm capable of anymore.

627
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:16,383
this divorce
has turned me into this...

628
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,250
bitter, hateful person,
and i don't like her.

629
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:21,684
hey, baby.

630
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:22,615
and for what it's worth,

631
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:25,649
i don't like what
it's turned you into either.

632
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:32,300
then let's stop being
those people.

633
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:37,266
okay.

634
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
okay.

635
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,667
(sniffles)

636
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:48,633
hey, just so you know...

637
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:52,600
i heard the woman in there
teaches sunday school.

638
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:55,000
oh.

639
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:58,233
a sunday school teacher
would never hurt a kid.

640
00:32:58,266 --> 00:32:59,567
no way.

641
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,266
thank you.

642
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:05,833
i'm sure lynette's
gonna be fine, too.

643
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,833
oh, i'm not worried
about lynette.

644
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:09,566
(laughs) hell,
with lynette in there,

645
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:11,533
they don't even need
that negotiator.
(laughs)

646
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:12,566
you put lynette in a room

647
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:15,233
with a woman who wants
to shoot her husband,

648
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:19,700
she'll have them renewing their vows.
right, lynette is very persuasive.

649
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,166
i give it an hour, tops.

650
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:31,033
then we'll all be back home
eating our hamburgers.

651
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:34,200
she was gonna
go to the store tomorrow,

652
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:37,900
but we were
out of hamburger.

653
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:43,200
i wanted hamburgers.

654
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,249
i hope all this
is giving you

655
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,217
a little perspective
on our situation.

656
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,516
shh!
she told us not to talk.

657
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,150
you're thinking
about your kids, right?

658
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:04,150
how awful it'd be
to never see them again.

659
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:06,650
well, that's what
you're asking me to feel,but for the rest of my life!

660
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:08,782
(lowered voice)
nora! nora, please!

661
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:11,016
hey, what'd i say?

662
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:14,716
(normal voice) sorry. i'm sorry.
we'll--we'll be quiet.

663
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:17,182
you and your friend
are really starting to bug me.

664
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:19,683
she's not my friend.

665
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:22,416
she's trying
to steal my kid.

666
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,917
nora, shut up!

667
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,998
is that true?

668
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:29,065
no! i--we're--we had--
we're sharing custody,

669
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:31,733
and then she tried
to seduce my husband, so--

670
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,733
she put the moves
on your husband?

671
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,533
why didn't you say so?

672
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:38,066
(gasps) aah! aah!

673
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:42,500
(gasping)

674
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,733
(gasps)

675
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:48,000
that was a shot!
we just heard a shot fired

676
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:49,133
inside the building.

677
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:51,100
a shot has been fired.

678
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:55,433
(gasping)

679
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:05,949
i believe the phrase you're
looking for is "thank you."

680
00:35:07,617 --> 00:35:09,450
(reporter)
we just had a shot.

681
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,450
we heard a shot fired
inside the market.

682
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:13,016
you can see
police are responding,

683
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,016
taking this very seriously.

684
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,449
we are going to just continue

685
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,117
to stand and watch and wait
and see what happens.

686
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,184
(crowd shouting indistinctly)

687
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:26,632
it was on television
at the airport.

688
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:28,899
i came as soon as i could.

689
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:33,300
the last thing i said to her
was that she disappointed me.

690
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,834
 <i>police have just confirmed</i>
 <i>that a hostage has been shot.</i>

691
00:35:36,866 --> 00:35:39,400
 <i>repeat,</i>
 <i>a hostage has been shot.</i>

692
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:41,999
 <i>there's no word on the name</i>
 <i>of the victim at this time,</i>

693
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:44,233
 <i>but it is believed</i>
 <i>to be female.</i>
(parker) mrs. hodge?

694
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:45,899
 <i>the mood here at the market,</i>

695
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:48,433
 <i>which has been very uneasy</i>
 <i>all morning...</i>

696
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:52,266
when's mommy
gonna be back from the store?
 <i>(man) thank you, leslie.</i>

697
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,415
i'm--i'm sure
she'll be back soon.

698
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,750
why don't we, uh,
go have some cookies?

699
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,017
mommy said we can't
have cookies before dinner.

700
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,316
well, uh...

701
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,017
i'm sure she won't mind.

702
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,283

703
00:36:10,316 --> 00:36:12,783

well... (sniffles)

706
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:19,283
good news is you won't need
that lawyer now.

707
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:21,416
you are gonna
get through this just fine.

708
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,150
there is a parking lot
full of ambulances out there.

709
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,616
you gotta let us
take her out of here!

710
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,050
no one's leaving.

711
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:30,817

712
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,216
