1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,300
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,600
The accountant's dropping off
the papers

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,900
For my cayman island account.
This is everything you need to access the money.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,300
<i>Edie got an opportunity...
let go!</i>

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,500
<i>But lost it.</i>

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,400
<i>Mike...</i>

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,500
You will go to rehab,
or so help me, i will leave you.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,400
<i>Made a promise.
I'll go.</i>

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,700
I keep thinking
about what we covered up.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,900
<i>Katherine's aunt was determined
to reveal the truth...</i>

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
<i>And victor...
uhh!</i>

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,900
<i>Was a victim of the tornado...
uhh!</i>

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,300
<i>That brought devastation...
oh, my god!</i>

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,800
<i>...to wisteria lane.</i>

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>Once the tornado had passed,</i>

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,600
<i>It began.</i>

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,800
<i>A man gave his coat
to a stranger in need...</i>

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,400
<i>A woman shared her food
with those just passing by....</i>

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,800
<i>A teenager reunited a dog
with its worried owner.</i>

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,700
<i>These are
the things that happen</i>

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,000
<i>In the wake
of any great disaster.</i>

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,100
<i>People start to perform
small acts of kindness.</i>

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,500
<i>They do what they can to help,</i>

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,500
<i>All the while knowing...</i>

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,700
<i>It won't be enough.</i>

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,400
Why is it taking so long?
They should be going faster.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
The fire captain said
they have to go slowly.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,100
They don't want debris suddenly
collapsing intsie basement.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,600
Has anyone heard from gaby?

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Uh, she went to the hospital
with carlos.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,700
He?? But they say he's gonnbe okay.
Thank god.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,900
Why can't we hear them?

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,000
If my kids are alive,
they would be yelling.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Tom would be yelling.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,500
Okay, lynette, listen to me.

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,200
They are all going to be fine.
I know it.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,200
Okay. You really,
really, really think so?

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,300
Yes, yes, i do. I do.

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,800
So i want you to go over
to those paramews,

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,100
And i want you to let them
look at these cuts.

41
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,200
Because you don't want
to be all bloody

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,300
When they pull your kids
out of there, do you?

43
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,300
No. No, i guess not.
Okay.

44
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,800
What are you doing?

45
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,100
You don't know if her kids
are gonna be okay.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm just trying
to comfort her.

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
By giving her false hope?

49
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
What do you suggest we do?

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,800
Well, you should be saying,
"lynette, this could end badly.

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,300
So you should start preparing
yourself for that now." Edie, if you say that??

52
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,500
So help me god,
i will wring your neck.

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
And i will help her.

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,300
Tom and ida and the kids
are buried under that rubble.

55
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,500
I mean, what is it
with you people?

56
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,400
Why aren't you willing
to face the facts?

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,300
Because we're hoping
for a miracle.

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,500
A miracle?

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,200
Maybe, just maybe,
if we stop flapping our gums,

60
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,700
And we start asking god
to take care of our folks,

61
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,500
He might just help us out.

62
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,800
So you think a prayer circle
is going to help lynette?

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,900
Once you get to my age,
you'll find it a lot easier

64
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,000
To believe that god
really does answer prayers.

65
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,500
So if you can just hang on
two more years... don't.

66
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,000
You know,
maybe a moment of silence

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,900
Wouldn't be
such a bad idea.

68
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,100
Hey, guys! We got someone!

69
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,200
Come on. Uhh!

70
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,300
Mom!

71
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,500
Mom!
Mom!

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,600
Oh, my god! Oh!
Thank you. Thank you.

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Hold on. Hold off!

74
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,100
Come on, tom.

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,100
Wait. Wait.

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Grab the arm.
Grab the arm.

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Here he comes.

78
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,300
Straight ahead, sir.Ad
go ahead. Right over there.

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you.
Oh, my god.

80
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,500
Got a light down there?

81
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,200
Where's ida?

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
Tom! Where's ida?

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,000
<i>Yes, in the wake
of a great tragedy,</i>

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,700
<i>People do what they can
to help...</i>

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
<i>All the while e@</i>

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,000
<i>It won't be enough.</i>

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,700
<i>The morning after the tornado,</i>

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
<i>The residents of wisteria lane</i>

89
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,200
<i>Began to sort
through the devastation</i>

90
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,200
<i>And slowly started picking up
the pieces of their lives.</i>

91
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
It's there by the north side!

92
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,100
<i>Bob hunter
found part of his fountain</i>

93
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,900
<i>In the middle of the street.</i>

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,700
<i>Bree hodge found her lawn mower
next to her coffee table.</i>

95
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
<i>And kayla scavo discovered
her music box in a tree...</i>

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
<i>Among...</i>

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,200
<i>Other things.</i>

98
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,500
She had your address
in her pocket,

99
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,300
But there wano other i.D.

100
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,800
Did you know her?

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,900
Sort of.
Her name is sylvia greene.

102
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,000
Is she local?

103
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
I knew her from chicago.

104
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
Esshe was...

105
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,800
Visiting.

106
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, i guess
that's all we need.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,100
Would you like me
to follow up with you

108
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,500
After we contact the family?
No.

109
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,100
So...

110
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,200
I guess this means
it's over.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,900
The fact that she is dead

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,900
Does not change the fact
that you slept with her.

113
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,800
I know it doesn't.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
I made a terrible mistake,
and i am so sorry, katherine.

115
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm sure you are.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,200
I want you
out of my house tonight.

117
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,100
??Yes, i do. It's over.
Asar as i'm concerned,

118
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,800
You could be lying on that slabright n??

119
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,200
Come on, ida. You can
watch us pack from up here.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,400
Wow. The things you accumulate
in a lifetime, huh?

121
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Yeah, especially
if you never throw anything out.

122
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
So her niece and nephew

123
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,700
Are taking all this stuff
back to nebraska?

124
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,100
Well, the stuff
that'll sell on ebay.

125
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm guessim rest
will end up in a dumpster.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,600
What's all this baseball stuff?
There's a mitt and a jersey.

127
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,700
Was this her husband's?

128
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,600
No, that was ida's
from her pro baseball days.

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Yeah, right.

130
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Yeah.

131
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,100
Oh, you're serious?

132
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,200
Ida played
in the all-American girls league

133
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,500
During world war ii.
You didn't know that? No.

134
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,100
Oh, she was a superstar.
Arm like a cannon.

135
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,300
People said she could throw
a porkchop past a hungry wolf.

136
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,800
Ida?

137
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,700
I have trouble seeing her
as the leadoff hitter

138
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,300
For anything
other than osteoporosis.

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,600
She made the only unassisted
triple play in league history...

140
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
Right here
in granville field, 1944.

141
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,600
That's why she wants her ashes
scattered there.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,200
How did i not know this?

143
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,400
Daddy said you were over here.
Can i help?

144
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,100
Oh.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,400
You realize we're cleaning,
right? We're not eating candy.

146
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,800
That's sweet, parker,

147
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,500
But we've got everything
under control here

148
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,600
If you want to go play.

149
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,700
No, i want to do something nice
for mrs. Greenberg.

150
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,000
She sort of saved my life.

151
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,700
What do you mean?

152
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,400
When the house
started shaking,

153
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,800
And daddy was passed out
by his asthma...

154
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,300
Mrs. Greenberg made us
all go under the stairs.

155
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,900
But that's not
where they found her.

156
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,400
Yeah.

157
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,400
There wasn't enough room
for her.

158
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,200
She said she'd be okay
in the corner.

159
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Es, parker,
you want to help?

160
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,600
Ida has some ice cream
in the freezer that needs eating

161
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Before it goes bad.
Go on.

162
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,400
I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,700
If you'd been there, it wouldn't
have made a bit of difference.

164
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,400
Susan,
we can't thank you enough.

165
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,600
Opening your home to us--
It's so generous. It's a horrible feeling

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,100
To literally not have a roof
over your head,

167
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,700
And that smoky fleabag hotel
just wasn't safe for a newborn.

168
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,900
Please, this is
what best friends do...

169
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,600
Right before
their friendship ends.

170
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,500
-Why did you agree to let her stay?
-How do you say no

171
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,200
That wasn't rhetorical.
Seriously, you got anything?

172
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,500
I know you feel guilty because
she let us stay with her once,

173
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,600
But don't you remember
how miserable were?
Oh, yeah.

174
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,900
Every coaster needs
a doily.

175
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,500
Every doily
needs daily laundering.

176
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,600
This woman is gonna drive me out
of my frickin'--Hey, roomies.

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,800
You need help?
No,
we've got it under control.

178
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Oh, and, uh, listen.

179
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
Bob and lee introduced us
to this wonderful contractor,

180
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,600
So we won't be imposing
for long. Imposing. Who's imposing?

181
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,300
You can stay as long as you want.

182
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
I'm sorry.
The words came out of my mouth

183
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,100
Before i knew what i was saying.
Then stop talking, and don't be so nice.

184
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,600
Otherwise, she'll just
take the place over.

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,200
Hey, susan, orson likes
to sleep with the window open.

186
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
Do you mind
if we rearrange the furniture?

187
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,700
No.

188
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Sounds good to me!

189
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,400
Hello, gabrielle.

190
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,300
Milton. Hi.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,500
It's a nice turnout.

192
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,000
Victor was loved by a lot of people.

193
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,300
It's gonna be a very emotional day.

194
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,200
You seem remarkably composed.

195
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Oh, no, no. I'm a mess--

196
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,100
You know, on the inside,
where thwhscara can't run.

197
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,400
Ah, i see.

198
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,300
The reading of the will
is today.

199
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700
Is it? I'd forgotten.

200
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,500
I thought you'd be curious
as to how much you'll inherit.

201
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,900
No. I'm not thinking
aboumoney today.

202
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,500
I'm burying my husband.

203
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,700
Of course.

204
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,200
It's just, i, uh...

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,800
Spoke to the executor
of the will,

206
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,900
And i have a ballpark figure
of what you'll be getting.

207
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh?

208
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,100
Well, i guess
there's nothing disrespectful

209
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,900
About a ballpark figure.

210
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,300
You're not getting a dime.

211
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Victor showed me the photographs
of you and your ex-Husband.

212
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,100
You broke his heart.

213
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,000
You humiliated him.

214
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
So you'll inherit exactly
what you deserve--Nothing.

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
Okay, i made a mista.

216
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm sorry, but victor
wasn't entirely blameless.

217
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,500
He ignored me.
He used me politically.

218
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,900
Oh, yeah,
and he tried to kill carlos.

219
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,500
So i think i'm entitled
to whatever he had.

220
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,200
Ah, there's the thing.

221
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
You married a man
from a very rich family--

222
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,600
The operative word
being ily."

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,900
Everything's in my name...
always was.

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,700
The service is starting.

225
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
I think
it's time for you to go.

226
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,000
Go? You can't kick me
out of my husband's funeral.

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,600
I think it's appropriate,
given the circumstances.

228
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,900
Go to hell.

229
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,700
I'll be delivering
the eulogy.

230
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,900
If you're stilin this pew
when i reach the pulpit,

231
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,300
I'm going to be telling
all of these people

232
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,800
Ou are
a cheating, lying whore.

233
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,400
See?

234
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,900
I told you it was
gonna be an emotional day.

235
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,200
Hello, boys.

236
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,400
Bob, lee, i baked you
some muffins to thank you

237
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,300
For introducing me
to walter here.

238
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,100
And, walter, i decided
you're absolutely right.

239
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,900
Dark shingles
are the way to go.

240
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,700
Why are you all staring at me?

241
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,600
I'm sorry, but i'm not gonna
be able to fix your house.
What?

242
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,700
I've just had some bad news
in my personal life.

243
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,600
Oh, good heavens.
I hope no one's died,

244
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,400
Which is the only
possible excuse i'd accept.

245
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,100
No, it's not--It's not that.
It's just...

246
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,800
I don't want
to get into it.

247
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,600
Walter, i can't find
a contractor now.

248
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,800
Everybody is booked
for the next year.

249
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,900
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,600
Walter. Walter. Walter,
i'm begging you. Please.

251
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,700
I'm living like a vagabond
in a teenage girl's bedroom.

252
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm sleeping under a poster
of orlando bloom.

253
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
You can't leave me.

254
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,500
Yeah, well,
sometimes people do that.

255
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
They just leave.

256
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,000
This is a nightma e.

257
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,700
What is going on?

258
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,400
Walter went rough
a bad breakup,

259
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
And today he found out that his
ex moved in with someone else.

260
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,800
Oh, for god sakes. Tell him
to put on his big boy pants

261
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,100
And find another girl.
Who says it's a girl?

262
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,600
Walter's gay?

263
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,300
<i>Yes. He can build home
and decorate them.</i>

264
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,400
Sometimes god gives
with both hands.

265
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,200
Well, then you just have
to fix him up with someone,

266
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,100
Give him back
ll to work.

267
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,900
Yeah, about that--
Uh, most of our friends are 9s,

268
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,900
And walter--We love him--
But kind of a 3.

269
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,000
And in the gay world,
3 does not go into 9.

270
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,000
Well,
we'll just have to find him

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,200
Someone who's not good
at gay math.

272
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,400
Well, i drove
all the way out there,

273
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,600
And i waited for hours

274
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,300
And then they wouldn't
let me see him.

275
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,800
Uh, no. They just said that
i should--I should call you.

276
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,400
Listen,
i know it's a 30-Day rehab.

277
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm not trying to break him out.

278
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,300
I'm just trying to see him.

279
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,600
You know what? Could you
just call me when you know?

280
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,700
Thank you.

281
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,100
<i>Ho</i>

282
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,500
Welcome to heaven.

283
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,700
Don't talk. I'm smelling.

284
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,700
What is that?

285
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,300
Duck a l'orange. Bree says
making a co.

286
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,200
And our oven
is making its debut.

287
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
Oh, it gets better.

288
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She did our laundry, too.

289
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,100
Smell my sock.
Oh.

290
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,400
Oh, my god!

291
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,200
I want to eat that.

292
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
She dusts. She irons.

293
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,700
Oh, and she does
this magic trick.

294
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
No matter where
you throw your sweater,

295
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,800
Within seconds,it's on a hanger.
This has just replaced

296
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,100
As the best day
of my life.

297
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,900
Oh, hi, susan. I hope you
don't mind that i made dinner.

298
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,500
I hope you don't mind
that i'mng to kiss you.
Ooh. Ye funny.

299
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,100
Now i need you to be honest
about this recipe.

300
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a dry run

301
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,200
For a all dinner party
i'm having tomorrow night.

302
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
Again, if you don't mind.
Not at all.

303
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,500
In--In fact, if you wanna
do a dry run for sunday brunch,

304
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,900
I'm there for you.
Dinner will beeady shortly.

305
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,600
Oh, and, julie, i fixed the hem
on that blue skirt of yours.

306
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,900
It's on your bed.

307
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
My hem is fixed? She's like
the mother i never had.

308
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,700
Oh, oh, no offense.

309
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,200
Oh, none taken.

310
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Hey.

311
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,500
How you feeling?

312
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,400
Uh, not so great.

313
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,800
Well, they should give you
something for the pain.

314
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,100
They gave me this button
that i can press,

315
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
But i'm trying
not to use it,

316
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,100
'Cause the drugs make me fes
a little to mellow.

317
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,800
- Was the funeral sad?
-???

318
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,300
I founout everytt
victor hvi is in milton's name,

319
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,900
And he told his fa about us,
so i'm not getting a penny.

320
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Wow.

321
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,100
Well, it's a good thing

322
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,300
You hooked up
with another rich guy.

323
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,200
Yeah...

324
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,900
Uh...

325
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,300
Gaby, you sound weird.

326
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Why do you sound
so weird?

327
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,900
Gaby.

328
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,700
Um, remember that day,

329
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,300
Uh...

330
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,700
When al was going to drop off
the account information?

331
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,700
Oh, my god. He didn't?

332
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,900
No, no, no. He did.

333
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,400
It's just... remember
how windy it was that day?

334
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,800
No, no, no.
That was the only copy.

335
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,900
I know,

336
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But edie was trying to steal
the papers from me,

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
And we got into this fight,

338
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,700
And then the tornado
just took them away.

339
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,200
Th???

340
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Kinda.

341
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh

342
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,400
What is that sound?

343
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
I'm texting someone.

344
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,400
Gaby, that account was
our future.

345
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,300
What are we gonna do now?
Shh. Carlos,just calm down, okay?

346
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm sure al has
an access code or a copy

347
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,900
Or some super nerd way to get
back into the account, okay?

348
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,700
I know we can fix this.

349
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,400
Yeah

350
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,500
Yeah, he could fix it.

351
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Okay.

352
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,800

353
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800

359
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Thanks.

360
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
Right this way.
Y.

361
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,800
Al

362
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, al.

363
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,400
Thanks again for your help.

364
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Well, we'd do anything
for yo aunt.

365
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,200
I hope you know
what an amazing woman she was.

366
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Uh-Huh. Hey, did you guys
happen to find a pearl necklace?

367
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's the only valuable thing
aunt ida owned.

368
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,100
Yeah, she promised it to me
if she kicked the bucket first.

369
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,600
Oh, really? In--In writing?

370
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,700
I'll be right back.

371
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,700
All right,
let's hit the road.

372
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,700
What about
the rest of these boxes?

373
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,500
Oh, that's junk. You can
just give 'em away. Hey, listen.

374
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,400
Is there a good place we can
grab a bite on the way out?

375
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Um, well, there's a great diner
right near granville field.

376
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,800
Oh. Isn't that--
Isn't that out of the way?

377
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,900
Yeah, but aren't you stopping there anyway
to spread your aunt's ashes?

378
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,500
We're kind'rprkifor time.
Yeah, we thought we'd just put her

379
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,600
In the family plot
back in omaha.

380
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,700
You can't do that.

381
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,200
Ida wanted her ashes
scattered at the field.

382
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,300
Yeah, i know, but that's
kinda crazy, don't you think?

383
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,900
It doesn't matter.
She was an amazing woman.

384
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
You should respect
her wishes.

385
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,400
We shogoing.Go

386
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah.
Hey, i-If you don't have time
to do it, i will.

387
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,800
Uh, you know,
you're not family,

388
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,900
So i think
that would be inappropriate.

389
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,500
Look,
you're taking her pearls.

390
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,900
The least you can do
is honor her wishes.

391
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,700
Okay, at the risk of being bitchy,

392
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,200
This is none of your business,

393
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,900
So could you please just drop it?
Fine.

394
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,100
You passed bitchy ten minutes ago.

395
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,500
Carter, get the urn.
I wanna get outta here.

396
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,500
Wait!

397
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,800
You'll never find it
i'll get it for you.

398
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,600
Oh. By the way, i'm staying
at ida's house for a while

399
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Since, you know, my house
is a pile of rubble.

400
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,800
Oh, that's so sad.
You've got a week.

401
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,700
Here you go.

402
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,800
Thanks.

403
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,500
Just put it in the cup holr.

404
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,100
Excuse me.
Are you al's wife?

405
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm gabrielle lang.

406
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,600
You're the mayor's wife.
Of course i recognize you.

407
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,200
So i was shocked
to hear about al.

408
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,700
I can't remember the last time
i was so devastated.

409
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,000
Didn't you just bury
your husband yesterday?

410
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,100
That sucked, too.

411
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,800
So what happened to al?

412
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,300
He was driving he,

413
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,900
Trying to beat the storm, and he
ran into a downed power line...

414
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,400
And his car
burst into flames.

415
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh, sweetie, don't.

416
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,000
I want you to remember al
like i do--

417
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,300
At his desk,
with a big smile on his face,

418
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,300
Surrounded by all his files.

419
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,500
<i>By the way,
where are those files?</i>

420
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,300
I cleared out his office.

421
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,200
Oh, i bet that was hard.

422
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
So where'd you put 'em?

423
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,500
In the garage.

424
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,200
Which is...

425
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,900
In the back.

426
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,900
Well, look at me,
monopolizing the widow.

427
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,600
You go mingle.
I'm gonna get you a cracker.

428
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,100
Ohh.

429
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh, crap.

430
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,900
Why, god?!

431
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,100
Why do people have to die?!

432
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,200
Why, god?! Why? Why?

433
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Why? Why? Why?

434
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,200
Oh, ank you so mucu for let tus

435
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,000
Take over your dininurom.
Please. Thank you
for making us dinner.

436
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,700
Oh, you will be sending up dessert later?
Oh, sure.

437
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,200
Just, uh, leave your trays
in the hall when you're ready.

438
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh.

439
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Puff pastry?

440
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,000
Thank you.
Oh, here is a nice 12-Year-Old scotch

441
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,200
To wash that down with.
Uh, look, it's nice of you
to invite me for dinner,

442
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,000
But if you're hoping to change
my mind about doing your roof,

443
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,900
I'm just--
I'm really not up to it.

444
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,000
No. No, no, walter,

445
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,600
We--We just heard
about your situation

446
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,200
And thought you could use
a little company. That's all.

447
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Yes, and a nice
home-Cooked meal.

448
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,900
Trust me, there are absolutely
no tricks up our sleeve.

449
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,000
Uh, i noticed there are
four place settings.

450
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,400
Is somebody joining us?

451
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,100
All right, i'm here.
What was so important?

452
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,400
What's going on?

453
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,700
I'm moving out.
It's been a little weird

454
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,600
Staying in the guest room
of my own house.

455
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,300
But i thought you and mom
were trying to work stuff out.

456
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
We are.

457
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,900
It's just... your mom
thought it might be easier

458
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
If we gave ourselves
a little distance.

459
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,000
<i>Well, then
why doesn't she move out?</i>

460
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,300
Dylan.

461
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,100
I'm serious. You can't
leave me here alone with her.

462
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,600
I'll go crazy.

463
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,300
Hey, come onwe're gonna see
each other all the time.

464
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,400
Why does she always
have to win?

465
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,400
Yeah, i'm thinking
of starting my trip in paris.

466
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,500
Todd and i talked about going
there, but now i'm thinking

467
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,800
Of doing it myself.

468
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Walter recently split up
with his life partner todd.

469
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,900
- They were gay.
- Small world, huh?

470
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,000
How is it small, exactly?

471
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,400
Andrew is also
an out-And-Proud homosexual.

472
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,600
He's here, he's queer,
and we're used to it.

473
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,700
Since when?

474
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,500
You know what else you two
have in common? A love of boots.

475
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,100
Andrew has
some beautiful boots.

476
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,500
Oh, i can only imagine

477
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,000
The fun you two would have
in the boot shop.

478
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,700
Um, mom, i'm gonna take
these bowls to the kitchen.

479
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,900
Oh, thanks, dear.

480
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,800
With you.

481
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,400
What are you doing?

482
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm just trying
to stay out of the way

483
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,800
Of all those sparks
that are flying.

484
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,600
Sparks?
The man's twice my age.

485
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,800
Yes, but he's also--

486
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,700
He's got a great sense of...

487
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,900
Okay, do you know how hard it is
to get a good contractor?

488
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,500
Oh, my god!

489
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,400
And poor walter
just had his heart broken,

490
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
So if it takes you being nice
to him to get our house fixed,

491
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,600
Then...
you're--You're pimping me out
for a new roof?

492
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,100
And windows.

493
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,500
And i am not pimping you out.
I'm simply asking you

494
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,200
To show some kindness to a lonely man

495
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,400
Who happens to be
an excellent roofer.

496
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,500
Look, if by kindness you mean sex--
Watch your mouth.

497
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,000
You can raise a man's hopes
without satisfying them.

498
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,800
Ve done ll my life.

499
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Andrew, i haveot
to get back into my

500
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,600
And you're my only hope.

501
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Fine.

502
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,300
I will flatter,
and i will charm.

503
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,000
Bless you.

504
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,300
And in exchange,

505
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,000
I expect
a 60-Inch flat screen tv.

506
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,300
Fine, and if you can
get him to come in

507
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,400
On time and under budget,
i'll throw in surround sound.

508
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,900
No. That walter guy
needs to stay mie,

509
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,600
Because if he's not,
he'll fix her roof,

510
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,900
And then she'll leave us.
Mom, we always knew
is couldn't last forever,

511
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,300
And she'll still be here
another week or two.

512
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,400
That is not enough timou
she just started

513
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,800
Stenciling the kitchen, and i
didn't want to tell you this,

514
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,600
But there is talk
of an herb garden.

515
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,200
I've gotta stop her.
How?

516
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,300
I don't know, but i've had
a taste of ironed pillowcases,

517
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,000
An not going back.

518
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,800
Oh, walter, you got
a little right there.

519
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,300
Ooh. Thank you.

520
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,600
Yeah.

521
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,500
Hey, everybody.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

522
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,500
But the smell of that apple pie
just made my mouth water.

523
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, say no more.
E.One slice coming right up.

524
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,400
Oh, susan delfino,
this is walter bierlich.

525
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,500
This is susan's house.S
she's kinde'nough to take us in.
All righty. Here you go.

526
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,700
Thanks.

527
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,900
Oh. You're. Oiu'o eat that...

528
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,700
Oh, i'm just gonna visit
a whe.

529
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,000
So, andrew,
we miss you around here,

530
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,300
But i bet you love
having your own place.

531
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,700
Uh, yeah.
It's--It's cool.

532
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,600
Of--Of course,
it does get lonely.

533
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,200
It'd be nice to have someone
stop by once in a while.

534
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, well, you'll reel
somebody in. You always do.

535
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,500
You should have seen
his last boyfriend--Justin.

536
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,800
Ha! He was so hot.

537
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,700
You really had a thing

538
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,900
For the young,
ripped musclboys, huh?

539
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,600
Um...

540
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,400
He did at one time,
but andrew'sutgrown thatow

541
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,100
He realized the folly
of being so shallow.

542
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,900
Exactly, and now, um,
his tastes have gone

543
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,800
To the more mature, cultured
types, like, uh, walter here.

544
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
Us
oh!

545
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,900
Well, i just--It never wouldhave occurre

546
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,500
Because of
the vast age difference.

547
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,600
But, hell. Why not?
Life is short.

548
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
Certainly shorter for walter.

549
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,700
Susan.
Oh, no, don't get me wrong.
I mean, i think it's great.

550
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,900
You should grab love
wherever you can find it.

551
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,500
Who cares if your friends think
that you're paying for it?

552
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh, so why don't you take this
piece of pie upstairs to julie?

553
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,300
??T. That's exhay
what my friends woied think.Th

554
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Well,
then you need new friends.
Hey, listen. You know what?

555
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,900
You seem like a nice guy, and it
would be great to parade you

556
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,000
In front of my ex, but, uh,
then i'd be using you.
Well, he doesn't mind.

557
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,300
No, parade me.

558
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,100
He's got a mesh tank top that
would bring your ex to tears.

559
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,100
Yeah, well, you know,
as tempting as that sounds,

560
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,200
You know, i'm just not ready
to date, so...

561
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,300
Thank u so mfor the di

562
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,600
Walter, wait!

563
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,800
Well, i guess i'll just bring
this pie up to julie.

564
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,500
You.

565
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,700
Sit.

566
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,700
So is someone
meeting us here or what?

567
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,000
Well, here's the thing.
I called the general manager

568
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,500
To ask if we could scatter
the ashes here,

569
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,600
And he said absolutely not.

570
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,200
So how are wing in?

571
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,600
Oh, lynette.

572
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,900
Hey, you've abetted.
Might as well aid.

573
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,800
Leave us.

574
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Okay, i know
that it sounds selfish,

575
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,500
But i did what i did
because i want you to stay.

576
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,500
Why? I-I thought
you'd want your house back.

577
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,200
Well, yeah, sure, someda

578
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,900
But right now i just love
having you take care of me.

579
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,700
All the cooking aathe cleaning

580
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,700
It's helping me feel

581
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,800
Like i'm not
just about to fall apart.

582
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Oh, sweetie, you're okay.

583
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,000
No.

584
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm pregnant,
and my husban rehab,

585
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,200
And the only reason
i seem sane

586
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,600
Because you're here, making
my house feel like a home.

587
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
This is a conversation
that could benefit

588
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,600
From some homemade
chocolate chip cookies.

589
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,900
Can i have milk, too?

590
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,700
I'll be right back.

591
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,800
Do you maybe want
to say something first?

592
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,400
Sp, uh, yeahewivguess so.

593
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,400
Um...

594
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,100
"Do not stand at my grave
and weep."

595
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,800
Um, "i'm--I'm not there.
I do not sleep.

596
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,800
"I am a thousand winds
that blow.

597
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,300
I am...
d glints of snow."

598
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,800
"I am the sunlight
on ripened grain.

599
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,800
I am
the gentle autumn's rain."

600
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,000
"Do not stand at my grave
and cry.

601
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,400
I am not there.
I did not die."

602
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,800
That was lovely.

603
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,500
Let's dump her. And try not
to sivownwind.

604
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,900
She played third be,
right?
Right. Right, right, right.

605
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,300
Oh, my goodness.

606
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,700
Wait. Uh, sorry.
Shortstop.

607
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, yeah.

608
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,200
Okay.

609
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,200
<i>No, it was third.</i>

610
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Damn it, karen.
I'm running out of ida.

611
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,900
Okay, don't move!

612
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,600
Stay right where you are
and show me your hands.

613
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,100
Okay, split up,

614
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,600
And i'll meet you
back at the car. Go!

615
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,800
Hey, hey! Right there!

616
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,200
Oh!

617
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,800
Lady, get back here!

618
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,800
Oh. Aah!

619
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Come on. Come on. Uhh!

620
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Come on!

00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,000
Run, jane doe, run!

622

Just grab her!

623
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,000
Hey, stop, hey!

624
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,200
I got her. Come on.

625
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,600
Come on.

626
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,000
So when i finally came clean,
his wife told me

627
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,400
She shredded anything that had
to do with offshore accounts.

628
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,000
She waprotecting al.

629
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,700
So we're broke.

630
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
I'm so sorry, honey.

631
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,200
I-I know this is bad,
but we have each other.E

632
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,600
We'll get married again,

633
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,000
And everyt will be f

634
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,900
For richer, for poorer,
right?

635
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Fa
in sickness
and in health.

636
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,400
The whole nine yards.

637
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,600
I'm gonna go down
to the cafeteria

638
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
And get us
a couple of ginger ales

639
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,500
To toast our future.

640
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,800
Hey, doctor. He's looking better
and better every day.

641
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,300
Keep up the good work.

642
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,000
You haven't told her yet,
have you?

643
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,100
E
i'm working on it.

644
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,000
Carlos, i know you're scared,
but give her some credit.

645
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,300
She's not gonna leave you
because you lost your sight.

646
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,900
You don't know gaby.

647
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
Thank god those cops
let us off with a warning.

648
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
I was this close
to my third strike.

649
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,200
I'm just glad we gave ida
what she wante

650
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,700
It's a beautiful thing
you did.

651
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,100
Feel better?

652
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,000
I don't know.
Why don't you?

653
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,900
Because it wasn't enough,

654
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,300
Not compared
to what she did for me.

655
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,500
De
she savemyids.

656
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
She's this amazing woman,

657
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,000
And i never bothered
to get to know her,

658
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,400
So, yeah,
i sprinkled her ashes,

659
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,300
But it would have been nice

660
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,400
<i>To do something
before she was ashes.</i>

661
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,200
That's a lesson we all
gotta learn over and over--

662
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,900
Appreciate people
while we still got 'em.

663
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,900
Yep.

664
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,000
Third strike?

665
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,500
What were the first two?

666
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,000
It's a long story.

667
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,900
That requires a pitcher of beer
and a dark bar.

668
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
I got time for that.

669
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,600
What are you still
doing here?

670
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,400
I thought you found
a motel room.

671
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I did,

672
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,200
But i wanted to set something
straight before i go.

673
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,400
I'm not leaving
because you want me to.

674
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,300
I'm leaving
because i'm walking out on you.

675
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,500
Oh, is that
how we're gonna play this?

676
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,000
Fine. Whatever.
You're leaving me.

677
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,500
Oh, yeah, and here's why.

678
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,800
You blamed what happened
on your ex-Husband,

679
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,300
And i believed you.

680
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
You told me
it was all his fault,

681
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,700
And now i find out
it was yours.

682
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We're about even
in the betrayal department now.

683
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,600
In fact...

684
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,100
I think you win.

685
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,100
<i>It had been seven days</i>

686
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,400
<i>Since a tornado
devastated wisteria lane,</i>

687
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,300
<i>And the residents continued</i>

688
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,100
<i>To pick up the pieces
of their lives.</i>

689
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,500
<i>Some salvaged
precious friendships.</i>

690
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,300
<i>Some uncovered
colorful histories.</i>

691
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,500
<i>Others found challenges
they hadn't expected.</i>

692
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,500
<i>And then...</i>

<i>Who stumbled upon the truth</i>

695
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,300
<i>She'd long
been searching for...</i>

696
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,400
<i>Only... to wish she hadn't.</i>
