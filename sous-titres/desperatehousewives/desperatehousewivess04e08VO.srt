00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,490
????

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,850
<I>Mike Was The Victim...

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,040
<I>Of A Hit And Run.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,150
<I>Lynette Couldn't Forgive  <I>Her Mother's Past.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,450
You Had Tom To Come Home To. I Had Your Stepfather.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,830
Hey,Glen May Have Bored You,

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,650
But The Years We Had A Father In That House

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,770
Were The Happiest Of My Life. You Drove Him Away. Mom,Where's Grandma Going?

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,380
<I>Bree Got Her Second Chance  <I>To Be A Good Mother. (Cries)

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,880
<I>Mike's Dependency Grew...

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,300
Addicts Are Experts At Deception.

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,430
(Gabrielle) Victor! Get Up. I Wanna See The Look On Your Face

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,800
When The Knife Goes In. Uhh!

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,130
<I>And Victor Was Lost At Sea.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,580
<I>(Mary Alice)  <I>We Think Of The Past

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,890
<I>As Water Under The Bridge,

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,990
<I>A Current That Carries Away  <I>The Mistakes Of Our Youth--

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,700
<I>The Loves We Lost...

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,780
<I>The Addictions We Gave Into...

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,260
<I>The Opportunities  <I>We Threw Away...

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,940
<I>But Sooner Or Later,

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,410
<I>Reminders Drift Back  <I>Into Our Lives...

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,180
<I>Of The Mistakes We Made...

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,800
<I>And The Sins We Committed.

25
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,830
(Hushed Voice) Carlos, Why Are You Calling Me?

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,380
I Told You We Can't Be Seen Together. (Hushed Voice) I Can't Take It Anymore.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,070
We Gotta Go To The Cops. Oh,Okay. And Say What? "Yes,Officer,

28
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,580
"My Lover And I Knocked My Husband Overboard Twice

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,730
And Left Him For Dead. Okay. Bye-Bye." I Don't Think So.

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,690
But He's The Mayor.

31
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,970
You Know,People Are Gonna Notice He's Missing,

32
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,500
And Then They're Gonna Ask Questions.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,700
Let Them Ask. No One Knows We Were On That Boat.

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,060
Let's Just Play Dumb And Ride This Thing Out. Gaby,Don't You Feel Guilty? A Man Is Dead.

35
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,600
Yes,I Feel Awful, But He Threatened Our Lives.

36
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,880
It Was Self-Defense.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,830
Exactly. So Then Why Don't We Go And Tell The Police?

38
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,750
O-Ow!

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,670
He Took The Lord's Name In Vain. (Scoffs)

40
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,190
(Lowers Voice) Look,We Have A Good Plan.

41
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,650
Let's Just Stick To It.

42
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,020
Okay,Okay. I Won't Say Anything.

43
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,810
Good. Now Until This Blows Over, Don't Call Me Again.

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,250
What Are You Doing Now?

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,490
I'm Praying For A Miracle.

46
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,080
Carlos,If Victor Had Lived, He Would've Killed Us.

47
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,940
I'm Thinking We Already Had Our Miracle.

48
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,350
<I>Yes,The Mistakes Of Our Past

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,490
<I>Have A Way Of Drifting Back  <I>Into Our Lives...

50
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,340
<I>And When They Do...

51
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,630
<I>We Have To Pay For Them.

《绝望主妇》 第四季第8集

55
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,280
<I>One Day In The Early Fall,

56
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,310
????

57
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,900
Ow! God.

58
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,050
<I>To Ease His Pain,

59
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,600
<I>He Took A Little White Pill  <I>Recommended By His Doctor.

60
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,190
<I>The Pain Persisted,  <I>So He Took Another...

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,710
<I>And Another.

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,600
<I>Unfortunately,When Mike's Pain  <I>Began To Subside,

63
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,320
<I>His Need  <I>For The Little White Pills...

64
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,910
<I>Did Not.

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,250
<I>But Mike Never Shared This  <I>With Those Who Cared About Him,

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,570
<I>Only With Those Who Could Not  <I>Have Cared Less.

67
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,700
Hey,It's Mike. I'm Out. I Need To Meet You Tomorrow.

68
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,160
Great. Got That Money You Owe Me?

69
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,160
No,But You Know I'm Good For It.

70
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,380
You Price Chemistry Textbooks Lately?

71
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,500
They're,Like,300 Bucks.

72
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,730
I Need My Money,Mike.

73
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,580
And You'll Get It,All Right?

74
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,200
Can't You Just Front Me Something For Now?

75
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,020
Well,Advice Is Free. Pills Aren't.

76
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,430
My Advice--Get Some Cash.

77
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,640
Oh.

78
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,730
So,Hey,You Know, I Better Get Going.

79
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,810
(Julie) Yeah,Um,I Should,Too.

80
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,500
Hey!

81
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,500
Mom.

82
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,160
Can We Talk? This Will Just Take A Second.

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,040
Did You Kiss Thaboy?

84
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,650
No,I Was Kind Of Interrupted. Oh,Well, You're Gonna Tnk Me.

85
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,760
Do You Know That He Has His Tongue Pierced?

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,650
Yeah. He Showed Me. How Do You Know? I Checked Out His Web Page.

87
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,320
You Did Not. I Did,Too,And Do You Know What Else He Has Pierced?

88
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,550
And If You Do, You're Grounded. Okay,Yes,Mom,

89
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,150
Derek Has Bought Into The Who Piercing Craze,

90
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,230
But Aren't You The One Who Told Me To Not Judge A Book

91
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,390
By Its Cover? If The Cover Has Holes In It, The Book Is No Good.

92
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,680
Okay, This Conversation Is Over.

93
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,380
I Am Going To Kiss Derek Good Night. Oh,Fine. Break My Heart.

94
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,320
Why Are You Freaking Out? We're Just Dating.

95
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,440
It's Not Like He's Trying To Put A Ring On My Finger.

96
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,820
Trust Me. Your Finger Is Not Where He'd Put It. (Scoffs)

97
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,830
Aw,He's So Beautiful When He Sleeps.

98
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,070
I'll Put Him In The Crib.

99
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,490
No, He'll Be Sleeping With Us.

100
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,920
Why? Is He Running A Fever?

101
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,990
He's Fine,But I've Been Doing So Reading,

102
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,350
And More And More People Say

103
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,700
That Babies Sleep Better Next To Their Parents.

104
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,230
'S Called The "Family Bed." No,I've Heard Of That.

105
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,850
Isn't It Designed To Facilitate Breast-Feeding?

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,860
Partly. What's Your Point?

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,820
You're Not Lactating. If Our Son Wants To Be Near The Milk,

108
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,570
He'll Have To Sleep In The Refrigerator.

109
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,250
(Scoffs) This Isn't Just For Me And Benjamin.

110
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,010
This Will Help You Bond With Him,Too.

111
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,870
Oh,Perhaps,But It's Sure Not Gonna Help Me Bond With You.

112
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,540
Darling,Sex Is The Last Thing Women Want

113
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,970
Right After They've Given Birth.

114
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,070
But You Didn't Give Birth. You Watched And Served Refreshments.

115
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,850
Well,That Doesn't Make Caring For An Infant Any Less Tiring.

116
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,580
Can't We Just Give It A Chance?

117
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,700
I Suppose.

118
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,750
What If I Roll Over And Crush Him?

119
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,250
Don't.

120
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,170
Yes,Hi. I'm Looking For My Mom.

121
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,080
She Hangs Out At Your Bar Sometimes.

122
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,600
Stella Wingfield?

123
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,270
Uh,Older Lady,Big Oker, Talks Like A Teamster.

124
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,590
Well,That's Your Fault For Letting Her Run A Tab.

125
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,850
Look,<I>If You See Her,Could You Tell Her To Call Lynette?

126
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,550
Thank You.

127
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,000
I Know That You Are Worried,

128
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,380
But I Am Sure Your Mother Is Fine.

129
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,290
She's Broke And Old And Rude.

130
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,060
That Is Not A Winning Combination On The Street.

131
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,650
Stella Is Very Resourceful. (Beeping)

132
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,650
Didn't You Tell Me That She Once Made Her Own Booze

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,110
By Putting A Bag Of Oranges Under The Radiator?

134
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,880
Lucy,Lydia And I Fought Over Who <I>Had To Take Her.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
She Was Right Outside. God Only Knows What She Heard Us Say. Yeah,Well,After The Crap She Puyou Guys Through,

136
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,410
You Have Every Right To Resent Her. It Is A Lot Easier To Resent Your Parents

137
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,850
When You Know They're Safe In Some Retirement Village,

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,660
But To Know That She's Out There,

139
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,900
Maybe Lying Facedown In An Alley...

140
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,960
This Is Exactly What She Wants You To Do.

141
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,350
She Wants You To Feel Guilty. Don't Buy Into It.

142
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,200
Okay. Okay.

143
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,350
I Guess You're Right.

144
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,560
Lynette.

145
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,760
The Morgue Is Listed Under Government Offices,Right?

146
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,040
Mrs. Lang?

147
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,180
The Police Are Here.

148
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,730
Oh.

149
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,750
Ma'am.

150
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,280
I'm Detective Berry. This Is Detective Lyons.

151
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,430
Can We Ask You A Few Questions?

152
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,910
Of Course.

153
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,310
When Was The Last Time You Saw Mr. Lang?

154
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,940
I Guess Two Days Ago. Why? What's Wrong?

155
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,690
His Office Has Reported Him Missing. Oh,No. They Did?

156
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,810
And This Morning, The Coast Guard

157
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,970
Found His Empty Boat Floating In The Bay.

158
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,280
Oh,My God. I Hope This Isn't...

159
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,870
Last Time I Saw Him, I To Him I Was Leaving Him.

160
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,810
How Did He React To That News?

161
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,580
Well,He Took It Pretty Hard.

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,970
Oh,You Don't Think He Did Anything Stupid,Do You?

163
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,080
Well,Actually,We Don't.

164
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,190
You Don't?

165
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,190
When We Examined The Boat,

166
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,100
We Didn't Find A Single Fingerprint,

167
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,920
Not Even Mr. Lang's.

168
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,620
Well,That's Weird.

169
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,330
What--What Do You Think That Means?

170
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,150
It Would Indate Somebody Wiped That Boat Down

171
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,530
After Mr. Lang Was... Gone.

172
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,580
Whoever Was On That Boat Is Clearly Not That Bright.

173
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,020
Okay,This Is No Time For Name-Calling. A Man Is Missing.

174
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,250
Well,Don't Worry,Ma'am.

175
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,030
We Got Our Best Men On This Case,'Round The Clock.

176
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,940
We'll Find Out Exactly What Happened To Your Husband.

177
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,690
Great.

178
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,280
Hi.

179
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,010
Hi. I'm Barrett. Is Mike Home? No,He's At Work.

180
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,600
Oh,Shoot. I Needed To Talk To Him.

181
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,430
We're,Uh,Just Doing Some Business Together.

182
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,700
Well,I Don't Know When He's Gonna Be Home,

183
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,030
But You Could Come Back Later Tonight. Oh,I Can't Do That. I Have To Study For An Orgo Test.

184
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,140
Orgo? Organic Chemistry. I'm Pre-Med.

185
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,810
Pre-Med?

186
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,590
Really?

187
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,650
Oh,Hello,Dear.

188
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,260
Andrew,Get Orson's Plate From The Oven.

189
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,780
Ask Me How My Morning Was.

190
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,970
All Right. How Was It?

191
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,010
After Two Nights

192
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Of Sleepless Bonding With My Son,

193
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,240
I Nearly Dozed Off

194
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,810
While Repairing Mrs. Colby's Cracked Molar.

195
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,040
I Doubt If The Crown I Put In Will Last Her A Year.

196
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,740
So You'll Replace It For Free.

197
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,320
That's Not The Point.

198
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,060
How Is A Dentist Supposed To Feel

199
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,620
When He Can't Give A 90-Year-Old A Lifetime Guarantee?

200
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,380
Bree,I'm Sorry,But This Whole Family Bed Thing Has To Stop.

201
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,840
Oh,Give It Some Time. We're Still Adjusting,

202
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,780
And Benjamin Is Sleeping So Soundly.

203
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,450
Well,He Can Sleep Just As Soundly In A Crib.

204
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,490
From What You've Told Me,

205
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,210
You And Rex Didn't Haul Andrew Into Bed With You. No,And I Wish We Had.

206
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,440
If We Did,He Mightn't Have Turned Out So...

207
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,760
So What?

208
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,100
Stupid? Lazy? Short?

209
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,340
I Was Going To Say Angry,

210
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,190
And Perhaps That Anger Began

211
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,430
When We Exiled You To The Nursery.

212
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,230
I'm Just Trying To Learn From My Mistakes.

213
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,160
So I'm--I'm What, Like The First Pancake?

214
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,650
Don't Be So Sensitive.

215
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,110
We'll Find Something To Help You Sleep--Maybe Some Warm Milk.

216
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,710
I Know Something That Used To Help Me Sleep.

217
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,580
Of Course,That's Off The Menu These Days. Could The Mistake Have The Salt?

218
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,440
D If You're As Tired As You Say You Are,

219
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,220
Then You're Bound To Sleep Better Tonight.

220
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,120
Yes,I Will,Because I'll Be Sleeping In The Den. You're Leaving Our Bed?

221
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,270
Darling,I Need To Either Sleep Or Get Lucky Tonight.

222
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,820
I'll Have A Better Shot At Both If I'm Alone.

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,830
Gosh,You're Studying To Be A Doctor.

224
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,390
That Must Not Leave You A Lot Of Free Time For Hobbies

225
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,470
Or... A Girlfriend.

226
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,530
Well,I Have The Time. I Just Don't Have The Girlfriend.

227
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,310
Oh. Well,No Rush.

228
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,710
You Know,Just Yesterday,I Was Telling My Daughter Julie--

229
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,560
Oh,You Know, That Is So Rude.

230
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,360
I-I'm Talking About  Daughter,

231
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,190
And You Don't Even Know What She Looks Like.

232
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,800
That's Her.

233
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,250
She's Cute.

234
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,460
Oh,Barrett,I Wasn't Fishing For Compliments.

235
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,150
If I <I>Was...

236
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,410
I Would've Shown You This One.

237
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,090
Wow.

238
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,360
Oh,Excuse Me. I'm Sorry. I Gotta Take This.

239
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,410
Oh,Sure. I Have To Check On The Laundry.

240
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,690
Yeah?

241
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,210
(Lowers Voice) No,Bonehead, I Don't Sell That Stuff.

242
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,180
Just Pills,Smokes And 'Shroomage. That's It.

243
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,900
20 Bucks,Cash Only. Meet Y At The Dorm. (Beep)

244
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,240
Look What I Found On The Dryer.

245
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,840
Julie Won Second Place In The State Science Fair.

246
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,730
That's Awesome.

247
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,600
Yeah, Good-Looking <I>And Smart.

248
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,430
Only Problem Is,

249
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,760
Where Is She Gna Find Someone Else Like That?

250
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,150
Well,I Gotta Get Going. My Study Partner's

251
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,730
Giving Me A Hard Te About That Test,So...

252
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,030
Oh,That's Okay. You Know, Why Don't You Come Back Tomorrow

253
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,710
To See Me,And If Julie Happens To Be Here,

254
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,350
Maybe You Can Give Her Some Advice

255
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,770
On Picking Out Colleges And Stuff.

256
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,730
Yeah,Sounds Great. See You Tomorrow,Mrs. Delfino. Oh,Please,Call Me "Mom."

257
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,490
Uh,Because...

258
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,370
That's What All The Kids Call Me.

259
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,760
Oh,Thank You.

260
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,460
Hey,Bree. (Chuckles) Table For,Uh,One And A Half?

261
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,640
No,Thanks. I'm Just Dropping Off Andrew's Cell Phone.

262
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,320
He Forgot It Again. Okay. I'll Give It To Him.

263
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,980
Um,Tom, May I Ask You Something? Mm-Hmm.

264
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,970
Did You And Lynette Do The Family Bed

265
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,750
When Your Children Were Babies? Well,It Wasn't Exactly A Choice.

266
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,750
They Just Kept Crawling In There. (Chuckles)

267
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,530
So,Um,Not To Pry, But,Um,

268
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,450
Did That Create Any, Uh,Issues For You?

269
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,070
You Mean Sex? (Chuckles Nervously) Apparently, "Not To Pry" Wasn't Necessary.

270
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,410
Well,It Did Put A Crimp On Things At First,

271
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,240
But That Just Forced Us To Be More Creative.

272
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,270
Oh. Again,Not To Pry, But--

273
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,350
The Office. (Gasps)

274
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,010
We Did It At The Office, Once In The Car,

275
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,810
And You Remember When Youasked Us To Wa

276
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,520
When You Guys Were Going Out Of Town?

277
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,590
Okay. Thanks. Yes,Um,We'll Be Going W.

278
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,110
Hey,Other Than Your Issue, How Does Orson Like Being A Dad?

279
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,750
Oh,He Just Adores It.

280
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,760
The Three Of Us Are Such A Happy Little Family.

281
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,980
Aren't We? Mm. That Is Great.

282
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,340
-Bye. -Bye

283
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,900
????

284
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,200
(Groans) Shouldn Leak Anymore.

285
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,130
Great. (Doorbell Rings)

286
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,680
Why Don't You Grab Us A Couple Beers?

287
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,250
Sylvia. What Are You Doing Here?

288
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Beautiful House.

289
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,870
Look,You Need To Leave.

290
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,430
I Don't Want Katherine Finding You Here.

291
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,510
Oh,But Katherine's Gone.

292
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,540
I Waited Until She Drove Away So We Could Be Alone.

293
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,250
Aren't You Gonna Invite Me In?

294
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,150
After You Ruined My Life? I Don't Think So.

295
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,410
You Ruined Your Own Life.

296
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,620
You Should Have Told The Truth About Us.

297
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,660
Sylvia,Why Don't You Do Us Both A Favor

298
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,390
And Go Back To Chicago?

299
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,770
Adam,Let Me In.

300
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,610
Hey,Man. Your,Uh, Your Beer's Getting Warm.

301
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,180
Oh,You Have Guests.

302
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,870
Well,

303
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,300
I Guess I'll Just Drop By Some Other Time.

304
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm Sorry,Man. It Just Sounded Like You Needed A Little Help.

305
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,870
Thanks. That's,Um, A-An Ex-Patient... Oh.

306
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,970
With Some Pretty Serious Mental Problems.

307
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,390
Uh,Could You Do Me A Big Favor?

308
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,680
I'd Rather Katherine Didn't Know She Was Here.

309
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,450
Oh. Oh,Yeah.

310
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,690
Yeah,That's No Problem.

311
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,160
You Know,Actually,I Was Gonna Ask You A Favor,Too.

312
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,170
I've Got This Pain In My Shoulder.

313
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,350
You--You Think You Could Write Me A Prescription?

314
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,020
Oh,I Wish I Could Help You Out,

315
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,030
But A Gynecologist Writing A Prescription For A Man?

316
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,740
It Kind Of Raises A Red Flag.

317
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,180
Yeah.

318
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,210
Ah,Don't Worry About It.

319
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,370
This Favor Thing

320
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,980
Doesn't Have To Go Both Ways.

321
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,960
Linda,Is Mrs. Zimmerman Here?

322
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,610
Hello,Doctor.

323
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,850
Bree. What A Wonderful Surprise.

324
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,010
Uh,I've Got A New Patient Coming In.

325
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,310
Mmm,Yes,You Do.

326
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,370
I'm Mrs. Zimmerman.

327
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,770
Uh,Your Message Said You Had A Cavity That Needed Filling?

328
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:27,840
I Was In A Very Naughty Mood When I Left That.

329
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,570
You're Waiting Outside. Why Are You Waiting Outside?

330
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,370
Everything Is Fine. It's Just,Um,Someone's Here.

331
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,770
Oh,My God. It's The Police?

332
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,710
No,No. No,Nothing Like That.

333
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,280
It's Your Stepfather.

334
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,480
Glen?

335
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,750
I Don't Believe It.

336
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,750
Lynnie.

337
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,660
Oh,It's Been A Long Time.

338
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,490
Oh,God. Only Three Decades Give Or Take A Year,

339
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,520
But Who Cares? (Chuckles)

340
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,280
Oh,Gosh. You Look Great.

341
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,020
Oh,So Do You,Although What--What--What's This?

342
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,140
Oh,Just A Little Cancer.

343
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,190
No,But I Kicked Its Ass. I'm Good Now.

344
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:29,880
Oh.

345
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,940
Oh.

346
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,930
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi!

347
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,090
You Come Here. Oh!

348
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,440
So Why--Why Are You Here?

349
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,840
Well...

350
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,530
Your Mother Called Me.

351
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,210
She Did? Is She Okay?

352
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,080
Uh,She Sounds Fine. She Asked For Money.

353
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,210
I Didn't Know You Guys Had Kept In Touch.

354
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,990
Well,We Hadn't. I'm Meeting Her Tomorrow

355
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,380
At Fairview Park To Give It To Her,

356
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,710
And I'm Guessing You'll Want To Come With Me.

357
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,240
Yes,Yes,Thank You, But Where Has She Been Staying?

358
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,690
She Broke Into A Car And Spent The Night There.

359
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,330
Oh,My God.

360
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,660
But She Did Say It Was A Cadillac.

361
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,900
Oh,Well,Good. At Least She's Not Living Like A Hobo.

362
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,820
Oh,My God. I'm So Glad To See You Again.

363
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,720
Oh,You,Too,Lynnie.

364
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,760
Mm.

365
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,360
Hey,Bree.

366
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,850
Oh. (Chuckles) Hello,Adam.

367
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,820
I Just Dropped By To See Your Husband. Is He Here?

368
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,240
He's In The Exam Room, Readjusting The Chair.

369
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,330
Look,I'm Sorry Mike Is In Such Pain,

370
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,480
But It's Not Really Ethical

371
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,700
For Me To Write Him A Prescription.

372
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,270
Know It's A Little Dicey,

373
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,790
But You'd Really Be Doing Me A Big Favor.

374
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,330
By The Way,Bree Looks Great.

375
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,390
I Haven't Seen Her Since I Delivered Danielle's Baby.

376
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,240
Sorry. Your Baby.

377
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,430
Hey,Andrew.

378
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,210
What Are You Doing?

379
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,540
Just Giving You That Sewing Room You Always Wand.

380
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,090
You're Moving Out?

381
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,280
But You Can't Afford An Apartment.

382
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,620
I Can Afford This One,

383
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,770
Which Will Give You Some Idea How Crappy The Neighborhood Is.

384
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm Sorry. I Don't--I Don't Understand.

385
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,700
Why Are You Ing This?

386
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,140
I'm Doing This For You. How Are You Gonna Get A Fresh Start

387
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,490
With Your Past Mistakes Stinking Up The Place?

388
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,870
Is This About The Other Morning?

389
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,940
Oh,For Heaven Sakes, You Can't Be Serious.

390
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,350
I Am. In Fact,I Already Gave The Landlord A Check.

391
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,220
So I Hope The Three Of You Are Very Happy.

392
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,810
Well,To Be Honest,

393
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,280
I'm Not Entirely Comfortable Giving This To You,Mike.

394
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,320
Pain Medication Only Helps Your Symptoms.

395
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,930
If This Is Chronic,You Need To Be Seeing A Physical Therapist.

396
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,050
You Know What I Need,Orson? I Need To Take A Few Weeks Off,

397
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,660
But I Can't, 'Cause I've Got To Work...

398
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,750
For The Baby, For Julie's Class Trip,

399
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,020
The Patio Furniture

400
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,940
And Everything Else Susan's Got Me Paying For.

401
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,800
Are You Okay,Mike? You Sound A Little Unhappy.

402
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,810
(Sighs) No,No,I'm Happy,

403
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,520
And I Don't Mean To Put All Of This On Susan.

404
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,710
It's Just,When I Signed Up For This Suburn Dad Thing,

405
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,830
I Didn't Exactly Know What I Was Getting Myself Into.

406
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,280
No,I Understand.

407
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,050
Still,This Is No Way To Deal With Stress.

408
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,150
It's Not About Stress.

409
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,440
It's About The Pain I've Been In Every Day

410
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,070
Since I Got Hit By That Car.

411
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,950
You Mean This Pain Is Related To Your Accident?

412
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,880
It Wasn't An Accident.

413
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,150
Some Son Of A Bitch Ran Me Down And Took Off.

414
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,010
Right.

415
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,450
Well,I Hope This Helps.

416
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,490
Mm.

417
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,190
Oh,Mike,You're Home.

418
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,910
I Was Dreaming We Were Ponies.

419
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,140
That's Nice. Go Back To Sleep.

420
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,470
Hey,That Kid,Um,Barrett Me By Today.

421
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,750
What?

422
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,830
Yeah,He Said That You Owed Him Money For Some...

423
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,180
Plumbing Job That He Helped You On.

424
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,970
Yeah. Yeah, I Gotta Get That To Him.

425
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,310
Oh.

426
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,340
He's Coming Back Tomorrow.

427
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,390
(Water Running) Don't You Think He Would Be Perfect For Julie?

428
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,660
Barrett,It's Delfino.

429
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,180
I'm Only Gonna Say This Once. I'll Get You Your Money,

430
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,080
But Don't <I>Ever Come To My House Again.

431
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,510
You Got It?

432
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,230
<I>Ever.

433
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,160
Yes,Hello.

434
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,770
I'd,Uh,Like To Leave An Anonymous Tip

435
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,590
About Something Important.

436
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,920
Uh,Do You Have Some Kind Of Voice Mail Menu For That?

437
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,300
Well,It's About The Mayor.

438
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,040
Oh,I Don't Think He's Missing.

439
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,150
I Think He's Dead.

440
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,250
Look,That's It. We Gotta Go Tos.

441
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,560
Carlos,Please.

442
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,650
Look,We Blew It With The Fingerprints,All Right?

443
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,760
Now They Know Someone Else Was With Him On The Boat.

444
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,050
They Don't Know That Someone Else Was Us. It's Just A Matter Of Time.

445
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,890
I Mean,Make A List Of People With A Motive To Kill Victor.

446
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,120
Number One--You. Number Two--You.

447
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,210
Number Three--Maybe Me, Probably Still You.

448
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,250
Okay,If We Just Stay Calm And Stick To The Story...

449
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,350
We Tried That.

450
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,310
It's Not Working.

451
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,170
I'm Going To The Cops.

452
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,870
Now You Can Either Come With Me

453
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,800
Or Wait For Them To Come And Get You.

454
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,920
Fine. I'll Go.

455
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,570
Thank You.

456
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,170
Can We At Least Have A Drink Before We Go? Calm Our Nerves?

457
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,360
I Mean,You Can't Talk To The Cops

458
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,750
The Way You've Been Babbling To Me.

459
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,910
(Sighs) I Guess One Drink Wouldn't Hurt.

460
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,810
(Raises Voice) You Okay With Tequila?

461
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,110
Only If It's The Good Stuff!

462
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,560
Oh,I Think You'll Find This Has A Real Kick.

463
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,730
Oh,And This Is The Worst. During A Dissection,

464
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,520
My Anatomy Lab Partner Squirted Stomach Juice In My Eye.

465
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,830
Ew. That Is So Disgusting. Oh,It Was Terrible.

466
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,510
(Laughs) So Gross. Ew.

467
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,290
Hey. What Are You Smiling About?

468
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,120
My Matchmaking Skills.

469
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,700
Julie And Barrett Are Really Hitting It F.

470
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,600
Barrett?

471
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,340
Yeah,Your Friend.

472
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,260
I Told You Last Night He Was Coming By Again.

473
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,760
I Appreciate All The Pressure You're Putting On Me. You're Welcome.

474
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,530
Uh,Julie, Could You Give Us A Minute?

475
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,900
Barrett And I Have A Little Business To Discuss.

476
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,100
Sure. I'll Just Grab My Jacket.

477
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,750
I Thought I Told You To Stay Away From My House.

478
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,780
But Your Wife Invited Me.

479
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,790
And,Hey,You Married Into A Cute Family. Kudos.

480
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,730
Here's Your Money. Now Get Out.

481
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,760
We Were Just Leaving. I'm Taking Julie On A Tour Of My Campus.

482
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,890
There Is No Way I'm Letting Her Go Anywhere

483
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,740
With A Lowlife Drug Dealer.

484
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,600
Lowlife? Dude,I'm A Pre-Med Student Who's Found

485
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,560
An Enterprising Way To Earn His Way Through College.

486
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,640
You,On The Other Hand, Are A Junkie,

487
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,840
And I Don't Think You Want Your Cute Family Knowing That,

488
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,130
Do Ya?

489
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,550
I'll Have Her Home By 10:00.

490
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,390
Mmm. This Is Delicious, Mrs. Delfino.

491
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,100
Thank You. Hey,You Know, Would You Like Me

492
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,630
To Pack Some Up For You Guys To Take?

493
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,700
This Guy's A Drug Dealer.

494
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,620
What?

495
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,820
You Remember Those Pills You Found? He Sold Them To Me.

496
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,910
Look,Mrs. Delfino--

497
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,550
Get Out Of My House.

498
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,750
Get Him Out Of My House!

499
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,760
Okay. I'll Go.

500
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,950
It's A Shame,Though.

501
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,990
He Was Such A Good Customer.

502
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,760
Hey.

503
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,360
Where'd Barrett Go?

504
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,060
Why Am I So Sleepy All Of A Sudden?

505
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,720
Oh,I Don't Know,

506
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,700
But If You're Not Feeling Well, Maybe We Should Put This Off.

507
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,200
No,No,No. We Gotta Go Now.

508
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,900
Crap! What?

509
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,490
Ow. Oh!

510
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,800
Detectives!

511
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,940
Any,Uh,News On My Husband?

512
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,700
Not Yet,But We've Got Some More Questions For You.

513
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,820
Oh,Okay. So Ask Away.

514
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,080
Mrs. Lang,Were You Having An Affair With Your Ex-Husband?

515
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,430
Carlos?

516
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,700
That's Crazy. Where'd You Hear That?

517
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,780
Your Neighbor Called Us.

518
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,070
Oh. Well,You Tell Edie Britt Just Because Carlos Dumped Her,

519
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,520
Doesn't Mean She Has To Go Around Trashing My Reputatn,

520
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,830
Especially When <I>She's The Slut.

521
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,690
Well, Have You Seen Him Lately?

522
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,570
Boy,Let Me Think. Uh...

523
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,000
Mm...

524
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,800
No. No,I Haven't.

525
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,040
This Is Lyons.

526
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,360
We're On Our Way.

527
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,480
Good News,Mrs. Lang. They Found Your Husband.

528
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,330
Huh?

529
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,890
A Couple Of Fishermen Found Him Washed Up On The Beach.

530
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,380
He's Unconscious But In Stable Condition.

531
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,630
Would You Like To Go To The Hospital?

532
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,470
Well,Why Wouldn't I?

533
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,310
Just Let Me Grab My Purse.

534
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,180
Well,You Can Stop Feeling Guilty.

535
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,000
Victor's Alive, And We're Screwed.

536
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,040
Okay,What's The Plan?

537
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,290
Once She Shows Up,You'll Meet Her And Give Her The Money.

538
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,820
Then Ask Her To Walk You Back To The Car.

539
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,500
I'll Jump Out,Grab Her, And While You Open The Trunk... Lynette.

540
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,350
Fine,The Backseat,But You're Just Gonna Spoil Her.

541
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,170
I See You Still Have That Wicked Sense Of Humor.

542
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,620
Yeah. It's The One Good Thing You Get From A Crappy Childhood.

543
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,810
You Know,I...

544
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,030
I Always Regretted The Way Things Ended.

545
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,420
Why? Mom Cheated On You. No One Blames You For Leaving.

546
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,060
It Was,Uh, More Complicated Than That.

547
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,210
Hey,I'm Not Complaining.

548
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,110
Well--

549
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,980
Ah,There's Booze-Illa Now.

550
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,230
All Right, I'll Go Get Her. (Door Beeps)

551
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,620
He Bought Those Pills A Long Time Ago

552
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,870
And Never Got Around To Paying The Guy.

553
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,350
(Scoffs) Wow.

554
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,590
Julie,It's Not Like It Was Heroin Or Crack.

555
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,920
It Was Just Pain Pills For His Shoulder,

556
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,120
But We Had A Talk,And He Has Totally Stopped Taking Them.

557
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,680
Are You Absolutely Sure?

558
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,760
Yeah.

559
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,110
Why?

560
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,770
Well,I Was At The Drugstore This Morning,

561
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,240
And I Saw Mike There, Picking Up A Prescription.

562
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,950
Hello,Stella.

563
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,880
Glen. What The Hell?

564
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,740
I Know We're The Same Age.

565
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,720
How Is It You Look So Much Better Than Me?

566
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,830
Well,I Don't Drink Or Sleep In Cars

567
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,200
Oh,So That's Your Secret. Who Knew?

568
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,700
Stell,Here's The Money.

569
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,560
Thanks,Doll.

570
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,650
You Are A Beautiful, Beautiful Human Being.

571
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,690
You Son Of A Bitch. You Set Me Up.

572
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,510
Lynette!

573
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,340
Oh,Crap!

574
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,590
Now Where Do You Think You're Going?

575
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,090
I'm Off To Die In A Ditch. What Do You Care?

576
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,360
Okay,Ough With The Drama. I  H Youwicomeome Th Me.

577
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,710
Oh,Really? That's Not What You Said To Lydia And Lucy.

578
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,880
I Am Sorry About That,Mom. We Were Just Venting.

579
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,630
People Who Love You Need To Do That.

580
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,260
I Was Not A Horrible Mother,

581
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,730
And Even If I Was,

582
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,050
It's Old News, So Drop It.

583
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,790
Drop It?

584
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,160
Do You Hear That? She Wants Me To Drop It.

585
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,730
And When She Cheated On You, And When She Wrecked Our Family,

586
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,540
I Bet She Wanted You To Drop That,Too. Okay,Guys--

587
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,620
What's Done Is Done, And If You Can't Get Over It,

588
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,390
There's Nothing I Can Say That'll Make You Stop Hating Me.

589
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,960
There Is One Thing You Could Say. You Keep Your Mouth Shut.

590
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,620
Stella,She's A Grown Woman. She Can Handle It.

591
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,980
Handle What?

592
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,070
Glen,Don't.

593
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,430
Lynnie...

594
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,620
I Didn't Leave Your Mother Because She Cheated On Me.

595
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,350
I Left Because I'm Gay.

596
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,450
(Siren Wailing In Distance) Mom. You Okay?

597
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,030
Just A Bit Dizzy From Holding My Breath In Your Stairwell.

598
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,630
May I Come In?

599
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,220
Oh,I'd--I'd Kind Of Rather You Not See The Place

600
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,540
Until I Get It Fixed Up.

601
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,640
Well,I Guess I'll Just Have To Take My Veal Scaloppini

602
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,150
And Go Home.

603
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,550
Mmm.

604
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,960
(Mouth Full) I've Been So Busy With Moving,I Forgot To Eat.

605
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,040
This Is Really Good,Mom.

606
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,630
Thank You. You Know, I'd Make It For Yoevery Day

607
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,460
If You'd Move Back Home.

608
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,920
Mom,This... This Is My Home.

609
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,910
Seriously,Andrew, You Don't Even Have A Bed.

610
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,760
Actually,You're Sitting On It. It's A Foldout.

611
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,220
Oh,Dear God. At Least Let Me Buy You Some Decent Furniture.

612
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,900
Absolutely Not. Mom,I'm-- I'm Gonna Do This On My Own.

613
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,340
(Sighs) Andrew,I Understand

614
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,490
You're Angry With Me About What I Said,But...

615
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,600
I Do Have A Good Reason

616
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,510
For Wanting To Raise Benjamin Differently.

617
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:21,110
I Mean,Let's Be Honest. You Put Me Through Hell.

618
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,330
You're Right. I-I Know I Did,

619
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,680
But That's Why I'm Mad.

620
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,680
Because I-I Changed, And You Never Noticed.

621
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,450
You Know, I-I Got A Job,A Car,

622
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,700
My Own Health Insurance.

623
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,810
I'-- I've Turned Things Around.

624
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,490
Well,I Know That.

625
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,430
Then Why Haven't You Said Anything?

626
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,220
It's Because You've Been So Focused

627
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,100
On Your New Husband And Baby.

628
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,160
Oh,Andrew.

629
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:52,410
Mom,It's Okay. You Know, You've Got A New Life,

630
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,210
????

631
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,690
I Just Don't Want Us To Part On Bad Terms Again,

632
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,190
Like We Did Two Years Ago.

633
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,450
You Mean When You Left Me On The Side Of That Road?

634
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,250
Look,Mom...

635
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,900
I Was Spinning Out Of Control.

636
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,090
You Forced Me To Grow Up.

637
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,850
If I Haven't Said It Before,

638
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,440
Thank You.

639
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,730
You Forgive Me?

640
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,270
I Forgave You A Long Time Ago.

641
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,780
You Just...

642
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,010
You Just Never Noticed.

643
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,890
Oh,Uh,Mom?

644
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,560
Uh,Would You Mind Using A Coaster?

645
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,640
Okay. Now I...

646
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,280
I Really <I>Am Gonna Cry.

647
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,080
Dave Passed Away Last Spring.

648
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,410
We Were Together Almost 20 Years.

649
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,560
Oh.

650
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,940
He Seems Nice.

651
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,630
I Know It's A Lot To Deal With.

652
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,080
Kinda.

653
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,150
So,Uh, Coffee's Probably Ready.

654
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,430
Uh,Cream And Sugar?

655
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,930
Shot Of Bourbon?

656
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,740
Why Didn't You Tell Me?

657
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,560
It Wasn't My Proudest Moment, Lynette.

658
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,340
What Are You Talking About?

659
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,900
I Failed As A Woman.

660
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,470
Two Years Being Married To Me, And He Turns Gay.

661
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,710
I Don't Think That's How It Works.

662
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,210
All I Know Is

663
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,030
I Was... So Ashamed.

664
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,840
What Does It Matter Anyway?

665
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,770
It Wouldn't Have Changed Anything Between Us.

666
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,750
Are You Kidding?

667
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,990
It Would've Changed  <I>Everything.

668
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,910
Oh,Y-You Would've Given Me A Pass On My Drinking

669
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,490
And My--My Swearing, My--My Men?

670
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,260
If I Understood <I>Why You Couldn't Stay Married To The Only Father,

671
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,590
The Only Stable Parent I'd Ever Known,

672
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,210
Yeah,I Could've Found A Way

673
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,610
To Forgive You All Sorts Of Things.

674
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,230
We Can Talk About This Later.

675
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,150
Let's Go Home.

676
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,760
I Don't Think So.

677
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,250
Listen To Me.

678
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,570
I Would Be Honored If You Would Come And Live With Us.

679
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,040
Having You Around These Past Few Months Was Sort Of...

680
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,860
Fun.

681
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,680
(Chuckles) It Was <I>Great.

682
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:30,340
We Actually Figured Out A Way To Stop Torturg Each Other.

683
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,250
Then Why Not Come Back?

684
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,380
Because I Don't Want To Screw That Up,

685
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,240
And Let's Face It,Lynette. You Know I Would.

686
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,600
So Why Don't We Just Take Our Chips

687
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,580
And Leave The Table Winners?

688
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,080
But Where Will You Live?

689
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,680
Actually,I Have A Thought.

690
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,300
Uh,Sorry. I Didn't Mean To Eavesdrop,

691
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,980
But,Um...

692
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,250
I Happen To Have

693
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,650
An Immaculately Decorated Guest Room.

694
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,360
You Know, He's Always Talked Like That.

695
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,430
How Did I Not Know You Were Queer?

696
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,130
(Laughs) I'm Sorry. You <I>Want This Around?

697
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,330
Well, We Always Had A Good Time,

698
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,240
And To Tell The Truth,I've Been A Little Lonely Lately.

699
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,010
<I>Oh.

700
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,060
So I Would Be Doing You A Favor.

701
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,650
Hmm.

702
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,410
Fine, But I'm Keeping The Money.

703
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,930
(Laughs) It's A Deal.

704
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,570
Does This Work For You?

705
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,320
It Does.

706
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,670
It Really Does.

707
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,060
Some Stretches,

708
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,770
And The Shoulder Feels Great.

709
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,330
That's A Relief.

710
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,870
You,Uh, Gonna Take A Shower?

711
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,130
Yeah.

712
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,980
I Might,Um,Go Down For A Snack In A Minute.

713
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,560
Okay.

714
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,380
Mrs. Lang?

715
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,000
Uh,I'm Dr. Wheeler, Your Husband's Neurologist.

716
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,800
How Is He? Uh,He's Starting To Wake Up Now.

717
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,580
Would You Like To Talk To Him?

718
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,260
Of Course! I-I Bet He's Pretty Delirious.

719
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,550
I Mean,After His Ordeal, I Wouldn't Be Surprised

720
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,410
If He's Just Babbling Like A Crazy Person!

721
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,380
(Dr. Wheeler) Mr. Lang,Your Wife Is Here.

722
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,260
Gaby. Hi.

723
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,790
Don't Strain Yoursel Victor.

724
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,240
There's Plenty Of Time To Talk Later.

725
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,080
Wh's Important Now Is That You Rest.

726
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,010
Just Stay Quiet And Rest... Quietly.

727
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,850
Mr. Mayor, I'm Detective Berry.

728
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,360
We Need To Ask You A Few Questions.

729
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,230
What Time Did You Take Your Boat Out?

730
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,370
I Was On The Boat?

731
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,470
We Think. We Found It Floating In The Bay,And,Uh,Obviously,

732
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,410
You'd Been In The Water For Quite Some Time.

733
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,980
Uh,The Last Thing I Remember...

734
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,680
Was Friday's Staff Meeting.

735
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,950
Really?

736
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,000
I Mean,What?

737
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,650
Gaby,Do You Remember Anythi About Me Being On The Boat?

738
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:32,930
No.

739
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,310
No.

740
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,440
Sorry.

741
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,430
I Guess I Don't Remember Anything.

742
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,780
Not Uncommon In These Situations.

743
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,400
He's Suffered Both A Mild Concussion

744
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,440
And Hypothermia,

745
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,680
Either Of Which Could Result In Memory Loss.

746
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,250
Well,Who Cares?

747
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,370
The Important Ing Is That He's Safe,

748
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,750
And We're Gonna Nue You Back To Health,

749
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,080
And I Think That Would Happen A Lot Faster

750
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,130
If We All Clear Out.

751
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,470
Thank You.

752
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,550
Gaby,Can You Stay With Me For A Little While?

753
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,530
Of Course.

754
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,640
(Sighs) Sounds Like I Was In Pretty Bad Shape There.

755
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,220
But You're Okay Now. That's The Important Thing.

756
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,110
(Whispers) Come Here.

757
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,560
I Remember Everything.

758
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,560
What?

759
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,640
I Think I <I>Will Rest Now.

760
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,170
I'm Gonna Need All My Strength.

761
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,980
<I>The Past  <I>Is Never Truly Behind Us.

762
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,060
<I>Ghosts Lurk In The Shadows,

763
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,440
<I>Eager To Remind Us  <I>Of The Choices We Made.

764
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,480
<I>But If We Look Back,

765
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,850
<I>We Might Find An Old Friend  <I>With Open Arms...

766
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,960
<I>Or An Old Enemy  <I>With A Hidden Agenda.

767
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,440
<I>Or A Grown-Up Son

768
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,680
<I>With A Forgiving Heart...

769
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,710
<I>Sadly,Some Of Us  <I>Refuse To Look Back,

770
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,190
<I>Never Understanding  <I>That By Denying The Past...

771
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,610
<I>We Are Condemned...

772
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,870
<I>To Repeat It.

773
