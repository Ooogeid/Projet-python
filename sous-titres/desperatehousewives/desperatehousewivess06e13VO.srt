1
00:00:00,416 --> 00:00:02,247
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,507 --> 00:00:05,713
Principal Hobson just called
and Juanita got accepted to Oakridge.

3
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:08,420
- <i>There was acceptance...</i>
- I like the blunt Ana

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,621
- more than the cute Ana.
- So you think I'm cute?

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,289
- <i>A plea...</i>
- Let me help you, or I am...

6
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,344
Or you won't get into heaven?

7
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,848
- <i>A breakdown...</i>
- Did you stab yourself?

8
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:21,766
I have to get to Mike!

9
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:24,762
<i>And a confrontation.</i>

10
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:26,768
I don't know how you feel,

11
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:28,607
because you never talk about it!

12
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:32,446
We lost a kid.
How can saying this out loud be helpful?

13
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:40,478
<i>If you want to throw
a successful dinner party,</i>

14
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:43,484
<i>there are certain rules
that must be followed.</i>

15
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:47,931
<i>If the good silver is used,
it must be polished.</i>

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,801
<i>If music is played,
the volume should be low.</i>

17
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:57,769
<i>If the guests bring wine,
it must be served.</i>

18
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:02,682
<i>And if the evening is
to be truly successful...</i>

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,400
<i>There must be a toast.</i>

20
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:09,240
To Lee. This dinner
has been a total triumph.

21
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:14,194
And it's not over yet.
I made a fruit tart for dessert.

22
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:17,689
And in case any of you are diabetic,
let me just say...

23
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,699
it was nice knowing you.

24
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:23,370
No. Seriously,
this is how we lost his cousin.

25
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:27,003
Bob, where's the whipped cream?

26
00:01:27,636 --> 00:01:30,732
I totally forgot. I was on my phone
and I drove right past the store.

27
00:01:30,902 --> 00:01:32,801
Of course,
'cause it's something that I needed.

28
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:35,489
I was working all day.

29
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,926
If it was that important,
why didn't you just get it?

30
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:39,261
I work, too.

31
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,929
Selling houses is work.

32
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,597
House.

33
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:44,557
He's sold one house in six months.

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,384
Attacking.

35
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:53,024
What's that?

36
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:55,527
My feelings journal.

37
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:00,044
Lee and I are seeing this counselor.

38
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:03,875
She has us write down our negative
feelings to discuss in our sessions.

39
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:08,498
Seems like you got
a lot of feelings there.

40
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:10,270
That's volume three,

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,121
with an entire chapter about me
forgetting to put down the toilet seat.

42
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:17,716
I thought that would be the one
advantage with two guys living together.

43
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:19,067
You'd think.

44
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,057
The good news is
that you're getting help.

45
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:27,851
We should think about that.

46
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:32,147
- What?
- You know, to help us with our stuff.

47
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:34,858
Can we talk about our stuff later?

48
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:37,353
We could, but you won't.

49
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,163
She never wants to talk.

50
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:43,928
You know how I feel about therapy.

51
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,257
It's for weak, indulgent...

52
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:51,791
Straight people.
You guys totally make it work.

53
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:55,712
I used to feel the same way.
But this lady, she's really great.

54
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,171
Volume three?

55
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,156
Can't we give it a try?

56
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:03,360
I don't need someone
telling me how I feel.

57
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,472
So could we just drop it?

58
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:12,373
<i>And the number one rule
for a successful dinner party?</i>

59
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,648
After dessert, let's karaoke!

60
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,786
<i>Keep discussion of your marriage</i>

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,639
<i>to an absolute minimum.</i>

00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,437
<i>Dr. Brent Avedon was
the head of psychology</i>

65
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,831
<i>at the Fairview health center.</i>

66
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:43,943
<i>He spent his days treating
antisocial adolescents,</i>

67
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,522
<i>delusional dowagers...</i>

68
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,940
<i>And bipolar businessmen.</i>

69
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,103
<i>But lately,
his most interesting patient</i>

70
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:58,750
<i>was a housewife</i>

71
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,607
<i>who'd had a nervous breakdown.</i>

72
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:05,917
I was just so lonely.

73
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,371
And then one day,
along came this wonderful man...

74
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:14,225
A man who made me laugh,

75
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,797
who gave me hope again...

76
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:20,328
And who turned out

77
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:23,038
to be in love with someone else.

78
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,809
So I went back to being lonely.

79
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,421
Only it was worse now because...

80
00:04:32,768 --> 00:04:35,576
He wasn't really gone.
He was across the street,

81
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,996
holding her hand,

82
00:04:39,315 --> 00:04:40,608
laughing with her.

83
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,868
So one day...

84
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:48,755
I pretended,

85
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:51,383
just for a second...

86
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:56,987
that it
wasn't her hand he was holding.

87
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:02,585
It was mine.

88
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,511
And that's
how the fantasies started?

89
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:15,316
When I was hurting,
I would let myself imagine

90
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,487
that he was there with me.

91
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,926
But then those moments started to...

92
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:26,441
mean more to me than what was real.

93
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,384
So...

94
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,025
I just let myself have them.

95
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:35,046
I let them take over.

96
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:40,380
What about now? Do you
feel that the medication is helping you?

97
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:49,763
I certainly
have a firmer grasp on reality now.

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,796
I can see things,

99
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,512
for the first time in a long while,

100
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:56,949
very clearly.

101
00:05:58,444 --> 00:05:59,687
That's great.

102
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:03,811
Not really.

103
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:08,292
Because now
I can see what I've done to my life.

104
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,248
And...

105
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,310
How I've ruined it.

106
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:24,796
Orson, it's time for
me to give you your bath.

107
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:26,607
Not now.

108
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,448
You haven't bathed in over a week.

109
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:35,342
I don't want
to do this any more than you do,

110
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:39,130
- but frankly, you're getting ripe.
- I said I don't want a bath.

111
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:43,609
It's not about what you want anymore.
It's a matter of preserving the drapes.

112
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,891
To have another
human being bathe me is humiliating.

113
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:49,988
Here.

114
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:53,157
- What's this?
- A list of things I need at the store.

115
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:56,452
I just went to the store
for you an hour ago. Can't it wait?

116
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:00,370
I need these items immediately.
It's urgent.

117
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:03,918
How are cornnuts urgent?

118
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:07,926
I'm sorry, Bree.

119
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,849
I just thought
that since you played a major part

120
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,596
in putting me in this chair,

121
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,431
you'd want to play a small part
in making my new life tolerable.

122
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:20,727
Give me the list.

123
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,389
Better yet, leave
it on the table and then back away.

124
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,920
Hey, teach.

125
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,959
I just dropped off
Juanita for her first day.

126
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:42,498
She's a little nervous.

127
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:45,016
She's gonna love it here.
The teachers are great.

128
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:47,338
- What animal is she?
- Excuse me?

129
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,948
They test the kids and they place
them in groups according to their level.

130
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:53,644
In math, there's leopards,
chipmunks, giraffes.

131
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,344
It should be in her folder.

132
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,236
She's a leopard.

133
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:03,936
What's M.J.?

134
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,480
He's a giraffe.

135
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,624
So...

136
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,901
Which is the advanced group?

137
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:13,766
No one knows.
They won't even tell me.

138
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:16,154
Principal Hobson feels
that if the parents find out,

139
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:18,993
they'll freak and
get all competitive.

140
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,530
That's crazy.

141
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,167
- Who cares?
- Exactly.

142
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:30,413
Leopards are the morons,
aren't they?

143
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,727
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.

144
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:37,264
When I asked about M.J.,
you were like, "He's a giraffe!"

145
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,389
And I said Juanita was a leopard,
and you were like, "Oh."

146
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,934
You're just jumping to conclusions.

147
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,588
You know something.

148
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:49,732
Spill it!

149
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:54,426
I don't know for sure,

150
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:58,241
But I teach these kids,
and it's pretty obvious.

151
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,778
We were making paper globes

152
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,455
This...
is Rachel Miller.

153
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:06,207
Damn, that's good.

154
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,084
She's a giraffe.

155
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,280
And this is Wendy Benson.

156
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,090
Chipmunk.

157
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:19,556
And this one was
made by Adam Hunter...

158
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,805
A leopard.

159
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:24,684
It looks like an
actual leopard made it.

160
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,897
There's nothing wrong with being
a leopard. They're very important.

161
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:32,959
They move the cafeteria tables,

162
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,046
excellent door holders.

163
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,117
This isn't fair.

164
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:42,556
We have a saying around here.
"It's the pace, not the race."

165
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,887
I know my daughter.
She is all giraffe.

166
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:47,154
I'm gonna go talk to the principal.

167
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,252
You don't push. You...

168
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:57,413
Sorry. My daughter wasn't
here to hold it for me.

169
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:06,820
Dinner's ready. Go wash up.

170
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,936
What is that?

171
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:10,399
It's nothing.

172
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,064
It's personal.

173
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,125
- Personal?
- Yes.

174
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:19,030
And I think it's important that
we respect each other's boundaries.

175
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,632
This morning, you walked in and sat
on the toilet while I shaved my legs.

176
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:24,160
We have no boundaries.

177
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,581
- Attacking.
- What?

178
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,855
You sound just like Bob and...

179
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,717
- Is that a feelings journal?
- If you must know, yes, it is.

180
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:37,673
I started seeing their therapist.

181
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,783
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I wanted to talk to someone,

182
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:44,388
and I didn't need your ridicule.

183
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:47,141
Are you talking about the baby?

184
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:50,307
It started out about that.
But now we're on to,

185
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:51,812
other things.

186
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,398
Other things? You mean like me?

187
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,235
I might've mentioned
you once or twice.

188
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:58,952
Once or twice?

189
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:02,526
I bet if we downed a shot every
time we read the name "Lynette,"

190
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,784
we'd be hammered by page two.

191
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:09,232
- Let me see that.
- No way.

192
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:14,627
But if your're really
interested in what's in here,

193
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,880
you can always join me in therapy.

194
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,840
Like hell.

195
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,105
Fine.

196
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:25,685
Then I guess you'll just
have to wait for the movie.

197
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,391
Here we go.

198
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:38,144
Thanks again for having me.
This all looks delicious.

199
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:41,597
It's your first night over. I wanted to
make you a traditional Italian meal...

200
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,764
Rigatoni with sausage,
chicken parmesan.

201
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,698
Just salad would be great.

202
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,872
Screw the salad.
That came out of a bag.

203
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,288
This rigatoni came from my heart.

204
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,363
To be honest, I don't eat carbs.

205
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:58,296
But you'll make an exception 'cause I've
been sweatin' over the stove all day.

206
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:01,090
Let it go.
She's watching her weight.

207
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,259
Her weight?

208
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,177
If I put the AC on high,
it'll blow her across the room.

209
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:06,906
I just have to be careful.

210
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:09,640
As soon as a graduate,
I'm going to NY to be a model.

211
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,435
No college?

212
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:15,479
Are you kidding?
And miss my prime modeling years?

213
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,413
I think it's great.

214
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:22,991
It takes guts to follow a dream.

215
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:25,781
It's great,

216
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,201
but it'd be nice to have something other
than the porn to fall back on.

217
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:36,375
I'm not saying that's gonna happen.
But a lot of models do end up that way.

218
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:40,588
I know it's risky,
but I'm really passionate about this.

219
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,614
And the best way
to be successful in life

220
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,592
is to do what you're
passionate about.

221
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:48,220
That's why I keep telling
Danny to pursue his poetry.

222
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:51,159
Poetry?

223
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,547
- It's amazing, right?
- I wouldn't know.

224
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:57,388
I'm too busy cooking
food nobody's gonna eat.

225
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,815
Why didn't you ever
show me your poetry?

226
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:03,248
- It's no big deal.
- Danny, it's great.

227
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:07,365
I keep telling him he should come to New
York with me to focus on his writing.

228
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:11,755
A model and a poet.

229
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:15,414
So while you're doin' porn,
he can make the dialogue rhyme.

230
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,012
This is why I don't tell her stuff.

231
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:28,210
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to make a joke.

232
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,013
Let's get back to dinner.

233
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:32,909
No. I'm good.

234
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,954
Carbs.

235
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,839
I'll be out running errands today,

236
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,987
so you'll have to let the physical
therapist in when she arrives.

237
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:50,783
What's wrong?

238
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,660
There's no strawberries.

239
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,818
You know I like strawberries
with my waffles.

240
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:58,451
I am sorry.
They're right here. There you go.

241
00:13:58,621 --> 00:13:59,751
Strawberries.

242
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,229
Enjoy.

243
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:03,379
I need whipped cream.

244
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,924
Unless you think the strawberries
are gonna magically

245
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,010
stick to the waffles by themselves.

246
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,376
Not so fast.

247
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,078
Say "Please."

248
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:38,474
I will not.
Give me my breakfast.

249
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,415
I am happy to do whatever you ask,

250
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:42,401
but I will not treated like a slave.

251
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,086
Now say "Please."

252
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,422
Now that I look at your waffle,
I understand

253
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,160
why you're so eager to have it.

254
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,554
You know the magic word.
It has six letters.

255
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,711
I know one that has three.
If you don't give me that,

256
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:09,320
I'm gonna shove that fork up it.

257
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,536
You can have it when
you're ready to be polite.

258
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:27,282
Mr. Hobson,
my daughter is incredibly bright.

259
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:29,632
I just need to know if
she's in the advanced classes.

260
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:32,718
You know that we have
a policy not to disclose that.

261
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:35,924
You don't have to say anything.
Blink when I mention the smart group.

262
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:38,057
- Leopard.
- Mrs. Solis...

263
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:41,519
Wait, was that a blink or a twitch?
I can't tell. You seem very nervous.

264
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:44,813
See, this is exactly
why we don't tell the parents.

265
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:48,031
They start behaving irrationally.

266
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,070
Stop trying to read things

267
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:53,906
on my desk upside-down.

268
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:57,701
What's the big deal? I just need to know
if my daughter's gonna succeed in life.

269
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:58,911
She's 7.

270
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,678
I suggest that you stop prying

271
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:05,876
and just be proud of her
no matter what group she's in.

272
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:09,473
I am proud of her, and I don't pry.

273
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,616
By the way,
enjoy your colonoscopy on the 16th.

274
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:23,811
Mom. What are you doing here?

275
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,894
I was having a nice get-to-know-you chat
with the principal.

276
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,357
Who are your friends?

277
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:30,954
This is Wendy and Rachel.

278
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,319
We're in math together.

279
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:35,849
Wait a minute.
I think I saw your art projects.

280
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:37,902
Wendy, you're a chipmunk, right?

281
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:40,286
And, Rachel, you're a giraffe?

282
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:46,481
You know what I would love to do?

283
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,882
Is take a picture with Juanita

284
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:50,716
and her friends.

285
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:53,131
And you know what
would be really cute?

286
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:55,498
Is if you hold up
your math homework.

287
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:05,227
Got it.

288
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:06,854
But I wasn't smiling.

289
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,728
It's a tough world out there.
Not much to smile about.

290
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,664
Have a great day!

291
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:15,296
Your mom's weird.

292
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:17,706
You have no idea.

293
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,584
I'm letting myself in.

294
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,197
Time for your therapy.

295
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,082
Help me!

296
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:42,602
Help.

297
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:46,320
Dear lord!

298
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:48,729
What happened?

299
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:50,576
Joyce.

300
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:54,136
I was trying to get those waffles,

301
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,056
And I fell out of my chair.

302
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:58,614
What are they doing up there?

303
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,785
Starving him?
That's ridiculous.

304
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:06,705
Really? So you don't torment
him by putting food out of his reach?

305
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,125
You kinda had to be there for that.

306
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,983
Can someone please
get me a piece of bread?

307
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,464
For god sakes! Stop that!

308
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:18,842
Please hit me in the legs this time.
There's no feeling there.

309
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:22,763
Mrs. Hodge, may I speak
to you privately for a moment?

310
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:34,024
You have to believe me.
I would never hit my husband.

311
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:36,473
I sensed him being
a little dramatic.

312
00:18:36,643 --> 00:18:37,903
But withholding food?

313
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:41,073
The whole thing started because
he refused to say please...

314
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,900
Which I know sounds rather petty,

315
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,226
but you have to understand.
He has been impossible lately.

316
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,011
The man is facing
life in a wheelchair.

317
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:55,337
He's mad at the world, unfortunately,
he's taking it out on you.

318
00:19:00,894 --> 00:19:02,784
I know this is not easy.

319
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,972
But until he comes to accept this,

320
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,683
you're gonna have to figure
out how to be more patient.

321
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,394
And if you can't,

322
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:12,813
it's my obligation to report it.

323
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,400
And give the man a bath.

324
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:22,553
Physical therapy
shouldn't require gloves.

325
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:31,920
You weren't home when they tried
to deliver this, so I signed for it.

326
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:35,377
We saw an ad for...

327
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,547
Honest to god, don't need to know.

328
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:39,681
Good.

329
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,218
Looks like somebody
got a new girlfriend.

330
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:51,337
Not for long.

331
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:53,363
I do not approve.

332
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:57,458
You don't approve, and she's got a body
that would make the pope walk

333
00:19:57,628 --> 00:20:00,110
through a sliding glass door.
Gosh, who's gonna win?

334
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,789
He is my kid.
If I don't think she is good for him,

335
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,740
I will do whatever I have to do.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,743
Which will drive him
towards her and away from you.

337
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,252
I know what it's like when
a mom hates the hottie her son loves.

338
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,667
Bob's mom hated me.

339
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:19,891
- I always thought that Bob was--
- The point is,

340
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:23,382
she overplayed her hand
and made Bob choose between us.

341
00:20:23,552 --> 00:20:26,060
The long story short,
I'm cuddling up with Bob every night.

342
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,856
And where's mama? Nursing home.
How'd she get there? Don't know.

343
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,219
Can't remember.

344
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:32,440
It's just...

345
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,324
I don't know this girl.
I don't know if I can trust her.

346
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:37,166
Then you better get to know her.

347
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,067
I'd hate to see you lose your son
cause you're afraid to share him.

348
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:44,979
Get outta here.

349
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:51,208
Carlos, did you get
the pictures I sent you?

350
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,919
You're as beautiful as the day we met.
Time hasn't touched you at all.

351
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,186
Not of me, of the math homework.

352
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:00,197
- What?
- Here.

353
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:02,719
This assignment looks easy,
doesn't it?

354
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:04,721
Pretty basic, yeah.

355
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,397
And look at this one
with the multiplication,

356
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,352
little more complicated, right?

357
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:11,728
I guess.

358
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:13,777
And this one...

359
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,817
Word problems. Fractions.

360
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,444
- This is the hardest one, isn't it?
- Looks like it. So?

361
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:22,715
This is the leopard's homework.

362
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:25,903
That cleared that up.

363
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,845
No. Don't you get it?
Our daughter is a leopard.

364
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,912
She's in the advanced class.

365
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,873
Good for her.

366
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:34,887
Poor Susan.

367
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:37,605
Yeah? Why?

368
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:40,153
Well, she was convinced
that MJ's brilliant,

369
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,583
and it turns out he's
in the slow group.

370
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:45,542
I'd hate for her to find out.

371
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,591
- Gaby, you are not telling her.
- Why not?

372
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:51,480
She didn't have any trouble telling
me she thought Juanita was one

373
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,597
- thermos short of a lunch box.
- She said that?

374
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:56,334
With her tone.

375
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,361
We've had enough drama with
the neighbors lately, so just drop it.

376
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,823
Fine, I'll drop it.
But just so you know,

377
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,998
I like you better when you're reading
the newspaper pretending to listen.

378
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:10,115
Sure, take whatever you need.

379
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,745
What are you doing here?

380
00:22:24,983 --> 00:22:26,720
I told them I don't
want any visitors.

381
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:29,723
Who says I'm visiting?
Maybe I'm bonkers, too.

382
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,750
Gonna eat the applesauce?

383
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:41,652
Remember when my gout flared
up and I couldn't walk?

384
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,953
And you used to come over to see me?

385
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,283
I figured I owe ya.

386
00:22:48,698 --> 00:22:50,148
Debt paid. Goodbye.

387
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,537
I see you got your
charming personality back.

388
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:57,584
So... when are you gonna
be coming back home?

389
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:01,038
What makes you think
I would ever come back?

390
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:04,305
After what I did to those
people? No. They hate me.

391
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:07,552
Take it from the reigning
odd duck on the Lane,

392
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,915
nobody cares about
all that silly stuff.

393
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:13,505
You're right. Bree and I
can just laugh, laugh, laugh

394
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,019
about silly me nearly
destroying her business.

395
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,854
And I'll tell Susan that I was just

396
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:20,609
joshing about trying to wreck
her marriage.

397
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,777
And I'll bet Mike is still chuckling
about me getting him thrown in jail.

398
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,327
Will you listen?

399
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,853
Kathy, I'm serious.

400
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,910
I'm willing to bet there's more
forgiveness there than you imagine.

401
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,112
- In that case, you know what?
- What?

402
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:38,407
Maybe you are bonkers.

403
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:51,666
Look who's here.

404
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,616
- Hey, Susan. What's up?
- I was going through some of MJ's stuff

405
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:57,983
and I found these math
workbooks from last year.

406
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,240
I thought Juanita
would find them helpful.

407
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,407
Well...

408
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:05,749
Thank you.

409
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,072
No problem. I thought
it might help her catch up.

410
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
Catch up?

411
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,435
You know, from when
she was out of school.

412
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:21,085
She was never out of school,
I was homeschooling her.

413
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:23,712
And I know you did
the best you could.

414
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:26,326
But now she has
professional teachers,

415
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,443
and I bet she's gonna
catch up to MJ in no time.

416
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:34,049
Get her.

417
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,280
By the way, did you hear?

418
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,814
Leopards are the advanced students.

419
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:44,894
What?

420
00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:48,061
It's true. Chipmunks are average.
And giraffes...

421
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:51,239
well, those cafeteria tables
aren't gonna move themselves.

422
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:54,159
How do you know this?

423
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,954
I got a copy of each group's homework.
Trust me. I cracked the code.

424
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:01,126
So that means
that MJ's not in the...

425
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:03,770
But you said it yourself...
it's no big deal.

426
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,712
"It's the pace,
not the race," right?

427
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,423
Right.

428
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:10,305
And please, don't
say anything to anyone.

429
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:12,552
You know how competitive
some parents can get.

430
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:16,614
All too well.

431
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:25,816
I'm finished. Can I have
my milk and cookies now?

432
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,554
Sure, sweetie.

433
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,741
You have some pasta stuck to
the right side of your face.

434
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,371
No, sweetie. Your right.

435
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,004
Never mind.

436
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:47,546
Mike, can you help
me take out the trash?

437
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:48,964
Sure.

438
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,514
Never mind that.

439
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:55,606
Okay, so he's a giraffe.

440
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,959
You know, there's nothing
wrong with being average.

441
00:25:58,126 --> 00:26:00,859
Chipmunks are average.
How many times do I have to tell you?

442
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,075
Leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.

443
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,762
I love him so much, Mike.
What if he's...

444
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:09,943
Slow?

445
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,039
He's not slow.

446
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:16,116
He's a smart, inquisitive,
bright little boy.

447
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:25,292
He's got his hand
stuck in the glass.

448
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,794
Come on, buddy.

449
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,690
Come on.
Just... just hold the glass.

450
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:36,866
Pull with the other hand.

451
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,088
You can do it.

452
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:42,653
Come on, MJ.

453
00:26:48,462 --> 00:26:50,358
See? You were worried about nothing.

454
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,758
You're right.

455
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:57,777
He's heading toward
the toaster with a fork!

456
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:27,604
- I'm heading out.
- Okay. Mwah. Wanna grab lunch today?

457
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,398
Maybe tomorrow. I have a thing.

458
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:34,079
If you mean therapy,
why not just say "therapy"?

459
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,364
I just didn't want to get
into a fight. That's all.

460
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:40,200
Won't you need this?

461
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:42,149
Right. Thanks.

462
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,653
Don't you wanna know if I read it?

463
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,899
I'd know if you read it.

464
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,020
Excuse me. Are you
waiting for dr. Graham?

465
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:13,425
- Don't tell me she double-booked again.
- Oh, no. I don't have an appointment.

466
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:16,486
But I really need to talk to her,
so can I have yours?

467
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:20,257
I don't know. I really
need to talk to her, too.

468
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,847
Seriously? Because I was
looking at you thinking,

469
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:27,122
what is he doing here?
That guy's really got it together.

470
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:30,853
Thanks. But I'm been having
a pretty hard time lately.

471
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,989
- I'll give you 200 bucks.
- Cash?

472
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,626
20's okay?

473
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:41,193
What were you going
to talk to her about?

474
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,888
I'm starting to feel
the urge to gamble again.

475
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:46,366
Thanks.

476
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:52,397
Mr. Jameson?

477
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:57,110
He had to go, but he said I
could have his appointment.

478
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,753
I'm sorry, but it
doesn't work like that.

479
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,090
If you're interested
in becoming a patient...

480
00:29:04,257 --> 00:29:06,703
I'm not. I am Mrs. Tom Scavo.

481
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,832
Yep, that's what I thought.

482
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:16,773
Well, I don't blame you
for reacting like that.

483
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,940
I can only imagine the stories
Tom's been reading to you

484
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:23,123
from his big book of wah!

485
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:26,361
So... here I am,

486
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:30,073
Tom Scavo's bitch of
a wife, in the flesh.

487
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,228
Why do you put it like that?

488
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:35,815
I don't know specifically

489
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,396
what word he uses.
I'm just...

490
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:40,833
picking the one
that seems the most likely.

491
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:44,217
So you think your husband
describes you as a bitch?

492
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:48,787
- Doesn't he?
- What Tom says in this room is private.

493
00:29:49,794 --> 00:29:51,113
Which means yes?

494
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,283
Well, obviously, it does to you.

495
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,679
I'm just wondering
why that might be.

496
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:00,548
Oh, I see what you're trying to do,

497
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,509
but I did not come here for therapy.

498
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,554
I came here to defend myself.
There's two sides to every story.

499
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:08,223
So you're not a bitch?

500
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,563
Not all the time, no.

501
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:13,645
But sometimes?

502
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:16,733
I just...

503
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,778
need...

504
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:21,087
want...

505
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,668
to feel like I'm in control,

506
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:27,413
and when I don't, that makes me mad.

507
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:33,347
Maybe I'm mad a lot
because I don't know if you've noticed,

508
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:36,521
but you can't control
what happens in life.

509
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,850
Like your baby dying?

510
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:52,057
I'm going to sit down, but only...

511
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:54,777
Because I'm tired.

512
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:03,987
Unless you need to go or something.

513
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,137
No. I don't need to go anywhere.

514
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,043
How was your day?

515
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,179
- Is that a...
- Yep.

516
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:25,694
Looks like we'll be
going to therapy together.

517
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:26,843
Really?

518
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:29,588
That is great news.
Thank you.

519
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,477
W... where's dinner?

520
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,941
I mean, you were home all day.

521
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:51,007
- What are you writing?
- You'll find out, Tuesday at 12:30.

522
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:58,750
Colleen! Can I talk to you?

523
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:02,545
Uh, I've got parent-teacher conferences,
but not for a few minutes. What's up?

524
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,473
It's about M.J. How is he
doing in your math class?

525
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,873
Oh, he's such a joy.

526
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,097
You just did the "he's such
a joy" with the head tilt.

527
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,019
I give that one to parents all the time
when I think their kid is driftwood.

528
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,813
No, seriously, M.J.'s doing great.

529
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:23,960
Oh, really? Well, if
he's doing so great...

530
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,985
Why is he a giraffe?

531
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,409
- What?
- He should be a leopard.

532
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:32,607
- They're the advanced students.
- You don't know that.

533
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:35,495
I do now.
Gaby Solis broke the code.

534
00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:37,288
What?

535
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,624
That's right. Giraffes
are the slow learners,

536
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,293
- and you know it.
- Giraffes are the slow learners?

537
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,462
No, no, no, Mrs.
Chapman. No one said that.

538
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:47,646
Why don't you wait
for me in my classroom?

539
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:49,700
Gabrielle Solis figured out the code

540
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,873
leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.

541
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,786
Jenny, we got the code!

542
00:32:54,953 --> 00:32:57,049
Leopards are the smart ones!

543
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:01,668
- Now look at what you've done.
- M.J. is here. He's a leopard.

544
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:03,265
Get used to it.

545
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:10,488
Where have you been?
I needed to close the door.

546
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:15,326
Oh, uh, well, I thought a
little fresh air would be nice.

547
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,703
Hmm, it isn't.

548
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:19,468
Well, as the person
who has to share a house

549
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:22,959
with the person who won't take
a bath, I need the fresh air.

550
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,628
I don't care. Close it.

551
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:31,634
I know that you are angry
at the world right now.

552
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,220
What happened to
you is unimaginable,

553
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,913
and I am gonna do whatever I
can to help you through this.

554
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,340
And all I ask in return is that you
treat me with a little bit of courtesy,

555
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:43,271
and that includes
using the word "please."

556
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,797
Why the sudden interest
in etiquette, Bree?

557
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:49,402
I mean, I don't recall you saying
"please" before you cheated on me.

558
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,656
This conversation is
over. The door stays open.

559
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,618
- I want it closed.
- No. You stink.

560
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:59,162
- And you're a whore!
- Here's the difference...

561
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,950
I can get clean.

562
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,462
Yes, you can.

563
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:18,227
What are you doing?

564
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,473
What is going on?
I'm not even dressed.

565
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,608
What is that? What... what
is that? What's going on?

566
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Bree, stop.

567
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,786
You wouldn't.

568
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,705
Okay, Bree, stop it.

569
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,415
Stop. Bree.

570
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,833
If only there was a word you
could use to get me to stop,

571
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,589
- like "please".
- I'm calling Joyce.

572
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,549
- Say "please"!
- Go to hell!

573
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:57,303
Why can't you just say
it? It's easy. Please.

574
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,445
Please, please! Please stop it!

575
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:09,770
Please roll me over. Please
help me off the toilet.

576
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:11,820
Please, please, please!

577
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:17,408
That's the life I'm facing now,

578
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:19,903
having to ask people
for help for everything.

579
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,911
Do you know how hard that is?!

580
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:25,754
Every morning I wake up at 5:00. You
get upt 6:30. For an hour and a half,

581
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:27,610
I lie, staring
at the bedroom door,

582
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:31,295
fantasizing about how
lovely it would be...

583
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:34,507
how excruciatingly
lovely it would be...

584
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,730
to get up and make myself
a cup of tea one last time.

585
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:41,506
No "please."

586
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:44,599
Just hot water and tea.

587
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:05,196
I'm so sorry.

588
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:10,396
Forgive me.

589
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:15,381
Please.

590
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,588
- What are you in for?
- Eating paste.

591
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,860
- What animal group are you?
- Giraffe.

592
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:38,325
Damn.

593
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,506
Joey Murphy.

594
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,410
I'll be with you two in a moment.

595
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:57,033
Sorry for getting you in trouble.

596
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,327
It's my own fault.

597
00:37:01,298 --> 00:37:02,748
I got carried away.

598
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,481
Me, too.

599
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,239
It was just so important to
me that Juanita was doing well.

600
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,102
I know.

601
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,013
No, I don't think you do.

602
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:17,319
My kids are my calling card.

603
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,397
They're what I have
to show for myself.

604
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:24,243
I don't have a career,
Susan. My kids are my job.

605
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:28,788
And if they succeed or not...
it's because of how I raise them.

606
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,848
Well, at least you get
to raise them.

607
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:34,983
Ever since I took this job,
I feel like I'm never with M.J.

608
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,023
I constantly worry. Am
I there enough for him?

609
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:39,715
Am I letting him down?

610
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,623
You don't have anything
to worry about.

611
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,163
M.J.'s a fantastic kid.

612
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:47,421
Well, so is Juanita.

613
00:37:50,274 --> 00:37:52,550
Their moms are competitive nuts.

614
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,817
This has been so ridiculous.

615
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,651
Leopards and giraffes and chipmunks
I mean, who created this crazy system?

616
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,829
You know, reading class is just as bad.
There's otters, penguins and seals.

617
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,576
Yeah, Juanita's an otter.

618
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:07,439
I mean, what does an otter have
to do with learning how to read?

619
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:12,248
Juanita's an otter?

620
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,879
- Why? What's M.J.?
- Penguin.

621
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:35,605
This is pretty. What do you think?

622
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,452
I think maybe I'd buy
it for my grandma...

623
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:39,989
If I hated her.

624
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:43,443
You're so funny.

625
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,980
So... as much fun as
we're having here,

626
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:51,203
- why are we doing this?
- We are getting to know each other.

627
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:55,499
You know me, and you don't like me.

628
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,651
It's not that I don't like you.

629
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:04,346
It's just, I don't think
you're good for Danny.

630
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:06,713
Why? Because I wouldn't
eat your pasta?

631
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:08,012
Rigatoni.

632
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:10,846
And no.

633
00:39:11,352 --> 00:39:14,613
It's because you are a
good-time girl out to have fun.

634
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:18,471
I don't blame you. You're young,
beautiful. You're supposed to have fun.

635
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,023
But Danny has been through a lot,

636
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,486
and he needs someone who
is not gonna hurt him.

637
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:26,546
I know Danny has been
through rough stuff.

638
00:39:27,557 --> 00:39:30,866
When he lashes out
and gets all defensive,

639
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,793
trying to protect himself?

640
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,060
I get it,

641
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:35,873
because I used to do it, too.

642
00:39:39,605 --> 00:39:41,611
It's the thing that
made me like him.

643
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:44,065
I know how he feels,

644
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,059
and it's not fun at all.

645
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,670
I don't care if you like me

646
00:39:51,837 --> 00:39:54,306
and I don't care if
you hate how I dress,

647
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:56,972
but I am not gona hurt Danny.

648
00:39:58,035 --> 00:39:59,731
How can I be sure of that?

649
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:01,565
You can't.

650
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:04,647
But it doesn't matter, 'cause...

651
00:40:04,814 --> 00:40:06,464
I'm not going anywhere.

652
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:18,218
What are you doing back here?

653
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:20,810
I've been thinking about
what you said last time.

654
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:23,921
The more I thought about it,
the more it pissed me off.

655
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:25,881
Why is that?

656
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,223
The people on that street have
been your friends for years.

657
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:31,593
You really think we
would dump your ass

658
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,473
just 'cause you went off
the deep end for some months?

659
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:38,635
I appreciate you coming here.

660
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:39,802
I do.

661
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:41,865
But after everything I did,

662
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:44,146
I don't see how anyone
could forgive me.

663
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:46,370
Well, we're not
saying it'll be easy.

664
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,040
But we'll give it a try.

665
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,013
I told them how much
better you were doing,

666
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,046
but they couldn't
take my word for it,

667
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,090
so they had to see for themselves.

668
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:49,666
<i>In our darkest moments,</i>

669
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:52,495
<i>we all need someone who will listen.</i>

670
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:56,180
<i>Some turn to friendly professionals.</i>

671
00:41:57,312 --> 00:42:00,756
<i>A few rely on those
who are older and wiser.</i>

672
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:04,096
<i>Others seek out</i>

673
00:42:04,263 --> 00:42:07,219
<i>someone who knows what
they're going through.</i>

674
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:12,197
<i>But for most of us,</i>

675
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,118
<i>nothing is quite so therapeutic</i>

676
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,239
<i>as a good long talk</i>

677
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:20,063
<i>with a few old friends.</i>
