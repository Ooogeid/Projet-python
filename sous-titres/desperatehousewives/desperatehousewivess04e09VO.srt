1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,800
 <I>Previously On...</I>

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,100
 <I>Mrs. Mccluskey</I>
 <I>Had Reached Her Limit.</I>

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,300
Five Kids Are Tough Enough,
But Your Husband Makes Six,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,700
And That's Where
I Draw The Line.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,000
 <I>An Old Friend Paid Adam</I>
 <I>A Visit.</I>

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,800
Sylvia.
Aren't You Gonna
Invite Me In?

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,800
After You Ruined My Life?
I Don't Think So.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
You Should've Told The Truth
About Us.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,300
 <I>Mike Got Help...</I>

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,400
 <I>From An Unexpected Source.</I>

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,300
(Gaby) Victor!
 <I>Victorashed Out...</I>

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,500
Come On! Get Up!
(Grunts)

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,900
 <I>And Carlos And Gaby...</I>
We Need To Ask You
A Few Questions.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,100
Sorry. I Guess
I Don't Remember Anything.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
 <I>Finally Met Their Match.</I>

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,100
I Remember Everything.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,900
 <I>(Mary Alice) It Was Supposed</I>
 <I>To Be A Beautiful Day.</I>

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,900
 <I>Kids Should Have Been</I>
 <I>Playing In The Park.</I>

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,200
 <I>Husbands Should Have Been</I>
 <I>Doing Their Chores.</I>

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,600
 <I>Women Should Have Been</I>
 <I>Tending Their Flowers.</I>

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 <I>But At 2:26 That Afternoon,</I>

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,300
 <I>A Tornado Came</I>
 <I>To Wisteria Lane...</I>

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,900
 <I>Bringing With It...</I>

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,800
 <I>Unbelievable...</I>

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,900
 <I>Destruction.</I>

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,700
 <I>No One Could Have</I>
 <I>Anticipated It...</I>

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,700
 <I>Especial</I>
 <I>Given How The Day Started.</I>

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,400
Sorry.
Can You Say That Again?

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I Don't Think
I Heard You Right.
Carlos And I Are Back Together.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Gaby,
You Just Got Married.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,200
And Some Of Us Gave You
Very Expensive Wedding Gifts.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,500
Uh, You Want
The Fondue Set Back? Fine.

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,700
But Don't Act Like
It Cost A Bundle,

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,200
'Cause It Clearly Didn't.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,300
I Got You The Fondue Set.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,700
Oh. Right. It's Nice.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,700
Oh, My God.
This Is Gonna Kill Edie.

38
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,400
You Would Think So,
But No Such Luck.

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
That Vindicte Hag
Told Victor Everything.
Victor Knows?

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,900
Yeah, And Seeing How He's
The Rich Mayor Of A Small Town

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
With Various Thugs And Cops
At His Dposal,

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,600
Carlos And I
Thought It Would Be Safer

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,300
If We Got
The Heck Out Of Dodge.

44
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,900
You're Leaving Fairview?

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah. This Afternoon.

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
No.

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,300
You Can't Be Serious.

48
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,600
Look, We'll Be Back...
Someday.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,100
We Just Have To Wait
Till This All Blows Over.

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,600
I Can't Believe This.

51
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,700
I Know. This Is...
A Lousy Way To Say Good-Bye.

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,900
And I'm Sorry,
But I Don't Have A Choice.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,600
Do You Guys Have Any Idea
How Much I'm Gonna Miss You?

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,900
Hey, You Heard The News?

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
A Tornado Just Hit
Mount Pleasant,

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
And They Think
We Could Get One, Too.

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Y'all Better Head Inside
And Start Getting Ready.

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,000
Um, Go. You Guys Go.

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,400
Yeah, And--And We Don't Need
To Say Good-Bye Anyway,

60
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,200
'Cause We're Gonna
See You Real Soon.

61
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,800
And Everything Will Be
Just The Way It Was.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,500
 <I>Sadly, This Was Not To Be.</I>
Oh!

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,300
 <I>In Four Short Hours,</I>

64
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,300
 <I>One Of These Women</I>
 <I>Would Lose A Husband,</I>

65
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,500
 <I>And All Of Them</I>
 <I>Would Lose A Friend.</I>

66
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,600
 <I>But How Could They</I>
 <I>Have Known This?</I>

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,600
 <I>It Was Supposed To Be</I>
 <I>A Beautiful Day.</I>

 <I>By Noon That Day,</I>

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,600
 <I>A Tornado Watch Was In Effect</I>
 <I>On Wisteria Lane,</I>

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,700
 <I>And Every One Of Its Residents</I>
 <I>Was Preparing For The Storm--</I>

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
 <I>Everyone, That Is,</I>
 <I>Except Gabrielle Solis,</I>

75

 <I>Who Was More Concerned About</I>

 <I>Mayor Lang,</I>

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,100
 <I>Will Reportedly Be Released</I>
 <I>From The Hospital Tomorrow.</I>

78
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,700
 <I>Until Then, The Deputy Mayor</I>

79
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,600
 <I>Will Be Coordinating</I>
 <I>Fairview's Emergency Response</I>

80
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,200
 <I>As The City Remains</I>
 <I>On Tornado Watch.</I>

81
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,500
 <I>It Has Been Over 50 Years...</I>
I Turned Off The Gas

82
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,900
And Locked Your Car
In The Garage.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm Gonna Go Gramy Passport
From The Safe-Deposit Box

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Before They Close The Bank.
 <I>...We Should Understand Is</I>
 <I>Never Underestimate</I>

85
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,200
 <I>The Power Of Mother Nature.</I>
What's Wrong?

86
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,200
They Said Victor's Getting
Out Of The Hospital... Tomorrow.

87
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,000
Relax.
We're Gonna Be Gone

88
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,900
Before They Give Him
His Last Sponge Bath.

89
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,800
And Remember, The Accountant's
Dropping Off The Papers

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,700
For My Cayman Island Account.
I Can't Deal With That
Right Now. I'm Packing.

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,500
Gaby, Those Documents Give Us
Access To $10 Million.

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Multitask.

93
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,400
I Told You Just To Pack
The Essentials.

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,000
That's What I'm Doing.

95
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
Is That A Boa?

96
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,000
Carlos, If You Are
Taking Me Somewhere

97
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,300
Where I Don't Need A Boa,
Then I Don't Want To Go.

98
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,500
Fine. You Could Be
A Little Bit More Sensitive.

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,700
I Had To Say Good-Bye
To My Friends Today.
Yes, I'm Sorry.

100
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,100
And I Should Probably Go Over
And Say Something To Edie.

101
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,600
Like What?

102
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,700
"Rot In Hell,
You Maggoty Whore"?

103
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
That Woman Ruined Our Lives.

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,800
If She Had Kept Her Mouth Shut,
We Wouldn't Be Running Away.

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,700
I Know, But I Can't Help
Feeling A Little Guilty.

106
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,700
I Mean, Do You Ever Even Think
About What We Did To Edie?

107
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,900
Who Cares?! Thanks To Her,
I'm Giving Up My Home,

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,700
My Friends,
Half My Wardrobe.

109
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,300
So Do Me A Favor And Never
Mention Her Name Again

110
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,000
Unless It's Followed
By The Phrase,

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
"That Conniving Skank."

112
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,200
Ya <I>Think</I> You Can Do That?

113
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Hey, Lynette.

114
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Hi. Did You Hear
They Declared A Tornado Watch?

115
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,700
Scary, Huh?
Yeah, Well,
Don't Worry About Me.

116
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm Ready For Anything.

117
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,200
It's Sweet Of You
To Dough.
Oh, Yeah.

118
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,900
Okay.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
Um...

120
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Can We Stay
In Your Basement?

121
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,500
What?

122
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,300
Well, If This Tornado Watch
Gets Upgraded To Aarning,

123
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
We're Gonna Need
A Place To Wait It Out.

124
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,500
"We"--Me, Tom, The Kids.E"?

125
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,400
That Family You've
Come To Know And Love.

126
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
All Ven Of You?

127
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeah.

128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, First Of All,

129
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,700
I Only Love Four Of You.

130
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,000
And Second,

131
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,300
No Way In Hell.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Mrs. Mccluskey, Please?

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,500
It's A Small Basement,
Lynette.

134
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,400
I've Already
Invited Ida Over.

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
We Just Wanna Play
Some Cards

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
And Wait This Thing Out
In Peace And Quiet.

137
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,400
We Can Be Quiet...

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,700
Relative To The Storm.

139
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,900
Look, There's A Shelter
Over At 3rd And Grove.

140
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,700
Why Don't You Go Over There?
That's In The Middle
Of Skid Row.

141
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,900
You Think I Want My Kids
Around A Bunch Of Winos?

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,700
Ida's Off The Wagon. It's Not
Gonna Be Much Better Here.

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,900
I Am Asking You As A Friend.
Please?

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
(Sighs) You're Not Gonna
Let This Thing Go, Are You?

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,900
Thanks. And Don't Worry.
I'll Have A Talk With My Kids.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,900
I Promise They'll Keep A Lid
On The Destruction.

147
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,300
Relative To The Storm.

148
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Yeah. Mm.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,300
Dylan, We're Fine.
It's Just A Tornado Watch.

150
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,500
No. We Paid A Lot Of Money
For This Class Trip,

151
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
And I Want You
To Stay And Enjoy It.

152
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,900
Tell Julie
I'll Keep An Eye On Her Mom.

153
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
Gotta Go.

154
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,000
What The Hell
Are You Doing Here?

155
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,600
I Just Came To Talk
To Adam.

156
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,300
I Like Your Hair Long.

157
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,300
This Is Harassment.

158
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,700
I Will Call The Police.

159
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,000
I Don't Think So.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
You'd Have To Tell Them
What Happened

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,100
With Me And Your Husband.

162
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,300
You Don't Want People
Knowing About That.

163
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,300
In Case You'd Forgotten,

164
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,300
Adam Wants
Nothing To Do With You.

165
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,900
Oh?

166
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,600
Didn't Seem That Way
Yesterday.

167
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,200
He Didn't Tell You
I Stopped By?

168
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,900
I Hope He's Not Starting
To Keep Things From You...

169
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Again.

170
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,900
Here. I Brought You A Few Things
In Case There <I>Is</I> A Tornado.

171
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
(Chuckles) Wow.
Tape, Batteries, A Radio.

172
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,000
How'd You Know
I Need This Stuff?

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,500
An Educated Guess.

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,700
Hey, Actually, Um,
Since You're Here,

175
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,300
I Was Thinking That Maybe
It Would Be A Good Idea

176
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,200
To Tell Orson About Mike's,
You Know...

177
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,100
Drug Problem.

178
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,600
Good, Because I Already...
Told Him.

179
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,400
You Did? When?

180
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,500
Last Week.

181
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,500
I Was Afraid That Mike
Might Go To Orson For Pills.

182
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm Sorry, So...

183
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,700
Orson Already Knows
About Mike?

184
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,500
Did I Do Something Wrong?

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,400
No. No, You Didn't
Do Anything Wrong.

186
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,500
Thanks For The Supplies.

187
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,500
I Don't Believe
A Word You Say.

188
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
So You Still Don't Think
I Slept With Adam?

189
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,300
Of Course Not.
Oh, Well, Let Me
Paint A Picture For You.

190
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,900
Me Lying In His Arms,

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,100
Him Wondering Out Loud
How He Ended Up Marrying

192
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,300
Such A Cold, Hard Bitch.

193
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Katherine,
Are You All Right?

194
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,400
I-I Couldn't Help
Noticing--

195
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,600
Of Course You Couldn't.

196
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,900
And Everything's Fine.
Thank You.

197
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Hi There.

198
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,100
I-I Don't Mean To Intrude,
But Are You All Right?

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
Not Really, No.

200
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Would You Like
A Nice Cup Of Tea?

201
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,700
 <I>The National Weather Service</I>
 <I>Has Extended The Tornado Watch</I>

202
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,400
 <I>To The Tri-County Area.</I>

203
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,200
 <I>Funnel Clouds Have Been Spotted</I>

204
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,800
 <I>In The Counties</I>
 <I>Of Mansfield And Webster...</I>

205
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
I Can't Believe
You're Being So Nice.

206
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,500
You Don't Even Know Me.

207
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,400
Well, I Know Katherine,
And Believe Me,

208
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,600
You're Not The Only Person
I've Seen Her Reduce To Tears.

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,600
Did You See Her Spit On Me?

210
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,600
Yes. That Was Unfortunate.

211
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
If You Need
Any Antibacterial Soap, I--

212
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,800
Nah, I'm Good.

213
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,500
So, Um, Why On Earth

214
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,900
Would Katherine Treat You
So Dreadfully?

215
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,300
Oh, She's Just Mad 'Cause
Her Husband's In Love With Me.

216
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,300
Really?

217
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,100
I Was One Of His Patients
Back In Chicago.

218
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,100
From The Moment We Met,

219
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,000
There Was
This <I>Intense</I> Passion.

220
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,600
We Tried To Fight It,
But We Couldn't.

221
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, You're Only Human.

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,900
I Know He's Miserable
Without Me,

223
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,100
Even Though She Tries
To Pretend That They're Happy.

224
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,300
I Mean, You're Their Neighbor.
You Think They're Happy?

225
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Well, They Seem...
Content.

226
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Well, They're Not.

227
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,100
It Was Just
An Observation.

228
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,900
Yeah, A Stupid One.

229
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Okay. (Chuckles)

230
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,500
This Has Been... Lovely.

231
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,800
We Really Should, Um,
Do It Again Sometime.

232
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,500
You Think
I'm Making This Up?

233
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,800
We Were Lovers.
I Can Prove It.

234
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,400
He Has A Snake Tattoo
On His Right Shoulder.

235
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
 <I>I</I> Licked It.

236
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,700
Be That As It May, I Really
Think You Should Go Now.

237
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,700
No One Believes Me!
She Has You All Brainwashed!

238
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,100
Sylvia,
Whe Are You Going?

239
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,300
Sylvia, You Need
To Come Out Of There.

240
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,800
Ask Adam!
He'll Tell You The Truth!
Ll, Adam Is Not Here,

241
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,900
And There Is A Tornado Coming.
And As You May Have Gleaned

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,700
From The Batteries
And Bottled Water,

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,300
That Bathroom Is Where We Are
Planning On Riding It Out.

244
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,700
So Would You Please Be A Dear
And Come On Out?

245
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,300
Go Get Adam!

246
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
And... Open Wide.

247
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,600
Orson, We Need To Talk.

248
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,800
(Drilling Stops)
Susan. I'm With A Patient.

249
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah, I Can See That.

250
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Hi. I'm His Neighbor.
Cute Shoes.

251
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Why The Hell
Would You Give Mike Drugs?
Uh...

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Mrs. Kowalsky...
(Clears Throat)

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,900
We're Gonna Step Out
For Just A Moment.

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,300
No Need. I'll Be Quick.

255
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,200
'Cause I'm Sure You Have

256
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,200
A Very Good Reason
For Giving Mike Pills

257
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,200
When You Know
That He Has A Drug Problem.

258
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,600
So... What Is
Your Very Good Reason?

259
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Okay, This May Take A While.
You Might Want To Spit.

260
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,900
Mike Was Having A Lot Of Pain
With His Shoulder.

261
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh, Of Course, And You Know
All About Shoulder Pain...

262
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,900
Being A Dentist.

263
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,500
I Thought I Was Helping.

264
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,900
By Giving Pills
To An Addict?

265
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,800
Does That Sound Helpful
To You, Mrs. Kowalsky?

266
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Ank You.
Finally, Some Sanity.

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,100
Susan, You Have To Leave.

268
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,700
Fine.

269
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,800
But You Know, If I Find Out

270
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,900
That You Have Given Mike
So Much As A Breath Mint,

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Trust Me, There Is Not
Enough Novocaine In This Office

272
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,900
To Numb The Pain
I Will Inflict On You.

273
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Hi, Miss Britt.

274
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,400
You Need Some Bottled Water
Before The Storm Hits?

275
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Well, Thanks, Jeremy.

276
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,900
20 Bucks.

277
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,300
Hold It.

278
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,900
You Are Price Gouging
Right Before A Tornado?

279
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
I Was Just Trying
To Make So Money.

280
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,200
You Really Wanna
Make Some Money?

281
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
Go Hit Up Gabrielle Solis.

282
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,800
She Hasn't Met A Price Tag
She Didn't Like.

283
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I Already Tried.

284
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,200
She And Mr. Solis
Are Moving.

285
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,700
Moving?

286
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,100
Yeah. They're Loading Up
Their Car And Everything.

287
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,600
They Didn't Tell You?

288
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,500
Well, They Probably Didn't
Want A Big Emotional Scene.

289
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,800
Too Bad.

290
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:24,314


291
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,900
What Was I Supposed To Do, Mike?
Leave 'Em In Your Truck?

292
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm Not Gonna Sit Back And Watch
You Spin Out Of Control.

293
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,800
Out Of Control? Have I Ever
Missed A Mortgage Payment?
What?

294
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,400
Or Disappeared For Days On End,
Or O.D.'D In An Alley?

295
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,900
No. I Go To Work Every Day.
I Help Out Around The House.

296
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,400
I Take Care Of You And Julie.
What's The Problem?

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,700
What's The Problem?
Let's See. You Lied To Me.

298
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,900
Uh, Your Drug Dealer
Almost Dated My Daughter.

299
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,400
You Lied To Me Some More,
And Then I Find Out That You

300
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,600
Hit Up My Best Friend's Husband
For More Pills.

301
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,400
You're Blowing This
Out Of Proportion.

302
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,400
And You're Kind Of Yelling
At Me--Also A Problem.

303
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,600
I'm Sorry. I'm In Pain.

304
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You Might Think
You Have Things Under Control,

305
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,800
But They're Only Gonna
Get Worse...

306
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,300
And With A Baby On The Way.
I'm Sick Of Explaining Mysel

307
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,300
If I Need A Pill Now And Then,
I'll Take One.

308
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,400
So Where Are They?

309
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,200
I'm Serious, Susan.
Give 'Em To Me.
Forget It.

310
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,600
Hey, Don't Walk Away
From Me! Susan!
Let Go Of Me!

311
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,600
My Wife Needs To Be Seen
Immediately.

312
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,300
She's Pregnant.
She Fell Down The Stairs.

313
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,100
Any Bleeding?
Uh, No.

314
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,700
Cramping?
Uh, I Think
I Just Twisted My Ankle,

315
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,600
But I Would Like
To Get Checked Out Anyway.
Sure,

316
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,800
But For Non-Emergency Cases,
It's Gonna Be A Long Wait.

317
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
Well, She's Pregnant. Doesn't
That Make It An Emergency?

318
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,700
Sir, I'm Sorry.
You're Just Gonna Have To Wait.

319
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,900
It's Okay.

320
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,900
How Could You Not Have Told Me
Sylvia Was Here?
I Was Trying Not To Upset You.

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
Well, You Failed.

322
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,600
At Least If You Had Warned Me,
I Wouldn't Have Been Blindsided

323
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
When She Showed Up
On Our Front Lawn.
I'm Sorry.

324
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,300
Look, I'll Call The Police.
I'll Get A Restraining Order.

325
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,100
I'll Do Whatever It Takes To Get
This Woman Out Of Oulives.

326
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,900
Bree. Hello.

327
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,100
Hi, Katherine.

328
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,400
Could I Borrow Adam
For A Second?

329
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,600
I Have A...
Situation On My Hands.

330
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,300
She's Over There,
First Door On The Left,

331
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
And Please Hurry.

332
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,700
What Is She Doing There
In The First Place?

333
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I Saw Her Weeping.
I Wanted To Help.

334
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,500
You Wanted Dirt, And I'll Bet
She Told You Plenty.

335
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,900
I Can't Help Having
A Sympathetic Face.

336
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,300
Sylvia? I Need You
To Come Out Here, Okay?

337
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Adam?

338
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,300
Is That You, Darling?

339
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,400
Don't Call Him That!

340
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,400
Katherine?! I'm Not Coming Out
If She's Here!

341
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,200
I'm Not Leaving You Alone
Withhusb

342
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,600
Just Come Out!
I'll Get Rid Of Her!

343
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,000
Ladies.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,100
So What'd She Tell You?

345
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
That She Had An Affair
With Adam.

346
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, She Didn't.

347
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,400
She Was His Patient--

348
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,400
A Pathetic, Lonely Woman.

349
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,000
One Day, For No Other Reason
Than Sheer Pity,

350
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,700
He Gave Her A Little Kiss.

351
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,700
Sylvia Took This To Mean
That They Were In Love.

352
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,600
And When Adam Told Her
Otherwise,

353
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,900
She Had A Breakdown

354
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,700
And Accused Him
Of Sexual Assault.

355
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,500
Oh, My God.

356
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,000
What Did You Do?

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,500
We Settled Out Of Court.

358
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,900
I Wanted To Fight It,

359
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,300
But Adam Was Afraid
Of Losing His License.

360
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,500
Of Course,
We Lost Everything Else--

361
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,200
Our Home,
Our... (Chuckles) Savings

362
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
And Our Friends.

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,300
So This Is Why
You Moved Back To Fairview?

364
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,100
It Was Supposed To Be
Our Fresh Start.

365
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,200
So...

366
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Now You Know
Our Dirty Little Secret.

367
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,600
Well, Katherine,
For What It's Worth...

368
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,100
I Would've
Spit In Her Face, Too.

369
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,700
What's That Noise?
Is... Is That The Tornado?

370
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,800
Worse. It's The Scavos.

371
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,300
(Lynette) Hey, We're Here!
I Know!

372
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,300
(Tom) All Right, Guys.
Come On. Stake Out Your Places.

373
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,900
(Preston) Th Is Our Spot!
We Called It!
(Parker) You Can't

374
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
(Preston) Can So!
(Boys Shouting Indistinctly)

375
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,300
(Boy) Ow, My Head!

376
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,400
Lynette? I'm Begging.

377
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
Oh. Sorry.
Kinda Get Used To It.

378
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,000
Come Here.
Give That To Mama.
(Shouting Continues)

379
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,400
Hey, Guys? Come On Now.

380
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,900
Knock It Off. Here You Go.

381
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,900
And... First Base, Second Base,
Third Base, Sit.

382
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,000
We Gonna Have
A Nice, Quiet Tornado Watch,

383
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,400
And Nobody's
Gonna Cause Any Problems.
Is There A Cat Here?

384
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,200
Oh, Yes. I Brought Toby.

385
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Is Something Wrong?

386
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,000
I Didn't Realize
There'd Be A Cat.

387
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,700
Tom's Really Allergic.

388
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,500
It Sets Off My Asthma.

389
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,700
Ida, Is There Any Chance

390
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,300
That We Could
Put Little Toby Upstairs?

391
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Upstairs?

392
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,400
Yeah. He'd Be Very Safe.
We Could Put Him In A Closet.

393
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,100
Sure.

394
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,000
Why Don't We Put Penny With Him,
Since It's Safe?

395
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,000
(Chuckles) What?

396
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,200
Toby Is Ida's Baby, Lynette.

397
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,400
 <I>No,</I> Toby's An Animal,
And My Husband, A Human Being,

398
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Will Get Very Sick
If He Stays Down Here,

399
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,000
So, Please,
Put The Cat Upstairs.

400
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,800
Look,
I Invited Ida To Come Here.

401
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,300
You, I'm Doing A Favor For.

402
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,000
If You're Not Happy
With The Accommodations,

403
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,400
You're Free To Leave.

404
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,400
Hey,
I'll Just Stay Over Here.

405
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
(Chuckles) May--Maybe It Won't
Get Any Worse.

406
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,900
No, That's Ridiculous.

407
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,800
Karen, Come On.

408
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,600
Sorry. Theat Stays.

409
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,100
Knock Yourself Out.

410
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,600
(Man) Start Him On I.V.
(Woman) I'll Be With You
In One Minute!

411
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,800
Are You Okay?
Yeah, Yeah, I'm Fine.
I'm Just Worried About You.

412
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,600
How Long Are They Gonna
Keep Us Waitin'?

413
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,800
Are You Sure
That's All It Is?
(Scoffs)

414
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,300
Hey! Hey, We Were Here
Way Before These People.

415
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,800
Sir, They're Seeing Everyone
On An Emergency Basis.

416
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,500
This Woman Is Hemorrhaging.
Danny, Can You Take Her In?

417
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
What, You Gotta See Blood
Before You'll Treat Somebody?

418
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
My Wife's Pregnant, And She
Fell Down A Flight Of Stairs.
I'm Sorry, But I'm Gonna

419
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,200
These People Are Bleeding.
I Can Absolutely Wait.
I'm Just Asking Them

420
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,600
Hell, You Could've Done It
While You're Standing Here

421
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,700
Talking To Me, Right?
Sir, We'll Get To Your Wife
As Soon As We Can.

422
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,500
Now Please Take A Seat.
Just Take A Look At Her!

423
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,800
Get The Hell Off Of Me!
Mike, Stop!

424
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,100
Whoa! Uhh!
I Need Security Here Now.

425
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,400
Hey.

426
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,100
When You Gonna
Let Me Out Of These Things?

427
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
When Your Wife's Done
And You're Ready To Go Home.

428
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,700
The Doctor
Said The Baby's Fine.

429
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,900
Oh, Thank God.

430
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
Yeah.

431
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
And, Uh, Your Ankle?

432
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,100
Just A Mild Sprain.

433
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,900
How You Doing?

434
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,700
I've Had Better Days.

435
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,000
I Am So Sorry.

436
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,800
It's Gonna Be Okay.

437
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,000
I Talked To The Doctor,
And,M,

438
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,000
They Have A Rehab Facility

439
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,800
Thanks.

440
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,600
I Don't Need Rehab.
I Can Kick This Myself.

441
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
I've Done It Before.

442
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,600
You Keep Saying That,
And It Just Keeps Getting Worse.

443
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,900
Susan, Look At Me.

444
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,400
I'm Handcuffed To A Chair.

445
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,700
I Think
I've Hit Bottom Here.

446
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,800
I Will Fix This.

447
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Just No Rehab.

448
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,400
Mrs. Delfino?

449
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,500
The Doctor Asked Me
To Give You These, For The Pain.

450
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,900
Oh, My God.
Are You Kidding Me?

451
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,800
I've Kind Of Had
A Rough Day Here.

452
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,500
No.

453
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,600
(Whispers) Susan...

454
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
(Normal Voice) I've Just
Gotta Get Through Is.

455
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,400
No.

456
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,000
There's No Tomorrow.
It's Now.

457
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,900
You Will Quit This Now.

458
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,500
You Will Go To Rehab,
Or So Help Me, I Will Leave You.

459
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,200
I Will Take This Baby,
And I Will Leave You.

460
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You Win.

461
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,600
I'll Go.

462
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,300
Gabrielle?!

463
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Excuse Me?

464
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
Sorry. I'm In A Rush.

465
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,600
My Wife's
Alone With The Kids,

466
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,800
And I Have To Get Home
Before The Storm Hits.

467
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,500
This Is The Information
Carlos Asked For.

468
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,700
About What?

469
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,500
About
The Cayman Island Account.

470
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Didn't He Tell You
I Was Coming?

471
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah, Of Course He Did.

472
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,400
Uh, He Said
You'd Be Stopping By.

473
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,800
Duh.

474
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,600
This Is Everything You Need
To Access The Money.

475
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,100
I Washed My Hands Of This,
So Whatever You Do,

476
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Don't Lose That Folder.
Got It?
Believe Me, I Won't

477
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,100
All Right. Nice To Finally
Meet You, Gabrielle.

478
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
You're Just As Pretty
As Carlos Said You Were.

479
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Oh, No.

480
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,700
I'm Prettier.

481
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,800
Edie,
What Have You Got There?!

482
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,800
Oh, Crap!

483
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,100
 <I>Residents Are Advised</I>
 <I>To Seek Shelter At Once.</I>

484
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,900
 <I>Again, Do Not Evacuate.</I>

485
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,700
 <I>Stay Where You Are</I>
 <I>And Seek Shelter In A Basement</I>

486
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,400
 <I>Or Any Windowless Room.</I>

487
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,700
You Okay?

488
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,600
My Throat Is Closing Up.
I Think I Gotta Go Upstairs.

489
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
No. No, No, No, No, No.

490
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,800
You Stay Here.

491
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,800
Edie, You Thief!
Open This Door Now!

492
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,500
I've Called The Police!

493
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
They're On Their Way,

494
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,200
And They Are
Going To Taser Your Ass!

495
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
Oh!

496
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,900
Gaby?

497
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,400
Oh, Good. You're Home.

498
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
Lynette! What--

499
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,600
What The Hell
Did I Tell You?!

500
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm Not Gonna Sit
And Watch My Husband Suffocate.

501
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,600
Well, I Don't Want Ida To Wake
Up And Find Her Cat Missing.

502
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,300
Karen, After All Our Years
Of Friendship,

503
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,500
How Can You Choose A Cat
Over My Husband?

504
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,200
You Think We're Friends?

505
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,900
Of Course.

506
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,000
Really?

507
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,500
You Ever Stop By Just To Say Hi
Or Invite Me For A Cup Of Tea?

508
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,800
Ida Does.
What Are You Talking About?

509
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,700
I Had You Over For Lemonade
Last Week.
While I Was Drinking It,

510
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
You Went To The Store,
And I Watched The Kids

511
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,400
Face It.
The Only Time We're Friends

512
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Is When You Need Something.
That Is Not True.
I Genuinely Care About You.

513
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,200
You Mean Like Today,
When You Came By To Check On Me?

514
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Oh, That's Right,
You Only Wanted A Basement,

515
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,400
(Meows Loudly)
Damn It, Toby!

516
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,700
Hey, Hold It! Hold It!
You Can't Go Out There!

517
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,400
That Stupid Cat Is
The Only Family That Ida's Got!

518
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,400
Now This Is What Friends Do!
Karen!

519
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,300
Give Me The Damn Folder, Edie!
(Singsong Voice)
Not Gonna Happen!

520
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,700
It's Worthless To You!
(Normal Voice)
Oh! You And Carlos

521
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,700
Are Screwed Without It,
And That Is Worth A Lot To Me.
Give Me My Money!

522
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Ah! (Scoffs) <I>Your</I> Money?

523
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,000
Carlos Embezzled It.

524
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,200
Oh, Now You're Moral
All Of A Sudden?

525
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,500
You Didn't Care
Where The Money Was Coming From

526
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,700
When Youhought Carlos
Was Gonna Spend It On <I>You!</I>

527
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,100
Okay, I'm Not Unreasonable.

528
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,400
Cut Me In For, Say, 60%,
And I'll Go Away.

529
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,200
How's That Sound?

530
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,200
No! (Growls)

531
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,200
Aah!

532
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,700
Get You!

533
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Aah!

534
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,700
Edie!
Give Me That!

535
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,600
No! Let Go!
No, You!

536
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,900
Let Go!

537
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,300
You! Aah!
Oh! Oh! No!

538
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,700
No!

539
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,300
Wh Did You Do?!

540
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,800
What Did You Do, Edie?!

541
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,200
Get In The House.

542
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
Now!

543
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
Toby!

544
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,200
Toby.

545
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,300
Karen!
You Gotta Get Inside Now!

546
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,300
He's Right There!
Damn It!

547
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm Not Gonna Let You Die,
So Don't Make Me Drag You!

548
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,200
Oh, Crap.

549
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Oh! Hurry!O! Go!

550
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,000
No!
Come On! Come On!

551
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,000
Come On, Come On!

552
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,500
Get In!

553
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,700
I Have A Crawl Space.
(Loud Bang)

554
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,400
I Think We Can Both Fit.

555
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,300
You Just Threw My Money
In A Tornado.

556
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
I Am Not Getting In There
With You.

557
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,700
Fine! Then Stay Out There
And Die.

558
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,300
Move Your Ass!
Oh!

559
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
Come On, Sylvia.

560
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
Please Open The Door.

561
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Sylvia.

562
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,500
Thank God You're Here. We Need
To Get Into The Bathroom.

563
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,500
We Can't.
There's A Woman In There.

564
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,200
Well,
Tell Her To Hurry It Up.

565
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,400
No, No, No, She's Barricaded
Herself In There.

566
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,900
She's A Patient Of Mine
Who's Had A Little Meltdown.

567
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Just Give Me Five Minutes.
We Don't Have Time. There's
A Funnel Cloud Out There.

568
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,800
Sylvia!
Open The Damn Door!

569
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,100
Go To Hell!

570
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
Quick! In Here, In Here.

571
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Come On.

572
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,300
Quickly. Quickly.

573
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,600
Come On! Hurry Up!

574
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,300
Go! Get In, Get In!
Get In!

575
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,200
Uhh! Hang On!
Hang Onto This!

576
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,300
Can I Say Something?

577
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,200
What?

578
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,700
I'm Sorry
Carlos And I Lied To You.

579
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,300
I Know We Hurt You,

580
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,000
And I Wish It Didn't Happen
The Way It Did,

581
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,100
And I-I Just Want You
To Know That.

582
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,700
Why Are You Talking
Like That?

583
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,600
Well, I Thought
Just In Case We--

584
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,400
Oh, No, You Don't.
You Just Shut The Hell Up.

585
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,900
We're Not Doing
Deathbed Confessions Here.

586
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
We're Gonna
Get Through This.

587
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,700
I'm Gonna Go On Hating You
For Years To Come.

588
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,300
You Really Hate Me?

589
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,800
Yes.

590
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,100
(Sighs) No.

591
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,900
(Sighs) It's Just That

592
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,700
I Really Let Myself
Fall For Him,

593
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Which Was Stupid
Because I Always Knew

594
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,100
That He'd Go Back To You.

595
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,500
Oh.

596
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,300
Well, I'm Still Sorry,
Though.

597
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,400
(Softly)
I Said Shut The Hell Up.

598
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,400
I Think It's Possible
Benjamin Might Need Changing.

599
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,100
That Went Beyond
The Hypothetical

600
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,100
A Good Ten Minutes Ago.
We're Giving You Shelter.
You Could At Least Be Gracious.

601
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,800
We Wouldn't Need Shelter If

602
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,100
Oh, So Now It's My Fault That

603
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,900
That Lunatic Commandeered
Our Safe Room?

604
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,800
If You Hadn't Been Dying
To Know Our Business,

605
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,600
She Wouldn't Have
Gotten In There.
Can We Stop Pointing Fingers?

606
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
This Isn't Bree's Fault.

607
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,200
You're Right.

608
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,400
Sorry.

609
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,500
But You Can Understand Why
I'm Upset,

610
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,900
Having That Insane Woman
Back In Our Lives.

611
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,800
I Can Only Imagine.

612
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,400
I Had To Listen To Her
Babble For An Hour.

613
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,100
What Kind Of Things
Was She Saying?

614
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,900
She Said That She And Adam
Were Lovers

615
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And She Could Prove It
Because He Had A Tattoo, And...

616
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,600
What?

617
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,300
She Said He Had A Tattoo
On His Shoulder,

618
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,100
Which I Know Isn't True Because
I've Seen Him At The Pool,

619
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,300
And I Would've Remembered

620
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,700
Cause Tattooed People
Make Me Very Uncomfortable.

621
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,000
Did She Say What Kind
Of Tattoo It Was?

622
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,300
Um... A Snake.
What's The Difference?

623
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,500
He Doesn't Have One.

624
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
He Did...

625
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,800
Back In Chicago.

626
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,700
He Had It Removed.

627
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
Oh.

628
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,500
Sorry.

629
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,400
Katherine...

630
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,900
So... That's Why We Settled?

631
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,600
Why We Lost Everything?

632
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm Sorry, But You Have
To Understand--

633
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,800
No, I Do Not.

634
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,500
Sorry.

635
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,500
(Whispers) Not Here.

636
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,500
Not Now.

637
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,400
Gaby!

638
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,600
Change Of Plans!

639
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,500
We Gotta Get
In The Basement Now!

640
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,500
Gaby?

641
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,400
(Sighs)
Damn It. Where Are You?

642
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,500
Where's Gaby?

643
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,900
I Thought She Was With You.

644
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
I Don't Know Where She Is.

645
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,100
I Guess We'll Have
To Wait For Her Together.

646
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,900
(Sighs) Do Youind
If I Say Something?

647
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,000
Look, Gaby And I Never Planned
To Get Back Together, Victor.

648
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,900
We Tried To Keep Away
From Each Other.

649
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We Really Did.

650
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,500
But... I Don't Know.

651
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,200
It's Like We're Two Halves
Of The Same Person Or Somethin'.

652
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,000
And When We're Apart, W...

653
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,400
We Just Aren't Happy,
Which Is Why We...

654
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,500
We Never Set Out
To Hurt You, Victor,

655
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,200
And I'm Sorry We Did.

656
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,600
Are You Done?

657
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,500
Yeah.

658
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,700
Come On, Carlos!

659
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,700
You Better Get In The House!

660
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,400
You Could Get Hurt Out Here!

661
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,700
Adam!

662
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,600
Hello!

663
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,000
Where Is Everyone?!

664
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,700
Did You Hear That?

665
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,400
Adam, I'm Leaving!

666
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,800
This Is Your Last Chance
To Come With Me,

667
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,700
Or I'm Gonna Tell Everyone
Exactly What Happened!

668
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,800
Okay.

669
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,900
You've Made Your Choice!
Here I Go!

670
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,300
Aah!

671
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,700
It's Here.

672
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,100
 <I>It Was Supposed To Be</I>
 <I>A Beautiful Day.</I>

673
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,300
 <I>But Then The Winds Came</I>
 <I>And Changed Everything...</I>

674
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,100
 <I>And Not Just The Houses</I>
 <I>And The Lawns.</I>

675
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,800
Oh, My God.

676
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,300
 <I>The People Had Changed, Too.</I>

677
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,000
 <I>While The Storm Had Raged,</I>

678
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,600
 <I>Each Of Them</I>
 <I>Had Learned Something...</I>

679
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,500
 <I>About Friendship...</I>

680
