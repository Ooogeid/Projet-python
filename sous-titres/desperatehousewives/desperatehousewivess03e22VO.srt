1
00:00:00,645 --> 00:00:02,814
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:05,583
<i>Carlos revealed his deepest desire.

3
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:07,917
It's about children.
I want them so bad.

4
00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:09,715
<i>Tom forced the issue.

5
00:00:09,872 --> 00:00:12,171
- Are you sleeping with my wife?
- Of course not.

6
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:14,087
<i>Rick came clean.

7
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,076
I have feelings for you.
I know you feel something for me.

8
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,328
You can't work here anymore.

9
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,739
<i>And Susan's tortured love life...

10
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:25,336
I was on my way to propose to you.

11
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:26,657
<i>Was finally...

12
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:29,043
- What would you have said?
- <i>On the mend.

13
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:35,448
<i>Exactly one year had passed

14
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:38,108
<i>since the night
Mike Delfino and Susan Mayer

15
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:40,282
<i>were supposed to
become engaged.

16
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,934
<i>So when Mike took Susan
to her favorite restaurant,

17
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,892
<i>she just knew he was going to
pop the question.

18
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,465
What are you gonna have?

19
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:53,382
<i>And when he did...

20
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:55,189
The chicken.

21
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:58,232
<i>She'd be ready with her answer.

22
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:01,768
<i>But as the evening wore on,

23
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,077
<i>the moment Susan
had been waiting for...

24
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:09,775
<i>Failed to materialize.

25
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,357
<i>And though many opportunities

26
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,501
<i>presented themselves...

27
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:25,227
<i>The question was never asked.

28
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:29,467
<i>Until the thought began
to dawn on Susan

29
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:31,099
<i>that perhaps...

30
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,619
<i>It never would.

31
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,398
Pretty quiet over there.
Was dinner okay?

32
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:48,059
If by "okay" you mean
uneventful, then yes.

33
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,280
Something on your mind?

34
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:51,751
Mike, what day is today?

35
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:54,465
- Wednesday.
- Yes.

36
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:59,319
It's also the anniversary of the day
we were supposed to get engaged.

37
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:02,125
A year ago tonight,
you were on your way

38
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,067
to ask me to marry you when
you got hit by that stupid car.

39
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:09,172
That was a year ago?
Time really flies.

40
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:12,387
Is that all you have to say?

41
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,522
Why are you getting mad?

42
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,901
I thought you were gonna
propose tonight.

43
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:20,701
Why would I want to commemorate
the anniversary of the night

44
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:22,536
that some maniac put me
in a coma?

45
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:25,493
Because this date has
special meaning for us.

46
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:30,093
I sat in front of that trailer for
six hours thinking you hated me,

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,900
and a proposal would've brought

48
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,934
the entire thing full circle.

49
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,578
It would've turned a bad memory
into a beautiful one.

50
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:38,807
You really thought
this through, didn't you?

51
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:42,034
Yes, I did, because
I am a thoughtful person.

52
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,162
And whenever we do
get married, that

53
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,516
is something you are
gonna have to work on.

54
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,190
I'll do my best.

55
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:52,903
By the way...

56
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:55,641
That seem familiar?

57
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,400
My God. I can't believe
that you did this.

58
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:09,387
Well, I wanted to...

59
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:11,429
How'd you put it?

60
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:13,635
Turn a bad memory into
a beautiful one.

61
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:18,584
Now go sit in front of that trailer.

62
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:21,306
I promise I'll show up this time.

63
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:55,400
<i>Yes, Susan knew Mike was about
to pop the question...

64
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:58,315
<i>The one she feared
he'd never ask.

65
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,774
<i>And thanks to Susan...

66
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:05,840
Will you marry me?

67
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,600
<i>He never did.

68
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:12,486
<i>Luckily, it wasn't the question
she need to hear.

69
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,146
I kind of had a speech
prepared, but...

70
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,111
Sure. What the heck?

71
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:20,926
<i>It was the answer.

Season 03 Episode 22
<i>What Would We Do Without You?</i>

75
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:35,579
<i>From the moment we wake up
in the morning...

76
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,667
What time is it?

77
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:43,205
<i>Till our head hits
the pillow at night...

78
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,427
Did you lock the front door?

79
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:49,408
<i>Our lives are filled with questions...

80
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:52,169
Did you remember to buy
more shaving cream?

81
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:57,063
<i>Simple ones that are easy to answer.

82
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:59,754
Can I still pull this look off?

83
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:04,569
<i>But some questions are so dangerous,

84
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:08,700
<i>the truth... is not an option.

85
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:19,070
Are you mad at daddy?

86
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,786
Why would you think that?

87
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,851
'cause you're not talking to him.

88
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,471
When two people have known
each other as long as

89
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:30,370
mommy and daddy have,
they don't have to always talk.

90
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,373
In fact, a sign of a good relationship

91
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:34,024
is being comfortable in silence.

92
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,401
That's true.

93
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,520
Although mommy ignoring me
last night at work

94
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,227
wasn't exactly what
I'd call "comfortable."

95
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:44,143
well, daddy probably
didn't notice

96
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:46,654
that I was unloading
20-pound bags of flour

97
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:49,517
'cause he still can't lift them,
so mommy didn't exactly have time

98
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:51,582
to sit around and
chew the fat.

99
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:54,520
You haven't wanted to chew
the fat for five days now.

100
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:57,117
Come on, Lynette,
something's obviously bugging you.

101
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:58,598
You wanna know what's bugging me?

102
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,476
I'm trying to have a lovely breakfast
with my family,

103
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,121
- and you're picking a fight.
- Who's fighting?

104
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,257
- I just wanna talk.
- There's nothing to talk about, okay?

105
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:05,843
- Just leave me alone.
- Fine.

106
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,016
Good.

107
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:09,425
Sorry I asked.

108
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,450
Hey, François, it's Susan Mayer.

109
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:15,108
Call me as soon as you get this.

110
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:17,558
I know I told you that my wedding
is off, but it's back on

111
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,059
and I wanna see if you're
still available to do the flowers.

112
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,666
Just so you know,
Ian's not the groom anymore.

113
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,879
Long story. Call me.

114
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:29,634
There. I think I left
messages for everyone.

115
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,496
Are you sure it's okay for us
to have the same wedding

116
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,327
I was planning with Ian?
Be honest.

117
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:37,910
Well, I stole his bride.
I guess I can poach his florist.

118
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:42,079
Gosh, I just keep thinking there's
someone I've forgotten to tell.

119
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:45,286
Caterer, band, florist...

120
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:47,562
Guests?

121
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:49,585
My God!

122
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,596
I had Julie call and cancel everyone.

123
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:52,730
Just call 'em back.

124
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,982
You can't invite people to
a wedding on the phone.

125
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:57,126
You have to send
a proper invitation.

126
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:00,028
You want people to think
I'm a complete flake?

127
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,289
Hi, Curt. Susan Mayer.
You did my wedding invitations?

128
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:06,066
I'm gonna need another batch.
Exactly the same,

129
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:08,780
only change the name
"Ian Hainsworth" to "Mike Delfino."

130
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:10,791
long story. Call me.

131
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,613
Hey, what's with the frown?

132
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:24,748
You trying to get wrinkles
before the wedding?

133
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,244
I can't find a good flower girl.

134
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:29,371
Lynette keeps hinting
for me to use Penny.

135
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:32,022
But I saw her in that preschool
sing-along, and I am sorry,

136
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:33,977
but we are talking zero charisma.

137
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,705
I had a thought about
the flower girl.

138
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:36,894
You did?

139
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,897
My cleaning lady has a daughter...

140
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:40,852
Where's that picture?

141
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:43,996
Look familiar?

142
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:47,468
My God. She looks just like me
when I was that age!

143
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:50,105
That's what I thought. See, this way,
the wedding procession

144
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,146
starts with you as
this beautiful little girl,

145
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,933
ends with you as the stunning bride
that you've become.

146
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,969
I love that you're so
into this wedding.

147
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:01,497
Most men would be like,
"yeah, tell me where the church is,"

148
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,750
but you're as obsessed as me.

149
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:06,997
You're like a hot groom and a gay
best friend all rolled into one.

150
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:11,424
Can you blame me for wanting to
make everything as perfect as you?

151
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,694
Feel better?

152
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:21,018
There must've been a bad scallop

153
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:22,949
in that paella last night.

154
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,717
You'd think that half-bottle of tequila

155
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:26,391
you drank would've disinfected it.

156
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:30,933
Sorry to interrupt.

157
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,436
I'm just moving some stuff
over to Susan's house.

158
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,267
You two shacking up now?

159
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:37,567
Actually, we're getting married.

160
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,327
You're kidding!

161
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,227
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

162
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:42,807
You don't waste any time.

163
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:44,552
You know, I've already
wasted a year

164
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,524
I don't want to wake up one more day
without her lying next to me.

165
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:50,395
God. Here comes what's
left of breakfast.

166
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,195
And you two better be careful.

167
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,510
All this wedding fever going around...

168
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:57,185
You might catch it.

169
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,243
Right!

170
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:04,498
What?

171
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:07,517
I didn't realize the concept
of our being married

172
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:09,136
was such a thigh-slapper.

173
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:10,920
Come on, Edie.

174
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,539
It's way too soon for us to be talking
marriage. We only just started dating.

175
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:16,166
I know, but...

176
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,450
We could live together.

177
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:19,967
We're either at my house

178
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:21,923
or your house
every night anyway.

179
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,725
True, but...

180
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:26,274
Why not?

181
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:28,793
And we're not kids anymore,
Carlos, and,

182
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:31,108
I mean, I really care about you.

183
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,666
Don't you care about me?

184
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:35,606
Of course I do.

185
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:37,429
But...

186
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:39,546
I just took over
Mike's lease yesterday.

187
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:42,612
Please. Old lady Sims can
find another tenant.

188
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:44,834
Edie, I already signed the papers.

189
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,773
Look, I have a responsibility.

190
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,386
You know, that rent helps pay
for her nursing home.

191
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,373
You understand, right?

192
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:57,448
SUNNY PASTURES
<i>RETIREMENT HOME</i>

193
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:02,928
Mrs. Sims?

194
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:08,733
Hi! Are you up for a visit?

195
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,594
Well, of course!

196
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,753
What a nice surprise!

197
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,567
I haven't seen you for years.

198
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:17,540
I know, and I feel awful about that.

199
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:20,869
I have always liked you so much.

200
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:23,638
You know, Wisteria lane hasn't been
the same since you left.

201
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:27,213
Well, with my arthritis,
I just couldn't live alone anymore.

202
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:30,104
But what I get from renting
more than pays for this place.

203
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:32,090
Well, that's good.

204
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,851
Although with Mike Delfino
getting married,

205
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:36,391
your house is gonna be empty now.

206
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,442
Actually, no. A friend of Mike's
just signed a lease...

207
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:41,327
A very nice man.

208
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,259
What was his name?

209
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:45,528
It's here somewhere.

210
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:49,912
Oh, dear.

211
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:51,195
What?

212
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,605
What did Mike tell you about Carlos?

213
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,624
Just that he's a nice, responsible man.

214
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:59,463
He is when he's sober.

215
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:02,475
He has a drinking problem?

216
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,651
Well, actually, what I heard is...

217
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:08,835
What am I doing?

218
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:11,518
I shouldn't be indulging in idle gossip.

219
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:14,334
- Edie, please!
- Smack. He does smack.

220
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,142
What? Good heavens!

221
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:20,716
Well... he seemed such
a nice man

222
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,688
when I met him,
and he's got a good job.

223
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,182
I know. What is that term?

224
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,903
"functional junkie."

225
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:29,782
This is very upsetting.

226
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:32,199
Maybe I should rethink this.

227
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:35,915
I should learn to shut my big mouth.
I mean, here I am,

228
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,301
blathering on about
drugs and prostitutes.

229
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:41,695
Prostitutes?! You never said
anything about prostitutes.

230
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,901
And I'm not going to.

231
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,739
Frankly...

232
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:48,336
I don't want to be on his bad side.

233
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:51,614
Edie, I can't have someone
like that in my house.

234
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:53,241
I have to tear up this lease.

235
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,697
I can't let you do that!

236
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:57,519
Not with your arthritis.

237
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:00,656
Here. You let me.

238
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,920
Julie told me about Ian.
I am so sorry.

239
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,141
You must be devastated.

240
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:20,387
I see you've picked up the pieces.

241
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:23,172
We got engaged last night.
We're getting married!

242
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,106
My God!
Congratulations!

243
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,344
So forget what Julie told you about
the wedding being off. It's back on.

244
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,902
Really?! Same day?

245
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,687
I promised people a wedding,
and they are getting one.

246
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:36,408
I'm sorry.
I can't make it.

247
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,082
I have plans that day.

248
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:40,733
- You could change your plans.
- No, I really can't.

249
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,105
Well, what could be more important
to you than my wedding?

250
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:46,663
My wedding?

251
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:48,321
What?

252
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:51,403
I see you got the invitation!

253
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,814
You're getting married
on my wedding day?

254
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,514
You canceled, and
Victor was kind of in a rush

255
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:00,587
because he didn't think it'd look good
for the mayor to be shacking up.

256
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:03,012
And every day we tried,
someone had a conflict.

257
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:04,474
And then your date opened up,

258
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:07,321
and we knew all my friends
were available, and, well...

259
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:08,893
You know, you, too.

260
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,974
It's really no problem.
We'll find another date.

261
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:15,218
Gaby, did you really think
I would want to spend what

262
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:18,003
would've been my wedding day
watching someone else get married?

263
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:21,569
I am so throwing that bouquet to you!

264
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:23,869
Okay, if you think for one second...

265
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:25,198
It's fine. Really.

266
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:27,467
Come on, Susan.
We got some calls to make.

267
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:30,619
Right! I have to cancel
my wedding...

268
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:31,988
Again!

269
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,542
Hi.

270
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:45,724
Is this a bad time?

271
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,491
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

272
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:50,730
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
for getting so snippy yesterday,

273
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:53,272
that when I canceled my wedding,
you had every right to...

274
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,752
Is that my Susan?

275
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:57,973
François!

276
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:01,059
I am so sorry that I could not do
your wedding flowers.

277
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,281
But the moment you canceled,

278
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:05,823
your friend here...
She... how you say?

279
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:07,528
Scoop me up.

280
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,327
You stole my florist?

281
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:16,630
Only because I admire your taste.
It's not theft. It's an homage.

282
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,394
I left the bouquet

283
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,727
and the centerpiece on the table.
If there are any changes,

284
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,441
you let me know.
Au revoir.

285
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:29,999
Well, I gotta go.

286
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:33,860
I wanna see those flowers.

287
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,771
My God, that's my centerpiece!

288
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,540
What, now you suddenly have
the trademark on peach tulips?

289
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:44,777
In this town in wedding season?
Yeah, I do.

290
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:47,296
You might as well have used
my cater and my swing band.

291
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,001
Yeah. Listen, about that...

292
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:52,103
My God. Did you steal
my whole wedding?

293
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,035
It was short notice, okay?

294
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:56,374
These people are booked
months in advance.

295
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:58,995
The only people available were
the ones you just bailed on.

296
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:02,006
I spent months planning that wedding.

297
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:04,790
I see what you're getting at.

298
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,793
And you know what?
You are right.

299
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,061
You have been my de facto
wedding planner,

300
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,829
and you deserve to get paid.

301
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,713
All right, what's the going rate?

302
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:14,254
$7,000? $8,000?

303
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:17,360
All right, $10,000.
I'm not gonna haggle.

304
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:20,098
I don't want to be paid.
I want my wedding back.

305
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:24,186
Well, you can't have it.
And if you ask me,

306
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:25,954
I am doing you
a really big favor.

307
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:27,597
Excuse me?

308
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,749
You are rushing into this marriage
thing way too fast.

309
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:34,065
Why don't you give it some time and
see if you and me work as a couple?

310
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:35,411
I'm rushing?

311
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,555
You met Victor three months ago.
I've known Mike three years.

312
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,792
Yeah, on and off.
Mostly off.

313
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:43,107
What if you tie the knot in a month

314
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:46,384
and realize that you miss
Ian and Mike misses the coma?

315
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,911
I cannot believe that
you just said that.

316
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:52,632
You know what?

317
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,495
I came over here to give you
my response card.

318
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,542
But here. This is my response.

319
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:04,291
You don't mean that.
That's just a big dramatic gesture.

320
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,208
This is a big dramatic gesture.

321
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,186
My flowers!

322
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,712
They're my flowers!

323
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,614
Enjoy your stolen wedding!

324
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:23,768
You can't do this!
I just signed a lease!

325
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:26,929
I'm sorry. The law says my mom
has 72 hours to change her mind.

326
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:28,970
She's exercising that option.

327
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:36,767
Hey! What's going on?

328
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:38,308
I've been evicted.

329
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,561
- What?
- Yeah. That was mrs. Sims' kid.

330
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:43,267
She's giving me 24 hours
to move out of her house.

331
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:44,682
That is so weird.

332
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:49,595
It gets weirder. He told me mrs. Sims
is praying for my spiritual recovery.

333
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:54,816
When old folks see the end coming,
they get all religious.

334
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,709
I guess.

335
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,237
So mind if I crash with you
until I can find a new place?

336
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:01,410
Of course not.

337
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,585
Thanks. I'll bring my stuff
over in the morning.

338
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,807
Why wait? I've got
boxes in the garage.

339
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,684
I'll help you start packing now.

340
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:13,532
Did you have something
to do with this?

341
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,940
What?

342
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:17,465
You have to admit,
it is kind of a coincidence.

343
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,156
You ask me to move in,
I say no, I get evicted.

344
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,689
How dare you.

345
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,903
I offer to put a roof over your head,

346
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:26,515
and you repay me with
suspicions and insults?

347
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:28,987
I don't even know that
I want you in my house.

348
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:30,536
Fine. I'll get a motel.

349
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,327
Hold on.

350
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,829
Let's not be hasty.

351
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:35,331
I knew it.

352
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,568
You were behind this.

353
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:41,745
If you wanna fight, fine.

354
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:43,935
But let's talk about
the real issue here.

355
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:46,505
Why are you so reluctant
to make a commitment to me?

356
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,461
I told you. I don't want to
talk about this.

357
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:51,133
You never do, but you owe me
an explanation.

358
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,417
Why don't you want to
move in with me?

359
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:55,279
Because I'm not in love with you.

360
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,325
Edie, I'm sorry.

361
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:03,124
I really like you...

362
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:04,767
No, I get it. I...

363
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,802
It's just a little upsetting because...

364
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:11,742
I'm late.

365
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,820
Ed, you can't be pregnant.
You're on the pill.

366
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,308
I might've forgotten to take
it a couple of days,

367
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,889
and I've been nauseous
for an entire week,

368
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,892
so I went and got a pregnancy test.

369
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:32,593
I figure I should find out if
I'm carrying your love child.

370
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:35,385
Wait, my mistake.

371
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:37,935
Your like child.

372
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:54,568
So? What does it say?

373
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,930
It's gonna take a couple
more minutes.

374
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:06,565
I just peed on that.
For God sake, put it on a coaster.

375
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:16,703
This is just dandy.
I'm 40, single and knocked up.

376
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:20,479
But on the bright side,
the dad's not into me.

377
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:25,798
Edie, if you are pregnant, I'm not
gonna let you go through this alone.

378
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,715
So what, you're gonna
be my lamaze partner?

379
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,314
No. I'm saying I'll step up.
I'll be there to help you raise him.

380
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:35,380
You serious?

381
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:39,299
Hey, I was there practically every day
to help you with Travers.

382
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:43,406
What makes you think that I would do
any less if it were actually my child?

383
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:46,019
Well, thanks. That's...

384
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,912
nice to know.

385
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,443
You know...

386
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:57,260
Your spare bedroom...

387
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,873
would make a great nursery.

388
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,908
Yeah. I guess it would.

389
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:05,317
I mean, it's right down
the hall from the master,

390
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:07,836
so we'd be able to hear him
when he was crying.

391
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,470
"We"?

392
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,996
You'd move in?

393
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,976
I told you that I would
be here for you.

394
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,590
We could even decorate his room
in, like, a whole pirate theme.

395
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:22,453
I always wanted to do
that if I had a son.

396
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:25,746
You know what would
be really cool?

397
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:27,858
Decorate his bed like...

398
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:30,736
like a... like a ship,
with a sail and a mast...

399
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:34,968
It's negative.

400
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:49,808
Well, that's a relief, huh?

401
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,476
We really dodged a bullet.

402
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:58,246
So...

403
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,750
Let's celebrate, have a drink.

404
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:08,842
And by the way, you're still welcome
to stay till you find a place.

405
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:10,806
That's nice of you.

406
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,301
Thanks.

407
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:27,003
I cannot thank you enough
for doing this.

408
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,975
Thanks for taking the time out
of your day.

409
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,259
Yeah, Tom, I'm not sure
this is the best approach.

410
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:33,669
I've never done a session before
where half of the couple

411
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:35,386
didn't know I was
a marriage counselor.

412
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:36,478
We'll tell her...

413
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,294
Eventually. I just don't wanna
scare her off.

414
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,053
Look who just walked in
off the street.

415
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:44,274
Scott McKinney.

416
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:46,214
Remember? We pledged
Alpha Tau together.

417
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,648
- I told you about him.
- You won the beer pong championship?

418
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,447
You told her about that?

419
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,128
and then you threw up in the trophy.

420
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:56,429
He is far from his only accomplishment.
He's got a PHD.

421
00:21:57,944 --> 00:22:00,291
Well, I'd love to chat,
but I have cheese to grate.

422
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:02,262
Honey, no, wait, please.

423
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:05,532
I will do that later.
I want you guys...

424
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,535
To know each other.
I mean,

425
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:11,460
this guy... is my boy.

426
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,339
So Scott got married
the same year that we did.

427
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,295
How's your wife liking Fairview?

428
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:23,386
Well her whole family's back east,
so she... she kind of resisted the move.

429
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:26,155
Really? So that was
a source of conflict?

430
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:30,036
Yes. All couples have their conflicts.
I'm sure you've had your share.

431
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,203
- Sure, now and then.
- Emphasis on "now."

432
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:38,274
Scott shared with us. We're going
through kind of a rough patch.

433
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:41,034
I see. I'm sure it's something
you will get through.

434
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:44,028
The trick is to keep those lines
of communication open.

435
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:46,537
Boy. Easier said than done.

436
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,395
So this rough patch... what--

437
00:22:49,595 --> 00:22:52,671
what would you say
is the underlying issue there?

438
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:57,968
Well, Scott, I'm not sure
i would say,

439
00:22:58,182 --> 00:23:00,000
particularly not to
someone I just met.

440
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:02,557
He's just trying to help.If you ask me,

441
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:04,969
I'd say it started when
our manager, Rick, quit.

442
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,532
Okay, and how did that
make you feel, Lynette?

443
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:12,151
I am not answering that.

444
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:14,607
This is not a therapy session.

445
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,595
But if it were, what
would you say?

446
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:24,817
Dear God you didn't.

447
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:26,882
Didn't what?

448
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,283
Give it up, Tom.

449
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,567
Yes, Lynette, I am
a couples counselor.

450
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:35,041
Really? And what do you
call this, ambush therapy?

451
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:36,433
It was my idea.

452
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:39,258
Look, I'm just trying to get you
to talk about what is going on.

453
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,079
And don't tell me that
nothing's going on!

454
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,303
No, Good.

455
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:43,611
All our cards are on the table.

456
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:44,732
Cram it!

457
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:49,509
I've been unhappy lately.
I am working through some issues,

458
00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:51,636
but that is something I need
to do on my own.

459
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:53,686
Talking about it doesn't help...
not to you,

460
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:56,111
and certainly not to
Dr. Beer pong.

461
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:05,080
Well, I'm biing you for a whole hour,
so is there anything else on your mind?

462
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:10,372
I mean, I'm sorry, but this time,
Gaby has just crossed the line,

463
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,220
and I will not make myself
sit through her wedding.

464
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:15,097
Julie thinks I'm overreacting.

465
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:16,950
You don't think I'm overreacting,
do you?

466
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:19,219
- Yeah, a little. - Absolutely not.

467
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:21,792
What? She asked.

468
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:24,466
Look, even if
Gaby is in the wrong here...

469
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:27,929
And she... she is hugely,
hideously wrong...

470
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:30,307
Do you really want to
boycott her wedding?

471
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,483
She said that I would make Mike
wish he was back in a coma.

472
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,252
I think her point...

473
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:39,169
And again, I wish she'd express
herself a little more tactfully...

474
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,780
was that marriage is unpredictable.

475
00:24:40,953 --> 00:24:42,877
We can't know what
it'll be until we're in it.

476
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,506
Don't defend that
self-centered brat.

477
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,516
She steals Susan's wedding and
then expects to stay friends.

478
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:51,739
She divorces Carlos and doesn't want
anyone else to date him.

479
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,281
You know, I've never known
anyone as

480
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:56,252
dishonest and manipulative.

481
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,419
Speaking of Carlos,
I hear he got evicted.

482
00:24:58,615 --> 00:25:00,383
Yeah, that was a real shocker.

483
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:04,161
Anyway, you stick to your guns, and
don't you dare go to that wedding.

484
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:05,914
It could ruin your friendship.

485
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,330
Are you willing to take that chance?

486
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:10,818
No, I guess not.

487
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,070
Wuss.

488
00:25:13,717 --> 00:25:18,082
Well, at least get her a thoughtless,
crappy gift, like a blender.

489
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:20,835
I got you a blender for Christmas.

490
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,283
And I use it every day.

491
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,004
Gotta go.

492
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,817
Honey, I am so sorry.

493
00:25:49,036 --> 00:25:50,163
I hope you don't hate me.

494
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:52,391
I don't. I was just on my way
to apologize to you.

495
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,237
Just so you know,
I changed all my flowers.

496
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,224
- You don't have to.
- The hell I don't.

497
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,586
Those peach tulips belong to you...

498
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:00,636
And so do these.

499
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,999
Thank you.
I was just bringing you this.

500
00:26:04,953 --> 00:26:08,348
Well, we got chocolate and wine.
Your place or mine?

501
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:14,657
I'm so glad we're doing this.
I hate it when we fight.

502
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:18,037
Me, too, and I'm so sorry about
that comment I made about Mike.

503
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,523
It was way out of line.

504
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,823
You guys are gonna
be insanely happy.

505
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:23,466
I think so, too.

506
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:27,306
But, you know, then I rember, that's
what I thought about me and Karl.

507
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:29,464
Please. Mike is not Karl.

508
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:32,921
Well, you know, when I married him,
Karl wasn't Karl.

509
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:36,160
And I think that's why
I got so mad at you.

510
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,037
Because 99% of me

511
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,555
is sure that we're gonna
be totally happy.

512
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:44,326
But then what you said...
It just stirred up that pesky 1%.

513
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,032
Honey, please. If anyone
should be nervous, it's me.

514
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:49,253
I met Victor three months ago.

515
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,365
I mean, I'm crazy
about him. It's just,

516
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:53,672
the thought of saying
those vows again?

517
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:55,206
That's scary.

518
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:58,600
Lynette is right.
You know, marriage is like...

519
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:01,088
It's like these bonbons.

520
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,717
You never know what you're getting
until you're in the middle of it.

521
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:08,242
It's one of those hard jelly ones.

522
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:10,370
Do you think that's an omen?

523
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:12,748
Honey, you're gonna be okay.

524
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,993
All right? We're gonna help
each other through this.

525
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:16,166
Right.

526
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:20,758
And getting married is scary,

527
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:23,425
but at least
we'll be doing it together.

528
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:28,324
My God!
We should totally do that!

529
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,093
- What?
- Get married together!

530
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,853
You and me?

531
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:35,990
Well, I'm beyond flattered.

532
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:38,681
I find you to be an incredibly
attractive woman. I just...

533
00:27:38,998 --> 00:27:42,675
No, stupid.
I mean, a double wedding!

534
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:46,810
I would love that!

535
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:50,002
And then you wouldn't be mad at me for
the date, and I wouldn't feel guilty.

536
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:52,255
And we could be brides...
Together!

537
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:56,397
Yes! Let's celebrate.

538
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,039
More chocolate.

539
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:02,600
And just so you know, if I was
a lesbian, I'd totally do you.

540
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,314
That's good to know.

541
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,283
<i>It's a fact of life that brides-to-be
who agree to

542
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:18,147
<i>double weddings late at night
often feel differently

543
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:19,649
<i>come the dawn.

544
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:24,608
<i>This change of heart was certainly true
in the case of Susan Mayer...

545
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:28,195
<i>And even more so...

546
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:31,347
<i>For Gabrielle Solis.

547
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,476
Morning.

548
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:35,686
Hi, honey.

549
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:40,208
I hope I didn't wake you last night.
I was at Susan's till midnight.

550
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:41,510
Is something wrong?

551
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,955
No, not exactly.
Just a...

552
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,521
small change of plans
about the wedding.

553
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:48,687
What kind of change?

554
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:50,611
See...

555
00:28:52,473 --> 00:28:55,367
Susan was really upset...

556
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:58,934
I mean, I've never seen
Gaby so torn up with guilt.

557
00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:02,162
...practically in tears over
this whole wedding date thing.

558
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:06,112
And she kept saying,
"<i>please, let me make it up to you!</i>"

559
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:09,121
So after an hour of this,
I suddenly heard myself say...

560
00:29:10,232 --> 00:29:12,000
"<i>hey, how about a double wedding?</i>"

561
00:29:12,235 --> 00:29:14,347
wanted to bite my tongue
the minute it came out.

562
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:16,975
She's so excited, so needy.

563
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:19,572
...jumping up and down
and hugging me.

564
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:21,042
I mean, what could I say?

565
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:23,279
So we're kind stuck.

566
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:26,150
So what do you think?

567
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,373
I think anything that makes
you happy is fine by me.

568
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,101
Will this make you happy?

569
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,144
I'm screwed.

570
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,108
I cannot get out of this without
hurting her feelings.

571
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:40,237
Well, maybe this'll help...
I forbid it.

572
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:42,083
You do?

573
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,047
Sure. Tell her that your groom's
an old-fashioned guy,

574
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,926
and he doesn't want to see anybody
on that altar but his bride.

575
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:50,554
If she gets mad, have her
take it up with me.

576
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,456
So this is what marriage is about?

577
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:56,451
Having someone to hide behind?

578
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,658
So what do youhink?

579
00:29:59,837 --> 00:30:01,136
You're gonna have to undo this.

580
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:03,865
How? look I know I shouldn't
have offered, but I did.

581
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:06,204
- I can't just take it back.
- You're gonna have to.

582
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:08,269
Do you have any idea what
this day means to me?

583
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:12,321
I do, and I know you've worked really
hard to make our wedding perfect.

584
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:14,723
Exactly. Do you think I want
to share it with your friend

585
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,051
and her ex-convict fiancé?

586
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:19,022
That's your problem?

587
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:21,103
Gaby, I'm the mayor of this town.

588
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:23,121
How's it gonna look?
There'll be press there.

589
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,419
Press? At our wedding?

590
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,022
We're public figures.

591
00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:28,846
So all of this planning and
attention to detail...

592
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,613
that's all been about your image?

593
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:33,758
Of course not. Gaby, this is gonna
be the proudest day of my life,

594
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:36,269
and I'm not sharing the spotlight
with anyone.

595
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:38,107
How about the bride?

596
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:39,366
Please.

597
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:41,729
Every eye in that place
is gonna be on you.

598
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:44,741
Every woman will wish they were you.
Every guy will wish they had you.

599
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:46,493
It's gonna be great.

600
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,894
Tell your friends you're sorry.

601
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:50,975
Tell 'em I'll even pay for
eir wedding.

602
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:52,860
But they're not sharing mine.

603
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:04,230
Here's a 1-bedroom at the oaks
with a view of the golf course.

604
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,060
That's gonna go fast.

605
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:08,844
You know, I'm gonna call on
this first thing in the morning.

606
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:10,753
Or...

607
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:14,140
I know this is the last thing you'd
expect to hear from me, but...

608
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:18,369
What if you stayed here with me,

609
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:21,044
and we tried to have a baby?

610
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:26,763
You're serious?

611
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:30,361
I saw the look on your face
when that test came back negative.

612
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:32,269
Admit it.

613
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:34,843
You were disappointed.

614
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:38,152
Yeah, maybe a little.

615
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:39,763
Well...

616
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:42,172
So was I.

617
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,722
- You were?
- Yeah, I was.

618
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,882
You know, having Travers here
made me realize that...

619
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,440
I like being a mom.

620
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,208
And you're so great with him.

621
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,928
Well, think...

622
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:57,284
We could have that all the time.

623
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,427
Edie, nobody wants
a kid more than me.

624
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:02,866
It's just...

625
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,214
We're not head over heels in love.

626
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:09,171
We like each other, right?

627
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:13,676
I mean, that's more than a lot of
parents have going for them.

628
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:15,256
It's...

629
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:16,747
Just a very big step.

630
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,610
Carlos, look around.

631
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,613
Everyone's taking big steps...

632
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:24,209
Gaby and Victor, Susan and Mike.

633
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:26,509
And this could be our step.

634
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:30,855
And we both need to love someone.

635
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,314
No one said it had to be each other.

636
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:40,951
Just think about it.

637
00:32:58,781 --> 00:33:00,158
Let's do it.

638
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:07,516
You really want to?

639
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:12,663
I'm tired of waiting for
my life to start.

640
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:20,107
Imagine, with your genes and mine,
that child is gonna be a knockout!

641
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:25,501
I'm gonna brush my teeth, I'm gonna
flush those birth control pills,

642
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:27,511
and we're gonna get crackin'.

643
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:54,871
- How are you doing?
- Good.

644
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:57,499
Listen. We need to talk.

645
00:33:57,678 --> 00:33:59,540
I spoke to Mike, and,

646
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,998
he's just not really into
the whole double wedding thing.

647
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,211
Mike said no?

648
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:08,160
He sort of wants the day
just to be about us.

649
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,381
So we're gonna wait till the fall.

650
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,094
I'm so sorry.

651
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:15,129
No, it's okay. Victor was kind
of on the fence about it, too.

652
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:17,756
Good! I mean, not that
they said no, just...

653
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,270
'cause I really wanted to do it.

654
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,601
Me, too. I think it would've
been so much fun.

655
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:26,404
I gotta go.
I'm gonna meet François.

656
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,267
See ya. By the way...

657
00:34:30,484 --> 00:34:34,208
You know that 1% sliver of a doubt thing
I told you about? Totally gone.

658
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:37,032
Any question I had about
Mike's been answered.

659
00:34:38,988 --> 00:34:41,147
That must feel really great.

660
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,695
I feel really good about this.

661
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:53,533
I do, too.

662
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:56,365
Our friends are probably
gonna make fun of us.

663
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:58,226
I'm sure.

664
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:00,760
But who cares?
It's gonna be great.

665
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:03,435
I'm so happy we're gonna
be living together.

666
00:35:03,654 --> 00:35:05,507
We're gonna have so much fun.

667
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:07,781
I'll be right out.

668
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,731
Let's make a baby.

669
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:02,848
I talked to my back doctor today.

670
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:04,403
What did he have to say?

671
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:05,812
He said, assuming

672
00:36:05,984 --> 00:36:07,799
I exercise reasonable caution,

673
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:10,325
I can have sex again.

674
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,125
And what would that have
to do with me?

675
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:16,067
Well, you don't seem to want
to talk to me these days

676
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:19,368
so I figured it's the one thing
that we can do together

677
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:20,963
without speaking.

678
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:26,021
Remember when I was giving birth
to the twins and screaming in agony

679
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,462
'cause Porter was dragging
my uterus out with him?

680
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:32,060
Well, I was more in the mood
for sex then than I am now.

681
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:37,611
I'm your husband. I have to find a way
to connect to you somehow.

682
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:40,927
So we can have sex or we can talk.

683
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:44,236
Your call.

684
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,857
Fine. Let's have sex.

685
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:51,109
- What?!
- Yeah. Let's get this off.

686
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,722
What, you would rather have sex
with me than talk to me?

687
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,374
- That hurts.
- I said I'd have sex.

688
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:59,681
- I didn't say I'd make love.
- You wanna play rough?

689
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:01,092
'cause I could play rough.

690
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,798
Cut it out!

691
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:05,355
Sorry. I'll try to be gentler
as I move down south.

692
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:10,255
Okay, fine!

693
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:12,179
You are mad at me.

694
00:37:12,742 --> 00:37:15,637
But name one thing that
I have done to deserve it!

695
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:17,671
You had lunch with Rick.

696
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:21,566
You're damn right I did.
I saw the security tape.

697
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:24,757
What was I supposed to do, pretend
that nothing was going on?!

698
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,167
Nothing was going on!
He never touched me!

699
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,677
And I wasn't gonna sit around
and wait until he did!

700
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,311
I am glad that I made him quit!

701
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,775
You didn't make him quit!
I fired him!

702
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:36,276
You what?

703
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:39,337
The idiot told me he had feelings for
me, which he never would've done if

704
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:42,184
you hadn't pushed him, and now
he's gone. It's all your fault.

705
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:43,842
My back!

706
00:37:51,777 --> 00:37:52,888
Honey?

707
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:03,065
It'll just be a few more minutes,
mrs. Scavo.

708
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,036
The doctor's oking at
your C.A.T. Scan.

709
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,241
Thank you.

710
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,659
This whole thing is ridiculous.
I bumped my head.

711
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,740
Lynette, you were dizzy
and throwing up.

712
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,625
You can't be too careful.

713
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:16,580
Well, I feel just fine now.

714
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:24,075
When Rick said
he had feelings for you,

715
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,204
what did you say?

716
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:31,589
I said that it was
totally inappropriate,

717
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,232
and then I fired him.

718
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:39,212
Do you have feelings
for him, Lynette?

719
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:46,065
Do you have feelings for Rick?

720
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:48,583
I would never cheat on you.
You know that.

721
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,445
That's not what I asked.

722
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:56,789
Did you fall for him?

723
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,334
God.

724
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:14,732
Nothing happened.
He's gone. It's over.

725
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:18,080
Don't tell me that it's over. We've been
fighting about this all week.

726
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:20,301
You miss him, don't you?

727
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,375
Don't do this.

728
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:24,877
Damn.

729
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,428
Not now. I can't.

730
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:37,828
That's me.

731
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:39,314
I'll be back.

732
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,359
Actually, I'd... rather have you
both come in for this.

733
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,383
Is it a concussion?

734
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,526
No, it's just a bruise.

735
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,638
Good.

736
00:39:57,015 --> 00:40:00,895
But I noticed something in your
C.A.T. scan that concerns me.

737
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:05,938
You have a few swollen lymph
nodes in your neck.

738
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:08,542
I wanna send you in for a biopsy.

739
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,028
A biopsy? Why?

740
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:13,126
Have you noticed any change
in your appetite lately?

741
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:15,105
Any fatigue, fevers, uh...

742
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:16,732
Stop. Just... stop.

743
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,680
What is it you think I have?

744
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:23,396
I don't want you to panic.
This can be any number of things.

745
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,173
Is one of them cancer?

746
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:29,528
It could be lymphoma.

747
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,931
We're hoping the biopsy
will rule that out.

748
00:40:36,377 --> 00:40:39,068
If you look at the C.A.T. scan...

749
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:44,043
You can see this white area here

750
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:45,279
stands out.

751
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:48,460
These are called submandibular
lymph nodes.

752
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,702
Lymphoma can vary according to
the type of cell that multiplies and

753
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,369
how the cancer presents itself.

754
00:40:56,635 --> 00:41:00,656
There are two types Hodgkin's and
non Hodgkin's lymphoma.

755
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:11,003
<i>From the moment we wake up
in the morning

756
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:14,041
<i>Till our head hits the pillow at night

757
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:17,767
<i>our lives are filled with questions.

758
00:41:21,154 --> 00:41:22,552
Is it morning yet?

759
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,399
<i>Most are easily answered
and soon forgotten.

760
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,886
Not yet, sweetheart.

761
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:30,154
You go back to sleep now.

762
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:33,547
<i>But some questions are
much harder to ask

763
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,636
<i>because we're so afraid
of the answer.

764
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:42,099
<i>Will I be around to watch
my children grow up?

765
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:48,862
<i>Am I making a mistake
by marrying this man?

766
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,674
<i>Could he ever truly love me?

767
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:03,119
<i>And what happens when
we ask ourself the hard question

768
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,031
<i>and get the answer
we'd been hoping for?

769
00:42:08,913 --> 00:42:12,165
<i>Well, that's when happiness

770
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:13,586
<i>begins.
