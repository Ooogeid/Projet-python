1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,270
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,270
We had an agreement to keep things casual.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,660
Susan made her feelings clear.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,100
So if I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you? No, it wouldn't.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,550
You work here?

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,410
I'm great with food. I understand business.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,530
Bree made orson a partner.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,140
Is she still asking you questions about me? A few.

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,460
And dave took steps to get karen mccluskey out of the way.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,980
You think you can screw with me?

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,200
Karen! Stop doing that.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,520
As a masseur for the fairview country club,

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,040
Carlos solis had become an expert

14
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,400
On how to make women happy.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,480
That's why he always had scented candles waiting

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,280
For sue bridges...

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,760
New age music for betsy daniel...

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,230
And apple schnapps for shannon glenn.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,900
Yes, carlos had made a lot of women happy

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,570
Over the years.

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,070
But on one very unusual wednesday afternoon...

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,500
He made mrs. Virginia hildebrand

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,540
A little happier...

24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,640
Than he intended.

25
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,500
Helen said your last reservation just canceled.

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,140
Do you want a ride home? Thanks, clay. That'd be great.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,350
Um... Can I ask you something? How long you been a masseur?

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,600
14 years.

29
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,440
Okay. And in all those years...

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,530
Have you ever accidentally given a woman...

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,940
An orgasm? An orgasm?!

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,780
Keep your voice down. You want to get me fired?

33
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,160
How do you accidentally give a woman an orgasm? I don't know.

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,490
I can barely give my girlfriend one, and I try really hard.

35
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,540
All I did was touch her back.

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,260
Are you sure?

37
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,830
Some of these old broads-- their bodies drop.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,820
Not everything's where it's supposed to be.

39
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,780
I may be blind, but my sense of touch is just fine.

40
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,820
Well, then maybe she just really liked the massage.

41
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,120
You wouldn't believe the moaners I get on my

42
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,230
Table. I'm telling you, her body was quivering

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,750
And she could barely breathe.

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,030
All right, well, there's one sure-firway to find out.

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,500
Where's your tip envelope? On the counter.

46
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,620
How much she leave me?

47
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,990
Enough for two orgasms.

48
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,090
Yes...

49
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,670
Carlos solis was an expert on how to make women happy.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,750
I'm about to go get groceries. Where are your tips?

51
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,750
Oh, my god! How did you get so much?

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,570
And he knew the best way to keep his wife happy...

53
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,450
Just... Good at my job.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,110
Was to lie.

55
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,590
There are dangerous women in this world--

56
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,900
Devious predators waiting to strike.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,920
You can spot them by the lipstick they use,

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,380
The shoes they wear

59
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,390
And the perfume they choose.

60
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,220
But the easiest way to spot a dangerous woman

61
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,760
Is to see how she behaves...

62
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,260
I am about to make you so happy.

63
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,820
With another woman's husband.

64
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,320
Amy, don't worry about the lunch specials.

65
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,830
I am only two blocks away. I'll take care of it once i...

66
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,410
Actually, you do them. I'm gonna be a while.

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,240
Tom?

68
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,360
H--lynette, hey. What--what are you doing here?

69
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,930
So funny. I was gonna ask you the same question.

70
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,970
But I was gonna start with "what the hell?"

71
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,670
You remember anne, right? Anne schilling.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,420
Kirby's mom.

73
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,910
We were room parents together in the third grade.

74
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
Right.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,640
So... What the hell?

76
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,150
Tom, why don't we just show her?

77
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,390
It's for my band.

78
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,370
Anne has been helping us find a rehearsal space.

79
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,620
That's right. You're a realtor.

80
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,560
Now I know what you're thinking. It seems like a waste of money.

81
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,500
But I just got them to reduce the rent

82
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,710
And throw in the utilities.

83
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,630
And you're always complaining about the nois

84
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,100
When we practice in the garage, so, you know...

85
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,340
What do you think?

86
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,210
It's great.

87
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,380
You do?

88
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,700
Wonderful.

89
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,080
Listen, I have to be somewhere by 10:00,

90
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,500
So why don't we sign a lease right now?

91
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,890
Wow! I-i was convinced that you would think it was a dumb idea.

92
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,160
Well... It's a little dumb,

93
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,600
But compared to what I was thinking...

94
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,760
What were you thinking?

95
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,470
Well, it's just...

96
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,820
I saw you two together, and i...

97
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,990
I didn't know that you were... And she looks so...

98
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,730
For god sakes, tom, the woman has to be somewhere.

99
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,490
Just sign the damn lease.

100
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,510
So out of nowhere, jackson says, "let's move in together."

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,620
I-i mean, of course I was stunned.

102
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,860
And then when I said no, he just broke up with me.

103
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,940
I mean, does he really expect me to be in love

104
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,200
After just five months? That's crazy.

105
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,040
Yeah, I guess, although his work on these moldings is amazing.

106
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,210
You really want me to repaint these, suzanne?

107
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,170
It's susan.

108
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,210
And he was the first one to say he didn't want to get serious.

109
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,570
Which is why I was happy. We were just having fun.

110
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,270
Well, maybe you should call him.

111
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,570
How do you like this color? Not so much.

112
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,480
Frank, how can I call him?

113
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,700
He's the one that ended it with me.

114
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,550
Look, the guy makes you happy.

115
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,700
He says he loves you.

116
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,950
You gonna let pride stop you

117
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,180
From finding out where this thing could go?

118
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,490
Come on.

119
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,100
Don't be stupid.

120
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,530
How much am I paying you?

121
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,500
$14 an hour.

122
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,910
That's not enough.

123
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,940
No, ma'am, it's not.

124
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,040
Carlos, what are you doing home?

125
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,810
Uh, virginia insisted on giving me a ride.

126
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,410
You must be gabrielle.

127
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,920
Carlos has told me so much about you.

128
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,460
I'm virginia hildebrand.

129
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,560
Oh! You are the mrs. Hildebrand.

130
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,710
Well, you're carlos' favorite client.

131
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,560
Well, mine, anyway.

132
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,430
I bought this top with that crazy tip you gave him.

133
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,610
Your carlos has helped my back problems

134
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,470
Like no masseur I have ever had.

135
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,330
I'm pain-free for the first time in years.

136
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,820
Oh, that's carlos for you. Mr. Magic hands.

137
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,270
He hits the ol' sweet spot every time.

138
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,950
Okay, gaby.

139
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,210
I should go now,

140
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,200
But promise you'll at least consider my little proposal.

141
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,870
What proposal?

142
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,950
I hate to stop when we're making so much progress,

143
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,000
But I need to go to europe for two months,

144
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,750
Mostly london and rome.

145
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,380
I'd be so grateful

146
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,150
If carlos were to accompany me as my personal masseur.

147
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
Two whole months?

148
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,830
See? I told you. It's too long, and gaby has the girls and--

149
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,380
I know it's a lot to ask,

150
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,230
Which is why I'm offering carlos $50,000.

151
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,780
$50,000?

152
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,220
Per month.

153
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,520
Well, pip-pip and arrivederci!

154
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,130
Gaby. I'll leave you two to discuss it.

155
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,300
Well, uh, what's to discuss? For that kind of money,

156
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,910
You can lock him in a cage and feed him peanuts.

157
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,830
I'll see you tomorrow, carlos. Lovely meeting you, gaby.

158
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,400
Carlos, don't even think about saying no to this!

159
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,840
She is not my only client.

160
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,170
I'll be letting down the rest if I go.

161
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,720
Mr. Banks could even fire me. Oh,

162
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,700
Don't worry about mr. Banks. I'll take care of him

163
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,440
Gaby! And so what if he fires you?

164
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,490
Once virginia tells all of her rich lady friends

165
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,810
About what you did for her,

166
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,000
They'll be lining up around the block.

167
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,790
Great.

168
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,060
Hey, great news.

169
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,960
I just got a call from my old friend, peter hickey.

170
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,160
I don't recall ever hearing that name before.

171
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,400
He's a friend from college. Anyway, he mentioned that

172
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,200
His parents' 50th anniversary was next month,

173
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,130
And I convinced him to let us cater it. Dinner for 80.

174
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,970
80?!

175
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,490
He shoots, he scores!

176
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,900
Orson! You are amazing!

177
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,930
One week on the job,

178
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,190
And he's already bringing in huge accounts.

179
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,630
That's great.

180
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,460
Well, better go marinate those scallops for the lunch tomorrow.

181
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,400
Oh, scallops? Done.

182
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,440
Done?

183
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,440
Mm. Oh, I also made the pesto mayonnaise,

184
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,850
And I put the individual cobblers in their ramekins.

185
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,890
Oh. Well, it looks like we're all set until the morning then.

186
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,760
Hey, why don't you, uh, take the afternoon off? And do what?

187
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,750
I don't know--read, relax, give yourself a pedicure.

188
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,330
Fine.

189
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,900
What do you bet I take my socks off

190
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,810
And see orson's already done it for me?

191
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,650
What are you doing?

192
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,170
Refrigerator needs cleaning.

193
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,940
No, it doesn't.

194
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,660
And besides, I gave you the day off. Now go home.

195
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,530
I'm thinking about moving to maryland.

196
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,000
Maryland?

197
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,210
Mm-hmm. Dylan's there with her husband,

198
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,010
And the baby's coming soon.

199
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,280
Maybe it's time for me to go inflict

200
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,550
Myself on them. You can't just up and move

201
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,530
You have a life here. No, I don't. I have a job--period.

202
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,620
No kids to raise, no husband, no boyfriend.

203
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,370
Might as well throw in the towel and... Go be a grandma.

204
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,140
Katherine, you are a vibrant, attractive woman. You--

205
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,400
Who hasn't had sex in two years.

206
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,260
That spells "grandma" to me.

207
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,340
I haven't made up my mind yet. Just let me think about it.

208
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,740
And help keep me busy.

209
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,440
When you're done with that,

210
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,770
The oven could use a really good scrubbing.

211
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,320
Bless you.

212
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,480
Karen?

213
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,960
Oh. Those must've set you back a chunk.

214
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,620
Yes, they did...

215
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,890
Not that you deserve them.

216
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,550
I don't blame you for being mad.

217
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,540
I'm not mad.

218
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,920
I'm furious.

219
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,190
Now what the hell were you thinking,

220
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,280
Coming at my husband with a baseball bat?

221
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,910
I know. I'm really sorry, edie.

222
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,380
The doctor had me on these new meds, and it made me loopy.

223
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,400
I thought dave was messing with my head,

224
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,990
And all the time, it was the damn pills.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,680
Well, I hope you stopped taking them.

226
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,880
You bet.

227
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,120
I had to get my marbles back.

228
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,280
Uh, look, I know you just got here,

229
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,180
But I am so sleepy and...

230
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,290
Of course. I'll see you when you get home.

231
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,400
Actually, I'm gonna call my sister

232
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,280
And see if I can stay with r for a while.

233
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,990
I don't think I should be on my own just yet.

234
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,330
Okay. Then I'll see you whenever.

235
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,590
Oh, be sure and tell dave how sorry I am.

236
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,120
He will be so glad.

237
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,460
He's really fond of you, you know.

238
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,930
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on.

239
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,810
Hey, sis. It's karen.

240
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,840
Do me a favor and get your sorry ass over to

241
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,410
Fairview memorial hospital a.S.A.P.

242
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,510
I need you big time,  kido.

243
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,180
Come in.

244
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,950
Hi. I'm looking for orson hodge. I'm peter hickey.

245
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,460
Oh! Yes, of course. Uh, I'm his wife bree.

246
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,970
I'm afraid he's out running errands,

247
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,830
But he's told me all about you.

248
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,810
Oh? Yes. He said you were roommates back in college.

249
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,030
Yes, we were.

250
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,100
Have a seat.

251
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,780
Anyway, my parents' 50th anniversary is coming up,

252
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,510
And I thought I'd surprise them with a family reunion.

253
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,740
What a thoughtful son you are.

254
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,650
So, uh, have you given any thought to the venue?

255
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,060
Uh, yes. I have a summer place up in lake pleasant.

256
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,580
Ah, pretty sure the terrace fits eight tables of ten.

257
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,700
My, that's a nice little terrace.

258
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,400
We, we will throw you a party so special

259
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,560
That you'll want us to cater your anniversary, too.

260
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,270
Uh, actually, I'm not married.

261
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,480
Well, let's talk about food.

262
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,430
With a new client,

263
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,810
What I usually do is discuss possible menus,

264
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,700
And then I have my very best chef

265
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,490
Prepare a sample dinner.

266
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,170
"sample dinner"?

267
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,460
We don't do sample dinners.

268
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,900
But this is orson's college roommate.

269
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,860
And... He's quite the catch!

270
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,210
Oh, wait a minute.

271
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,640
Is this a setup? Because I loathe blind dates.

272
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,750
Well, that's what's so great about it.

273
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,740
Technically, it's a business dinner.

274
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,790
It has all the potential upside of a date

275
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,410
While still being tax-deductible.

276
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,940
Fine. I will cook for the man.

277
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,770
But I am not going to get dressed up,

278
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm not going to put on makeup, and I am not going to flirt.

279
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,390
He came while orson was out.

280
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,950
I let him record a message on my phone.

281
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,820
Orson,sorry I missed you,

282
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,870
Catch you next time, okay?

283
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,970
You realize you could have just led with this

284
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,740
And saved us this whole discussion?

285
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,010
Jeez, roberta!

286
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,840
Put that damn thing out. You're not in a corner saloon.

287
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,020
Then how come there's bourbon in my coffee?

288
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,690
Do I have to call a nurse?

289
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,850
Fine. I drove 80 miles to see you, karen.

290
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,240
You better be dying, or you're gonna pay for my gas.

291
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,290
I'm not dying, but there's someone who sure wishes I was.

292
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,220
Son of a bitch landed me in here.

293
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,750
You tell me where to find him. I'll clean his damn clock.

294
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,970
No, we've got to be careful with this guy.

295
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,330
Mm. He's dangerous.

296
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,250
That's what you said about that biker in florida

297
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,430
Who now has to puree all his food.

298
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,490
Hmm, nearly forgot about him.

299
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,860
That was a fun vacation.

300
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,110
So what do you need me to do?

301
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,870
Let me come stay with you when I get outta here.

302
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,140
This guy thinks I'm out of commission,

303
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,590
And I want to keep it that way.

304
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,620
And you can help me do some digging.

305
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,900
You still work for that cell phone company? The...

306
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,540
Teleshore. Yes, god help me.

307
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,710
Good. Pull his records and see what turns up.

308
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,210
The name is dave williams.

309
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,580
How do you know he's with teleshore? I went through his mail.

310
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,420
God, you remind me of mom.

311
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,030
So what else you need?

312
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,740
Could you smuggle me in a cold brewski?

313
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,070
Boy, no one knows you like family.

314
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,600
Jackson? It's me.

315
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,450
Hello?

316
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,420
That'll work.

317
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,310
Are we ok?

318
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,150
I think so.

319
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,480
Good.

320
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,240
So who the hell are you?

321
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,400
Darcy.

322
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,640
Who the hell are you?

323
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,150
Susan.  Jackson's girlfriend.

324
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,760
He never said anything about a girlfriend when we hooked up in the club.

325
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,080
Well, when guys go slut hunting,

326
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,590
They tend not to play the girlfriend card.

327
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,330
You just call me a slut?

328
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,100
You met the guy in night, then you're in a shower.

329
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,670
I'm just doing the math.

330
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,270
Got the pizza. Oh... Crap.

331
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,420
So we break up,

332
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,920
And 15 minutes later you're with someone else?

333
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,850
You got over me fast.

334
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,020
I'm surprised it took 15 minutes. Stay out of this.

335
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,740
Susan, why are you here?

336
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,660
I wanted to talk about our future.

337
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,200
You--you said you didn't want a future.

338
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,360
Well, I was starting to change my mind,

339
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,850
And then I show up

340
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,070
And find 5 feet of lip gloss in the shower.

341
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,480
I brought hot wings. You're not getting any.

342
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,760
Hi. What's that for?

343
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,110
Well, I was gonna use it to wash down a bottle of sleeping pills

344
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,560
The next time your husband's "band"

345
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,370
Defiled another rock classic.

346
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,080
But since you got them a rehearsal space,

347
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,980
I thought we could share it over ice. Come on in.

348
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,600
Hey. We're taking off.

349
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,420
Remember, I'm spending the night at kirby's house.

350
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,710
Oh, right. And, kirby, tell your mom thanks.

351
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,790
That place she found for tom is already paying off.

352
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,360
Yeah, she said she was there yesterday

353
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,350
And said it was looking pretty cool. Sh-she was there? Why?

354
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,070
She was just dropping off some old furniture for mr. Scavo--

355
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,210
A couple chairs, lamp, futon.

356
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,060
Well, see you tomorrow.

357
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,720
Okay. Drive safely.

358
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,870
Um... Neat or rocks?

359
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,030
Rocks.

360
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,170
So why does tom need a bed in his rehearsal space?

361
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,500
Not a bed-- a futon, like a couch. That folds out to a bed.

362
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,140
What are you saying? Well,

363
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,930
If it's just a couch, why didn't tom tell you about it

364
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,490
How do you know he didn't? I don't. Did he?

365
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,290
No.

366
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,770
Well, good for you.

367
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,060
Good for you

368
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,240
For not worrying about your husband's bachelor pad.

369
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,690
You are not the teeniest bit paranoid, and I say brava.

370
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,100
Now why aren't we drinking?

371
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,460
Not bad! I mean, we were really cookin' there.

372
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,250
Tom, you got any beer in the fridge?

373
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,700
I got nothing but beer in the fridge.

374
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,090
All right, everyone, go grab a cold one.

375
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,640
You earned it. You sounded great.

376
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,580
Oh, do we blow. Oh, yeah.

377
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,240
Not you, though.

378
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,990
Man, you got the heart of a real blues guy.

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,430
Ah, that's what five years in prison'll do to ya.

380
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,870
Oh, yeah. I heard about that. Still...

381
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,340
It's fun, isn't it?

382
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,720
Highlight of my week.

383
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,000
You know, uh...

384
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,710
I was thinking, maybe we should bump up our rehearsal schedule,

385
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,310
You know, to start working the kinks out.

386
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,190
Ah, twice a week's about all I can handle

387
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,430
What are you doing that's more important than this?

388
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,330
Well, let's see. My job, my son.

389
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,310
Uh... Also, I just... Met this woman.

390
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,760
Oh, no, dude, not blowing us off for a girl.

391
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,290
Buddy, I just started seeing her, all right?

392
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,910
It's kind of important

393
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,350
For the whole "getting back on the horse" thing.

394
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,430
Right, what about saturday afternoon?

395
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,290
I mean, come on, man. We gotta do this.

396
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,650
Why? You're putting a lot of time and effort

397
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,880
Into a neighborhood garage band.

398
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,640
Why is it such a big deal to you?

399
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,910
It's not.

400
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,530
I'm--i'm just having a real good time.

401
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,340
All right, boys! What do you say?

402
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,630
We gonna drink beer or we gonna play some rock 'n' roll?

403
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,240
Tom, where are you?

404
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,570
Hey, babe, we just really got into a groove at rehearsal,

405
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,950
And I think we're gonna play for a couple more hours.

406
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,920
Yeah?

407
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,550
Anyway, I just wanna say don't wait up for me.

408
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,640
And I will, um, I'll see you in the morning, okay?

409
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,330
Okay. Bye.

410
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,190
Oh, my god.

411
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,040
Lynette!

412
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,050
You said you were rehearsing.

413
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,560
I know. I know.

414
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,000
The guys--the guys left, and I just figured I'd, uh...

415
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,780
Hang out for aittle bit.

416
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,240
Why can't you do that at home?

417
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,030
What the hell is this?

418
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,390
You moving out on me?

419
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,260
Why would I move out?

420
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,470
So you can have your affair--

421
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,660
You know, the one that follows the sports car

422
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,530
And the garage band

423
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,260
And wanting to quit your job,

424
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,330
The final stage of your midlife crisis.

425
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,350
Oh, and then...

426
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,340
When I hear anne schilling has been dropping by--

427
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,920
Lynette! She had a bunch of old, crappyurniture in her garage.

428
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,570
I bought it for 50 bucks.

429
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,120
You don't really think that...

430
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,940
Okay...

431
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,340
These past few months,

432
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,560
When we've been fighting about the car and the road trip,

433
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,530
Part...

434
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,860
Part of me thought that you were just complaining to complain,

435
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,770
Trying to ruin my fun.

436
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,730
But if it's affecting you like this,

437
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,610
If it's making you actually think

438
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,760
That I would hurt you in that way,

439
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,360
I'm done with all of this.

440
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,070
So you'll come home?

441
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,410
Of course.

442
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,930
Let me just square all this stuff away, okay?

443
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,370
And then I will see you ere.

444
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,690
Good.

445
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,620
Maybe when you come home,

446
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,160
You could teach me how to play that video game.

447
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,060
That'd be great.

448
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,040
Okay.

449
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,880
Hey, clay. Is mr. Banks around?

450
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,490
Uh, he's not back from lunch yet. What's up?

451
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,240
Oh, I need to sweet-talk him

452
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,230
Into giving carlos two months off.

453
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,310
Oh, you two going away somewhere? No, just carlos.

454
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,310
Mrs. Hildebrand is taking him to europe

455
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,050
As her personal massage therapist.

456
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,680
Personal massage therapist?

457
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,860
Paying him a fortune. But he's worth it.

458
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,180
I mean, what he's done for that woman,

459
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,910
No one else has been able to do.

460
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,120
So... He told you about that?

461
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,430
They both did. You should have seen the woman,

462
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,550
Looking at carlos, gushing like crazy.

463
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,700
And you're okay with them going away together?

464
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,850
Why should I be jealous?

465
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,180
The woman's, like, 60.

466
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,200
If she gets off on carlos' magical touch, what do I care?

467
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,720
Yeah. Well, you're broad-minded.

468
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,200
You know, if my girlfriend knew

469
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,660
That my ssages were giving a woman orgasms,

470
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,670
No matter how old she was-- whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody used the "o" word.

471
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,630
He didn't mention that?

472
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,180
No! He's giving her orgasms?!

473
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,480
Nah, not deliberately!

474
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,220
Uh, he swears he's only been doing his standard massage.

475
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,060
Oh, I bet he does! Where is he? Is she here now?

476
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,160
Oh, no, no.

477
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,050
She prefers her place, so she's been sending a car for him.

478
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,760
Where? Where does she live?

479
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,660
It's that big house

480
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,210
On the corner of lake and pinehurst.

481
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,450
I'm sorry, gaby. Is there anything I can do?

482
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,610
Hmm. Well, when the time comes, an alibi would be nice.

483
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,620
We need to talk.

484
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,750
Sorry, bad time.

485
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,230
I have the mailman upstairs in my tub.

486
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,640
You know what?

487
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,190
You have no right to be mad at me.

488
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,100
I don't?

489
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,260
I try to commit to you, and you push me away.

490
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,120
I try to move on, and I'm a shallow jerk,

491
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,660
What the hell are you doing?

492
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,220
Yeah, I have been married twice,

493
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,050
And both times that's imploded,

494
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,000
So really, I feel like...

495
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,190
Love is not my friend.

496
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,810
You know, i-i wish that I could say it was just rotten luck,

497
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,880
But...

498
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,490
I just am thinking that...

499
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,430
I can't do this.

500
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,770
You can't?

501
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,050
I-i never even had a real girlfriend before I met you.

502
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,870
I didn't want one.

503
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,260
And the first time I try to commit, bam! I get smacked.

504
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,760
Look, I don't even know where we are anymore.

505
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,000
We really messed this up, didn't we?

506
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,120
Pretty much, yeah.

507
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,730
We just have so much baggage.

508
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,380
I sh we could start over.

509
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,690
Can we start over?

510
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,950
Hello?

511
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,380
Hi. Uh, is Susan Mayer there?

512
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,710
May I ask who's calling?

513
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,410
This is jackson... Braddock.

514
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,710
Uh, we met once. I don't know if you remember me.

515
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,030
I have brown hair.

516
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,270
Uh, yeah. I think I remember you.

517
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,610
Well, anyway, I thought we really clicked,

518
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,050
So I was wondering if you might want to have dinner with me.

519
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,100
Okay.

520
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,650
When?

521
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,850
Tomorrow.

522
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,070
I know this great mexican--

523
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,310
French place.

524
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,760
Sounds great.

525
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,200
Pick me up at 7:00.

526
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,530
Great.

527
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,430
Where do you live?

528
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,570
May I help you? Excuse me.

529
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,870
I am gabrielle solis.

530
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,160
Perhaps you know my husband? He "rubs" your boss.

531
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,450
Where are they?

532
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,680
I am under strict instructions not to disturb mrs. Hildebrand.

533
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,130
You can wait here.

534
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,660
Fine.

535
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,380
When the cops bust up this brothel,

536
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,250
I'm gonna tell them you're the madame.

537
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,240
Mmm. Mmm, yes.

538
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,410
That's it, right there.

539
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,590
You sure this isn't too rough?

540
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,900
Mmm. No way.

541
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,840
Go deeper. I can take it.

542
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,160
Ahh. Hold on.

543
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,380
I've got a crick. I...

544
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,850
Carlos, I just remembered

545
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,640
I had an important business call to make.

546
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,150
Could you give me the room for a minute? Absolutely.

547
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,170
Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?

548
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,220
I know what you've been up to, and shame on you.

549
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,690
What are you talking about?

550
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,670
I know about... The big "o."

551
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,070
Oh, dear. He could tell?

552
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,650
I'm beyond mortified.

553
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,080
I understand your concern,

554
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,370
But I assure you it was only that one time.

555
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,780
It's never happened again.

556
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,530
And it never will, because if you think

557
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,600
I'm gonna let you drag carlos off to europe, you're nuts.

558
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,780
I suppose I should be flattered

559
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,590
That a woman as young and beautiful as you

560
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,960
Should see me as a threat.

561
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,550
But it would be a shame to let it end a friendship

562
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,210
That's come to mean so much to me.

563
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,950
Maybe a little too much.

564
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,180
Mrs. Solis, my husband's gone. I'm estranged from my family.

565
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,170
If you live with loneliness long enough,

566
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,840
It becomes an ache inside you-- an actual physical pain.

567
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,540
I thought I'd live with that pain the rest of my life.

568
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,500
Then your husband healed me.

569
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,240
Can you blame me for being grateful?

570
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,840
No, but I just think we should end things

571
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,970
Before they get any weirder.

572
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,240
Carlos tells me you used to be a fashion model.

573
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,770
I've always had a passion for clothes.

574
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,280
The reason I'm going to europe is

575
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,280
To see the couture collections in paris and milan.

576
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,460
Lucky you.

577
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,610
It's not so much fun going alone.

578
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,340
But if I had a knowledgeable companion like you

579
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,790
To be my guide...

580
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,070
In fact, you could be my personal shopper.

581
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,460
That is,

582
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,270
If you don't mind being paid in dresses.

583
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,500
Gosh, that's a...

584
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,010
A hell of a sweet offer,

585
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,700
But I've... Got the girls, and, um...

586
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,350
We'll bring them along.

587
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,470
Think what fun we'll have dressing them up.

588
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,060
What the hell? You're never too young to see paris, right?

589
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,310
I'm so glad!

590
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:00,230
I can see we're going to be great friends.

591
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,990
Carlos, I'm done with my call.

592
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,290
Hello!

593
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,790
Hey, hon. Check this out.

594
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,480
If it's the cat eating spaghetti,

595
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,760
I've already seen it.

596
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,300
It's our band logo.

597
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,170
We're thinking of getting t-shirts made up.

598
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,930
"blue odyssey"? Who came up with that?

599
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,340
This was the name of my brother's band

600
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,820
When he was in high school.

601
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,250
You have a brother?

602
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,160
Had. He died.

603
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,490
Well, you never told me about him.

604
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,900
What happened?

605
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,680
His name was steve.

606
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,280
He was a great guy...

607
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,120
Just kinda got caught up in drugs and couldn't get out.

608
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,860
He went to prison, and when he was there,

609
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,280
He was killed... By another inmate.

610
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,190
And what happened to the guy who killed him?

611
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,690
Oh, the court ruled it self-defense,

612
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,210
So the guy finished his time, and he got out.

613
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,760
I can't believe you've never told me about him.

614
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,170
I mean, it might help you to talk about stuff like that.

615
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,930
I have my own way of dealing with it.

616
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,480
Oh, sorry I'm late.

617
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,520
That rehearsal was awesome.

618
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,210
They're letting me sing lead vocal

619
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,330
On "hotel california." oh, that's nice.

620
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,690
Hey, was there a blue convertible

621
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,950
Parked in front of katherine's? Yes, there was. Nice one.

622
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,460
My god, he's still there. Who's still there?

623
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,680
Well, katherine's been lonely, so I set her up with a client,

624
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,570
And he's been there for over four hours,

625
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,970
So you know it's going well! Good for you! My clever little matchmaker.

626
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,540
Mmm. Ohh. Mwah. Well, you deserve some credit, too.

627
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,620
I mean, you brought us peter's business.

628
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,120
Peter? Peter hickey?

629
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,300
Yes.

630
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,080
You set him up with katherine? Is that bad?

631
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,600
Potentially.

632
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,820
Is he gay?

633
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,240
Ugh! I knew he had too much product in his hair.

634
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,260
No, it's just that when I booked the anniversary party,

635
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,210
I didn't want you to be uncomfortable around peter,

636
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,670
So I said we'd met in college, which is not actually the case.

637
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,490
Well, where did you meet? Prison.

638
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,690
Peter's a felon?

639
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,560
But he's so refined, so handsome.

640
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,340
Two qualities that did not serve him well behind bars.

641
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,110
My god, orson. What kind of criminal is he?

642
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,440
A killer or a rapist? Oh, no, no, no, nothing like that.

643
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,850
They got him for organ trafficking.

644
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,840
What?!

645
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,480
He was a surgeon, and it seems

646
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,230
That when the opportunity presented itself,

647
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,380
He'd harvest the odd liver or kidney

648
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,720
From a deceased patient

649
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,350
And then sell it on the black market. Are you telling me

650
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,440
That I set katherine up with a

651
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,910
Convicted graverobber?! Well, you said yourself

652
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,810
Women over 40 can only be so choosy.

653
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,330
That is not funny! I have to go warn katherine.

654
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,190
Hello?

655
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,540
Katherine, hi!

656
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,520
Is everything all right over there?

657
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,580
Yes, everything's fine.

658
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,030
Then why are you whispering?

659
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,310
Peter just fell asleep. I don't want to wake him.

660
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,900
Oh, my god.

661
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,870
You slept with him?

662
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,570
You can wag that finger all you like.

663
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,960
I've got just six words for you, bree hodge...

664
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,510
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

665
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,050
Oh, I just really wish you'd taken things more slowly.

666
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,550
Bree, you have given me the most magical night I've had

667
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,000
Since I don't know when.

668
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,060
Are you gonna make me feel bad about it now?

669
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,310
No, I'm not.

670
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,670
Oh! He is just so wonderful.

671
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,710
I tell you, if I'm not careful, this guy could steal my heart.

672
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,460
Well, if he tries, just promise you'll call.

673
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,510
Sorry I'm late.

674
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,090
I was sleeping so soundly.

675
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,220
Peter didn't want to wake me.

676
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,360
What's this?

677
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,620
A cosmopolitan. That's your favorite, isn't it?

678
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,890
It's 10:00 a.M. I don't want a drink.

679
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,700
You will.

680
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,540
But... These homeless people whose kidneys he bought--

681
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,830
He at least paid them well, right?

682
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,480
Oh, I am so, so sorry.

683
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,580
Oh, it's not your fault. You didn't know.

684
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,900
I have no one but myself to blame.

685
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,200
That's it. I'm going to maryland.

686
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,550
You can't just move because of one bad date.

687
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,230
You don't get it.

688
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,120
When we started this, you were just as lonely as I was--

689
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,950
Orson in jail, benjy gone.

690
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,810
And I felt bad for you,

691
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,500
But, boy, was it nice to have somebody in the same boat.

692
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,170
And then orson got out, and now he's here all the time.

693
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,540
And I feel like you're this...

694
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,340
Fun, happy power couple,

695
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,470
And I'm just this needy, pathetic idiot...

696
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,090
Who hops into bed

697
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,440
With the first pancreas thief who kisses her.

698
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,320
I should be with family.

699
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,300
And I'm not family?

700
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,120
Katherine, all my life, I wanted a sister.

701
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,670
And now I feel like I finally have one.

702
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,590
But we're always fighting and competing with each other.

703
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,750
Well, what could be more sisterly than that?

704
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,670
I know I'm not the most...

705
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,090
Demonstrative... Person, but I care about you deeply,

706
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,260
And if you were to just walk out of my life,

707
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,590
I would be very...

708
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,850
Very unhappy.

709
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,000
Well, I wouldn't want that.

710
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,210
Good.

711
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,230
Well, now that that's settled...

712
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,470
Let's make some pies. Okay.

713
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,170
Can I have another cosmo?

714
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,450
No.

715
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,870
Hey, is porter still at kirby's?

716
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,990
What's wrong with you? You've been antsy all night.

717
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,770
Nothing. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

718
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,310
Okay, I know what it is.

719
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,330
I have had this nagging feeling that I've forgotten something,

720
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,620
And then I just realized

721
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,570
I think I left the freezer door at scavo's open. You sure?

722
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,900
No. That's why it's gonna drive me crazy.

723
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,550
I better go down there and check. Mmm.

724
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,010
Okay.

725
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,050
Hurry back.

726
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,410
I'm so glad you were able to get away.

727
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,740
I didn't think you'd make it.

728
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,050
I'm glad my parents still think I'm young enough for sleepovers.

729
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,670
Crap! It's my dad!

730
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,230
Dad, hi. I was just--i was just...

731
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,020
I know what you were "just."

732
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,590
When I found this, I thought,

733
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,440
Oh, great!

734
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,630
One of the guys in the band is having an affair.

735
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,770
And then it hit me-- porter has a key.

736
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,570
Where is she?

737
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,060
Oh. Dad.

738
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,760
Don't.

739
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,670
She isn't wearing anything, all right?

740
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,320
Who is she?

741
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,510
Just some girl from english class.

742
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,010
You--you don't know her.

743
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,080
I'm gonna go in the bathroom.

744
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,000
You got 60 seconds to get her out of here.

745
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,860
Oh. Hey, mike.

746
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,140
Wow. Look at you all dressed up.

747
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:53,390
Oh, I was, um, kind of on a date.

748
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,400
Oh. How did it go?

749
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,210
Pretty bad.

750
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,520
Basically, she just grilled me all through dinner--

751
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,850
What do I think about this? What would I do if that?

752
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,480
I barely even know her.

753
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,030
I felt like I was on trial for my life. Oh, I'm sorry.

754
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,320
I just wanted somebody nice to have a cup of coffee with.

755
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,450
I guess that's too much to ask.

756
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,570
Well, it's kinda late for coffee, but...

757
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,720
I do have lemonade.

758
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,450
I'd settle for lemonade.

759
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,700
Hey, you know,

760
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,010
I know it seems like I am being hard on you,

761
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,970
But like I told you before,

762
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,970
I don't think

763
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,220
That you're emotionally ready for sex.

764
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,100
I know. You said.

765
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,560
Just making sure you heard me.

766
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,240
Now go to bed.

767
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,100
It's late.

768
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,770
Want me to, uh,

769
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,740
Put the car cover on for you first?

770
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,370
Sure. Thanks.

771
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,720
You shouldn't be here. Someone might recognize your car.

772
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,230
Is everything okay?

773
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,970
Yeah. My dad doesn't suspect anything.

774
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,870
I'm sorry if I got you in any trouble.

775
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,200
It's okay. You're worth it.

776
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,540
There are dangerous women in this world.

777
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,830
Some are lovers,

778
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,940
Blind to the consequences of their actions.

779
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,090
Some are wives enraged by the betrayal

780
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,000
Of those they trusted.

781
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,680
Others are predators,

782
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,690
Deviously setting traps to get what they want.

783
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,240
If you're unlucky enough to come upon

784
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,890
One of these dangerous creatures,

785
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,170
The safest thing to do...

786
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,040
I pulled those records you asked for.

787
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,960
Looks like your mr. Williams is keeping a little secret.

788
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,360
Is run the other way.
