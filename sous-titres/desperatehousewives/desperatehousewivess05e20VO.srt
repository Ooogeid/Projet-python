<i>Lynette went back to work,
and Tom filled his days...</i>

3
00:00:05,552 --> 00:00:07,679
- You're good at this girl talk thing.
- Thanks.

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:11,307
- Do you at least know why he steals?
- I steal to hurt you.

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,647
<i>Bree struggled to understand
her husband's problem,</i>

6
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:17,915
<i>while down the street,
Edie finally figured out</i>

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,439
- <i>her husband's plan...</i>
- You married me to get close

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,059
- to the man who killed your family.
- He was never punished.

9
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:45,155
<i>Rose Kemper was a survivor.</i>

10
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,520
You could see
that by looking into her eyes.

11
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:51,596
<i>She had buried one husband,</i>

12
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,660

<i>As a result,</i>

16
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:05,564
<i>Rose Kemper was no
longer afraid of anything.</i>

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,588
<i>Sadly, the man who climbed
into her window that night</i>

18
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,482
<i>was unaware this...</i>

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,993
<i>But Rose was more than happy</i>

20
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,993
<i>to explain it to him.</i>

21
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,471
Get out of here!
Just get the hell out!

22
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:32,729
I'm calling the police.
Do you hear me?!

23
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:51,151
Mrs. Kemper?

24
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:58,095
Katherine! What are you doing here?

25
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:01,772
I heard you weren't feeling well,
so I brought you some flowers.

26
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:04,465
The doctors tell me
you had a mild heart attack.

27
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:06,332
Did they tell you why?

28
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,782
It was death.

29
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,497
He came for me.

30
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:17,646
- Death came for you?
- But I chased him out

31
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:19,592
with my baseball bat.

32
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:23,805
I gave him a good whack,
too, right on the old noggin.

33
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:27,367
How much morphine
do they have you on?

34
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:31,127
You know that shelf
where I keep my knickknacks?

35
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,353
He tried to take one.

36
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,157
Death collects knickknacks.

37
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:39,689
And when he couldn't get me,
he went after that other lady...

38
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,776
The one who crashed.

39
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:44,021
Edie Britt?

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,121
Yes, and I saw everything.

41
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,373
Death just staggered
out into the street,

42
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:52,402
and he raised his hands

43
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:56,254
and he made her run
into that light pole.

44
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,787
You believe me, don't you?

45
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,500
I would never make
anything like this up.

46
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,893
I know you wouldn't, sweetheart.

47
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:10,733
Listen,

48
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:14,392
I'll stop by tomorrow.
You just get your rest.

49
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:21,894
If you see death
lurking in the hall,

50
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:24,903
you tell him he better
not come around here,

51
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,577
'cause I am not afraid of him.

52
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:31,755
<i>No,</i>

53
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:35,263
<i>Rose Kemper was not
afraid of anything...</i>

54
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:39,465
<i>But the man who had
broken into her home,</i>

55
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:43,518
<i>was now very afraid of rose kemper.</i>

<i>But some people

66
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,473
I know, but that's what happened.

67
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:34,276
I went for a walk,
tripped, and I hit my head on the curb.

68
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,804
Everything's looking much better.

69
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:40,866
I see no reason why
he shouldn't be released this weekend.

70
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:42,819
Really? That soon?

71
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:45,125
You can pick him
up in the afternoon.

72
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,248
I'll check
in one more time before you go.

73
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:58,501
You don't seem all that thrilled
about the prospect of me coming home.

74
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:01,980
Honey, I don't mean to be negative.
It's just...

75
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,079
What's gonna happen?

76
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:08,247
Will you
keep stealing and lying to me?

77
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:13,589
I love you, but I just
can't put up with that anymore.

78
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,086
Don't worry.
Things are gonna be different.

79
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:17,203
How?

80
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:19,508
I've been
doing a lot of thinking lately,

81
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:21,351
and I've decided,

82
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,576
finally, to be happy.

83
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:28,012
How can you
just decide something like that?

84
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,361
There are things
that I don't like about my life,

85
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:36,915
but there is so much that is good.

86
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:40,957
Do I really
wanna risk losing everything?

87
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:45,989
If I can decide
to be resentful and jealous,

88
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,539
I can damn well
decide to be happy...

89
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:51,636
And be the kind of husband

90
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,715
that you deserve.

91
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,687
Do you really mean that?

92
00:05:58,095 --> 00:05:59,307
I do.

93
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:03,467
I hope so, because
I just cannot take any more lying.

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,937
You won't have to.

95
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,374
I can promise you that.

96
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:17,841
Dave?

97
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,499
- He didn't answer.
- Now I'm starting to get worried.

98
00:06:30,746 --> 00:06:33,348
I left that casserolle
three days ago and it's still there.

99
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,405
I'm surprise
the squirrels haven't got into it.

100
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:38,275
Maybe they did. Anybody
seen any dead squirrels around here?

101
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:41,402
Even if Dave wants to be alone,
we have to make sure he's taken care of.

102
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:42,693
We owe it to Edie.

103
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,805
We keep showing up
until he lets us help him.

104
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:47,767
We need to be annoying and persistent.
We're good at that.

105
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:51,189
Who can come by later and check on him?
I'd do it, but I'm working late.

106
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,996
I'm in the classroom all day,
and I have meetings after.

107
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,029
- I have a rehearsal dinner to cater.
- And I have a garden club meeting.

108
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,833
You're in a garden club?

109
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:04,776
- I just joined.
- Wait.

110
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:07,897
There wouldn't happen to be actual
gardeners in this club, would there?

111
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,924
Hot shirtless gardeners

112
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:12,233
with great abs and
learner's permits?

113
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:15,403
Gee,
this bit just gets funnier and funnier.

114
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,474
We tease because we love.

115
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:20,332
Now back to Dave.
I'll ask Mike to check in on him.

116
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:23,159
- That'd be great.
- Tell him "annoying and persistent."

117
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:26,438
- And I can make another casserole.
- 'Cause he hasn't suffered enough.

118
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:30,329
That's a
bit that I never get tired of.

119
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:34,201
Dave?

120
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:36,429
It's Mike.

121
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:51,270
Sorry to barge in.

122
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:53,604
I just want to make sure you are ok.

123
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,102
Katherine made you lasagna.

124
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:07,647
Thought it'd be a good
idea to eat something.

125
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:12,670
Want me to get you a plate?

126
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,837
I'm good.

127
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:21,324
You'll get through this.

128
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:22,745
Buddy, you will.

129
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:26,724
- I have gone through some really...
- You've gone through nothing.

130
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:31,073
And if you stand there and try
to tell me you understand how I feel,

131
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:33,763
I swear to god,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

132
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:37,430
- I'm just trying to help.
- You can't!

133
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,695
So go back to Katherine
and your happy little life

134
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:42,606
and leave me the hell alone!

135
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:44,859
You're right.

136
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:49,415
I don't have any idea
what you're going through.

137
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:04,970
Sweetie, I'm home.

138
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,059
Don't make plans on tuesday.

139
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:16,266
We're having dinner
at the Solis' and...

140
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:20,206
What's that look on your face?

141
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,226
You didn't eat dairy again, did you?

142
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:24,813
I've been working out.

143
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:29,492
If you're good,
I'll let you cop a feel.

144
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:32,632
That's okay. I can see it from here.

145
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:34,137
Thrilling.

146
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:40,560
- You smell good.
- I just took a shower,

147
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,564
and I know where
you're going with this

148
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:46,332
- but I am exhausted.
- Come on, Lynette. Please?

149
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,569
Whining... that's hot.

150
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:53,798
Fine.

151
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,208
Let's have sex.

152
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:00,749
But I warn you, I'm just gonna lie here,
resenting you the whole time,

153
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,489
waiting for this hell to be over.

154
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,174
If you're sure.

155
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:11,284
All right, all right.
Okay, forget it.

156
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,327
Wait.

157
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:18,571
- You just took a shower? Where?
- At work.

158
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:21,613
I didn't know you
had a shower there.

159
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:23,339
I don't. Carlos does.

160
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:29,874
You went into Carlos' office,
stripped naked and took a shower?

161
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:32,404
No, I went into Carlos' bathroom,

162
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:34,751
closed the door,
then stripped naked and took a shower.

163
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:37,798
I'm not comfortable with this.
What if he walked in?

164
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,402
Maybe I'd get
that raise I've been asking for.

165
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,773
This isn't funny. You already
spend 16 hours a day with the guy,

166
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,056
and now I find out that some
of those hours, you are naked and wet.

167
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,423
Hours? It was two minutes.
It's not like I'm lighting candles

168
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:54,134
- and putting on Barry White.
- I don't care. I want it to stop.

169
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,069
Fine.

170
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:07,536
I should've just had sex.
I'd be asleep by now.

171
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:18,172
And ladies,
we have been asked by the city council

172
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,667
to beautify the center
divider on main street.

173
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:23,877
So make sure your calendars
are clear next tuesday.

174
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:28,591
I know I'm new here at the garden club,
but what's with all the gardening?

175
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:31,984
I thought this was just an excuse to
get together for bitchin' and boozin'.

176
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:35,118
- Blame Edna, the flower fascist.
- When we first joined,

177
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,955
we used to sit around in wicker chairs,
drinking margaritas

178
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,470
- and just looked at the flowers.
- I'd kill for a margarita.

179
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,448
Don't cluster, ladies.
Vary the colors.

180
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,877
And she's the one I'd kill.

181
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:49,145
Really, who died
and left her in charge?

182
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:52,539
Alice Koontz.
Grand mal seizure while driving.

183
00:11:57,294 --> 00:12:00,438
- This Edna has got to be stopped.
- How?

184
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:04,024
Oh, my god.
You're planning a coup, aren't you?

185
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:05,241
I'm in.

186
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:06,887
Me, too.

187
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:09,943
That's three. Who else can we get?

188
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,117
Definitely Judy.

189
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,993
And Terry's allergic to everything.

190
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:17,286
One bee sting,
and she blows up like...

191
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:18,872
Like, Judy.

192
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:22,529
- How about the woman in the overalls?
- Phyllis? She just got her second DUI.

193
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:24,732
If there's cocktails, she's in.

194
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,478
So the lush gives us six.

195
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:31,056
- What about them?
- No way. They're all friends of Edna's.

196
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:33,891
All right,
so they have six, and we have six.

197
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:35,763
We're gonna need a tiebreaker.

198
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,770
Are men allowed to join the group?

199
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,982
I don't knowhy they wouldn't be.

200
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,891
Ladies, start your blenders.

201
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:57,167
- I heard you wanted to see me.
- Yes, Dr. Kagen.

202
00:12:57,572 --> 00:13:00,219
I heard you're treating
a lady across the hall.

203
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:03,082
- You mean Rose Kemper?
- She's actually my neighbor.

204
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:06,557
- I wanted to know how she's doing.
- Sorry. I can't discuss her condition

205
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,430
with anyone she's not related to.

206
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,415
That's a problem.

207
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:15,031
She has no family or friends,
for that matter.

208
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:18,000
And, because of her dementia...

209
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,905
Who said she has dementia?

210
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:22,834
Certainly you've heard
some of her bizarre ramblings.

211
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:26,526
If she doesn't have dementia,
it's something just as troubling.

212
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,639
She has been saying
some very disturbing things.

213
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,512
But I wasn't aware it
was an ongoing situation.

214
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,271
Yes, it is.

215
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:38,632
And I'm so worried about
her going back to that big house

216
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:40,481
with no one to look after her.

217
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,960
I hate to get social
services involved.

218
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,736
They'd probably just stick
her in some state-run facility.

219
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,821
That would be a shame.

220
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:51,084
But what if she ends up

221
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:54,257
hurting herself or someone else?
I'm not a lawyer,

222
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,914
but wouldn't the hospital be liable?

223
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,619
Hey, Penny.

224
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:17,200
- Aren't you gonna be late for school?
- My stupid brothers hid my homework.

225
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:18,666
Real mature.

226
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:21,856
- Is your mom ready?
- She's in the shower.

227
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,818
What?

228
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:33,133
Carlos, you're early!

229
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:35,542
Didn't you get my text?
The meeting got moved up.

230
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,192
Ccrap. I'll be right there!

231
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,288
Lynette, you okay?

232
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:47,534
Are you all right?

233
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:51,444
If you don't answer me,
I'm coming in there.

234
00:14:58,318 --> 00:14:59,639
Oh, my god.

235
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,297
All right, doctor. Thank you. Bye.

236
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:07,049
He says that since you weren't
out very long, you should be fine.

237
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,648
And don't worry about the meeting.
I pushed it to lunch,

238
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:12,732
- and I can handle it alone.
- No, I'm fine. I want to go.

239
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,131
You sure?

240
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,192
I'll let you get dressed.

241
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:18,304
Carlos, quicquestion for ya.

242
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:22,596
Last thing I remember,
I was in the shower, naked,

243
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,059
reaching for the soap.

244
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:28,042
Then I was here on the bed,
under a blanket...

245
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:31,221
Still naked.

246
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,817
And my question is,

247
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:36,289
how did I get from there to here?

248
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,274
I carried you.

249
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:43,465
Which means you saw me...

250
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:50,113
The only thing I was thinking about
was were you gonna be all right?

251
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,781
I appreciate that.

252
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,020
Here's something
else I'd appreciate...

253
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,233
Could we not tell
anyone else about this?

254
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:00,829
Not tell anyone?
I'm a first-time hero.

255
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,820
This was gonna be my lead
item in this year's christmas letter.

256
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:06,048
If Tom finds out, he'll freak.

257
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:10,196
He has this weird thing about being
the only guy who gets to see me naked.

258
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,674
You got it.
Now get dressed. We gotta go.

259
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:18,677
Could u maybe step outside?

260
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,547
I only do one show a day.

261
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:23,115
Sorry.

262
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,739
Here you go!

263
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:33,690
Edna, here's your diet soda.

264
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,212
- Try to keep your pants on.
- I don't mean to be a killjoy, but

265
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:39,402
are we gonna do any planting today?

266
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:44,206
There's some seeds in this.
Knock yourself out.

267
00:16:56,822 --> 00:17:00,009
Patty, do you mind
if I steal Tom for a sec?

268
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,756
Okay, but only a sec.

269
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,715
What's up?

270
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:09,890
First of all,
you're a real prince for coming today.

271
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,584
- Thanks to you, our coup is complete.
- No problem.

272
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,522
Anyway, I know you must be bored silly,
so go ahead and make your escape.

273
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:22,163
Actually, I'm thinking of staying.
I'm having a great time,

274
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,618
meeting some nice people.

275
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,471
About that... I gotta warn you.

276
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:29,753
Patty's kinda got
a thing for married men.

277
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,139
- She's just being nice.
- Yes, she's like that.

278
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:36,116
She'll give you
the bra off her back.

279
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:38,510
We're just talking.

280
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:42,459
"Oh, Tom, what big arms you have"...

281
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,347
That kind of talking?

282
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:46,283
Oh, that. Okay, fine.

283
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,062
Point taken.

284
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:51,852
Great. Now if you'll excuse me
Have to get back to my gardening.

285
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:00,437
So Orson's decided to be happy.

286
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:04,099
- Isn't that great?
- He sounded very sincere.

287
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,515
I'll bet.

288
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:11,092
Just how happy is he going to be?
Will he whistle while he works

289
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:13,620
or will he just skip
around the house occasionally?

290
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,024
I did not raise you to be bitchy.

291
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,648
You raised me to
be passive-aggressive.

292
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:20,517
My bitchiness, that was self-taught.

293
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:24,022
Save it for those karaoke
parties at Bob and Lee's.

294
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:26,058
I am not amused.

295
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:31,021
Your BS meter might be broken,
but mine works just fine.

296
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:32,685
Orson's up to something.

297
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,645
I can understand why you're a bit cynical,
but I'm giving him another chance.

298
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:40,354
He's my husband,
and I still love him.

299
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:45,562
He's been stealing
stuff from your friends.

300
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:47,881
He tried to get you
to sell your business.

301
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:50,263
I know.

302
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,751
Fine.

303
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,656
Go ahead. Take him back.

304
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:57,976
But while you're watching
Orson skip and sing,

305
00:18:58,146 --> 00:19:00,926
I'll be looking up divorce lawyers,
just in case.

306
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:11,034
- Susan, you here?
- In the kitchen.

307
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,769
Why are you mopping the ceiling?

308
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,362
I was cooking, all right?

309
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:22,141
Lids.

310
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:24,631
You really gotta start using lids.

311
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:27,229
Sometimes it's the stove's fault.

312
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:29,997
I saw Dave last night.

313
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,631
- How'd that go?
- Not good.

314
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:36,249
He's in a really dark place.
He kinda lashed out at me.

315
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,891
At you?

316
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,720
- Why?
- I don't know. All of a sudden,

317
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,684
he resents my happiness
with Katherine.

318
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,773
- That's weird.
- Maybe not.

319
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,381
When your wife dies,

320
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:51,072
it must be depressing to see
other people in a loving relationship.

321
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:52,853
Maybe you could look in on him.

322
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,112
That didn't come out right.

323
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:00,744
I know what you meant.

324
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:03,098
I'll stop by tomorrow and see him.

325
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,416
Thanks.

326
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:09,076
This whole thing with Edie...

327
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,540
Seeing her lying in
the street that night...

328
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:18,906
It just brought up all those
awful memories from our accident.

329
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:27,179
We did what we had to do.

330
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:33,845
Look what it did to us.

331
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,066
Daddy!

332
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,378
Hey, buddy.

333
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:45,067
- Hey, you hungry?
- No, mommy made spaghetti.

334
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:51,813
I'll have him back before school.

335
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,211
You take care.

336
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,380
You, too.

337
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:15,514
I'm on my way to work,
but I just wanted to bring you these.

338
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:18,489
Chicken salad sandwiches,
which I did not make.

339
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:21,619
I bought.
I learned my lesson from the casserole.

340
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:24,778
Thanks.

341
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,712
Wait.

342
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:29,634
Could you maybe have one right now

343
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:32,964
so that I know
that you actually ate something?

344
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,837
I'm not hungry, but again, thanks.

345
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:39,898
I know that you're
going through hell,

346
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:43,216
but Edie was my friend,
so please, let me help you.

347
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,173
Just a little.

348
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,550
You sure you don't want one?

349
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:03,908
It's really good.

350
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,350
Still not hungry.

351
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:14,560
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do now?

352
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:16,514
I'm gonna sell the house.

353
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:18,683
You're kidding. So soon?

354
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:21,289
I've got a realtor coming by today.

355
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:24,403
I'm gonna put the money
in a trust for Travers.

356
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,598
It's what Edie would have wanted.

357
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,766
At least you're making
plans for the future.

358
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:40,025
Everything that ever
mattered to me is gone.

359
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,168
The future's the last
thing I'm thinking about.

360
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,140
I should probably...

361
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:54,792
Put these away
before I finish them off.

362
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:01,330
Are you sure there's
nothing I can do to help you?

363
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,077
A load of laundry?

364
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:05,196
No, thanks.

365
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,396
<i>How about a pot of coffee?
Or I could just...</i>

366
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,954
Straighten up in here?

367
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:15,685
<i>Please. I need to be alone.</i>

368
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,039
Sure.

369
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:45,206
Do you know what is
a great cure for the blues?

370
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,930
Cribbage.

371
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:51,169
- Do you have a cribbage set?
- I thought you had to go to work.

372
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,387
I'll call in sick, take the day off.

373
00:23:57,623 --> 00:24:00,834
I really don't want to be rude,
but you need to leave.

374
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:07,404
You have a realtor coming, right?

375
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:10,485
You cannot let him see
the house in this condition.

376
00:24:10,897 --> 00:24:14,193
So just let me clean up a little.

377
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,579
You won't even know I'm here.

378
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:47,912
All right.

379
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:50,921
I will be back after work

380
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:52,988
to check on you.

381
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:55,490
But until then,

382
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:58,519
here's the phone, in case you wanna

383
00:24:58,986 --> 00:25:01,024
order chinese or...

384
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:04,068
Call a hotline or something.

385
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:18,426
Katherine,
can you call me back as soon as you can?

386
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:21,056
I just left Dave,
and he's in bad shape.

387
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:23,225
I actually think that he might be...

388
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:26,770
Crap. I gotta go.

389
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:34,005
- Yes, officer?
- License and registration, please.

390
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,830
- What did I do?
- It's against the law

391
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,325
to talk on a cell phone without
using a hands-free device while driving,

392
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,684
- As of january 1st.
- Right. I know that.

393
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:45,982
I just was worried about a friend
so I forgot. I'm sorry.

394
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:50,335
Step out of the car slowly.

395
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:52,992
- You don't want the license?
- Out of the car.

396
00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:01,335
You think that I'm dangerous.
I totally have an explanation for those.

397
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:03,694
- Stop talking.
- You're gonna feel really silly

398
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,407
- when you hear what it is.
- Get out of the car now!

399
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,214
- On the ground!
- Yes, sir!

400
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:14,737
Susan. I just got
your message about Dave.

401
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,259
I'm on my way to the hospital,
but if you want me to...

402
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:23,177
You know, why don't we talk later?

403
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:43,599
Was that Patty Rizzo?

404
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:46,769
I had some car trouble,
so she followed me over to the garage

405
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,495
and gave me a lift back.

406
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,506
Patty lives six blocks away.
I live down the street.

407
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:54,279
Why didn't you ask me to take you?

408
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:57,348
Are you going somewhere with this?

409
00:26:57,837 --> 00:27:00,144
Tom, I'm sorry,
but I got a responsibility here.

410
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:04,080
I brought you into the club.
I introduced you to the horny homemaker.

411
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:08,806
- I just don't want you to...
- What, Gaby,

412
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:10,143
cheat on my wife?

413
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:13,841
I was gonna say "die of gonorrhea,"
but that's close enough.

414
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:17,393
I really appreciate your concern,

415
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:20,187
but how can I put this?

416
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:21,525
Butt out.

417
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:26,168
You leave me no choice.
You are no longer allowed to see Patty.

418
00:27:26,614 --> 00:27:29,274
"Allowed"? Who are you, my mother?

419
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:32,026
I trump your mother.
I am garden club president.

420
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:34,938
This is ridiculous.

421
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:38,106
- I thought you were my friend.
- I love you, Tom,

422
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:40,188
but you're my friend
with a small "f."

423
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,802
My friend with the
big "f" is Lynette.

424
00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:45,307
So if I see something
that could hurt her, you bet your ass

425
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,095
I'm gonna do something about it.

426
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:50,096
A neighbor offered me a ride.

427
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,741
If you want to hurt Lynette

428
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:54,382
and twist it into something
that it isn't, screw you.

429
00:27:55,949 --> 00:27:57,724
And that's with a big "f."

430
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:06,049
- Hello, my love.
- Hello, darling.

431
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:08,003
Please tell me you're
here to spring me.

432
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:11,037
Not that I haven't enjoyed every
moment of your poking and prodding.

433
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:13,064
I'm just taking one last look.

434
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,292
Are you sure he
wasn't in a bar fight?

435
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:18,246
It looks like he got smacked
with a pool cue or something.

436
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:21,703
Orson's not exactly the bar-fight type.
He's more of a raised voices

437
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:23,519
at-a-cheese-tasting type.

438
00:28:24,277 --> 00:28:26,849
While I'm finishing, do you
wanna go sign the discharge papers?

439
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,591
Great. Be back in a minute.

440
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:35,918
Bree?

441
00:28:37,944 --> 00:28:40,932
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see Rose Kemper.

442
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:42,911
Right. I heard she was here.

443
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,248
It's so sad.
I'm here to help her pack.

444
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:48,603
Social services is coming this afternoon
to take her to some nursing home.

445
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:52,165
I'm surprised. I knew she was a bit dotty,
but didn't think it was that serious.

446
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:55,829
Yes. She's been telling
people this story about how death

447
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,225
- broke into her house.
- Death?

448
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:00,402
- Dear...
- Apparently,

449
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,487
he climbed in through a window and then
tried to steal one of her knickknacks.

450
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,537
That's odd.

451
00:29:09,432 --> 00:29:12,408
Then she whacked him across the head
with a baseball bat.

452
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,808
- A bat?
- Which is what I would do

453
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:18,171
if death were ever to
steal one of my knickknacks.

454
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,879
Did she get a good look at... Death?

455
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,770
She said he was wearing
some sort of mask.

456
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:27,679
She tells the story so convincingly,

457
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,469
you almost believe her.

458
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:34,160
There's the social worker.
I wanna be there when she talks to Rose.

459
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:42,069
He's all yours, Bree.

460
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:44,563
Wonderful.

461
00:29:51,504 --> 00:29:54,552
This dinner is delicious.
You really didn't have to do this.

462
00:29:54,722 --> 00:29:57,958
With the long hours you've been putting
in, I just wanted to say thank you.

463
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:01,665
And by "do something," he means having me
slave over a rack of lamb all day.

464
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:04,098
I would like to propose a toast.

465
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:07,211
Who says
that friendship and business don't mix?

466
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:09,857
- To friendship.
- Hear, hear. To friendship.

467
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:16,648
I want to hear more
about the garden club.

468
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:19,020
Tom says he's meeting
all kinds of nice people.

469
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,907
Really?

470
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:22,829
Any favorites, Tom?

471
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,220
They're all great gals.

472
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,845
One's sort of a pain in the ass.
Other than her,

473
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:29,417
I'm having a great time.

474
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:33,549
Although I keep telling
Tom how dangerous gardens can be.

475
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:36,058
Everywhere you step,
there are shovels

476
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:38,525
and rakes and hoes.

477
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:47,107
Lynette and I should
really be toasting you two.

478
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:49,111
Us?

479
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:52,297
For putting up with all
the long hours we've been keeping.

480
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,345
I didn't mind the long hours.

481
00:30:55,193 --> 00:30:57,535
I wasn't so crazy about
the whole shower thing, but...

482
00:30:57,705 --> 00:30:59,302
Lynette told you about that?

483
00:31:00,186 --> 00:31:02,773
She thought I was nuts
for getting weird about it.

484
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:04,684
I get it.
A guy carries your

485
00:31:04,854 --> 00:31:07,152
unconscious,
naked wife to your bed...

486
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,868
What are you talking about?

487
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:16,250
Is this gorgonzola?

488
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:19,963
The day when she fell in your shower.
What are <i>you</i> talking about?

489
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:22,161
When she took a
shower in your office.

490
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:25,042
- You took a shower in my office?
- What's going on here?

491
00:31:25,212 --> 00:31:27,688
Lynette was taking a shower
and Carlos came by to drive her to work.

492
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:31,387
- She slipped and fell, he helped her.
- You told her? I asked you not to.

493
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,033
- She's my wife. I tell her everything.
- You hear that, Lynette?

494
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:37,146
They tell each other everything. They
know that they're not hiding anything.

495
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:40,191
I was just afraid you'd overreact,
like you're doing right now.

496
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:42,983
Full disclosure, Lynette,
that's what a marriage is about.

497
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,491
So I assume you fully disclosed your
little "friendship" with Patty Rizzo.

498
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,612
What little friendship?

499
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:56,189
You know what?
I think this is gorgonzola.

500
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:02,382
Patty gave me a ride home,
and Gaby's making a big deal about it.

501
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:05,437
Because it's Patty Rizzo.
She's a total slut.

502
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:08,730
You should be on antibiotics
just for sitting in her car.

503
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:11,489
- Exactly.
- Stay out of this, Gaby.

504
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:13,608
- You've done enough damage.
- Don't snap at me!

505
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:15,926
Lynette's my friend.
I was just watching her back!

506
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:18,094
While your husband
was watching her front.

507
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:21,814
Drop it, Tom.
We'll continue this at home.

508
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:31,819
If you have a shower at the office,
how can you come home smelling so bad?

509
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,324
I don't know.

510
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:37,122
Why does the lamb
taste like sawdust?

511
00:32:41,656 --> 00:32:43,046
Thank you, darling.

512
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,102
I can't tell you how
nice it is to be home again.

513
00:32:47,272 --> 00:32:49,652
It's wonderful to have you home.

514
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:52,498
How's your head?

515
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,464
- It still hurts.
- That'll teach you to go out

516
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,789
walking in the middle of the night.

517
00:32:58,984 --> 00:33:02,225
You know, I still don't
know why you were out so late.

518
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:06,220
I told you.
We had a little spat,

519
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,565
and I wanted to clear my head.

520
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:12,901
And then you bumped
it on that nasty curb.

521
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:16,207
That'll teach me to
fight with my lovely wife.

522
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:20,386
And that's all you were doing,

523
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:22,178
just going out for a walk?

524
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:25,039
That's all.

525
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:35,767
I just remembered some business
I have to discuss with Andrew.

526
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:38,109
Enjoy your tea.

527
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:45,935
Hey, mom. What's wrong?

528
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,453
Orson's lying to me again.

529
00:33:51,185 --> 00:33:53,195
I think I have to divorce him.

530
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:59,025
Just tell me how I can help.

531
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:04,817
You okay?

532
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:08,667
I just keep thinking about Dave.

533
00:34:09,705 --> 00:34:12,641
His life was so great.
He had everything.

534
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:16,382
Then one day, boom! All gone.

535
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:19,645
I know.

536
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,320
Life can turn on a dime...

537
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:24,934
Dave,

538
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,314
Edie,

539
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:28,513
Rose Kemper...

540
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:32,700
The one thing it's
made me realize is...

541
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,650
I don't want to live with regrets.

542
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,319
Me neither.

543
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,498
I've been wanting to
tell you this for some time.

544
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,250
Remember when I suggested
moving in together?

545
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,644
It wasn't just about saving rent.

546
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,308
I was trying to

547
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:56,332
pull you closer,

548
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:59,592
manipulate some kind
of commitment out of you.

549
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:03,354
And that's not who I am,
so I want you to know that I'm sorry,

550
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:05,255
and it won't happen again.

551
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:08,706
From now on, no hidden agendas.

552
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:13,438
I like that policy.

553
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:18,315
I'm always gonna be honest with you.

554
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:23,905
After all, you're the guy I'm
gonna spend the rest of my life with.

555
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:36,874
More sandwiches.

556
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:38,564
Or is my gun in there?

557
00:35:39,364 --> 00:35:42,989
It's just your belts and ties.
The police kept the rest.

558
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:45,401
I know. They called.

559
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,748
You told them I was suicidal.

560
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:49,623
I'm sorry.

561
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:51,922
It's just... the things you said...

562
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,262
I'm worried about you.

563
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:55,736
Don't be.

564
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:58,224
I told you, I'm fine.

565
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:03,704
You are not fine.

566
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:08,771
How could you be?
You have suffered a horrible loss.

567
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:12,226
And you are allowed
to feel any way you want.

568
00:36:12,528 --> 00:36:15,196
But I know that you are not fine.

569
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,024
I'm sorry for ransacking your house.

570
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,347
I'll stop bugging you.

571
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,574
Edie and I had a fight.

572
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:35,516
That night.

573
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:38,655
A bad one.

574
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:46,710
I came home.

575
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,579
We argued.

576
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:52,148
She stormed out,
got in her car and died.

577
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:04,588
- That does not make it your fault.
- Doesn't it?

578
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:08,172
If things had been different,
if I...

579
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:12,467
- Had been different, she'd still be alive.
- You can't think that way.

580
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:15,018
What happened is bad enough.

581
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:18,525
You can't blame yourself for it, too.
If you do that,

582
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,166
You will destroy everything
you have left that's good.

583
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:25,154
Trust me. I know.

584
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,985
Trust me. You don't.

585
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:36,463
A few years ago,
Mike and I got in a car accident.

586
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:40,804
A woman and her daughter...

587
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:42,437
Died.

588
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:45,925
I heard about that.

589
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:49,934
Mike was driving, right?

590
00:37:52,995 --> 00:37:54,723
That's what we said...

591
00:37:57,836 --> 00:37:59,235
But it wasn't true.

592
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:05,304
After the crash,

593
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:08,926
I couldn't find my license.

594
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:13,447
I had switched purses that night,
and I had left it at home, and so...

595
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:17,706
Mike... Told them
that he was driving.

596
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,852
He took the blame for me.

597
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:24,725
So...
I understand guilt.

598
00:38:26,776 --> 00:38:30,661
And I want you to understand
that Edie's death

599
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:32,976
was an awful tragedy.

600
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,474
It was not your fault.

601
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,097
Maybe you're right.

602
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:43,503
Thank you for telling me.

603
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:57,054
Heck of a dinner party.

604
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:01,066
It's amazing how fast
you can eat in total silence.

605
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:04,409
It's my fault.
I should have just told Tom the truth,

606
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,460
although it turned
out to be kind of a wash

607
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,918
with the whole Patty Rizzo thing.

608
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:11,435
You know what I think is cool?

609
00:39:11,605 --> 00:39:14,530
You guys have been married a long time,
and you still get jealous.

610
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:20,337
But just to be on the safe side,
if I fall in my tub again,

611
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:21,651
let me die there.

612
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:25,792
- Back to work.
- Yes.

613
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:29,879
And we shall never speak of this again.
I am embarrassed enough.

614
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:35,129
I saw you without your towel.

615
00:39:36,315 --> 00:39:38,897
You got nothing to
be embarrassed about.

616
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:56,017
How's the garden club today?

617
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:59,870
Phyllis got tanked on
cosmos and threw up on Edna...

618
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,357
So now we're back to planting crap.

619
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:08,003
I'm really sorry
for sticking my nose

620
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,066
- into that whole Patty rizzo thing.
- It's okay.

621
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,666
The truth is,
is I knew she was coming on to me.

622
00:40:16,857 --> 00:40:18,848
Then why did you keep
hanging out with her?

623
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:24,494
Lynette has been so
swamped with work lately,

624
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:26,134
that she doesn't...

625
00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:31,090
It's just nice having
a woman notice me again.

626
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:32,711
Is that terrible?

627
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:34,923
I get it.

628
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,337
When we first moved here,
Carlos was working round the clock,

629
00:40:38,507 --> 00:40:41,459
and he'd come home
and barely say hello to me.

630
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:44,020
It was like I was invisible.

631
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:45,235
Invisible...

632
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,803
That's the word.

633
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:54,238
When he didn't see me,
I found someone who did.

634
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,151
You know I'd never
do that to Lynette.

635
00:40:57,594 --> 00:40:59,622
I never thought I'd do it to Carlos.

636
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:06,373
Then it's a good thing I've got
a friend around to keep an eye on me,

637
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,507
even if it's one with a small "f".

638
00:41:10,877 --> 00:41:13,121
For the record,
you're growing on me.

639
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,229
I'm thirsty.
Let's start a book club.

640
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:25,812
<i>The fact is everyone does it.</i>

641
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,326
<i>Everyone tries to cover up</i>

642
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:30,775
<i>what they don't want others to see.</i>

643
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:36,351
<i>Women hide their
need for commitment...</i>

644
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:43,606
<i>Men disguise their
gring insecurity...</i>

645
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,124
<i>Wives mask their intense disdain.</i>

646
00:41:50,629 --> 00:41:52,829
<i>How can ordinary people
hide the truth</i>

647
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:55,466
<i>of their feelings so successfully?</i>

648
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:00,883
<i>All it takes is
a friendly gesture...</i>

649
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:04,299
You can't play in the street, M.J.
You could get hurt,

650
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,726
and that would really
tear your mom apart.

651
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:11,120
<i>And a plan.</i>
