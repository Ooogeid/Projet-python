provided by Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,100
bree discovered  a family secret.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,760
Oh,I'm gonna be sick.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,510
Lynette struggled  with chetherapy...

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,230
while susan took joy
in being pregnant...

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,620
I'm eating for two.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,570
The biggest obstacle
to carlos and gaby...

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,920
the I.R.S.Could make
me testify against you.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,890
Was the promise edie
forced  carlos to make.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,960
We're engaged.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,430
I really did care for edie,but
I can't let her ruin my life.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,410
trevor!Over here!

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,480
all children  love to play games.

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,210
But before  they can race their bikes

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,290
or jump their ropes

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,830
or toss their frisbees,

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,570
children understand they must  first convince
their friends  to play along with them.

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,330
The same is true for adults.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,840
Hi,gaby.It's me.I'm throwing a
party saturday night.Guess what kind?

20
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,500
A charades party?Didn't
you just throw one?

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,850
No,that was a year ago.

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,700
Oh.Right.Guess it's
time for another one.

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,450
Sure is.Can you come?

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,960
Um...sorry.Victor needs me at this...

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,200
political thing.Damn.Damn.Damn.

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,510
Aw!You have to come.You're the
best charades player I know.

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,480
That's sweet.and totally accurate.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
But I'm really whipped
from the chemo,so...

29
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,580
oh,there's my other line.Can
you ask me next time,okay,hon?

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,620
Okay,bye.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,920
hello?

32
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,840
Oh,hey,bree.Mm,what's up?

33
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,870
Well,I stopped by katherine's last night just to get
a recipe,and you'll never believe what I overheard.

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,430
She slapped her kid?!No!

35
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,600
Yes,and get this... when adam said dylan
was just going to keep asking questions,

36
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,820
katherine said... and I quote...

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,590
"well,we're just gonna
have to find better lies."

38
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,020
oh,hang on.I've got another call.

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't answer it!It's susan.She's
hosting another game night.

40
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,090
Another one? It's time
for an anonymous letter.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,560
- Wait...is katherine going to susan's charade night?
- Probably.Why?

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,420
We should go,too.

43
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,680
Get a few drinks in
her,see if she loosens up.

44
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,510
Well,I doubt a woman like katherine
is gonna spill her secrets just

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
- because she's had a little win
- I don't know.

46
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,920
You came out with some interesting
things before you swore off the sauc

47
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,730
well,none that I recall.

48
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,260
Didn't you tell me you lost your
virginity in the backseat of a...

49
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,320
point well taken.I'll bring the wine.

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,220
Susan,good news.We can
come to the party after all.

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,850
Hey,you know who else you should invite?

52
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,730
Yeah,I am feeling much
better,so count me in.

53
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,490
- Will our new neighbor be coming?
- Of course!

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,320
I love your charades parties.And I hope you're
inviting that delightful katherine mayfair.

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,430
So you were pa a very
nice compliment today.

56
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,740
- I was?
- Yes.

57
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,270
I am hosting a charades party,and all of my
friends went out their way to insist I invite you.

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,730
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,140
Yes,not all adults  like to play games.

60
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,810
But the ones who do...

61
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,580
play to win.

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,550
Stella wingfield hated to cook.

66
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,440
Still,she spent  that friday
morning  grating cheese...

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,940
and greasing a pan...

68
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,060
and laying in macaroni

69
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,100
because her eldest daughter  was sick,

70
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,840
and stella could no longer
sit by and do nothing.

71
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,560
- Lunchtime!
- Oh.No,thanks.

72
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,660
Oh,come on.I made it for you
special.You've gotta keep your streng up.

73
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:57,190
I appreciate the effort,but I told
you,I can't keep anything down,and F.Y.I.

74
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,240
Mac and cheese is halfway to vomit.

75
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,100
You might as well have given
me a plate of creamed corn.

76
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,320
Aren't you taking the anti-nausea drug?

77
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,520
Yeah,I am taking it.It's just...

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,550
not working.

79
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,830
Well,um...

80
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,820
I know something that might help
your nausea  and boost your appetite.

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,230
Um...

82
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,890
perhaps a little visit
from my old friend...

83
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,850
mary jane?

84
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,040
- You're suggesting pot?
- A lot of chemo patients use it.

85
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,210
- Hell,I did.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh,come on.

87
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,030
Let mama score you
some kick-ass chronic.

88
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,860
"Kick-ass
chronic"? Uh-huh.

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,100
You're a grandmother.Shouldn't you
be off somewhere knitting an afghan?

90
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,610
Just trying to ease your pain.

91
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,170
Well,thks,but prefer not to get my
medication from some guy under a bridge.

92
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,710
Suit yourself.

93
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,600
Hey.

94
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,440
- What's this?
-  A crib.

95
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,710
Oh,and look...

96
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,170
safety latch.I figured if
the baby takes after you,

97
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,330
"accident-proof" is key.

98
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,370
Honey,you know,I'm still
in my first trimester.

99
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,820
Um,don't you think it's a
little early to be making cribs?

100
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,750
Early would be painting
it pink or blue.But...

101
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,090
I got both,so we're covered either way.

102
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,760
great.

103
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,550
And whether it's a boy
or a girl,colts fan.

104
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,860
- That's
non-negotiable. - Mm.

105
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,380
Um,bree's home.I'll be right back.

106
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,180
look sharp.It's susan.

107
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,550
God,it's getting harder and
harder to keep her at arm's length.

108
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,440
I never knew she was such a hugger.

109
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,690
- You want me to run interference?
- I'm getting good at props. No,no.

110
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,060
Yeah? Good.

111
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,090
Hey,susan!What's up?

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,250
I need a favor.

113
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,910
Um,I remember you mentioning
that you liked your obstetrician.

114
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,730
Can I get his number?

115
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,130
I thought you were using dr.Mayfair.

116
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,790
Yeah,I don't know.It's
getting a little weird.

117
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,680
You know,adam is my neighbor.

118
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,980
But you don't mind
orson being your dentist.

119
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,270
Well,that's because I don't
blush when orson says,"open wide."

120
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,290
you know,my O.B.Is all
the way across town.

121
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,520
You just do not want to drive that far.

122
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,060
Oh,well,we could schedule our appointments
together and carpool.You know...

123
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,510
pregnant gals on the road.

124
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,720
it does sound fun,but I don't think
my doctor's taking on any new patients.

125
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,230
Oh,I can talk him into
it.What's his name?

126
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,070
I,uM...don't remember.

127
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,250
You don't remember?

128
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,750
No.You know,I usually
just call him "doctor."

129
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,280
bree,just get me the number.

130
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,990
Ooh.

131
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,590
here you go,but please
don't mention my name.

132
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,140
As I said,you know,he's overbooked,and
I just don't want to get on his bad side.

133
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,070
I'm so excited.Pregnant
gals sharing a doctor!

134
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,240
- ah-choo! -
Oh,bless you.

135
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,500
Oh!Sorry,probably just allergies,but,you
know,you don't want to take anchances.

136
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,790
right.

137
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,330
Hey.Can I get a drink?

138
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,610
Yeah,sure.

139
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,230
By the way,you missed a spot.

140
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,090
Oh,thanks.

141
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,070
Anytime.

142
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,370
- I'd say the car is clean enough.
- Katherine.

143
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,830
You two seemed awfully friendly.

144
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,540
- Do you know her?
- We said two words.No.

145
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,170
- She criticized my car washing.
- Hmm.It's funny.

146
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,360
When I criticize you,you
don't put on a big,goofy grin.

147
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,050
You really need to stop this.

148
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,740
Given our history,shouldn't
i be saying that to you?

149
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,830
Katherine,I can't just
not speak to women.

150
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,950
I'm a gynecologist,for god's sake.

151
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,160
Yes,I know.

152
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,670
But you don't have to bring
your work home with you.

153
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,650
you leaving already?

154
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,720
Ah,edie asked me to help her
pick out a gift for her sister,

155
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,710
so I gotta swing by the mall.

156
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,130
Whenan I see you next?

157
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,160
Well,victor has a teachers'
union thing on thursday.

158
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,820
Guess I'llee you on thursday.

159
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,980
Carlos,what's happening here?

160
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,950
I mean,with us.Why are
we still sneaking around?

161
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,900
- You know exactly why.
- Oh,come on.

162
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,620
Edie's recovered from her little suicide
attempt.Don't you think it's time to move on?

163
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,010
I've got some things going on,and I need
them to pay off before I can make a move.

164
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,420
Really,I don't have a choice.

165
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,180
Okay,but if you did have a
choice,would it be a hard one?

166
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,390
I mean,it's not like you're
in love with edie,is it?

167
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,620
No,I don't love edie.

168
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,990
And I've got a plan to get her out of my
life forever.Just give me two weeks,okay?

169
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,510
A bracelet's always nice.

170
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,960
For edie's sister.

171
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,380
Good idea.

172
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,440
here's the thing...
my daughter has cancer.

173
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,620
She's so nauseous,she's stopped eating,and I
can't just stand by and watch her waste away.

174
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,780
So I asked around,and people thought
you might be able to get me what I need.

175
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,510
You follow my drift?

176
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,660
Um...yeah.You...

177
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,870
you want me to score you some weed.

178
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,400
The best stuff you can get.

179
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,440
nothing's too good for my little girl.

180
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,180
Darling?

181
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,080
What is it?

182
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,230
Well,I don't want you to worry.

183
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,550
I-I just got off the
phone with the convent.

184
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,800
It seems danielle took a little spill.

185
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,050
You're 8 1/2 months pregnant!

186
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,940
What in heaven's name were
you doing roller-blading?

187
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,710
I'm bored.All I do is lay around.

188
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,060
In your condition,that's
what you should be doing.

189
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,320
And where on earth did you
get skates in a convent?

190
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,540
I borrowed them from one of
the eating disorder girls.

191
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,390
They have all the good
exercise equipment.

192
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,060
Danielle,what if your reckless
behavior had hurt the baby?

193
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,710
They're going to examine
me.I'm sure the baby's fine.

194
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,380
Yes,and it is going to stay that way

195
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,740
because I have instructed sister
theresa to keep you sequestered

196
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,230
in your room until the baby is born.

197
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,400
What am I supposed to do for fun?
You won't even get me a dvd player.

198
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,030
Well,I was hoping that you could use these
last few wee for reflection and personal growth.

199
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,900
I hate you.

200
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,690
Clearly,it would be time well spent.

201
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,130
- How was the lasagna?
- Why don't you ask it yourself?

202
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,700
- Honey.
- Sorry.

203
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,360
At least eat a little.We need you in
fighting form for charades tonight.

204
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,230
Yeah,about that... I don't
think I'm gonna make it.

205
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,020
You have to!You are
the charades assassin.

206
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,190
They still talk about the night that you gueed
"the americanization of emily" in 15 seconds.

207
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,410
12.And that's my point.

208
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,390
I'm undefeated.Why spoil my winning
streak by playing when I'm not up to it?

209
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,070
Honey,people...know that you're sick.

210
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,960
They don't expect you to
be at your absolute best.

211
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,340
tom,hair loss and constant
nausea... those are inconveniences.

212
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,480
Losing at charades to susan meyer...
that is just flat-out intolerable.

213
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,040
- hey,andrew.
- Hey.

214
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,370
What's up? Hey,mr.Scavo,um,a
package for lynette's mom

215
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,510
got delivered to our
house by mistake,so...

216
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,080
I've got it,tom.It's a pattern.I'M...

217
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,030
knitting lynette an afghan.

218
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,310
a friend of mine recommended this place.

219
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,410
It's not exactly what I expected.

220
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,350
must be one heck of a doctor,though,huh?

221
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,450
I don't know.I just come
here to buy clean urine.

222
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,590
Shoo!Those are only for grown-ups.

223
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,930
Why?

224
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,420
Because that have
special medicine in them.

225
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,010
Like the grown-up iced
tea you always drink?

226
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,500
Similar.

227
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,930
How about some ice cream instead? And
you can watch tv till your eyes fall out.

228
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,890
- Yeah!
- You stay.

229
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,540
Grandma needs a favor,and
you've got justhe face for it.

230
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,150
Wow,sweetie.

231
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,490
Those really look delicious,but I
just don't feel like eating right now.

232
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,190
Just one,mom?

233
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,140
I made them special...

234
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,210
Just for you.

235
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,510
This really is delicious.

236
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,280
Emergency,you can reach
me on my cell phone.

237
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,880
Or they can just walk across the street.

238
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,190
Have fun,girls. Don't
do anything I would do.

239
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,780
Adam seems really laid-back.

240
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,510
Yeah,he's pretty cool.

241
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,310
Of course,everyone seems
cool compared to robo-mom.

242
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,770
Hey,you never told me.

243
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,160
What happened when you asked
her about your real dad?

244
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,300
She freaked out,just like I thought.

245
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,960
She wouldn't tell me anything.

246
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,280
Well...

247
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,880
There are other ways to find things out.

248
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,820
Does your mom keep any old papers?

249
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,170
You know,letters,diaries?

250
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,120
Not that she shows me.

251
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,270
There's stuff in the storage room
upstairs,but it's locked,so forget about it.

252
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,090
What kind of lock is it?

253
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,410
Oh,come on in.

254
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,530
I was hoping you were susan.

255
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:40,920
She's not here?

256
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,530
No,and she's not
answering her cell phone.

257
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,350
Where is she?

258
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,900
Well,she had an appointment with this new obstetrician
over on river street,but she should be here by now.

259
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,370
Why would she see a doctor over
there? That's a terrible neighborhood.

260
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,480
- It is?
- Yes.

261
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,680
Don't you remember? That's where they
murdered those two prostitutes last year.

262
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,110
We should help mike with the food.

263
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,480
- Knock,knock.
- we're here.

264
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,020
Oh,good! Katherine,I was hoping
we'd get a chance to chat.

265
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,450
Open this now.

266
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,810
Susan's parties are
always such a snoozefest.

267
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,480
The only thing people will be miming
is get me the hell out of here.

268
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,870
Aren't you a little
overdressed for charades?

269
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,340
Oh,I thought that I'd look
nice,just in case we decided to...

270
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,310
Oh,I don't know--
announce our engagement?

271
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,460
We're not announcing anything.

272
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,380
It's susan and mike's party.

273
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,790
I do not want to make it all about us.

274
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,930
You're right,darling.

275
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,740
I may drop a few hints,though.

276
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,300
Edie,let me be clear on this.

277
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,670
You are not to tell anyone
about our engagement,got it?

278
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,200
Fine.

279
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,770
I won't say a word.

280
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,390
Oh,this is fantastic.

281
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,810
You know edward ferber?

282
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,970
- State senator?
- Yes.

283
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,670
His wife just got picked
up for shoplifting.

284
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,100
Why is that fantastic?

285
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,770
He was making noises about
going against me for governor.

286
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,510
I guess the light-fingered
mrs.Ferber just put an end to that.

287
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,470
Why? It's not like he shoplifted.

288
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,910
It doesn't matter. It's a scandal.

289
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,800
You know what they do to poll numbers.

290
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,490
Oh,that's right.

291
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,280
I was reading about that in
politics is boring magazine.

292
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,960
I'm just glad I don't have to worry
about you pulling crap like that.

293
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,620
Yeah,you're lucky.

294
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,850
So where's lynette?

295
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,390
She's usually your charades M.V.P.

296
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,190
Ah,she wasn't feeling so well,but,uh,you
are still going down,mister.

297
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,050
It's just a game,tom-- a game
you wish you never played.

298
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,670
So much work...

299
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,590
Oh,hi,gaby.

300
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,910
Katherine and I were just
talking about the old days.

301
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,610
So when you were living with your
aunt,was dylan's father with you?

302
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,640
No,just me and dylan.

303
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,640
Were you widowed or divorced?

304
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,590
Actually,I prefer not to
discuss my first marriage...

305
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,520
If you don't mind.

306
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,160
We,we certainly didn't mean to pry.

307
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,400
Let me just tidge that up for you.

308
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,620
Hello,all.

309
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,340
Ah,it's so nice to see you.

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,080
Some wine?

311
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,800
Oh,no.

312
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,390
Oh,my contact slipped.

313
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,800
Edie,is that an engagement ring?

314
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,640
Uh,shoot.

315
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,780
Pretend you didn't see that.

316
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,840
I promised my fianc?

317
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,650
That I wouldn't say a word
until the official announcement.

318
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,160
Excuse me.

319
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,380
Gaby!

320
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,870
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,920
Oh,my god! You made it.

322
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,350
That is such a beautiful dress.

323
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,090
We're gonna have so much fun. You...

324
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,170
Come with me.

325
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,490
- She's got a ring!
- What?

326
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,070
Edie--she's wearing a big,honkin'
engagement ring the size of a peach pit.

327
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,580
Hey,I didn't get her a ring!

328
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,030
Oh,so you're not engaged?

329
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,950
- Well,see,here's the thing-
- oh,you gotta be kidding me!

330
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,290
- Let me explain!
- No,no,no.

331
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,140
I am done with your explanations,and I am
done with just give me two more weeks,baby.

332
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,480
Whatever games you're
playing,I'm sick of it.

333
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,750
We're through.

334
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,660
So you're just gonna go and live
happily ever after with victor,huh?

335
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,510
You think victor's my only option?

336
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,370
Well,I got news for you,carlos.

337
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,940
I can have any guy
I want,because this...

338
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,470
Waits for no man.

339
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,500
You bought yourself an engagement ring?

340
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,280
It's been three days,carlos.

341
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,480
How long was I supposed to wait?

342
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,410
You agreed not to say anything.

343
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,770
Ah,but I didn't agree
not to wear anything.

344
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,670
Don't worry.

345
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,370
It wasn't expensive.

346
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,970
You can pay me back later.

347
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,570
Count on it.

348
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,600
And the whole time,I just kept
thinking,this is bree's doctor.

349
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,280
Bree recommended him.

350
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,810
He must be the best.

351
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,980
So I didn't worry when it
was between a needle exchange

352
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,950
And the area's only
transvestite bookstore.

353
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,940
And I ignored that my
shoes stuck to the floor

354
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,330
And there was a cigarette
machine in the waiting room,

355
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,930
But when I saw the ant
traps on his speculum tray,

356
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,070
I thought that you and
i should have a talk.

357
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,930
Oh,susan,I am so sorry,and,of course,

358
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,590
I will pay for the slashed
tire and the stolen cell phone.

359
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,010
That is not the point!

360
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,830
Why would you send me to somebody
who is obviously not your doctor?

361
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,880
I can't tell you.

362
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,580
Why not?

363
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,650
It's private.

364
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,040
You know what else is private?

365
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:59,180
The parts of me that I'm pretty sure
he snapped with his camera phone.

366
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,170
I have a party to throw.

367
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,290
I will deal with you later.

368
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,200
Look,al,she is totally out of control.

369
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,150
I need her taken care of.

370
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,600
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

371
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,930
I promised my fianc?

372
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,480
That I wouldn't say a word
until the official announcement.

373
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,720
Adam,I feel the tag of my dress
sticking out,and I can't reach it.

374
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,920
- Do you mind?
- Oh,sure.

375
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,590
There you go.

376
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,550
I think I got a chill.

377
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,550
Now let me see if I can give you one.

378
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,240
Oh,yeah,it worked.

379
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,780
We haven't been here an hour,and
you're already humiliating me?

380
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,830
Are we really having
this conversation again?

381
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,970
Oh,I guess you learned
nothing from chicago.

382
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,900
For god sake,I was not flirting.

383
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,540
- She asked me to fix her dress.
- Yeah.

384
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,360
I saw your face.

385
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,870
I could tell what a
chore it was for you.

386
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,810
You know what? I think I'm a little
behind you in the alcohol department.

387
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,780
Let me go catch up.

388
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,670
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,910
I,uh,didn't mean to eavesdrop,but you
really shouldn't take this out on adam.

390
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,650
Gabrielle has a little bit of a
reputation,if you know what I mean.

391
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,360
No,I don't.

392
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,680
But I'd certainly like to.

393
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,550
Okay,everybody,let the games begin.

394
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,100
Um,okay. I will be team captain one.

395
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,180
Who wants to be captain number two?

396
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,010
- i'll do it.
- Great.

397
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,210
- okay,you pick first.
- Oh,okay.

398
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,710
I will pick adam.

399
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,350
I pick lynette.

400
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,900
Where's lynette?

401
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,080
Uh,she really wanted to be here
she's just feeling too sick to party.

402
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,320
That's funny,isn't it?

403
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,500
Are you kidding? It's genius.

404
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,120
He's a sponge,but he talks!

405
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,480
Well,looks like somebody
is feeling a little better.

406
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,780
Yeah.

407
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,330
I guess that anti-nausea
medicine finally kicked in.

408
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,800
That must be it.

409
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,680
Orson.

410
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,130
Carlos.

411
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,990
Husband in the room?

412
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,240
Honey,I love you,but I wanna win.

413
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,160
You should pick edie.

414
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,280
Why?

415
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,000
The woman just tried to commit
suicide. Don't make her last pick.

416
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,220
- She's still fragile.
- Good point.

417
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,830
Mike!

418
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,820
Yes! Let's get started.

419
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,920
No,no! Wait,wait,wait.

420
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,130
Gaby,you know how it works.

421
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,120
Okay,first,I have to
go over all the signals.

422
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,810
Okay,so,um,this is movie,um,tv...

423
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,610
Where did you learn to do this?

424
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,260
When you live with a mother who constantly
locks herself out,you develop certain skills.

425
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,540
I don't know.

426
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,040
Maybe this is a sign we should stop.

427
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,320
What were you saying about signs?

428
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,090
A whole concept,person,um,let's see.

429
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,740
Shakespeare,book,and then
if you do the signal for book

430
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,970
And you touch your
heart,then that's poem.

431
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,730
Okay,when has anyone ever
used a poem as a clue?

432
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,310
Yeah,come on. Let's play.

433
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,060
Let's play!

434
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,540
Yeah! Let's play!

435
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,940
Hey,honey! You made it.

436
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,060
Dibs on lynette! She's on my team!

437
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,020
That's not fair. She's
like the charades ninja.

438
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,870
That's me! The ninja!

439
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,650
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

440
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,050
Okay.

441
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,070
Okay! I'm ready.

442
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,230
Okay,go.

443
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,590
- shoe.
- Sock.

444
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,610
- Working out.
- black.

445
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,950
- sole.
- itch.

446
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,390
- Itch.
- Scratch.

447
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,720
A blister.

448
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,760
Sounds like blister.

449
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,360
- Sister.
- kissed her.

450
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,520
Two mules for sister sara!

451
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,830
Okay,22 seconds.

452
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,920
Lynette,you're up.

453
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,110
Come on,babe.

454
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,250
We're 40 seconds down.

455
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,180
We need you to make that time up.

456
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,300
Who do you think you're talking to?

457
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,910
- Right on.
- all right.

458
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,380
Ready?

459
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,170
- Get set...go.
- Okay.

460
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,730
Honey,clock's ticking.

461
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,860
I know.

462
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,290
Just,this is a really hard one.

463
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,420
Okay,come on,come on.
What is--what is it?

464
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,610
Is it a book? Is it a movie?

465
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,920
Movie.

466
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,120
It's a western.

467
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,980
- No talking.
- Sorry.

468
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,830
Honey,start with the first word.

469
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,420
How many syllables?

470
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,310
One word.

471
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,060
Sweetie,act it out.
You're really good at that.

472
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,910
Okay,okay. Whole idea.

473
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,430
- Me.
- Edie.

474
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,590
- Woman.
- Blonde.

475
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,870
Bleach!

476
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,460
Hang 'em high?

477
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,320
Yes! Yes!

478
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,130
Yes!

479
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,890
Okay. Well,I think
it's time for a break.

480
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,690
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

481
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,410
You feeling okay? 'Cause you're...

482
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,790
Acting kinda spacey.

483
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,320
Yeah,no,I'm good.

484
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,750
Hey,do you think they
have any grapes or lobster?

485
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,350
Why--why don't I go
get you some coffee,hon?

486
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,980
Uh,um,orson?

487
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,450
Hey,um,there's a phone call for you at
the house. Yoshould probably take it.

488
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,980
- Hi.
- Hello.

489
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,340
Oh,tom.

490
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,290
Stella,what-- what
are you doing here?

491
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,130
I made some brownies
earlier,and I just...

492
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,450
Noticed they were missing.

493
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,300
Lynette didn't bring them here,did she?

494
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,550
Why? Is that a problem?

495
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,130
It's like chocolate love.

496
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,210
Okay,wait,wait,wait.
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.

497
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,640
Sorry,uh,don't eat those.
Don't eat those.Sorry.

498
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,140
Uh,no!

499
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,800
Bad batch. Bad.

500
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,440
Bad,bad,bad. Sorry.

501
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,970
Full of trans fats.

502
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,800
Tom,watch it!

503
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,330
I am sorry.

504
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,370
Oh,here.

505
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,810
- Let me get that.
- Thank you.

506
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,650
- Okay.
- It's a little cold.

507
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,530
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

508
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,070
Would it be too much to ask you
to keep your hands off my husband?

509
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,230
What? I spilled my drink on him.

510
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,950
And you're trying to make up
for it by breast-feeding him?

511
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,710
Uh,katherine?

512
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,600
Look,lady,you need to calm down.

513
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,600
You're getting a reputation around
here for having a stick up your ass.

514
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,710
Better that reputation than
the one you're toting around.

515
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,920
What do you mean by that?

516
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,960
Okay,back to charades.

517
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,990
Never mind. Forget it.

518
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,470
Oh,no,no. Tell me.

519
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,040
What's my reputation?

520
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,510
Am I smug and
holier-than-thou?

521
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,140
Oh,no,wait. That's you.

522
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,960
Let me be specific.

523
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,640
By reputation,I mean that
you are the kind of woman that

524
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,420
Treats a man like a plaything,whether
it's my husband or let's say...

525
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,890
Your teenage gardener?

526
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,100
Bree saw you slap your daughter.

527
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,180
Excuse me?

528
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,420
Gaby!

529
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,970
Yeah,she asked about her
father and then you smacked her.

530
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,180
Why'd you do that?

531
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,830
This is the last thing
that I will ever say to you.

532
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,300
Yes,I lost my temper with dylan,but
her father is a horrible man.

533
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,500
I want you to imagine the worst thing
that a father can do to his daughter.

534
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,600
What was I supposed to
tell dylan about that,hmm?

535
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,690
I hope that satisfies
everyone's curiosity.

536
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,780
oh,my god.

537
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,100
"Hang 'em high" has three syllables.

538
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,460
I guess you...saw what
happened down there.

539
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,500
Yep.

540
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,830
Look,it was a long time
ago,and...and it didn't mean anything.

541
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,670
How many people know about this?

542
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,820
Now or before tonight?

543
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,850
- how many?
- Look,I know you're upset.

544
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,580
I'm not upset.I'm just trying
to work out how to spin this.

545
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,480
Clearly,the boy was underage.

546
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,030
Do you think money would shut him up?

547
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,290
Victor,really,I don't
think it's a big deal.

548
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,120
Hmm.That's because you're not me.

549
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,850
Okay,you've got to remember this.

550
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,140
This is bodsworth.You
took him everywhere.

551
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,740
No,I think I'd remember
a bear that ugly.

552
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,590
Well,clearly,it's yours.

553
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,460
Your mom kept it all these
years,and he's here in your old room.

554
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,390
Wait.This was my old room?

555
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,090
My mom told me I'm in my
old room down the hall.

556
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,190
No,this was your room.What
are you talking about?

557
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,470
Evening,girls.

558
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,210
Hey.How was the party?

559
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,080
It was lovely.

560
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,150
I think your mother would
like you home to help clean up.

561
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,480
I'm sorry,mom.

562
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,520
It's okay,sweetie.

563
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,080
But I don't want you
seeing that girl anymore.

564
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,390
Orson,honey,where have you been?

565
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,870
We got a call from danielle's doctor.

566
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,810
Apparently,her fall caused
a placental abruption,

567
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,480
- where the placenta separates from the uterus.
- Oh,my god.

568
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,240
Now they said not to
panic.There are degrees of this.

569
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,050
They're doing a sonogram,then
they're gonna call us.

570
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,770
I can't wait that long.I
have to be with her.

571
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,700
Okay.I'll get your purse.

572
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,370
What do you think you're
doing? You can't leave yet.

573
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,740
- Something's come up.We'll talk tomorrow.
- No,we'll talk now.

574
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,340
You still owe me an explanation
for that scuzzy gyno you sent me to.

575
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,640
I said I was sorry.For god
sakes,susan,not everything is about you.

576
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh,I know this night has been a
complete disaster,but all in all,

577
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,080
it's still your best party ever.

578
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,900
I'm confused.

579
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,810
Ow!Now I'm confused,and my head hurts.

580
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,590
That's for letting edie
think you're engaged.

581
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,160
And the kiss?

582
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,720
When you saw me
flirting,you smashed a glass.

583
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,050
When victor heard I had an affair,he
started crunching poll numbers.

584
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:59,500
I need a man who cares enough to explode
when he thinks he's gonna lose me.

585
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,050
I don't just love you.I
lovethe way you love me.

586
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,820
- So we're back on?
- See you thursday.

587
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,360
Al,what have you got for me?

588
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,350
I think I found a way
to make this happen,

589
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,240
but it might take a week or
two to line everything up.

590
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,230
Fantastic.

591
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,260
I'll call you when it's done.

592
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,500
Shirley?

593
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,500
Can you make some
copies of the britt file?

594
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,530
Al Kanminsky Certified Puhlic Accountant

595
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,150
ah seen gaby?

596
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,830
Uh,yeah,in the bathroom upstairs.

597
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,750
Tell me something.

598
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:07,000
When you found out that kid who you were
paying to mow your lawn was doing your wife,

599
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,200
how did you not kill him?

600
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,350
Well,I wanted to at first,but...

601
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,700
hey,we're all human,right?
We gotta forgive and forget.

602
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,200
You're a very understanding man.If
she pulled something like that on me,

603
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,570
yhat guy wouldn't be around for long.

604
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,350
Yeah,but no woman's worth
going to jail for,right?

605
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,370
If you have enough money,it's not
that hard to make someone disappear.

606
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,600
let's go,honey.

607
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,270
Night,carlos.

608
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,810
- darling,what are you doing?
- I have to bring this dvd player to danielle.

609
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,350
- Honey,we really have to go.
- It'll just take a few seconds.These damn cords...

610
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,380
- sweetheart,it's a long drive.
- It's the only thing she asked for.

611
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,160
yes.Hello?

612
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,310
Hello,doctor.

613
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,870
How is she?

614
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,120
- Thank god.
- oh,my god.

615
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,150
It's gonna be okay.

616
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,910
kids are all tucked in.They're
sleeping like angels.

617
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Great.Did you put
quaaludes in their cocoa?

618
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,480
Could you check on 'em for me,please?

619
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,170
- So how was the party?
- You drugged me.

620
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,370
Oh.Just a little.

621
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,190
What is wrong with you? I
told you,I didn't want any pot.

622
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,700
Before you slap me around,let
me ask you something.

623
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,880
Do you feel better?

624
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,930
That's not the point.And what were you
thinking,using my son as a drug mule?

625
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,950
He didn't know what was going on,and why

626
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,090
are you making such a big deal about it?

627
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,930
Let me ask you something.Do you
remember what I wore to the junior prom

628
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,480
or what part I hadin the play that year?

629
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,970
Who remembers that stuff?

630
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Parents who weren't stoned.

631
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,840
My whole childhood passed in a blur
because you were medicating yourself...

632
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,990
pot when you were sick,booze when
you weren'T.I am not going to do that.

633
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,340
I wot miss a second of my kids'
lives,not if I can avoid it.

634
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:53,540
Well,I'd say I'm sorry,but I'm not.

635
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,690
You're a mom.

636
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,990
You know,there's nothing worse
than watching your kids suffer,

637
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,130
and seeing you...

638
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:09,150
act all goofy,watching
that cartoon,well...

639
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,890
it was probably the
high point of my trip.

640
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,090
I get it.

641
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,510
But if you ever pull
something like this again...

642
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,320
- I won'T.
- Okay.

643
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,180
Well...

644
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,260
I think I'll turn in.

645
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,740
- Yenta.
- What?

646
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,760
Junior year,you were yenta
in "fiddler on the roof."

647
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,900
- You remembered.
- Yeah.

648
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,410
There are some performances so
bad,even alcohol can't block them out.

649
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,330
Bree?

650
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,730
Can we call a truce,please?

651
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,940
So you know I'm not
bluffing,um,I brought cake.

652
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,760
I am so sorry that I
snapped at you tonight.

653
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,030
It's okay.

654
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,900
I just wanna know what's going on.

655
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,510
Ever since you've been pregnant,there's
been this wall between us.

656
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,810
It's like something's
changed,and I don't know why.

657
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,320
Did I do something to offend you?

658
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,580
It's not about you.I've just
been going through some things.

659
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,320
Like what? I mean,come on.Just tell me.

660
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,250
We share everything.

661
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,920
Okay.Um...

662
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,080
I haven't told anybody this,but...

663
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,850
it's,uh,about the baby.

664
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,690
- There have been some complications.
- Oh,no.

665
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,280
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah,everything's fine,

666
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,610
but,uh,there was just a time
where I thought I might lose it.

667
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,980
Oh,my god.

668
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,070
And there I was,just bugging you
about your doctor.I am ssorry.

669
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,040
- You should've just told me.
-No,you're pregnant,too.

670
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,390
I'm not gonna tell you
anything that's gonna worry you.

671
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,820
Oh,are you kidding? It's the
first baby I've had in 17 years.

672
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,560
You know,I could not
possibly be more freaked out.

673
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,020
- This morning,I caught mike building a crib.
- No.

674
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,670
- This early?
- Yeah!

675
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:45,160
I-I wanted to scream.You know,are
you nuts? Do you just wanna jinx it?

676
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:50,590
This is what we get for having
kids at our age... anxiety,terror.

677
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,440
It's just gonna get worse.

678
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,200
Do you know,when our babies
go to college,we'll be like...

679
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,000
dead?

680
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,950
- If we are lucky
- Mm.

681
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,740
Look at us.

682
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,490
Pregnant gals,eating cake and bitchin'.

683
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,260
- it's kinda nice,huh?
- It really is.

684
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,800
- What are you doing?
- The hospital called.

685
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,750
My aunt's ready to come home.

686
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,590
- And you want her to stay in here?
- Yeah.

687
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,030
I think making this room
off-limits was a mistake.

688
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,300
If I want dylan to
focus on other things,

689
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,400
I really need to make
it less intriguing.

690
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,190
Speaking of intriguing,

691
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,250
what were you thinking last night?

692
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,220
- What?
- Come on.

693
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,830
"The worst thing a father could do"?
You realize what people are gonna think.

694
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,500
Yeah.

695
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,890
They're gonna be very uncomfortable,

696
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,930
and uncomfortable people
don't ask questions.

697
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,230
all children love games.

698
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,380
But children grow up,and then
they find  new games to play.

699
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:29,010
They pretend to be well  so
their families won't worry.

700
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,080
They lie to their lovers  about
where they go  in the afternoon.

701
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,140
So anyway,that's why it was so great.

702
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,040
- Oh!
- They invent stories to hide

703
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,330
- the truth from their friends.
- I got it,I got it.

704
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,690
Oh,one more.Here you go.

705
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,870
Yes...

706
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,320
everyone has fun playing games

707
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,870
right up until the moment...

708
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,320
Someone gets hurt.
