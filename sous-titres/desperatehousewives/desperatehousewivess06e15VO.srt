<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:03,324 --> 00:00:05,715
<i>A friend was welcomed back.</i>

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,730
I told'em how
much better you were doing.

4
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,927
<i>A marriage was on the mend.</i>

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,555
I would like to recapture
what we once had.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,309
<i>Gaby and Carlos discovered a secret.</i>

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,937
You are gettin' sloppy! And if
people start pokin' around, we're done.

8
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>And Susan made a request.</i>

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:27,723
You're asking if I'm okay with
letting a stripper live with us.

10
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:37,704
<i>The first thing you need to know
about Robin Gallagher</i>

11
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,362
<i>was that everyone
liked to look at her.</i>

12
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:45,154
<i>They would stare at her legs...</i>

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>And her breasts...</i>

14
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:50,944
<i>And her hair.</i>

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,006
<i>And once they were done,</i>

16
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:56,431
<i>people would begin to ask...</i>

17
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,974
Who is this?

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,320
- This is my friend Robin.
- Hello there.

19
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,271
Mike had to work today, so
I thought I'd bring her as my plus one.

20
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,545
- Hello there.
- You already said that.

21
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:07,742
I wanted her to know I meant it.

22
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,737
It's really good to have you
back on the Lane.

23
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,074
It's great to be back.
I didn't know what to expect at first.

24
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:17,285
I have wondered how everyone
would feel about me,

25
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:20,370
if they were really ready
to welcome me back.

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,849
I guess there's always that fear

27
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:25,001
that people are going to reject you.

28
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,505
- Do I smell appetizers?
- I know I do.

29
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,152
Hello, Susan!

30
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:39,307
Who's your new friend?

31
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,144
Robin, this is Carlos,
Tom, Roy and Orson.

32
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,940
Hope you got all that,
'cause there's gonna be a quiz later.

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,869
So, Robin, welcome
to my humble abode.

34
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:53,113
Thank you.

35
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:55,247
It's so suburban.

36
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:58,076
I've never been in a place where
the ceilings were so tall.

37
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,805
Fascinating. Just fascinating.

38
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,207
- You live in the city?
- I did,

39
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:07,366
but I'll be living
with Susan for a while.

40
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:08,837
I just moved in today.

41
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:15,300
- Susan, let's get you a drink.
- No, that's okay. I'll wait till...

42
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,261
So...

43
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,558
So how did you meet Susan?

44
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,983
So... you want to tell
us about your new friend

45
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:26,396
or, should I say "roommate"?

46
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,264
She was down on her luck and
she needed a place to stay.

47
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:32,861
Plus, I feel responsible,
because I told her to give up her job.

48
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,195
What was wrong?

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,576
We probably don't need
to let the guys in on this, but...

50
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,039
- Robin was...
- That's wild!

51
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,742
So you used to be a stripper?

52
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:49,157
<i>Yes...</i>

53
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,142
<i>Everyone liked to look
at Robin Gallagher...</i>

54
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,473
<i>But not everyone</i>

55
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,776
<i>liked what they saw.</i>

60
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:23,854
You moved a stripper into the
neighborhood? What were you thinking?

61
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:26,790
You guys aren't even taking
the time to get to know her.

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,302
Our husbands are
pulling together their dollar bills.

63
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,676
- What more do we need to know?
- I just met Robin,

64
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:34,547
- she seems great.
- Did she mention that she's a stripper?

65
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,341
Did she have to?

66
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:40,094
I am just trying
to help her get back on her feet.

67
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,228
I bet that'd be a nice change
for her.

68
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:45,282
She's living in my house.
If anybody should be worried,

69
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,602
it'd be me, and I am not
threatened by her at all.

70
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,405
- Really?
- Yes. She's a nice girl.

71
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:53,717
Nice, blonde, and you can
bounce a quarter of her ass.

72
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:55,401
I'm telling you, she's trouble.

73
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:59,121
Here's a good thing... She can't bring
any more crazy than I did.

74
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,056
- Let's give her a chance.
- I agree.

75
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,327
Robin's probably had a tough life,
and she needs our help.

76
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,365
I'm all for being open minded
but I have teenage boys at home.

77
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:10,196
The last thing I need
next door is a stripper.

78
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,300
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.
We're picking up Parker for school.

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
Please come in.
I'll get him for you.

80
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,520
You ever gonna get back
to folding the laundry?

81
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,428
I thought I'd treat myself
and wash the breakfast dishes first.

82
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:38,024
You started this.
Don't you think you should finish?

83
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,144
Since you're so
passionate about it...

84
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,068
Knock yourself out.

85
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:54,308
You just went from jerk

86
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:56,754
to adorable real quick.

87
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,630
Happy anniversary.

88
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,556
It's the ring!
You went back to that antique shop.

89
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:09,263
Thank you!

90
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,666
Wait till you see your present.

91
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:15,064
You can unwrap it tonight
when the kids are asleep.

92
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,601
Or how about after
they leave for school?

93
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,617
Why are they still up there
and why can't I hear them?

94
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,006
What's going on?

95
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,742
We're late for school.

96
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,867
The next time you take a shower,
could you close your blinds?

97
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,121
I have a 16-year-old son,

98
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:11,996
and he has friends.

99
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:17,669
You may have retired, but you're
still doing seven shows a week.

100
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,965
At least they didn't have to pay
a cover charge, right?

101
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,982
This is a nice community.

102
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:26,239
You have a responsibility
to the neighbors,

103
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:28,596
Especially the ones
with innocent children.

104
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,767
They're not all so innocent.

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,144
Excuse me?

106
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:38,034
Yesterday that son of yours

107
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,939
asked me if I would
have sex with him.

108
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,986
Parker?

109
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,320
My Parker?

110
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,612
Red hair, skinny,

111
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,243
still-sleeps-in-a-bed-shaped
like-a-racecar Parker?

112
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,487
Of course I said no.

113
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:56,839
Then he offered me cash.

114
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,125
Come in.

115
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,262
Have a seat.

116
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,053
What's up?

117
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:10,675
Something wrong?

118
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,328
We hoped it would be another year

119
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,666
before we had the
parent-son conversation

120
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:19,289
where we tell you not to offer
your neighbor money for sex.

121
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:20,690
But...

122
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:22,525
Crap. She told?

123
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,323
You might want to pick a more
discreet stripper next time.

124
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:30,482
What were you thinking?
We raised you better than that.

125
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:31,859
- Didn't we?
- We did.

126
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:34,954
We did. So... what do you
have to say for yourself?

127
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:42,350
I just really, really, really...

128
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:44,589
Needed to have sex.

129
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,947
Three "reallys.

130
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:50,720
In that case, here's a $20.
Go back and try again.

131
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:54,746
You are a 16-year-old boy.

132
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:58,616
We understand your hormones are
holding your brain hostage,

133
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,980
but why
would you need to pay for sex?

134
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,549
Because I'm the only one with my friends
who hasn't lost his virginity.

135
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,837
First of all, we've seen
your friends and trust me,

136
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:11,324
"pimples," "braces" and "beam me up,
Scotty" are not gettin' any.

137
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:13,350
Girls don't look at me that way.

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,203
It's never gonna happen.

139
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,570
Knock it off!

140
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:28,596
You are a great kid!

141
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,982
You don't need to pay for it.

142
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,804
In a few years,

143
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:34,919
when you're emotionally ready,

144
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,048
you'll meet the right girl,
and you will have tons of sex.

145
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:40,770
After you're married.

146
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,524
Okay, dad. Sorry.

147
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,174
Nice job.

148
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:55,599
Thank you.

149
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:58,007
You think he bought it?

150
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,632
Bought what?

151
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:01,530
You know.

152
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,032
Guys always pay for
sex in some way...

153
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:09,149
Dinner, flowers...

154
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:12,446
Antique rings.

155
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,141
You think that's the only reason
we're having sex tonight?

156
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:20,784
Of course not.
It's our anniversary.

157
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:23,195
It's a given,
like turkey on Thanksgiving.

158
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:27,024
Although I am hoping that the ring
gets me an upgrade from missionary.

159
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:30,751
Forget about upgrades.
You just got bumped off the flight.

160
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,197
Why are you getting so upset?

161
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:37,336
Because I didn't know I was married
to such a cynical lug nut.

162
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:40,454
Are we really not
gonna have sex tonight?

163
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,242
Don't worry, Tom.

164
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:44,606
In a few years,
when you're emotionally ready,

165
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:46,294
you're gonna have tons of sex.

166
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:51,115
Come on!

167
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,673
So you really like that ring?

168
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:05,077
Did you read the inscription?

169
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,027
"To my darling..."

170
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,820
We're not having sex.

171
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,121
Come on.

172
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:11,808
Why not?

173
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:14,453
Because I am still
upset by what you said.

174
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:18,701
Do you really think women only sleep
with men if they buy them things?

175
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,148
I think supermodels sleep
with 80-year-old millionaires

176
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:27,001
because they love to hear stories
about when bread was 5 cents a loaf.

177
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,294
I'm not a model,
and you're no millionaire,

178
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,911
so I'm thinking
you owe me an apology.

179
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:35,923
You and I went to Marley's Tavern
on our first two dates,

180
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,847
and I could barely get past
a good night kiss.

181
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:42,224
But third time out, I dropped
200 bucks at La Rive Gauche,

182
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,393
and you finally put out.

183
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,271
Finally made love.

184
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:49,754
Listen, you idiot!

185
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:57,216
I did not "put out" because you
bought me an expensive diner.

186
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,724
I did it because you showed up
with a lightbulb

187
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:04,492
to replace the one that had burned
out in the hallway to my apartment.

188
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:05,750
Remember?

189
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:08,517
You said I didn't live
in the best neighborhood.

190
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,836
And I was worried about you.

191
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:15,299
I was ready to do
you right then and there.

192
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:17,424
Really?

193
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,661
That's all it takes?

194
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:22,390
Me showing you I care?

195
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,031
'Cause that's easy.

196
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:30,940
And now it's time for
your anniversary present.

197
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:43,491
Remember the other day when
I told you this was a nice neighborhood?

198
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,339
I forgot to warn you...
there's this one bitch

199
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,101
that lives right nearby,

200
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,625
and that would be me.

201
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:52,053
I understand.

202
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,672
An ex-stripper moving next door
will freak some people out.

203
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,717
Seriously, I'm sorry.

204
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:00,720
Apology accepted.

205
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:07,018
And, by the way...

206
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:11,131
Next time you're giving it
to your husband with the lights on,

207
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,648
could you draw the drapes?

208
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:25,453
Here we go.

209
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:31,516
I've got the Steiner
Bar Mitzvah tomorrow

210
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:34,758
If you need me to run any
errands for you before I go?

211
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,427
It should be good.

212
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:39,115
Joyce'll be here at 3 for my rehab.
And Roy

213
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:40,968
offered to take me to the park.

214
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,679
Isn't that lovely?

215
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,809
- Do you wanna watch a movie?
- I'll read...

216
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:52,798
I guess we could watch a movie.

217
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,982
If you want to read, go ahead.

218
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:01,992
Good night.

219
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,816
If you need anything,
just ring the bell.

220
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:08,954
I'm right upstairs.

221
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:11,957
I'm sure I'll be fine.

222
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,203
Knock, knock.

223
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:22,927
Come on in.

224
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,681
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.

225
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,681
Susan and Mike have
been so good to me.

226
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,795
I wanna do something nice,
and I thought,

227
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:31,685
maybe I should bake them a cake.

228
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:33,910
That's very thoughtful.

229
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,940
Feel free to use whatever you need.

230
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:37,729
Thank you.

231
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,155
So what do I need?

232
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:47,034
What exactly do
you know about cakes?

233
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,664
If you're gonna
hide in one for more than an hour,

234
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,958
the air holes have
got to be pretty big.

235
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:59,720
All right, then. It looks like I
will be teaching you how to make a cake.

236
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:01,924
You rock, Bree!

237
00:14:03,015 --> 00:14:04,180
I rock.

238
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:08,655
The key to success
is following the recipe exactly.

239
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,308
The secret to baking is precision.

240
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:13,835
Got it. You're my hero.

241
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:17,898
- What are you doing?
- Making you my screensaver.

242
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,080
- That's sweet.
- You're replacing my cat.

243
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:22,877
He's eating noodles.

244
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,682
Let's just do this.

245
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,073
Go get yourself an apron.

246
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,160
That is, like, the coolest
cake I've ever seen.

247
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,478
Raspberry Mocha.

248
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:35,310
Orson's favorite.

249
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:39,958
I talked to him at the party.
He's nice.

250
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,298
It must be tough
having him in a wheelchair.

251
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,467
It's been challenging.

252
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:48,387
They say you can get through
anything if you have a solid marriage.

253
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,310
Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

254
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,151
It's fine. Let's just say before
his accident there were issues,

255
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:00,675
and now we're trying to put
the pieces back together.

256
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:02,311
That's good for you.

257
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,154
So what's the piece you can't find?

258
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,239
Now you are prying.

259
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:10,466
What? We did make a cake together.

260
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,057
My grandmother always said
that if you wanna save your marriage,

261
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:17,041
there's only one room to do it in.

262
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:22,087
- The bedroom.
- I got that.

263
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:24,764
It's not about sex.

264
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,916
It's about... closeness.

265
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,824
We've lost our intimacy.

266
00:15:30,424 --> 00:15:31,424
Honey.

267
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:33,488
Sex is how men get intimate.

268
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,902
I'm not even sure he's capable.

269
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:38,187
It doesn't matter.

270
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,962
His brain still works.

271
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:42,942
And he can see you.
He can feel you touch him.

272
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:44,929
He can hear what you say to him.

273
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,965
I had this regular customer...
92 years old, in a wheelchair.

274
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:51,992
I had to push the oxygen tank
out of the way to give him a lap dance.

275
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:56,413
I don't know if he's
even interested.

276
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:59,015
Here's the thing.

277
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:00,905
Neither of us knows for sure,

278
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:03,495
but only one of us can find out.

279
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,790
Hello, dear.
How was the Bar Mitzvah?

280
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,727
A boy became a man,
and a Rabbi blesse my cream pie.

281
00:16:18,897 --> 00:16:21,021
Same old, same old.
How was your day?

282
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:23,774
I've been passing the time reading.

283
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,453
I suppose I should
get out of these clothes.

284
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:33,491
Peter Tchaikovsky. God bless you.

285
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:35,411
I never tire of this piece.

286
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:38,586
It's extraordinary- so moving, so...

287
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:39,999
Sensual.

288
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,605
Don't you wanna do that upstairs?

289
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,984
- Near the hamper?
- Actually,

290
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:17,533
I'd rather do it...

291
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:21,004
Right... Here.

292
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:31,216
Why are you walking like that?

293
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,845
Why do you think?

294
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:36,972
I'm not sure.

295
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,851
Trying to make me feel
better about being paralyzed?

296
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,358
Guess again, big boy.

297
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,073
If you're having a stroke,
we're gonna make quite the team.

298
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:04,162
I do believe it's getting... hot,

299
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,708
in here.

300
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,601
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, just a second.

301
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:19,250
My earring's caught.

302
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,442
Enjoy the music.

303
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,367
- Let me help.
- No. I'm good.

304
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:29,281
Stay there. I'm coming over.

305
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,818
I've got it!

306
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,323
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,243
I told you I didn't need any help!

308
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,912
In my defense,
that wasn't entirely clear.

309
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,540
Forget it. This was stupid.

310
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:46,166
What was that?

311
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:49,253
What do you think?!
It was a lap dance!

312
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,587
A lap dance?

313
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,215
I was trying to arouse you.

314
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:55,881
You are aware I'm in wheelchair?

315
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:58,700
I thought you'd still might be
interested in that sort of thing.

316
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,931
- I am!
- You certaintly don't act like it.

317
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,086
After the accident, I just never
thought you would ever consider...

318
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,821
Things will be awkward at first,
but we can work on it.

319
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:18,323
You're my husband.

320
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:21,092
I wanna be close to you.

321
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:24,063
I wanna share your bed again,
even if it means

322
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:27,069
just holding your hand
before you fall asleep.

323
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:30,335
Come here.

324
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,213
Is this all right?

325
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:49,277
Let's see...

326
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:52,717
I've got Tchaikovsky on the stereo,

327
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,334
my wife in my arms.

328
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:58,668
Yes,

329
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,673
this is all right.

330
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,054
She and Danny spent
the whole day together.

331
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,483
What's left to say?

332
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,701
This is out of control.
Let's forbid Ana to talk to him.

333
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:29,271
Yeah, forbid two teenagers,
that always works.

334
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,876
Besides, what would we say...

335
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:33,482
we overheard his parents talking
and we think they're evil?

336
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,200
What you think the Bolens did?

337
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,287
I don't know but you don't go on
the run for not paying your cable bill.

338
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,257
They've been cagey
since they moved in.

339
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,574
And Nick doesn't work.
How do they have money?

340
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,701
Maybe they're drug dealers
or gun runners.

341
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,621
Whatever they are, I don't want
Ana anywhere near that family.

342
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,569
- She won't break up with him.
- She will if we make her.

343
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:54,616
I told you that won't work. We need
to come up with a carrot, not a stick.

344
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,090
- Privacy, please.
- I've got big news.

345
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:03,157
- For me or for you?
- You!

346
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:06,384
I just got a call
from my good friend Luke Rayfield.

347
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:09,841
I was a struggling model in New York
when he was a struggling photographer.

348
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:12,764
Well, mostly I was his beard
for all his family functions.

349
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:15,607
- There was this one time...
- Is the part about me coming up?

350
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,214
Anyway, Luke now has
his own modeling agency,

351
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:23,240
and he's always looking for new talent,
so I sent him your picture.

352
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,631
Wait for it! Wait for it.

353
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,346
He wants to represent you.

354
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,205
You may now begin screaming.

355
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:33,661
I have to call Danny!

356
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,628
Well, you know what? Danny can wait.

357
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,424
We need to go buy you some new luggage.
They want you in New York immediately.

358
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,719
Now? But, uh, don't I
have to finish high school?

359
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,542
World war II... Germany lost.
Korean war... Korea lost.

360
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:48,682
Vietnam war... we lost.
Happy graduation.

361
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,560
What's wrong?

362
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:55,480
I don't think I can go just yet.

363
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,399
Why not?

364
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:00,963
Danny and I have a plan.

365
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,572
We're going to New York
together when I graduate.

366
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,630
After everything
I've done for her...

367
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:12,797
"Danny and I are moving to New York
after I graduate. We're in love!"

368
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:15,542
Pour me some more wine
before I throw up.

369
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,877
What's wrong?

370
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,467
Gaby got her niece a foot
in the door for a model crew,

371
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:21,465
- and she's turning it down.
- Bad call.

372
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:25,392
I used to take ballet, and
I was pretty good at it, too.

373
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:28,639
And one time, this instructor
from a big ballet company

374
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,439
saw me perform, and...
long story short,

375
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:33,352
two days later
they offered me a job.

376
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:36,855
- What happened?
- Bobby Butterfield happened.

377
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:39,483
- A boy.
- Not just a boy.

378
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,870
The boy.

379
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:42,933
I was crazy about him,

380
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,009
thought it was gonna last forever.

381
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:46,826
So I passed on the job.

382
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:50,168
And two months later, he
dumped me for Louise McMullen.

383
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,731
And then a month after that,
I got into a car accident,

384
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:56,583
messed up my knee, and then
it was good-bye, tutu. Hello ta-tas.

385
00:22:58,508 --> 00:22:59,908
That is fantastic!

386
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:04,248
- Did we just hear the same story?
- You've got to tell that story to Ana.

387
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:08,053
Putting off your dreams and then having
your life spiral down the crapper?

388
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,138
It couldn't be more perfect.

389
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:15,769
Well, I guess I could talk to Ana,
if you think it would help her.

390
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,434
Great. And don't be afraid
to turn on the waterworks.

391
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:20,524
Nothin' sells pathetic
like stripper tears.

392
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:23,871
Maybe it would help
if I started taping you

393
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:26,388
so you could hear
what it is you say.

394
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,149
Don't be discouraged if Luke starts
you off with catalogue work.

395
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:34,127
Just try to get
your face in the shot.

396
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:36,897
A little tough to do with a lawn mower,
but I did it.

397
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:40,919
- Where you've been. I was texting you.
- I was just coming over.

398
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:43,296
Taking a trip?

399
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:47,093
I'm sure you two
have a lot to talk about.

400
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,360
So I'll just take these inside for you.
Bye, Danny.

401
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:53,890
What do you need luggage for?

402
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,472
I was just about to come over
and tell you right now.

403
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,559
- When did this happen?
- I just found out.

404
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:03,324
I thought we were supposed
to go together.

405
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:06,681
- Why can't you wait?
- This is a huge opportunity.

406
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,406
You should be saying,
"great, Ana. Go for it."

407
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:13,506
If you can't support me, then maybe
we shouldn't even be together.

408
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:21,525
- What's up?
- I've been meaning to thank you.

409
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,749
You little speech to Ana
worked like a charm.

410
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,051
- I just took her to the airport.
- Great.

411
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:29,301
So, why was she fighting
with Danny Bolen yesterday?

412
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:31,136
They were breaking up.

413
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:33,307
They were dating?

414
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:35,891
Yeah. That's the whole reason
I wanted you to talk to her,

415
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,049
to convince her she was
screwing up her life,

416
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:40,968
so I could ship her off to New York
and get her away from Danny.

417
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,523
You didn't tell me that.

418
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:47,069
- Okay, so?
- So I don't like being used.

419
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,963
Don't get upset, you did good.
Ana's gone. Danny's out of the picture.

420
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,530
I owe ya big time.

421
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,212
I think we need to talk.

422
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,464
Sorry. It's really not a good time.

423
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,531
Actually, this is exactly the time.

424
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:17,681
I just talked to Luke.

425
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:21,824
Ana has settled into her dorm,
she's got all her classes lined up, and

426
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:23,939
he's taking her
new head shots tomorrow.

427
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,526
And the best part is, she is miles away
from the nearest Bolen.

428
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:49,548
Perfect timing.

429
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,502
- Something smells good.
- Thank you.

430
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:56,565
Just putting on the finishing
touches before we eat.

431
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,074
You spoil me.

432
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:02,791
- What's wrong?
- Is it your back again?

433
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,938
I spent all day
working in a crawl space.

434
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,536
I'll call the chiropractor
first thing in the morning.

435
00:26:07,703 --> 00:26:09,753
No need for that. I can fix it.

436
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,485
Come here.

437
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,799
Wait! Wait! What are you doin'?

438
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,600
At Double D's, the girls were
constantly throwing their backs up

439
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:19,295
from sliding down that pole.
They all came to see me.

440
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,773
Now just relax...

441
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,706
and one, two, three.

442
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:26,117
There. How do you feel?

443
00:26:28,065 --> 00:26:29,065
It's gone.

444
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,630
The pain's gone.

445
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:33,404
Thank you, Robin.

446
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:36,737
I was just gonna give him a scotch
and make him sleep in the guest room.

447
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:39,014
Seriously, you really fixed me up.

448
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,556
- Thanks.
- Please.

449
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:43,810
After all you guys have done for me,
it's the least I can do.

450
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:50,866
I'm home!

451
00:26:51,203 --> 00:26:52,203
In here!

452
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,114
No fast food tonight! Fire up the...

453
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,782
microwave.

454
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:02,287
My back went out again.

455
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,069
Robin tried cracking it,
but it just didn't go deep enough.

456
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:07,096
This is the way
the buddhist monks do it.

457
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:10,212
It's the only way to get
through all that muscle.

458
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,839
Is there a problem, babe?

459
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:15,717
No problem.

460
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:21,013
It looks like you're in good hands.
Or... feet.

461
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,917
So I'll just, uh, go make dinner.

462
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:25,748
Happy trails!

463
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,560
<i>How does that feel?</i>

464
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,677
<i>Yeah, yeah, do that! Do that!</i>

465
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:36,229
<i>- Can you handle a little more?
- Give me all you got.</i>

466
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:39,586
So I ran into Janice White today.

467
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,608
Says her husband is sick.

468
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:43,221
<i>You're really stiff.</i>

469
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,536
<i>- Let me try something else.
- You're the boss.</i>

470
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:51,064
Apparently, it's bacterial,
and he's bloating like a pig.

471
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:53,081
<i>I'm gonna grab it and pull.</i>

472
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,333
<i>Go for it!</i>

473
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:56,941
And there's a lot of diarrhea!

474
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:07,852
This is incredible. Those monks
really know what they're doing.

475
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:12,653
When do they find time to pray?

476
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm on my way to school.

477
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:22,534
The faculty volunteered to make
sandwiches for the homeless.

478
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,961
Okay, well, I'll, uh, see you later.

479
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,956
What's the matter?

480
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,693
I re-piped an entire house.

481
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,804
- Even my hair hurts.
- You poor thing.

482
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,254
- You want the heating pad?
- I'll be okay.

483
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,339
I won't be gone long. Feel better.

484
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:39,630
I'll just have Robin crack
my back when she gets home.

485
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:41,845
Or I could stay here and do it.

486
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,167
What about the homeless?

487
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:47,050
Please. They've gone
this long without food.

488
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:48,601
What's another ten minutes?

489
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:52,498
Susan, do you have a problem
with Robin working on me?

490
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:53,865
Of course not.

491
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:57,116
But she's not here
and you're in pain.

492
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,578
So why don't you let me
take a shot at it?

493
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:02,073
A shot at it? We're
talking about my spine.

494
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:06,286
Mike, Robin didn't exactly go
to medical school between lap dances.

495
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,286
I saw what she did. I
can do the same thing.

496
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:11,517
Here we go.

497
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,980
That's exactly what Robin did.

498
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:18,753
No, she didn't yank it.
It's my arm, not an emergency brake.

499
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,052
Just take a deep breath.
The key is relaxation.

500
00:29:23,754 --> 00:29:25,805
One... two...

501
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,770
You know, if you hadn't
moved when I said "three"...

502
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,103
Just go.

503
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,065
Is Mike gonna be all right?

504
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:48,432
- Can I see him?
- Sure, sweetie.

505
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:51,121
Just don't climb on the bed.

506
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,922
Why didn't you wait for me? I would've
taken care of Mike's back, no problem.

507
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,216
Well, I wanted to do it myself.

508
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:09,099
I'm lying. I didn't wanna do it.
I just really

509
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,142
wanted you not to do it.

510
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:14,062
I don't understand.

511
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:18,986
God, I've been trying really
hard to be cool about all this.

512
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:22,080
But when I walked in
and I saw you...

513
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:23,863
all over Mike...

514
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:26,199
When I was cracking his back?

515
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,119
I was just trying to help.

516
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,445
While you wearing next to nothing

517
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:33,415
and straddling my husband.

518
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:36,709
How was I supposed to react?
You used to be a stripper.

519
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:45,343
Don't cry. Why are you crying?
Strippers are supposed to be tough.

520
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,053
Stop calling me that.

521
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,530
Yes, I was a stripper.

522
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:53,284
But you know what?
You were the only person

523
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,603
who never treated me like one,
until now.

524
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,817
And I'm really sorry
if I crossed the line with Mike.

525
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,617
I guess after working
nine years in the club, I just

526
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:06,184
don't know where
the line is anymore.

527
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,951
I overreacted.

528
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,552
Maybe I should move out.

529
00:31:15,827 --> 00:31:17,627
You don't have to do that.

530
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,261
I want us to be friends
for a very long time.

531
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,288
So, yes, I do.

532
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:33,975
Daddy needs help
making the bed go back down.

533
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,471
Susan asked me to bring
some of your mail.

534
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:52,994
I'm Robin. We met at your party.

535
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,412
Yeah, I remember.

536
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:57,040
How's it going?

537
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:01,711
I take it you heard about my little
vacation at Fairview behavioral.

538
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:03,710
Yes. I heard.

539
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:05,327
Well, to be honest,

540
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,841
it's been hard, especially coming back
to this big, empty house.

541
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:12,555
Not to mention the subtle glances
I get from people judging me.

542
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,505
But you know what I
say? To hell with them.

543
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:16,933
Thank you.

544
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,930
I'll see you.

545
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:24,700
And if this house gets too lonely,
I'm looking for a room to rent.

546
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:26,817
Mike and Susan are great, but

547
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:29,072
it's gettin' a little crowded
over there.

548
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:31,533
Okay, I'll keep it in mind.

549
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:35,066
For what it's worth,
it might take the heat off of you.

550
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:39,123
No one judges the woman from the looney
bin when there's a stripper next door.

551
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,250
This is great.

552
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:51,368
I haven't had
a female roommate since...

553
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,805
- after college.
- Let's hear it for girl power!

554
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,059
We should go out
and have a drink to celebrate.

555
00:32:58,622 --> 00:32:59,772
I don't know.

556
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,003
My therapist says
I should get out more, but...

557
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,420
Even being over at Gaby's
house the other day, it's...

558
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:09,237
- It's just hard.
- Yeah, I get that.

559
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:13,157
So what was it like being
in a mental hospital?

560
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:19,198
You know...

561
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:21,978
as much fun as one would expect.

562
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:24,475
I only ask 'cause of my mom.

563
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:27,185
She used to use me
as a punching bag and

564
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:29,424
I always dreamed
about having her committed.

565
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:31,426
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,013
It was only when she was drunk.

567
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:39,458
It was her way of coping with my dad
cheating on her all the time.

568
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:43,515
I remember wishing that he was ugly
so other women wouldn't want him but

569
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:45,189
he looked like Clint Eastwood.

570
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:51,041
Anyway, mom had to take
out her anger somewhere, and

571
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:54,076
I was an easier target
than a 6'4" trucker.

572
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:58,016
Actually...

573
00:33:59,076 --> 00:34:00,913
It was pretty bad at the hospital.

574
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:04,542
People always say it's
the screaming that gets to you.

575
00:34:07,127 --> 00:34:09,964
But at least screaming
means you're alive, you know?

576
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:15,555
What I couldn't take
were the people with the...

577
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,309
blank stares.

578
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,420
There was this one woman
who sat frozen in the garden all day,

579
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,526
whispering the words to

580
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:30,151
"old MacDonald had a farm"
over and over and over.

581
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:33,191
The doctors ever take
offense when she got to

582
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:35,990
"here a quack, there a quack,
everywhere a quack-quack"?

583
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:45,964
You know what?

584
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:52,532
If there were ever two people
who deserved a night out drinking...

585
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:53,778
It's us.

586
00:34:57,226 --> 00:34:58,376
Quid pro quo.

587
00:34:59,321 --> 00:35:02,450
I told you what it was like
to go to bed in restraints,

588
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:06,062
so I think it's only fair that you tell
me what it was like being a stripper.

589
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:07,785
It was brutal.

590
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:11,325
If I had a dollar for every
guy that slapped me on my butt

591
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,290
just 'cause he felt like it...

592
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:15,363
Come to think of it, I do.

593
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,289
Excuse me.

594
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:21,577
My friend and I were wondering
if you'd like to join us at our table.

595
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:25,581
No, thank you. It's girls night out.

596
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:29,543
Two beautiful women in a bar.
Can't blame a guy for asking.

597
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:32,815
We're over there
if you decide to go coed.

598
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:37,790
Is it bad that I wanna go
sit with them?

599
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:38,970
You do?

600
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,807
It's been a while since a guy
that cute has flirted with me.

601
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:47,915
- You know what? Let's do it.
- Really?

602
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:51,082
Yes. You look way too hot
to waste it on just me.

603
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:53,051
Shall we?

604
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,741
- Come on. You've gotta have a secret.
- Nope. It's shampoo and conditioner.

605
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,454
Well, it looks amazing. You should be
on the cover of hair magazines.

606
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:05,621
- What is it you said you do?
- I didn't.

607
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,374
But my friend Katherine is starting
her own catering company.

608
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,794
Well, thinking about it.
Cooking's a passion of mine.

609
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,344
But a lot has to happen
before I start my own business.

610
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,801
I know. You're a model.

611
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:24,056
Dental hygienist?

612
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,392
I know. You're a flight attendant.

613
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,812
You may as well tell me
or I'm just gonna keep

614
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,857
- guessing all night.
- She's a stripper, okay?

615
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,069
Ex-stripper. I'm sorry.

616
00:36:37,686 --> 00:36:40,782
Why are you apologizing?
We love strippers.

617
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:44,577
They're like angels of mercy...
that show their boobs.

618
00:36:46,695 --> 00:36:48,664
We should probably get going.

619
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:52,126
What are you talking about?
We haven't even danced yet.

620
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,078
I don't really feel like dancing,

621
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,138
although I can't speak
for Katherine here.

622
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:57,924
It's just, I wanna dance with you.

623
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,251
You're not attracted to
someone who's classy, witty,

624
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:03,763
not to mention
breathtakingly beautiful?

625
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,849
No offense to your friend,
but you're more my type.

626
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,920
Well, in that case, I guess
I'll just keep her all to myself.

627
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,830
Night, guys.

628
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:30,325
The look on their faces...

629
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:33,388
I know. It was the perfect combo of

630
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:36,655
"I am so turned on"
and "I am so going home alone."

631
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,298
You should remember that the next time
you want to get out of a bad date.

632
00:37:42,465 --> 00:37:43,803
No, I don't think so.

633
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:48,577
Those two pigs confirmed what
I've been thinking for a while now...

634
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:50,852
I think it's time for
me to give up on men.

635
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,562
Amen, sister.

636
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:56,364
It's official.
My dating days are over.

637
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,818
You don't have to take it that far.

638
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:02,530
You could always just do what I did
and explore other options.

639
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:05,241
What do you mean?

640
00:38:06,413 --> 00:38:07,763
Cast a wider net?

641
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,036
Expand the pool?

642
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:13,082
Date chicks?

643
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,269
So you're...

644
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:21,444
Card-carrying.

645
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:29,348
I thought that kiss
felt awfully convincing.

646
00:38:30,371 --> 00:38:33,371
Well, I mean, I dated
guys for a long time and...

647
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,148
I just never really felt a connection.
And then I started stripping,

648
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:42,236
and I was surrounded by all these
confident, sexy women, and I realized,

649
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:46,324
"Robin, sweetie, you have been
barking up the wrong tree."

650
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:49,463
Yeah, I think I got the right tree.

651
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:51,617
Just sick of barking.

652
00:38:53,756 --> 00:38:54,956
Suit yourself.

653
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,625
You're okay with this, right?

654
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,883
I mean, it's not gonna
affect anything with us?

655
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:07,548
I don't see why it would.

656
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
- What are you up to?
- Just out for a walk.

657
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,284
It's such a nice day.

658
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:35,808
Yeah, it is. So how do
you like the neighborhood?

659
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:38,042
- Is everyone treatin' you okay?
- I guess so.

660
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,003
No one's giving you any guff
about being a stripper, are they?

661
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:45,466
I just wanna make sure,
'cause trust me, I've been there.

662
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:50,346
Way back when, I was sorta
in the sex trade myself.

663
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:56,262
I used to model women's
foundation garments for sears, Roebuck.

664
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:58,829
These breasts
put me through college.

665
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:01,190
They're real, by the way.

666
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:03,841
They look real.

667
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:08,698
Anyway, I'm glad that
people are treating you nice.

668
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:11,908
You know what the best part is?

669
00:40:13,698 --> 00:40:15,248
They actually see me.

670
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,379
- See you?
- I spent a lot of years

671
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:22,179
working in a place where people
stared at me all night long.

672
00:40:22,346 --> 00:40:25,173
But no one ever really... saw me.

673
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,212
- You know what I mean?
- I do.

674
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:31,078
And when I first got here, I thought

675
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:33,695
it was gonna be
the same thing. But...

676
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,565
I get the feeling your neighbors

677
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:41,075
see past all the stuff
that people usually look at.

678
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:43,816
It makes me feel really good.

679
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,235
I'm glad.

680
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:50,016
<i>Robin Gallagher was right.</i>

681
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,464
<i>The people she had met
on Wisteria Lane</i>

682
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:55,516
<i>had really looked at her,</i>

683
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:59,642
<i>and they had seen
her sense of morality,</i>

684
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,203
