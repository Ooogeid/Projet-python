2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,500
<i>Lynette made excuses...</i>

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,116
The restaurant did close
a half-hour ago.

4
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:09,055
We're doing inventory.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,800
<i>Carlos made a friend...

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,600
Nothing better than family.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,498
<i>And Edie made a pass.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,500
- Victor popped the question.
- Will you marry me?

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,300
- <i>Susan let Mike down.</i>
- I love you.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,100
But you love him
a little bit more.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
- <i>And Ian...</i>
- Good-bye, Susan.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,600
<i>Let Susan go.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,100
<i>It can happen to anyone--

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
<i>An old woman hears suspicious footsteps
as she walks down the street...

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
<i>a businessman sees a
reflection in his car window...

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,800
<i>a shop owner feels a
blade pressed against his back...

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,900
<i>and in that instant...

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,800
<i>an ordinary person...

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,100
<i>is transformed into a victim.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,600
<i>And a world that seemed so safe

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
<i>is suddenly...

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>filled with danger.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,684
So this little ear-shaped pasta
is called...

24
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:18,500
Orecchiette.

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,000
- And the cubes of bacon are pancetta.
- Thank God for Italian.

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,500
You can charge way more for
"orecchiette with pancetta"

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,300
Than you'd ever get for
"bacon and little ears."

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,400
Thank you.

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,300
This is nice.

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,400
- It doesn't need more garlic?
- No, I mean...

31
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,300
everything the food,
the wine...

32
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:49,100
you.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,200
I swear, there are times this is
all that gets me through my day,

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,800
knowing at the end of it,
I get to steal this little half-hour

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,300
where I'm not a mom or a wife or a...
pizza slave.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm just a...

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,800
tired lady with a nice
man who cooks for her.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,300
Well, it's the highlight
of my day, too.

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,500
Sorry, guys. We're closed.

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, we know.

41
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,600
Put your cell phones
on the table.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,597
Oh, crap.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,300
Get in there. Don't make any noise.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Oh... my... God!

45
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,800
Oh! Oh, my God!

46
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,700
They locked us in here!

47
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,000
It's 42 degrees!  We're
gonna freeze to death!

48
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,300
Listen, don't panic.

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm sure when you don't come
home, Tom will come looking for you.

50
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,600
No, he won't. He takes
a pain pill at 10:00.

51
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,100
He's probably already
asleep. Jeez.

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,600
How are we gonna make it
through the night in here?

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,800
<i>Yes, in the moment it takes
to bolt a freezer door,

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,900
<i>Ordinary people can
become victims.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,900
That better?

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,200
<i>And a world that seemed so safe...

57
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,900
<i>That helps.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000

<i>"Into The Woods"

63
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,900
<i>At the exact same moment his wife
was being locked in a freezer,

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>Tom scavo was having a nightmare about
monsters trying to destroy his home.

65
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,900
<i>But it wasn't until
he woke up the next morning

66
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,200
<i>that his real nightmare began.

67
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,978
You awake?

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,700
- Did you sleep at all?
- A little.

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,500
Thanks for not letting
me freeze last night.

70
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,400
Are you kidding me? You're
the one that kept me warm.

71
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,100
- You don't have a fever, do you?
- No.

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,900
That's just me.

73
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,900
Tom's always kicking
the covers off the bed.

74
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,200
He calls me his little
blonde furnace.

75
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,700
He's a lucky guy.

76
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,200
Tom! In here!

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,499
- Thank God.
- We were robbed!

78
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,200
- I don't care about that. Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

79
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,100
- Were you hurt?
- No, no, I'm just cold.

80
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
I was so worried about you.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you knew the places
that my mind has been...

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm sorry. I would've called,

83
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,900
But they took our cell phones
before they locked us in there.

84
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,304
"Us"?

85
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,100
I can't believe one
dress could cost so much.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,816
Well, I wanna look fabulous tonight
when Victor's elected mayor.

87
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,522
But isn't it bad luck to buy a dress

88
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,391
for the victory party
before the election?

89
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,900
Vern, focus. It's never bad
luck when I look fabulous.

90
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,700
Oh! Hi. Don't worry.
I'm here now.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,900
Yeah, but your meter just expired.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,927
- Might want to put another quarter in.
- No.

93
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,063
I'm just gonna say bye to my friend,
then I'm gone.

94
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:47,631
You know, this whole
thing is crazy.

95
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,556
I go on one gay cruise and
come home to find

96
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:51,048
you engaged to some rich politician.

97
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:53,100
Vern, I can't wait for you to meet him.

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,600
He's everything I've ever wanted
in a man sensitive and kind...

99
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,195
- and buys you $3,000 dresses.
- Buys me $3,000 dresses.

100
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:03,939
And he's totally fine with you
being a high-maintenance nightmare?

101
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:07,000
That's the best part.
He lets me be me.

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,000
All right, I gotta get going.

103
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,500
See you later.

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
What are you doing?

105
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
I told you I was leaving.
Stop writing!

106
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,100
Yeah, but you weren't leaving.

107
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,700
- You were flapping your gums.
- Oh, give ma break.

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
I was standing right there.
You could've said something.

109
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,700
I told you to put a quarter in...
spoiled bitch.

110
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,500
You can't talk to me like that!

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
$40? You think I'm gonna pay that?

112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,900
No, I'm guessing it'd be the sap
that bought you the $3,000 dress.

113
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Hey, Carlos! Wait. Hi.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,700
Look, there's some crazy rumor
going around that Mike moved.

115
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,000
It's true. He went on a little
trip, and en he's heading back east.

116
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh, my God. What--
where is he now?

117
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay, look, I know that I've
put Mike through the wringer,

118
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,900
but that's why I have to
talk to him to make it right.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,500
- He's not answering his cell phone.
- He turned it off.

120
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,300
- He said he wanted to clear his head.
- Okay, Carlos...

121
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,700
tell me where to find him.

122
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm sorry, Susan. Look, you know
what they say-- Bros before hos.

123
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,400
They... say it. I... don't.

124
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,100
Come on. Just for my peace of
mind,I have to know he's okay.

125
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,900
- I don't know...
- What am I gonna do go hunt him down?!

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,300
I have a daughter.
I have responsibilities.

127
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,700
He hiked to the hot springs at
Pinewood valley state forest.

128
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,700
Okay, Julie, I'm out of here.
Here's 40 bucks on the counter.

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,799
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Yes.

130
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,960
If I don't find Mike before
he's off that mountain,

131
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,031
I may never see him again.

132
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,095
Okay, what you're doing
is nauseatingly romantic,

133
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:52,333
But how do you know he even
wants to see you? I mean,

134
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,848
after the whole "I choose Ian" thing?

135
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,000
That's why I have to go.

136
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,400
I have to make amends and
heal his broken heart.

137
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,800
Oh, well, what if his
devastation has turned to anger,

138
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,900
And he's burning pictures
of you in his campfire?

139
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, what else can I do?

140
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,600
I love him. I have to go.

141
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,100
Then go.

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,300
- Strike three! You're outta there!
- Again? How are you beating me?

143
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,100
You got someone in there greasing
the ball for you? Huh?

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,700
Hey, come on, Travers. You can take
him. Go for the soft underbelly!

145
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,600
Soft?! What are you talking about?

146
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,900
I'm all muscle.
Travers, feel that bicep.

147
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,700
- Mom's is harder.
- Oh, well, thank you,sweetheart.

148
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,100
Fine. I can take a hint.
I need a little exercise.

149
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,900
So how about we go to
the batting cages and hit a few?

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,245
- Cool.
- Wait!

151
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:51,788
We're supposed to go
to the movies.

152
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,400
- How about batting cages on saturday?
- Sounds great.

153
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,800
Yeah, we'll get to find out who
hits the ball harder you or mom.

154
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,499
You are so going down.
Come here.

155
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:06,300
Hey, what the hell is that?

156
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,700
Hello, Edie.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,100
It's your dad.

158
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,170
Kenya was amazing, and being

159
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:28,623
a part of doctors without
borders was so rewarding.

160
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:31,800
But I can't do it again,
not with the time commitment.

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,100
I'm gonna have to wait till
this little guy is in college.

162
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,900
So... when are you
taking Travers home?

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Not till tomorrow.

164
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm, speaking at a conference
in Hilldale this afternoon.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,900
And if you're hungry,
I'm buying you breakfast.

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
- That'd be great.
- All right!

167
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll help you get dressed.

168
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,600
You know, if you wanna
take a couple days and chill,

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,900
Edie and I would be more than
happy to keep looking after Travers.

170
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:08,012
Thanks, but we should probably
get back home.

171
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:09,596
Right.

172
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,600
The thing is...

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,300
we kind of made plans to take him
to the batting cage on saturday.

174
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Oh. Sorry.

175
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,000
Maybe you can take him
the next time he visits.

176
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,500
When do you think that'll be?

177
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,100
I don't know.

178
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll have to check my schedule.

179
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,594
I don't mean to sound pushy.
It's just...

180
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,840
you know, the three of us,we've just
We've been having a lot of fun together.

181
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,134
Well...look at the bright side--

182
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,700
You'll have a lot more
time alone with Edie.

183
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,700
Yeah... that is good.

184
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Here you go, officer.

185
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,100
I cued it up to
the clearest shot of the g.

186
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,300
Thank God you made me spring
for that surveillance camera.

187
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,900
I wanted to spend the
money on a pinball machine.

188
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,500
Son of a bitch.

189
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,200
I think these are the same guys that hit
a couple of diners out on mount vernon.

190
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,800
- You mind if I rewind?
- No.

191
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,300
I wanna see the exact
time they came in.

192
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,900
Overshot it a little.

193
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,500
I was doing receipts,and Rick surprised
me with this great idea for the menu.

194
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,680
- It's called What are they called?
- Orecchiette.

195
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,900
- It means "little--"
- I know what it means.

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,894
And he makes them with
pancetta and garlic

197
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,214
and olive oil. It's really, really good.

198
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,500
It's gonna be our special tonight.

199
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,300
So the door was unlocked?

200
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,100
You need to be more careful.

201
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,400
The two of you are just
asking for trouble.

202
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah, I guess we were.

203
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:13,745
Quiet! Quiet!
They're about to announce!

204
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:16,070
<i>...and the race in valley
ridge is too close to call.

205
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:19,100
<i>However, we're now projecting
a winner in Fairview.

206
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,312
<i>It's Victor Lang by 10%...

207
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,500
Speech! Speech!

208
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Thank you, all. I couldn't
have done it without any of you.

209
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I would especially like to thank
my beautiful fiance Gabrielle.

210
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,800
And I will, as soon as the
feeling returns to my lower back.

211
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,500
Sir, mayor's on the phone.

212
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Sounds like he wants to concede.

213
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,500
- Gabrielle,congratulations.
- Thank you.

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,247
Your husband runs a hell of a campaign.

215
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,227
We're so excited for Victor.

216
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,729
What a day, huh?

217
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,116
It is ending a lot better
than it started.

218
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,523
What happened?

219
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,380
This morning, I got in a fight with
a parking cop over a ticket,

220
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,932
and the guy was a total jerk.

221
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,778
Your days of dealing with
that crap are over.

222
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,253
What do you mean?

223
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,703
Mayor johnson's wife, Sydney.

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,472
She's been collecting parking tickets
like bubble gum cards for years--

225
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,549
Just gives them to her
husband. They disappear.

226
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:24,448
Keep talking.

227
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,440
Honey, you are no longer
one of the little people.

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Forget jury duty, speeding tickets.

229
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,500
You rule this town now.

230
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,500
Well, he conceded. I'm the mayor.

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,800
- You ready to be the mayor's wife?
- Am I ever.

232
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,000
Knock, knock.

233
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,400
Hey. Where's Travers?

234
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,600
His dad's helping him pack.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,700
God, I'm gonna miss
that little guy.

236
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,200
- It's been so much fun.
- Yeah, it was.

237
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,300
You're gonna miss him, too,
aren't you?

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I know what would cheer us up.

239
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,800
A weekend getaway, just the two of us.
How's that sound?

240
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,300
- Actually, I'm busy this weekend.
- Really?

241
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,500
I thought we had plans to go
to the batting cage.

242
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,900
Yeah, but that was gonna take a couple
of hours, and I'm swamped with work.

243
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,500
Since when?

244
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,876
You spent every day hanging out
with me and Travers.

245
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,805
Exactly. I've been putting off my work

246
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:34,713
so I could be there
to help you with him,

247
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:37,131
And now it's time for
me to buckle down.

248
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,600
So... what does that
mean for you and me?

249
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,800
We're still gonna see each other.

250
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,300
I was thinking...

251
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,500
for your birthday,that we could
go to that new oyster bar.

252
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,200
- My birthday is two weeks from now.
- Yeah. It'll be my treat.

253
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,500
Great.

254
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Looking forward to it...

255
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,900
for the next 14 days.

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,200
Hey, don't let Travers leave
without saying good-bye to me.

257
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,400
Oh, wouldn't dream of it.

258
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,100
I know how much he means to you.

259
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,920
Hi there.

260
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,910
Can I get a map to the hot springs?
I'm gonna hike up there.

261
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,150
No problem. You got gear?

262
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,190
- That's not gear.
- Why not?

263
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,940
It's tiny,ma'am.And pink.

264
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,860
Well,it's my daughter's.
The whole junior class has them.

265
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,210
Does the junior class
have compasses, too?

266
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,773
- Trail shoes? Tents?
- Why would I need a tent?

267
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,944
It's a 2 days hike to reach the springs.

268
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:49,486
Two days?

269
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,960
Well, can't I just drive part of
the way and then hike from there?

270
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:58,590
That's not really how nature works,
ma'am. There are trails, not roads.

271
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,757
Well, maybe I am a little unprepared,
but it'll be fine.

272
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,707
I work out. I have quads of steel.

273
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:07,741
I'm sorry.
I just can't let you go up there--

274
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:09,691
Can't? There's no "can't" in love.

275
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:11,059
There's a man on that mountain

276
00:16:11,082 --> 00:16:13,049
that I intend to spend the rest
of my life with,

277
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,279
And nothing is gonna keep me
from him not fate,

278
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,908
not destiny and definitely not you.

279
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,596
To finish my thought, ma'am.
I can't let you go up there alone.

280
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,346
You'll need a guide.

281
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,237
Cool.

282
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,490
- How do I get one of those?
- Toni, I got a hiker for ya!

283
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,970
This is Toni, and those
are quads of steel.

284
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,775
Thanks for suggesting we do this.
I've always wanted to try this place.

285
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:50,028
You've been working
for me for over a month,

286
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,909
and I figured it was time
we got acquainted.

287
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,420
So much I don't know about you.

288
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,565
Well, I'll be happy to fill
in the blanks.

289
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,650
What would you like to know?

290
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,051
Well, for starters.

291
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,425
Are you sleeping with my wife?

292
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,209
What? No,Tom. Of course not.

293
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,926
Okay, so you're just
hoping to sleep with her.

294
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:17,504
Look, if this is about the video,

295
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:19,378
I swear, I was just trying out
a new recipe.

296
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,436
Don't give me the recipe line.
I am not an idiot.

297
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,787
The truth is that Lynette and I

298
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,730
have been going through
sort of a rough patch.

299
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:33,275
Yeah, she told me about that.

300
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,060
And then you came along, and wham,
it's the perfect storm.

301
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,030
You're young, good-Looking, sensitive.

302
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,970
Way more fun than five screaming kids
and a cranky, invalid husband.

303
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,840
Tom, seriously,
nothing has happened.

304
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,420
And nothing is going to,
because you are gonna quit.

305
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:55,421
Quit? No.

306
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,060
No, I'm not gonna do that.

307
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,960
You want me gone, fire me.

308
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:03,792
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

309
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,239
Have Lynette fight for you,

310
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:08,181
while I'm the jealous jerk
who can't trust his wife.

311
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,500
No. You have to quit.

312
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,070
I'm staying as long as
Lynette wants me there.

313
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,880
And make no mistake.
She wants me there.

314
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,598
Oh, buddy.

315
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:28,738
You're not thinking this thing through,

316
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,643
because Lynette will never
leave her family.

317
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,869
So the best and I mean,
the very best that

318
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,708
you can hope for is to catch her
in a weak moment

319
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,480
and leave a wound in her marriage
that will take years to heal, but.

320
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,520
I will heal, because
I will stand by her

321
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,490
and I will le her just as hard as
she hates herself for what she did.

322
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,970
You still feel like sticking around?

323
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,300
Can I get you some more bread?

324
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,380
No,I think I've had
just about enough.

325
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,730
I mean, the doctor said that Mike might
never come out of the coma.

326
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,480
And then when he did,
he didn't even remember me.

327
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,850
Di you need to rest a second?
You sound winded.

328
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,270
No. I'm invigorated.
This fresh mountain air is!

329
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,910
Little help.

330
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,870
So anyway, the whole situation
with Mike it just seemed hopeless

331
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,670
And that's when I decided
to take a chance with Ian.

332
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Ian is the british guy
whose heart you crushed?

333
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,090
What was I supposed to do,
wait forever for Mike?

334
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,260
No, seriously, I was asking.
What would you have done?

335
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:55,867
I would have waited for him.

336
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:59,021
Clearly, you were n paying attention,
because I did go back to

337
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,693
Mike the second he woke up,
and he'd totally forgotten me!

338
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,330
But none of that
matters anymore 'cause.

339
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,941
Bug.

340
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,700
You know,the bugs can't get in
if you keep your mouth shut.

341
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,360
I have someone who wants
to meet you.

342
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,177
A puppy!

343
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,160
You wanna hold him?

344
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,220
He's awesome.
Are you gonna keep him?

345
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,500
No, he's not mine. He's yours.

346
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,180
- No way!
- Well, way!

347
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,430
I just rescued him from the pound.

348
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,100
So. What you gonna call him?

349
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,840
- Fenway. After Fenway park.
- That is so cute!

350
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,350
Everybody back home is
gonna be so jealous.

351
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,110
But, mom. I can't take him home.

352
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,860
Dad's allergic.

353
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,080
That's right. Shoot.

354
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,528
I'm gonna have to take poor little
Fenway back to the pound.

355
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:13,736
No! Why can't I keep him here?

356
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,861
Well, you don't visit here
very often, and

357
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:20,028
I can't take care of a dog
all by myself.

358
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,182
Well, I don't know what else to do.

359
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,969
Why can't I just visit you more?

360
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,074
Hey, that's a thought, and
Carlos would love it, too.

361
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:38,502
Of course, I don't know how your father
would feel about joint custody.

362
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,103
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him I want it.

363
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,652
Really? Well, that would be great.

364
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,380
But you better make sure that he knows
that it was all your idea, okay?

365
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,710
We're about three hours
from the hot springs.

366
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,930
So if we get an early start tomorrow,
we should be there by lunch.

367
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,833
- What are you doing?
- It's a face mask.

368
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,765
It's lavender and honey.
You want some?

369
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,185
Honey, huh?

370
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,785
So you're in the middle of the woods,

371
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:13,536
getting ready to smear
your face with bear food?

372
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,120
Well, I wanted to look nice for Mike.

373
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,670
Lord knows I don't want to hear you
talk about this anymore

374
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,050
But what exactly do you think is
gonna happen with you andhis guy?

375
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,250
Well. I'm going to apologize and

376
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,930
then I'm gonna tell him that
I made a huge mistake--

377
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,210
No. After that.

378
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,020
Say he accepts your apology. You get
back together, and then what happens?

379
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,630
You know, after the novelty wears off?

380
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,220
Well, then.

381
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,730
We'll just be happy.

382
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,170
Okay, I know it's dark,
but I can see you.

383
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,690
Look, after hearing
your whole history with Mike

384
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,030
It doesn't take a genius to figure out
what the problem is.

385
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,350
- What is it?
- You.

386
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,207
You don't want to be happy.
You're a drama junkie.

387
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,033
When there is no drama,
you create it.

388
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,390
You sleep with your ex-husband,
you cheat on a coma victim

389
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:24,463
And now you're hiking up
a mountain after a guy

390
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:27,152
who has no idea you're coming.

391
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,200
Who knows? Maybe this guy
will take you back.

392
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,620
But once the dust settles,
you'll kick up some more

393
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,460
Because you don't know how
to just. Be happy.

394
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,600
You don't even know me.
How dare you talk to me like that?

395
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,590
So dramatic.

396
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm gonna turn in now.

397
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,720
All right,sunshine,
let's get moving.

398
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,191
- What are you looking at?
- My city.

399
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,566
It's like I'm seeing
it for the first time.

400
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:39,273
Everything looks different now
that I'm first lady of Fairview.

401
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:42,940
Oh, my God. You did not just call
yourself "first lady of Fairview".

402
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,800
Well. Who do we have here?

403
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,890
Wouldn't you just love to rub
his nose in your newfound power?

404
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,440
Vern, you're just awful.

405
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,970
And as it happens, so am I.

406
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,820
Gaby, come on, I was just joking.

407
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,540
Hey, lady. It's a hydrant.
You can't park there.

408
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,910
Really? 'Cause I just did.

409
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,890
Oh,you again! Gaby.

410
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,890
Just stand back and
enjoy the carnage.

411
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,490
Thank you. Now what you're
about to see may astound you.

412
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,850
You know, I could give you
another ticket for littering.

413
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,010
You could try, but
you might not want to.

414
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,020
See,I'm engaged to Victor Lang.
Ring a bell?

415
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:41,280
- The mayor? Your new boss?
- I don't follow politics.

416
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,320
Let me know when the carnage begins
so I can shield my eyes.

417
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,480
Listen, buddy, you're not getting it.
You answer to me now.

418
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,240
- I could have you fired.
- You can't do nothing.

419
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,830
I can do whatever I want!

420
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,670
In fact, my first official act of
business as mayoress of Fairview...

421
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,580
is to declare today
"free parking day"!

422
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,650
Hey, knock that off. Hey!

423
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,030
- Free parking!
- Give me that!

424
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,000
- No! - Give me that!

425
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,600
You're hurting me!

426
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,887
You know what that sound is, fat boy?

427
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,259
The sound of your career
circling the bowl.

428
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,636
You're gonna find out what happens

429
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,408
when you screw with
the first lady of Fairview!

430
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,190
Okay, north. I need north.

431
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,640
Moss grows on the north side of trees.

432
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,152
What?

433
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,770
Damn it! Stupid mossy trees!

434
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,780
- Dad!
- Hey, buddy!

435
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,650
- How you doing?
- Good.

436
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,450
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure. You can ask me anything.

437
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,740
How would you feel
about joint custody?

438
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,080
- You bought him a puppy?
- No, I bought myself a puppy.

439
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,840
How was I supposed to know
that he'd get so attached?

440
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,690
Don't lie to me, Edie.
You were trying to manipulate him.

441
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,330
What? Would it be so terrible
to have joint custody?

442
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,090
In case you forgot,
I am his mother.

443
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,110
Two weeks out of the year,
and that's the way you wanted it.

444
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,880
- Well, I changed my mind.
- Damn it, Edie.

445
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,550
- We had an agreement!
- It wasn't official!

446
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,460
And there isn't a judge in this world
that would keep a mother from her ???.

447
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,930
- Hey, Travers. What's going on?
- Mom and dad are fighting.

448
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,640
- You wanna go watch tv at my house?
- Okay.

449
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,850
I'll see you there in a sec, buddy.

450
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,190
You haul me into court, and so help me,
I will destroy you!

451
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,500
You threaten me again, and I will go
for full custody, you son of a bitch.

452
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,240
- Hi.
- Hey.

453
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,020
So. What is going on?

454
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,050
Edie has lost her mind.

455
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,840
For eight years, she's been happy
to see him two weeks a year.

456
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,250
Now out of the blue,
she's gotta have joint custody.

457
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,390
- Really?
- Yeah. And how's that supposed to work?

458
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,750
We live four hours away.

459
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,510
What's he gonna do,
go to two different schools?

460
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,960
I don't know what to tell you, man.
I'm sorry.

461
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,120
Yeah, thanks.

462
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,050
You know, I just don't get it.

463
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,180
Edie's been perfectly
happy with our arrangement.

464
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,700
What the hell's gotten into her?

465
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,190
- Well, thanks.
- Good night.

466
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,910
Come again.

467
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,550
There. Hey...

468
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,640
I made you an espresso.

469
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,686
Great.

470
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,760
You okay?

471
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,170
You've been so quiet all night.

472
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,510
I had lunch with Tom today.

473
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,390
That's funny.

474
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,480
He didn't mention it.

475
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,680
He asked me if
I was sleeping with you.

476
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:45,682
What?

477
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,890
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God.

478
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,100
I'm so sorry.

479
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,290
That paranoid idiot.
You know, I knew it.

480
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,850
I knew when we were watching
the surveillance tapes that

481
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,960
he would completely
misinterpret it.

482
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,430
- Oh, did he?
- Did he what?

483
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,920
Did he misinterpret it?

484
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,780
Or did he just see what is obvious
that you and I can't admit?

485
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,670
I fon't know what you're talking about.
There's nothing to admit.

486
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,550
Lynette, how long are
we gonna kid ourselves?

487
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,260
I have feelings for you.

488
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,860
I know you feel
something for me.

489
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,780
Stop! Don't say it!

490
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,347
You cannot say these things.

491
00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:22,767
Come on. We both know it's true.

492
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,186
We've been flirting since we met.

493
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,660
Yes, flirting! That's it!

494
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:29,114
It's what married people do, because
we know there is a line you don't cross.

495
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,326
And maybe I've gotten
close to that line,

496
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:33,429
And maybe I've enjoyed
getting close to that line,

497
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,746
But I have never once crossed it.

498
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,074
Look, I know I don't
have much to offer--

499
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,478
And I have nothing to offer!
I am taken!

500
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,077
God!

501
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,617
Great, great.
Now what, you're mad at me?

502
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,477
Yeah, I'm mad! I am mad because
I loved our nights together.

503
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,659
It made me feel sexy and happy,
and, God, how I needed that.

504
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:57,293
And now it's over. You ruined it.

505
00:30:58,337 --> 00:31:00,508
You can't work here anymore.

506
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,039
Wait... you're gonna fire me?

507
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:09,571
Oh, jeez. What choice do I have?

508
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,809
- Lynette, please--
- Don't touch me!

509
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,293
You have to go now.
Please, go.

510
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,805
You have to go now.

511
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,970
Go on. Go.

512
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,447
Her name is Susan Mayer,
and she's never hiked before.

513
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,308
Now this is the last place I saw her,
but honestly,

514
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,473
she could be anywhere.

515
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,487
Just checking back in.
The name's Delfino.

516
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,699
Delfino. Great.You're all set.

517
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,324
- Are you sure she's lost?
- Of course I'm sure.

518
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,482
She's a dippy brunette
from the suburbs.

519
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,337
She didn't bring a compass.
She brought makeup.

520
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,941
Wait, is she the one looking for
the guy at the hot springs?

521
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Yep, that's her.

522
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,470
Now let's go find her before
she falls off a cliff.

523
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,341
- The woman is a total klutz.
- Yeah, I hear you.

524
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:00,530
All right, we'll split up.

525
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:03,752
I'll take north of the river here,
and you look down in here.

526
00:32:05,677 --> 00:32:06,742
Excuse me.

527
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,565
This klutz...

528
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,195
could you tell me her name?

529
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:39,614
Listen, I know your cell phone's off,
but I...

530
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,413
I wanted you to know that I followed
you up to the hot springs, and...

531
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,767
now I'm lost.

532
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,870
You know, in the off chance that I get
devoured by a mountain lion, I-

533
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,700
I just wanted you
to know that...

534
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,071
I love you.

535
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,600
I've always loved you.

536
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,230
And I don't want any more drama.

537
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,270
And if you take me back,
I promise there won't be.

538
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,860
Unless I get eaten by a mountain lion,
and, you know,

539
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,650
That'll be dramatic,
but it won't be my fault.

540
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,037
Anyway...

541
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,890
I hope it's not too late,
but if it is, I just...

542
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,280
I just want you to know
that I am so, so...

543
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,812
sorry.

544
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,690
Here she is, sir.

545
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,950
No charges, no press.

546
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,100
Never happened.

547
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,380
Hi, honey.

548
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,630
You look handsome in a tux.

549
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,500
Jerome, give us the room, please.

550
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,590
All right, look,
I know you're mad, but

551
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,610
Wait till you hear what
that jerk did to me--

552
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,070
Gaby, shut up.

553
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,200
Are you familiar with the quote,

554
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,348
"<i>From the one to whom much has been
entrusted, even more will be demanded</i>"?

555
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,910
Doesn't ring a bell.

556
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,882
From the bible.

557
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,525
- That explains it.
- This is not a joke!

558
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,621
I have been elected mayor.
Certain things are expected of me.

559
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,901
One in particular is that my future wife
not assault city employees.

560
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,199
- He was mean. He deserved it.
- I don't care!

561
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,984
Your behavior reflects on me,
and I can't do my job

562
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,986
if you're constantly humiliating me.

563
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,181
Constantly? A side from today,
give me one example.

564
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:00,879
Okay, how about jumping into my arms

565
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,295
when you screw with
the first lady of Fairview!

566
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,619
I was just joking around, being me.
I thought you liked that.

567
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,989
I do, in private.

568
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,618
In public, you have
to act like a grown-up.

569
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,863
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

570
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,063
It won't happen again.

571
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,753
I better get dressed.

572
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:30,320
I don't want to be late
to the victory party.

573
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,391
What happened to your wrist?

574
00:35:34,728 --> 00:35:36,462
That's what I was trying to tell you.

575
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,720
The meter man--
He grabbed my arm and twisted it.

576
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,057
What?

577
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,291
My God, he left a bruise.

578
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,512
It's not as bad as it looks.

579
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,125
Still, he shouldn't have done that.

580
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,200
You're home early.

581
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,940
It was kind of dead tonight.

582
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,520
Hi.

583
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,614
Sorry.

584
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,670
By the way, we are gonna need
to find a new chef.

585
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,800
Rick gave notice.

586
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:25,351
He quit?

587
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,500
Well, he got a better offer
from some place across town.

588
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,340
That's too bad.

589
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,427
Well...

590
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,670
Whatcha gonna do?

591
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,050
Well... we don't have
to hire someone.

592
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,440
I am coming back.

593
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,980
- You sure you're ready?
- Yeah.

594
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,340
Doctor said I can lose
the back brace next week,

595
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,350
And I promise I'll take it easy.

596
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,680
No lifting-- just cooking.

597
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,120
Well, okay, then.

598
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,720
I feel really good
about this, hon.

599
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,070
I have been going nuts
just lying around.

600
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,300
This is gonna be so great!
We're a team again.

601
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,820
Besides...

602
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,540
I missed you.

603
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,610
I missed you, too.

604
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,630
Well, hello, stranger.

605
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,710
Come on in.

606
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,080
- So what's up?
- Nothing much.

607
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,540
I hear you're going for
joint custody of Travers.

608
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:09,340
I hired a lawyer,
and he is a real shark.

609
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,890
You're not messing around, huh?

610
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,050
I think it's important that Travers
has his mother in his life.

611
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:23,210
Of course, he'll probably want to spend
more time with his video game buddy.

612
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,359
You know, but I just keep thinking...

613
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:32,658
what's all this gonna be like for him--

614
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,536
You know, all the traveling
back and forth?

615
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,530
He's a kid.

616
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,520
He'll adjust.

617
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,630
Yeah, plus two schools, two sets of
friends. I mean, it's not gonna be easy.

618
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,600
Why are you being so negative?

619
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,820
I thought you'd be excited about this.

620
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,180
I know you did...

621
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,659
I just want you to ask yourself,

622
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,909
is this all really in
the best interest of Travers?

623
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,520
You know, kids need stability.

624
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,370
What about what I need?

625
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,050
I know that you miss him...

626
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,070
and I know you're worried
about being lonely,

627
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,360
But I am going to be here for you.

628
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,840
Yeah, once every two weeks.

629
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,110
I'm really going to be here for you.

630
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,450
And I'm gonna make you happy.

631
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,840
Don't say that if
you don't mean it, Carlos.

632
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,904
I do.

633
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,090
All right, I'll...

634
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,573
I'll call off the lawyer.

635
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,770
No, I really ??? miss him.

636
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,894
Yeah, me, too.

637
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:25,150
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in
welcoming the next mayor of Fairview.

638
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,360
Your name Jeff Scott?

639
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,610
- Yeah.
- You read meters for a living?

640
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,660
Do you know how much I love you?

641
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:07,791
I think so.

642
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,874
<i>Anyone can end up a victim...

643
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,206
<i>injured by the actions of others.

644
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:22,889
<i>But whether the damage is inflicted
by a cunning ex-wife...

645
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:28,396
<i>or a blow delivered by
the object of our affection...

646
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,278
<i>the time comes when we must pick
ourselves up and continuen our journey.

647
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:41,722
<i>And if we can't,
then all we can pray for...

648
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,079
<i>is rescue.

649
00:41:49,286 --> 00:41:51,034
I twisted my ankle.

650
00:41:52,085 --> 00:41:53,109
Good.

651
00:41:57,285 --> 00:41:59,470
'Cause now I get to do this.
