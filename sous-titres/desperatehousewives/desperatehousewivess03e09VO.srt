OH,
IT'S ALSO A DISASTER AREA.

15
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:40,235

81

HE'S A SINGLE MAN
WITH A BASEMENT FULL OF TOYS!
I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN,

BUT WE CAN'T BOOK A GUY

84
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:26,931
YOU DON'T GET IT.

85
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,987
<i>HIS HOUSE
HAD THIS CREEPY VIBE.</i>

86
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,539

I NEVER WENT DOWN
TO THE ACTUAL ROOM--

87
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:33,639
OKAY, HE WASN'T THERE.
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

88
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,282
LOOK, HE HAD A WALL
FULL OF PICTURES

89
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:39,143
OF HALF-NAKED BOYS
IN SWIMSUITS.

90
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,383
DIDN'T YOU SAY
HE WAS A SWIM COACH?

91
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:44,840
WHAT ARE YOU, HIS LAWYER?
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, IT'S ODD.

92
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:45,918
HERE'S WHAT'S ODD--

93
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,899
IF YOUR NEIGHBOR
HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE,

94
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:50,372

00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,081

99
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:07,409
I WAS

100
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,280
A CAKE?

101
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:14,587
IT WAS A "THANK YOU" CAKE.
HE SORT OF SAVED MY LIFE.

102
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,495
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THATE WAS
A PEDOPHILE WHEN SHE BAKED

103
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,846
THE ACTUAL CAKE--
HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE CAKE, TOM.

00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:23,149
WELL, WHY ARE YOU SNAPPING
AT ME? YOU'RE TOTALLY SNAPPING.

109
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:38,957

114
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:56,195
YOU'RE GONNA

115
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:57,258
ANOTHER PERSONAL SHOPPER.

116
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,650
WHAT, I SLAM ONE DRESS,
AND YOU QUIT ON ME?

117
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:02,018
NO, THAT'S MY NEWS.

118
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,057
I'M LEAVING THE STORE
AND STARTING MY OWN BUSINESS.

119
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:07,881

120
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:11,369
YOU'RE OPENING UP A SALON?
GOD, COULD YOU GET ANY GAYER?

121
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:14,055
IT'S A CONSULTING FIRM

122
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:16,368
<i>AND THE ANSWER'S "YES."</i>

123

125
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:23,308

HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE FUN?

126
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:24,942
IF YOU COME DOWN
AND GIVE A TALK.

127
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,485
YOU KNOW, GIVE THE KIDS
SOME POINTERS.

128
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,003
VERN, I WORKED THE CATWALKS
IN MILAN AND PARIS.

129
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:32,060
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE MAKEUP TIPS
TO LITTLE MISS TRAINING BRA.

130
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:34,100
YOU HAVE BEEN
IN RARE BITCH FORM.

131
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,604
IT'S BEEN MONTHS NOW,
SO DON'T BLAME IT ON YOUR CYCLE.

132
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,788
DON'T CALL ME A BITCH,
AND STOP TRACKING MY CYCLE.

133
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:44,579
I TOLD YOU
THAT FREAKS ME OUT.
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU'VE BEEN VERY CRANKY TODAY.

134
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,643
WHAT'S GOING ON?

135
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:51,233
THE DIVORCE DECREE
CAME THROUGH TODAY.

136
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:54,018
CARLOS IS OFFICIALLY
OUT OF MY LIFE.

137
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,697
OH, HONEY.

138
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:58,872
THE GIRLS' AGES RANGE
8 TO 12.

139
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:01,064
WE MEET EVERY THURSDAY IN
THE REC ROOM OF THE ELKS LODGE.

140
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,472
I'M NOT DOING IT.

141
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,254
YOU NEED A PROJECT.

142
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:06,727
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM--
YOU'RE BORED.

143
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,470
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THE CURE FOR THAT IS--

144
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,414
HELPING OTHERS.

145
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,740
FINE. I'LL DO IT,

146
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:15,923
BUT I WANT
THIS DRESS FOR FREE.

147
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,539
EVIL!
YOU SAID YOU HATED IT.

148
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,227
AND I HATE HELPING OTHERS,
TOO,

149
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,723
BUT I'M DOING THAT,
AREN'T I?

150
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,416
IS THE COAST CLEAR?

151
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,018
I DON'T WANNA
FLASH THE HELP AGAIN.

152
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,880
RELAX.
HE'S MAKING BREAKFAST,

153
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,985
BUT YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO FLASH ME.

154
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:34,833
(both chuckle)

155
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:38,863
HOW LONG
HAS RUPERT WORKED FOR YOU?

156
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,768
OH, FOR YEARS.
HE'S PRACTICALLY FAMILY.

157
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,590
SO YOU'RE THAT CLOSE,
AND YOU NEVER TOLD HIM ABOUT ME?

158
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,694
YES, ABOUT THAT...

159
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,861
RUPERT WAS
INCREDIBLY DEVOTED TO JANE.

160
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,485
HE'S, UH, NEVER SEEN ME
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,

161
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,161
LET ALONE
A FRISKY, NAKED ONE.

162
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,424
(laughs)
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS

163
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:59,133
WHY HE WAS A LITTLE COLD
TO ME THIS MORNING.

164
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,669
WAS HE?
I'LL HAVE A TALK WITH HIM.

165
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:03,926
OH, NO, DON'T DO THAT.
THAT'LL JUST MAKE IT WOR.

166
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:07,205
I GET IT. HE LOVED JANE.
HE DOESN'T KNOW ME.

167
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:09,548
YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST
HAVE TO CHARM HIM,

168
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,148
WARM HIM UP A LITTLE.
(chuckles)

169
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,852
WELL, I'M, UH,
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A WAY.

170
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:21,482
GREAT.
9:00 IN THE MORNING,

171
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:23,834
AND I HAVE TO PUT ON
A SLINKY, BLACK COCKTAIL DRESS.
(chuckles)

172
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:27,842
(Susan)
HEY, HERE'S AN IDEA.

173
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,688
YOU KEEP SOME THINGS
IN A DRAWER AT MY HOUSE.

174
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:32,536
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I HAD ONE HERE?

175
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,081
A DRAWER? DO YOU THINK
WE'LL BE HERE THAT OFTEN?

176
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,917
YOUR SHOWER
S SIX POWER NOZZLES.

177
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:41,151
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU,
I'LL BE BACK.

178
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,935
WELL, THEN BY ALL MEANS,
LET'S GET YOU A DRAWER.

179
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,296
(laughs) I DON'T NEED MUCH.
ONE OF THOSE WILL DO.

180
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,703
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

181
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:52,110
RUPERT ARRANGES THINGS
METICULOUSLY.

182
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,733
YOU'LL NEVER WIN HIM OVER IF YOU
MESS WITH HIS SYSTEM. RUPERT?

183
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:58,823
WOW! YOUR TIMING'S PERFECT.

184
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,060
NOT ALWAYS.

185
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,260
SUSAN WILL BE NEEDING
A DRAWER.

186
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:05,267
A DRAWER, SIR?

187
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,076
YES, FOR HER THINGS.

188
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,955
SHE'S GONNA BE SPENDING
MORE TIME HERE.

189
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:11,667
YEAH, RUPE, I HOPE
WE CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS,

190
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:13,689
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
BE SEEING LOTS MORE OF ME.

191
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,785
OH, MADAM,
THAT HARDLY SEEMS POSSIBLE.

192
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:22,520
MOTHER HODGE,
YOUR FOOD WILL GET COLD!

193
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,696
WHY, PLEASE, IS THERE A LOCK
ON THE LIQUOR CABINET?

194
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,344
BECAUSE YOUR DOCTOR SAYS

195
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,279
PEOPLE TAKING YOUR MEDICATION
SHOULDN'T DRINK,

196
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,938
A WARNING YOU'VE CHOSEN
TO IGNORE IF THE LIPSTICK

197
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,222
ON THE VODKA BOTTLE
IS ANY INDICATION.

198
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:42,523
<i>POACHED FISH AGAIN?
I DON'T WANT THIS.</i>

199
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:45,059
I WANT
WHAT YOU'RE ALL HAVING.

200
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:47,714
WELL, YOUR DOCTOR HAS YOU
ON A LOW FAT, LOW SODIUM DIET.

201
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,019
EIGHT MEALS THIS WEEK,

202
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,339
EIGHT TIMES I'VE TOLD YOU
THE SAME THING.

203
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,290
SO... WHO WOULD LIKE
TO SAY GRACE?
ALLOW ME.

204
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,288
DEAR LORD,

205
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,977
I THANK YOU FOR THIS BLAND,
INDIFFERENTLY PREPARED MEAL

206
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,441
AND BESEECH YOU TO IGNITE
SOME SPARK OF COMPASSION

207
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,447
IN MY COLDHEARTED
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW,

208
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,743
THAT SHE MIGHT SHOW
SOME SHRED OF MERCY TO ME,

209
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:10,999
HER WRETCHED CAPTIVE.

210
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,407
AMEN.

211
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:21,093
MOTHER, MAY I REMIND YOU,
YOU ASKED TO COME HERE?

212
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,765
I DIDN'T KNOW I'D BE TRADING
ONE JAIL FOR ANOTHER.

213
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:25,452
AT LEAST AT THE HOME

214
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:28,148
YOU COULD BRIBE THE ORDERLIES
TO SMUGGLE THINGS IN,

215
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,139
BUT HERE, NOTHING GETS PAST
THE COMMANDANT.

216
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,315
I HAVE DONE
EVERYTHING I CAN

217
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:36,547
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
AND COMFORTABLE.

218
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:38,512
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?

219
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,865
I WANT MY FREEDOM.

220
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:42,530
I WANT OUT
OF THIS PERKY LITTLE GULAG

221
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:45,729
AND INTO A HOUSE
I CAN CALL MY OWN,

222
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,161
AND YOU'RE
GOING TO BUY IT FOR ME.

223
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:50,976
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO BUY YOU A HOUSE.

224
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,369
YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO.

225
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:00,495
I KNOW A HOUSE
WON'T BE EASY TO SWING,

226
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,386
BUT HOW MANY MORE
OF THESE EDWARD ALBEE DINNERS

227
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:06,319
DO YOU WANT TO SIT THROUGH?
AT DID SHE MEAN BY,
"YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO"?

228
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:07,936
WAS SHE THREATENING YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

229
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:11,039
YES, SHE'S THREATENING TO
MAKE US MISERABLE TILL WE CAVE.

230
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:14,437
LOOK, AT LEAST SEE
IF EDIE HAS ANY CHEAP LISTINGS.

231
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,454
WE'LL BE HAPPIER,
MY MOTHER WILL BE HAPPIER--

232
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,966
YEAH, AND SHE'LL TAKE
TERRIBLE CARE OF HERSELF

233
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:21,958
AND BE DEAD IN A YEAR.
YOU JUST STOLE
MY NEXT ARGUMENT.

234
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:28,973
(Edie) OKAY, YOU'VE GOT
ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY EITHER

235
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,556
THE PHONE OR THE CABLE BILL,
BUT NOT BOTH.

236
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:36,419
HELLO? MIKE.

237
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:39,114
I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU HERE.

238
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:43,506
OH, I'M SORRY.
JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

239
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:47,505
FINE. CABLE IT IS.

240
00:11:48,138 --> 00:11:49,505
NOBODY CALLS YOU ANYWAY.

241
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:50,097
(front door opens, slams)

242
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:01,128
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

243
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:02,687
MY TOILET'S CLOGGED.

244
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,478
I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU COULD FIX IT.

245
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,830
OH, WAIT, YOU CAN'T,
CAN YOU?

246
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:08,438
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY TOOLS.

247
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,100
MUST BE TOUGH
BEING A PLUMBER WITHOUT TOOLS.

248
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,213
WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE
LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE?

249
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,404
JEEZ,
YOU SURE ARE HOSTILE

250
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:19,205
FOR A GUY WHO MAKES HIS LIVING
IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY.

251
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:20,397
(engine starts)

252
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:35,499
YOU KNOW,
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME,

253
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:36,979
THERE'S NO POINT
IN PAYING THE CABLE BILL

254
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,928
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE ELECTRICITY,

255
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:44,412
SO I'M THINKING PAY
THE ELECTRICITY UPFRONT AND...

256
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,368
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
THEY'RE ALL WAITING FOR YOU.

257
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:04,009
I'M HERE TO TEACH FASHION,
SO I'M FASHIONABLY LATE.
CUTE.

258
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,433
NOW REMEMBER, THESE MOTHERS
HAVE REFINANCED THEIR TRAILERS

259
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:07,441
IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THIS,

260
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,593
SO WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR ENTRANCE,
FOR GOD SAKES, SPARKLE.
(scoffs)

261
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,199
(Vern) NOW IN ADDITION
TO HER THREE "VOGUE" COVERS,

262
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:16,607
YOU MAY REMEMBER HER

263
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,302
AS THE FACE
OF LA ROQUE COSMETICS.

264
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:20,852
PLEASE WELCOME
MISS GABRIELLE MARQUEZ!

265
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:22,045
<i>(dance music playing)</i>

266
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:23,116
(applause)

267
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:24,076
<i>(music slows, warps)</i>

268
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,715
VERN? A MOMENT.

269
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:37,078
(mouths words)

270
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:41,892
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

271
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,651
YES! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THAT PETTING ZOO OUT THERE?

272
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:47,408
NOT EVERYONE WINS THE GENETIC
LOTTERY LIKE YOU DID.

273
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:48,608
THESE GIRLS NEED HELP

274
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:51,064
FINDING THE PROMISED LAND
OF BEAUTY AND STYLE.

275
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,465
PLEASE, GABRIELLE,
BE THEIR MOSES.

276
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,016
(sighs) GOOD COMPARISON,

277
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,566
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE
A MIRACLE

278
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:00,174
TO TURN THESE MUTTS
INTO SHOW DOGS.

279
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:05,741
HEY, GIRLS,
LET'S TALK BEAUTY.

280
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:06,478
(knock on door)

281
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:14,356
WHAT'S UP, BROTHER?

282
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,700
I'M SORRY. YOU ARE...

283
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,131
CARLOS
FROM DOWN THE STREET.

284
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,562
WE WERE
ONLY BEST FRIENDS, DUDE.

285
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:28,705
OH, UM, WELL,

286
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:32,049
THINGS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE FUZZY
SINCE THE ACCIDENT.

287
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,785
I'M SORRY THAT I, UH,
I HADN'T COME BY SOONER,

288
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,057
BUT MY DIVORCE HAS BEEN
KICKING MY ASS. (chuckles)

289
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,152
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

290
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:42,472
ANYWAY, I GOT A NEW CONDO,
BUT IT'S GETTING RENOVATED,

291
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,934
SO I WAS THINKING
MAYBE I COULD CRASH HERE.

292
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:47,685
HERE?

293
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:50,375
YEAH, I COULD HELP YOU OUT
AROUND THE HOUSE

294
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:54,263
AND FREE YOU UP TO FOCUS
ON JOB ONE--GETTING BETTER.

295
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,405
'CAUSE YOU'RE TOSSING IT
TO EDIE NOW, RIGHT?

296
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,309
THAT'S
A REAL RELATIONSHIP KILLER,

297
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,814
NEEDING YOUR LADY
TO HOIST YOU OFF THE CAN.

298
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:06,212
WELL,
HOW LONG ARE WE TALKING?

299
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:08,812
COUPLE MONTHS.
THREE AT THE MOST.

300
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:12,315
AND, OF COURSE, I CAN KICK IN
FOR HALF THE UTILITIES AND RENT.

301
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:19,033
WELL, HOW CAN I SAY NO
TO MY BEST FRIEND?

302
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:19,852
(chuckles)

303
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:27,440
(boy) CAN YOU DO A KICKFLIP?

304
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,663
WHAT ARE THE BLAKE KIDS DOING
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE?

305
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:33,083
PAM NEEDS TO KEEP
A CLOSER EYE ON THEM.

306
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:35,043
WILL YOU PLEASE
COME AWAY FROM THAT WINDOW?

307
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:37,839
YOU BARELY SLEPT LAST NIGHT.
COME ON. TAKE A NAP.

308
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:40,083
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

309
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:42,626
WHOA.

310
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,793
HOLD ON.

311
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:44,600
(door slams)

312
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:52,831
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

313
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,119
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO GET THIS BACK TO YOU

314
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:56,511
<i>AND TO THANK YOU.</i>

315
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:59,926
REBECCA AND I
REALLY ENJOYED THE CAKE.
HI!

316
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,285
OH! GOOD.

317
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:03,693
SO...

318
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:06,492
BYE.

319
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,492
SO WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF OUR PLACE?

320
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:11,116
SORRY?

321
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:13,380
IT MUST HAVE BEEN WEIRD

322
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:16,787
BEING IN THERE
WITH ALL THE NEW FURNITURE.

323
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:19,313
I-I DIDN'T NOTICE.

324
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,946
WELL,
HOW ABOUT THE KITCHEN?

325
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,531
REBECCA LIKES THE COLOR,
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE.

326
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:26,410
OH, SORRY. NEVER MADE IT
PAST THE LIVING ROOM.

327
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,593
WHAT?! COME ON!
YOU'RE IN AN EMPTY HOUSE,

328
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,577
CURIOUS ABOUT
YOUR NEW NEIGHBORS...

329
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,984
YOU LOOK AROUND.
WE ALL DO IT.

330
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:35,672
WELL, I DON'T.

331
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,383
WELL, NEXT TIME YOU'RE OVER,
I'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE TOUR.

332
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:44,839
GREAT, GREAT.
MR. PROTECTOR MAN!

333
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,415
HEY, HEY,
NOT NOW, PARKER.

334
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:49,654
I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF I CAN
PLAY HIS PINBALL MACHINE AGAIN.

335
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,125
I GUESS THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT TOUR.

336
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,081
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
FIRST THINGS FIRST--

337
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:13,667
<i>IF YOU CAN'T WALK,
YOU CAN'T WIN. HIT IT, VERN!
(dance music playing)</i>

338
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:18,494
REMEMBER, EYES FORWARD,
SHOULDERS BACK, HIPS SQUARE.

339
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,815
LOOK LEFT, LOOK RIGHT,
WHIP AND WALK.

340
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,484
YES, I'M UNBELIEVABLE.
CLOSE YOUR MOUTHS.

341
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:28,451
**

342
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:28,954
(thud)

343
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:46,906
UH, OKAY, STOP, STOP.
(music stops)

344
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:50,833
WHAT? MY EYES WERE FORWARD,
MY HIPS WERE SQUARE.

345
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,055
BUT WHERE'S YOUR CONFIDENCE?
WHERE'S YOUR PRIDE?

346
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,239
COME ON. WHAT DO I HAVE
TO BE PROUD OF?

347
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,479
(scoffs)

348
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:09,565
HAVE YOU GUYS EVER SEEN

349
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:12,660
A RUNWAY MODEL WITHOUT
THE HOT CLOTHES AND MAKEUP?

350
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:16,572
WELL, TRUST ME,
THEY'RE NOT THAT SPECIAL,

351
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,514
BUT THE ONE THING
THAT THEY DO HAVE IS ATTITUDE.

352
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,555
YOU HAVE
TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,

353
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:25,938
<i>AND IF NOT, PRETEND TO BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, OKAY?</i>

354
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:28,403
ALL RIGHT.

355
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:31,942
NOW I WANT YOU TO PRETEND
YOU'RE ON THE RUNWAY...

356
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,920
FLASHBULBS ARE POPPING,

357
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,199
EVERYONE'S LOOKING AT YOU,
ENVYING YOU,

358
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:40,270
AND THEY'RE ALL THINKING
THE SAME THING--

359
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:44,662
ISABEL HOROWITZ
IS SMOKING HOT!

360
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:45,661
**

361
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:48,614
GO, ISABEL! GO!

362
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:55,730
(Gabrielle) YOU'RE DOING IT!
ISABEL, YOU'RE DOING IT!

363
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:57,115
THAT'S IT! KEEP GOING!

364
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,146
I WAS WALKING!

365
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,409
OH! YOU--YOU WERE
TOTALLY WALKING!

366
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,597
GOOD JOB!
ALL RIGHT, DONNA, YOU'RE NEXT.

367
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,906
GET UP THERE AND MAKE ME
HATE YOUR BEAUTY.

368
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:12,985
(car alarm sounding
in distance)

369
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:18,089
NOW THIS PLACE IS
A REAL DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.

370
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,804
COZY LITTLE
2-BEDROOM PLUS DEN,

371
00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:23,125
WITH
A HIGHLY MOTIVATED SELLER.

372
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:25,557
OH, LOOK,
A HIGHLY MOTIVATED COCKROACH.

373
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:27,603
OH!
(stomps foot)

374
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:30,153
(chuckles) LET'S TRY
TO BE POSITIVE, PEOPLE.

375
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:31,578
IT'S A FABULOUS LOCATION.

376
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:35,313
JUST WALKING DISTANCE
TO ALL SORTS OF FUN SHOPS.

377
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:37,193
RIGHT! FROM HERE I CAN SEE

378
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:39,641
A BAIL BONDSMAN
AND AN ADULT BOOKSHOP.

379
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,994
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
IN YOUR PRICE RANGE, "TARA"?

380
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:48,167
LET'S GO. THANK YOU.

381
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,511
WAIT.

382
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,006
I'M NOT
AN IMPRACTICAL WOMAN.

383
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,558
I KNOW THAT
MY SON'S RESOURCES ARE--

384
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:57,470
LIKE HIS ACHIEVEMENTS--
RATHER LIMITED.

385
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,469
I WANT TO SEE
THE REST OF IT.

386
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:05,381
OKAY. NOW THE LIGHTING
IN THE KITCHEN IS A BIT HARSH.

387
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:07,518
THE PREVIOUS OWNER--
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY

388
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:10,619
HE RAN SOME SORT
OF HOME-BASED MEDICAL BUSINESS.

389
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,549
YOU CANNOT LET YOUR MOTHER
MOVE INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

390
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,899
IT'S FILLED WITH
JUNKIES AND WHORES.

391
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,205
YEAH, AND WE'LL
OWE THEM ALL AN APOLOGY,

392
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:20,589
BUT WHO CARES?
SHE LIKES IT.
OF COURSE SHE LIKES IT.

393
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:24,242
THERE'S A 24-HOUR LIQUOR STORE
ACROSS THE STREET.
LOOK, SHE WANTS A HOUSE.

394
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:26,978
THIS ITHE BEST WE CAN AFFORD
WITHOUT BANKRUPTING OURSELVES.

395
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,122
ORSON, WHAT IF SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN TO HER?

396
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:32,042
STOP WORRYING ABOUT HER.
WORRY ABOUT US.

397
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,714
DO YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH WE'VE
BEEN FIGHTING SINCE SHE CAME?

398
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,832
THE WOMAN'S RUINED
EVERY RELATIONSHIP

399
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:38,712
THAT'S MATTERED TO ME,
AND SHE'S DOING IT AGAIN.

400
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:39,463
(Gloria) OHH!
(crash)

401
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:40,695
(Edie) OH, MY GOD!

402
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:43,983
OH!

403
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,105
OH! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH! MOTHER?

404
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:48,407
MOTHER?
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SPILL.
HER CANE HIT A LOOSE TILE.

405
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:49,540
IS ANYTHING BROKEN?

406
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:53,636
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
THE MN FLOOR.
WE'LL NEED THAT FIXED
BEFORE SHE MOVES IN.

407
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,218
ARE YOU INSANE?! SHE OBVIOUSLY
CAN'T BE ON HER OWN.
WHY, IT'S A LOOSE TILE.

408
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:01,923
I'M PERFECTLY FINE.
AND WHAT IF YOU WEREN'T?
WHAT IF SHE HAD BROKEN SOMETHING

409
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:03,834
AND SHE WAS
LYING HERE FOR HOURS?

410
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:05,681
YOU ARE
COMING HOME WITH US.
BREE--

411
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,025
AND I WILL NOT HEAR
ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT.

412
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:13,077
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU BOUGHT US PIZZA.

413
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:14,776
WELL,
YOU GUYS EARNED IT.

414
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:17,759
BUT EAT FAST, BECAUSE WE ONLY
HAVE ONE HOUR LEFT, AND I WANT

415
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:20,433
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO YOUR NEW
BEST FRIEND--MR. SPRAY TAN.

416
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:25,184
YOU KNOW SO MUCH COOL STUFF.
CAN'T YOU COME BACK ANOTHER DAY?

417
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:26,455
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

418
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,263
<i>PLEASE?
YOU HAVE TO.</i>

419
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:31,278
WELL,
LET ME CHECK MY BOOK.

420
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,895
I MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE
SOME STUFF AROUND,

421
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,165
BUT I THINK I CAN SWING IT.

422
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:36,725
YOUR LIFE
MUST BE SO EXCITING, HUH?

423
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,860
YEAH,
EVERY DAY'S A PARADE.

424
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:44,309
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE
BEING A FAMOUS MODEL?

425
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,741
HONESTLY, IT WAS LIKE
ANY OTHER JOB,

426
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:49,404
EXCEPT THE PAY WAS GREAT,
THE CLOTHES WERE COUTURE

427
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,011
AND THE PARTIES WERE
JUST THIS SIDE OF GOMORRAH.

428
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:56,193
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT "GOMORRAH" MEANS, DO YOU?

429
00:21:58,665 --> 00:21:59,713
GOOD.

430
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,617
DID YOU KNOW KATE MOSS?

431
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:04,816
I INVITED HER TO A PARTY ONCE.
DID YOU
EAT PIZZA WITH HER?

432
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:07,601
<i>'CAUSE IF YOU DID, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE WE ATE PIZZA WITH HER.</i>

433
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:09,551
WELL, HONEY,
MOST MODELS DON'T EAT PIZZA.

434
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:12,552
WELL, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT
HAVING A FINGER FOR DESSERT.

435
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:14,224
(makes retching sound)
GROSS.

436
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,590
I KNOW. I NEVER DID THAT.
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE

437
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,086
THE HORRIBLE THINGS
THESE GIRLS DID TO STAY SKINNY.
LIKE WHAT?

438
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:25,629
WELL, SOME WOULD SMOKE THOSE
UNFILTERED FRENCH CIGARETTES.

439
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:27,646
BUT CIGARETTES
CAN KILL YOU.

440
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,780
BUT BEFORE THEY DO,
THEY KILL YOUR APPETITE.

441
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:30,444
(chuckles)

442
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:32,981
ONE TIME,

443
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:36,709
THERE WAS A GIRL WHO TOOK
TOO MANY LAXATIVES, AND, UH...

444
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:39,731
WELL, IF YOU'RE EVER AT
THE CHATEAU MILAN IN ROOM 238,

445
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:41,724
<i>DO NOT USE THE JACUZZI.</i>

446
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:45,073
DO YOU HAVE TO BE SKINNY
TO BE A MODEL?

447
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:46,990
WELL, YEAH.
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME

448
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,731
YOU SAW A FAT PERSON
ON A MAGAZINE COVER?

449
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,010
NOW I'M GONNA GO TALK TO VERN
ABOUT OUR NEXT SESSION.

450
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:54,297
YOU GUYS FINISH LUNCH
SO WE CAN GET BACK TO WORK.

451
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:54,713
(humming)

452
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,767
HI, RUPERT!
I WENT TO THE MALL

453
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,638
AND BOUGHT A CHANGE OF CLOTHES
FOR THE WEEKEND,

454
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:13,855
AND WHILE I WAS THERE,
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

455
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,693
I THOUGHT YOU COULD WEAR IT
ON YOUR DAY OFF.

456
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,749
DO YOU LIKE IT?

457
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:21,422
VERY MUCH.

458
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:23,409
IT'LL COME IN HANDY

459
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,292
SHOULD MY NATIONALITY
EVER SLIP MY MIND.

460
00:23:26,644 --> 00:23:26,893
(laughing)

461
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,179
THAT WAS GOOD.

462
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,910
YOU--
I WANNA PARTY WITH YOU.

463
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:37,402
HEY, I WAS THINKING
THIS AFTERNOON

464
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,410
MAYBE WE COULD
GO LOOK FOR THAT DRAWER.

465
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:40,521
OH, I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

466
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:42,554
I'M AFRAID I HAVE
ALL THIS SILVER TO POLISH.

467
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,401
WELL, LET ME HELP YOU,
AND WE CAN TALK.

468
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:48,849
THERE IS SO MUCH
I WANNA KNOW ABOUT YOU.

469
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:51,575
WHO IS
RUPERT CAVANAUGH?

470
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
WHAT MAKES HIM TICK?

471
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,416
(gasps) AAH!

472
00:23:56,751 --> 00:24:00,280
TELL YOU WHAT--LET'S GO
FIND YOU THAT DRAWER, HMM?

473
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,174
OH, ISN'T THE MASTER BEDROOM
DOWN THAT WAY?

474
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:07,277
I REALIZE
IT'S A BIT OF A JAUNT,

475
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:10,509
BUT I MANAGED TO FIND YOU
AN ENTIRE BUREAU.

476
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:11,469
OH! (chuckles)

477
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:14,291
OKAY, WELL, YOU CERTAINLY DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO TO ALL THAT...

478
00:24:15,835 --> 00:24:16,719
TROUBLE.

479
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:18,727
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

480
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,437
UH, NO,
I-I-I JUST, UM...

481
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:25,877
WELL, ALL I REALLY NEEDED
WAS JUST A LITTLE...

482
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:29,308
LITTLE DRAWER, AND, UH,
THIS IS JUST SO FAR AWAY--

483
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:30,556
AND WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

484
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:33,068
OH, YES, ABOUT THAT--

485
00:24:33,197 --> 00:24:35,875
THE CAT PASSED AWAY
IN THIS ROOM.

486
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:39,931
DID YOU CONSIDER
REMOVING THE BODY?

487
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:41,491
WELL, IF THIS
ISN'T ACCEPTABLE,

488
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,763
I CAN LOOK ELSEWHERE
FOR A DRAWER

489
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:45,434
<i>WHEN I HAVE THE TIME.</i>

490
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,313
WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO BE THIS WAY?

491
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:50,802
WHAT WAY IS THAT?

492
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:53,128
LISTEN, I KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT JANE,

493
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:55,153
BUT IF YOU COULD JUST
GIVE ME A CHANCE...

494
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,448
I MEAN, COME ON,

495
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,976
YOU--YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
HATE ME THIS MUCH, CAN YOU?

496
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:02,176
I'M DONE.

497
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:04,839
OH, FINE.
FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE.

498
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,702
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO LIKE ME,

499
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:08,959
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD
GIVE ME JUST A LITTLE RESPECT.

500
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,086
I AM IAN'S GIRLFRIEND.

501
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:13,252
HE'S STILL MARRIED.

502
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:16,746
AT BEST,
YOU'RE HIS MISTRESS.

503
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,700
OKAY, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO CALL ME THAT.

504
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:23,754
FINE.
WHAT TERM WOULD YOU PREFER?

505
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:26,418
CONCUBINE? CONSORT?

506
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,345
GOLD-DIGGING WHORE?

507
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:29,639
OH!

508
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:31,583
OH! I'M SO SORRY.

509
00:25:31,768 --> 00:25:33,895
I'M--I-I-I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

510
00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:35,829
BUT, RUPERT,
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

511
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:37,293
IT'S JUST A DRAWER.

512
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:39,935
THOSE DRAWERS ARE
FILLED WITH NE'S THINGS.

513
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,272
THIS IS HER HOUSE.

514
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:44,702
YOU ARE
A GUEST IN HER HOUSE,

515
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,165
AND A TEMPORARY ONE
AT BEST.

516
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,045
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
THAT IS FOR IAN TO DECIDE.

517
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,613
OH, HE HAS DECIDED.

518
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:55,532
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT YOU?

519
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,531
WHY DID HE WAIT SO LONG
TO BRING YOU HERE?

520
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,722
HE DIDN'T WANT YOU
IN THAT ROOM,

521
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:04,154
WHERE HE STILL KEEPS
JANE'S THINGS

522
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:06,460
EXACTLY AS SHE LEFT THEM.

523
00:26:11,784 --> 00:26:14,661
BUT... I'LL KEEP
LOOKING FOR THAT DRAWER.

524
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:15,503
(sighs)

525
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:23,000
HEY,
I'M GOING OVER TO MIKE'S.

526
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,480
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA MOW THE LAWN.

527
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:26,184
I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT

528
00:26:26,288 --> 00:26:28,160
I PROMISED I'D HELP HIM
INSTALL A SHOWER BAR,

529
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:30,351
AND, UM,
IT COULD TAKE A WHILE.

530
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:31,751
OKAY.

531
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:34,102
<i>(man) THERE NOW,
GO FEED THE CHICKENS...</i>

532
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,574
<i>(football game playing on TV)</i>

533
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:38,237
T-REX.
HOW THEY HANGING, BROTHER?

534
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,799
LOW AND LAZY.

535
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:41,446
HERE YOU GO.
YEAH.

536
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,173
HEY, IF LYNETTE ASKS,

537
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:45,665
I INSTALLED
YOUR SHOWER BAR TODAY.

538
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:47,896
(grunts) MMM.

539
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,678
VERN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WE NEED TO TALK.

540
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,910
IS IT ABOUT
THE GIRLS' MAKEUP?

541
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:55,853
'CAUSE I GOT THEM EACH
THEIR OWN MAKEUP KIT,

542
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:57,956
CUSTOM-TAILORED
TO MATCH THEIR SKIN TONE.

543
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,453
AND I GOT MELINA SOME WAX.
I KNOW SHE'S ONLY 11,

544
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:05,500
BUT THOSE GREEK GENES ARE GONNA
KICK IN ANY DAY NOW. WHAT?

545
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:07,075
THIS MORNING,
MRS. HAYES CAUGHT DONNA

546
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:08,191
HER FINGER DOWN HER THROAT

547
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:11,700
TRYING TO BARF UP
HER TOASTER WAFFLE.
REALLY?

548
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:14,596
AND MRS. HOROWITZ FOUND ISABEL
BEHIND THEIR GARAGE SMOKING.

549
00:27:15,003 --> 00:27:16,292
APPARENTLY,
SHE THOUGHT CIGARETTES

550
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:17,819
WOULD HELP HER
LOSE A FEW POUNDS.

551
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,658
WHERE DO YOU THINK
SHE GOT THAT IDEA?

552
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:24,370
THOSE DAMN
TOBACCO COMPANIES!
GABY!

553
00:27:24,698 --> 00:27:27,442
OH, FINE, I MAY HAVE TOLD A FEW
STORIES ABOUT THE OLD DAYS,

554
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:28,889
BUT AS A WARNING.

555
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:30,929
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
INAPPROPRIATE FOR KIDS.

556
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,297
CASSIE WARREN
ASKED HER MOTHER

557
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:33,553
IF SHE COULD THROW
A GOMORRAH PARTY.

558
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,800
OKAY, LOOK, WE HAVE TO DO
DAMAGE CONTROL. I GET IT.

559
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,100
NEXT SESSION,
I'LL APOLOGIZE TO ALL THE MOMS.

560
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
UNH-UNH, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
A NEXT SESSION FOR YOU.

561
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,100
THE MOMS DON'T WANT YOU
ANYWHERE NEAR THEIR DAUGHTERS.

562
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
BUT I'M HELPING THEM.

563
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
THEY LOVE ME!

564
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,400
WAIT, PLEASE, VERN,

565
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,800
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO FIX THIS.

566
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,000
IT'S TOO LATE, GABY. YOU ARE
NOW OFFICIALLY A BAD INFLUENCE.

567
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,200
WELL,
SEE YOU AT SPIN CLASS.

568
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,100
<i>(car engine revving)</i>

569
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
<i>(man) ALL RIGHT,
WHO TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS?</i>

570
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,700
<i>(man) HEY,
MAYBE THEY CALLED THE RACE</i>

571
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,200
<i>ON ACCOUNT OF DARKNESS.</i>

572
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,300
MOM SAID WE COULDN'T LEAVE.

573
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,500
I'M JUST GOING OUT FRONT.

574
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500

576

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!

577
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,300
STOP RUNNING THE BALL!

578
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,700
CAN I ASK YOU GUYS
SOMETHING?

579
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,900
WHAT WAS I LIKE
BEFORE THE ACCIDENT?

580
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

581
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,500
I MEAN,
WHAT KIND OF GUY WAS I?

582
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,900
WAS I HAPPY? WAS I ANGRY?

583
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,600
DID I EVER GET VIOLENT?

584
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,000
(scoffs) YOU WERE FINE.

585
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,400

(both sigh)

588
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,200
LOOK, I'M SERIOUS.
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW.

589
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,500
YOU--YOU CAN BE HONEST.
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

590
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,300
(exhales deeply) HONESTLY?

591
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,200
YOU WERE SORT OF MYSTERIOUS,
KEPT TO YOURSELF.

592
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,500
NOBODY REALLY KNEW YOU
ALL THAT WELL.

593
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,900
YEAH...

594
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,600

???

604
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,100
UH, WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

605
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,400
HE WENT OUTSIDE.
YEAH.

WHAT...

607
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,200
OKAY, WATCH HER!
WATCH HER.

608

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

(Lynette) HELLO?
OPEN UP! OPEN THE DOOR!

611
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,000
LYNETTE? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

612
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
I WANT MY SON.
HE'S NOT HERE.

613
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,400
HE'S NOT AT OUR HOUSE,
HE'S NOT IN OUR YARD.

614
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,900
DO NOT JERK ME AROUND.
PARKER!

YOU CAN'T JUST BARGE INTO
MY HOUSE LIKE THISLYNETTE.

I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
IS DOWN HERE!

618
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,700
WHERE'S THE PINBALL?
WHERE'S ALL THE GAMES?

619
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,200
OH, THAT WAS A COLLECTION
I WAS TAKING UP

620
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,700
FOR THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

621
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,500
I DELIVERED EVERYTHING
YESTERDAY.

622
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,300
DID YOU DONATE
THE PHOTOS, TOO?

623
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
PARKER!

624
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,500
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF?

625
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,300
DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW.
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

626

IS THERE A PROBLEM?

628
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,500
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

629
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,400
I CAN'T FIND MY SON.

630

ISN'T THAT YOUR SON?

631
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
HEY, HEY!

632
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,600
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!

633
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,900
WE WERE AT MIKE'S.
HE WANDERED OVER LOOKING FOR ME.

634
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,500
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?

635
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,800
WELL, THAT WAS
THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

636
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,200
ART'S STORY CHECKS OUT.
HE DONATED ALL THAT STUFF.

637
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,700
THAT PROVES NOTHING.

638
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,500
HE KNEW I WAS ON TO HIM.
HE HAD TO DUMP IT SOMEPLACE.

639
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,700
HONEY, BELIEVE ME,
I AM WITH YOU.

640
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
THERE IS SOMETHING FISHY
ABOUT THIS GUY.

641
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,800
BUT YOU GOTTA GET A GRIP.

642
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,500
YOU CAN'T GO
BARGING INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES.

643
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,100
WHAT IF PARKER
HAD BEEN IN THERE?
BUT HE WASN'T,

644
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,300
AND IF YOU KEEP ACCUSING
THIS GUY WHOUT PROOF,

645
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,600
HE CAN SUE US.

646
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
LISTEN...

647
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,200
I'VE BEEN THINKING

648
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,800
THAT AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH--

649
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,400
PLEASE DON'T BRING UP
THE SUPERMARKET AGAIN.

650
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,800
THAT WAS
A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE.

651
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,400
I THINK IT'S AFFECTED YOU
MORE THAN YOU REALIZE.

652
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,700
AND MAYBE YOU NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEBODY ABOUT IT...

653
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,100
YOU KNOW,
LIKE A THERAST.

654
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,600
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

655
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,800
HE'D GOTTEN RID
OF EVERYTHING--

656
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,400
THE TOYS, THE PICTURES,
EVERYTHING WAS GONE.

657
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,000
(sighs) OH.

658
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,500
YOU CAN'T SIT ON THIS,
LYNETTE.

659
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,400
I KNOW!

660
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,100
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO SOMEONE'S KID

661
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,900
BECAUSE
I KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT...
OOH.

662
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,000
THE THING IS,
I PROMISED TOM I'D BACK OFF.

663
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,600
<i>WELL, I DIDN'T.</i>

664
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,200
(cell phone beeping)

665
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,600
UM...

666
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
JANE HAS
SOME BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

667
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,300
YES, SHE'S ALWAYS HAD
IMPECCABLE TASTE.

668
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,800
HMM.

669
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,800
I, UM, I KNOW
HOW IT MUST SEEM TO YOU--

670
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,900
MY HOLDING ON TO THEM.

671
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,000
BUT I-I JUSTOULDN'T
BRING MYSELF TO--

672
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,200
I GET IT.

673
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,700
AS MUCH AS I HAVE TRIED
TO PRETEND

674
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,100
THAT IT'S JUST YOU AND ME...

675
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,700
THERE'S THREE OF US
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

676
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,000
SUSAN, YOU--YOU KNOW
I ADORE YOU.

677
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
NO, PLEASE, LISTEN...

678
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,300
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS,

679
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,100
I THOUGHT WE'VE GOTTEN
REALLY CLOSE,

680
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,500
AND I HAVE BEEN LOVING THAT.

681
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,400
UM, I JUST FEEL LIKE LATELY...

682
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,500
THERE'S THISIMIT TO HOW FAR
YOU'LL LET ME IN.

683
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,200
WELL, I'M--I'M TRYING.

684
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,100
IT'S JUST THE, UM, THE MORE
I-I LET YOU INTO MY HEART,

685
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,000
THE MORE I FEEL
I'M PUSHING JANE OUT AND--

686
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,600
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUSH JANE OUT
TO LET ME IN.

687
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,700
OF COURSE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

688
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,300
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
NO.

689
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,400
THAT KIND
OF COMPASSIONATE WISDOM

690
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,100
DESERVES
AN OBSCENELY EXPENSIVE MEAL.

691
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,900
MMM.
(laughs)

692
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,900
OKAY, WELL,
GIVE ME A MINUTE,

693
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,300
AND I WILL CHANGE
INTO SOMETHING NICE.

694
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,200
UH, RUPERT STILL HASN'T
FOUND YOU A DRAWER?

695
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,100
NO, NOT JUST YET.

696
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,500
WELL, IN THAT CASE...

697
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,300
IAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

698
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,100
IF I CAN MAKE ROOM IN MY HEART
FOR BOTH OF YOU,

699
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,700
I CAN CERTAINLY MAKE ROOM
IN MY BUREAU.

700
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,100
(chuckles)

701
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,700
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.
YOUR MOTHER SKIPPED LUNCH, TOO.

702
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,100
SHE SAID
SHE WASN'T HUNGRY.

703
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,300
CAN'T WE JUST REVEL
IN HER ABSENCE?

704
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I KNOW SHE'S A HANDFUL,

705
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
BUT SHE DESERVES
SOME COMPASSION.

706
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,300
THE WOMAN WATCHED
A DREAM DIE YESTERDAY.

707
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,500
???

708
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,200
I'M TAKING HER DINNER UP.

709
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,900
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL DO IT.

710
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,500
, NO,
I'D RATHER DO IT MYSELF.

711
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,100
I WANNA TALK TO HER.

712
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,300
OH, WELL, I'LL LET HER KNOW
YOU'RE COMING.

713
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,600
MOM'S COMING.
DITCH THE WINE.

714
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,900
VERY WELL.

715
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,600
YOU FINISHED
THE WHOLE BOTTLE ALREADY?

716
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,800
I WAS... THIRSTY.

717
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,200
GLORIA,
I'VE BEEN THINKING AND--

718
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,700
DOES NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE
EVER BOTHER TO KNOCK?

719
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,000
IS THAT ALCOHOL?
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

720
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,600
ANDREW!

721
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,300
WHEN MY GRANDMA ASKS ME A FAVOR
WITH TEARS IN HER EYES, HOW--

722
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,600
OH, SHUT UP,
YOU LITTLE EXTORTIONIST.

723
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,200
HE CHARGED ME 20 BUCKS,
PLUS 5 FOR THE CORKSCREW.

724
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU LATER.

725
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,400
YOU CAN KISS THAT CODEINE
GOOD-BYE.

726
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
ANEW BROUGHT HER WINE.

727
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,100
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
THIS IS OUR HOUSE.

728
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,600
IF YOU EXPECT TO STAY HERE,

729
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,500
YOU'REOING TO LEARN
TO OBEY A FEW RULES.

730
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,600
I DON'T OBEY RULES.
I MAKE THEM.

731
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,000
NOT ANYMORE, MOTHER.

732
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,100
JUST WATCH YOURSELF,
SONNY BOY.

733
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
OKAY, LOOK,

734
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,000
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET, BUT DON'T
BLAME ORSON. IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

735
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,100
<i>IT'S ALL HIS FAULT.</i>

736
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,100
YOU THINK HE'S SO WONDERFUL.

737
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,000
YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF
OF WHAT HE'S DONE.

738
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,200
LET'S GO. I CAN'T DEAL WITH HER
WHEN SHE'S LIKE THIS.

739
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,100
HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO HEAR THE TRUTH--

740
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,700
HOW HE CHEATED ON ALMA.

741
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,200
WHAT?

742
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,700
SHE'S DRUNK!

743
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,200
HOW HE BROKE HER HEART...
AND MINE,

744
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,600
ALL FOR HIS PRECIOUS MONIQUE.

745
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,200
YOU SHUT UP, MOTHER.

746
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,600
MONIQUE POLIER?

747
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,200
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
HARVEY BIGSBY'S MISTRESS.

748
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,400
OH, SHE GOT AROUND,
THAT GIRL!

749
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,900
SEE, I TOLD YOU.
I TOLD YOU SHE WOULD DO THIS.

750
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,100
THERE HE WAS,
CHEATING ON ALMA,

751
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,500
NOT KNOWING ALL THE TIME
S WHORE WAS CHEATING ON HIM.

752
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,100
STOP IT!
YOU SHUT YOUR EVIL MOUTH!

753
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,500
OR WHAT?!

754
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,000
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO ME
THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN DONE?

755
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,900
BREE...

756
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,200
BREE!

757
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
BREE, NO!

758
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,000
BREE, WAIT!

759
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,600
BREE!

760
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,900
(car engine starts)

761
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,900
(car departs)

762
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,200
(girl) I KNOW. I THOUGHT
IT WAS SO ADORABLE.

763
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,800
(girl) SKIRT...
I KNOW!

764
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
(girls continue
speaking indistinctly)

765
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,500
MISS GABRIELLE!
(girl) GABRIELLE!

766
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,500
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

767
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,000
I TOLD HER SHE WAS BANNED.

768
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,200
OKAY,
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

769
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,300
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID
TO THE GIRLS,

770
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,000
AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

771
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,700
DAMN RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE NEAR OUR GIRLS.

772
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,000
CAN'T YOU GIVE ME
A SECOND CHANCE?

773
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,100
WHY SHOULD WE?

774
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,800
YEAH, I MEAN,
YOU WALK IN HERE

775
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,600
ALL CLICKETY-CLACK,
PERFECT LITTLE MISS SIZE ZERO,

776
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,400
THINKING YOU'RE ALL
BETTER THAN US.

777
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,600
WE ALL SAW THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP.

778
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,700
I DON'T THINK
I'M BETTER THAN YOU.

779
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,300
HELL, I ENVY YOU.

780
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
(scoffs)
PLEASE.

781
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,700
NO, IT'S TRUE. YOU HAVE
HUSBANDS AND FAMILS

782
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,800
AND A REASON
TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.

783
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,400
WHAT DO I HAVE?

784
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
HIM.

785
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,200
TEACHING YOUR KIDS
ABOUT CONFIDENCE AND BEAUTY

786
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,800
IS THE MOST USEFUL THING
I'VE DONE SINCE...

787
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,700
I DON'T KNOW WHEN.

788
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,500
AND AS MUCH
AS I'VE HELPED THEM...

789
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,400
THEY'VE HELPED ME
SO MUCH MORE.

790
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,000
SO PLEASE, I NEED THIS.

791
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,300
AND I PROMISE,

792
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,100
NO MORE TALK ABOUT
DODGY WEIGHT LOSS METHODS.

793
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,300
LIKE THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE,
NON-F.D.A.-APPROVED DIET PILL

794
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,000
I CAN GET
FROM MY FRIENDS IN ZURICH...

795
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
IN BK.

796
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,500
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THE CHRISTIAN THING

797
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,900
WOULD BE TO FORGIVE HER.

798
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LADIES
TALK IT OVER?

799
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,200
AND I'M GONNA WORK ON POSTURE
WITH THE GIRLS.

800
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,400
(girl) YEAH! COME ON!

801
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,700
(girl) COME ON, YOU GUYS.
LET'S GO!

802
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,000
AS LONG THEY'RE SAFE...
(women speaking indistinctly)

803
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,800
OH, THANK GOD.

804
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,300
I'VE BEEN DRIVING AROUND
ALL NIGHT LOOKING FOR YOU.

805
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,500
WE SAW THAT WOMAN
AT THE MORGUE...

806
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,300
ON OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

807
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,700
YOU PRETENDED
NOT TO KNOW HER.
BREE, I CAN EXPLAIN.

808
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,500
NO. I'M DONE.

809
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,300
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED.

810
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,500
THERE WERE TWO WOMEN
IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE ME.

811
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,200
ONE VANISHED,
AND THE OTHER WAS KILLED.

812
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,100
THAT'S ALL
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

813
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,800
I'VE PACKED
SOME OF YOUR THINGS.

814
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,000
I WANT YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE.

815
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,300
NOW.

816
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,200
BREE...

817
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,800
PLEASE...

818
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,800
I LOVE YOU.

819
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,300
I KNOW...

820
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,000
BUT IT SCARES
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

821
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,500
<i>DANGEROUS MEN WALK AMONG US,</i>

822
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,500
<i>AND WE CAN'T ALWAYS BE SURE
OF WHO THEY ARE</i>

823
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,500
<i>OR WHAT SECRETS THEY HIDE.</i>

824
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,700
<i>BUT ONCE OUR WORST SUSPICIONS
ARE CONFIRMED,</i>

825
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
<i>WE CAN TAKE ACTION.</i>

826
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,600
<i>ONCE THEIR AGENDAS
ARE REVEALED...</i>

827
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,200
<i>WE CAN TAKE STEPS</i>

828
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,200
<i>TO PROTECT OURSELVES</i>

829
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
???
