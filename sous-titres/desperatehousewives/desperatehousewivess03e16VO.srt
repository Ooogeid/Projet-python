1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:01,644
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,200
<i>Mike's plan to propose to Susan...</i>

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,812
These things don't belong to Jane.

4
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:06,892
"Mike Delfino."

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,800
<i>...was a surprise to Ian.</i>

6
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:11,196
<i>Monique was murdered...</i>

7
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,288
There's been an accident.

8
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:13,367
<i>And Orson...</i>

9
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,846
Don't forget your wrench.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,300
<i>...passed the blame.</i>

11
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:18,600
<i>A connection was made.</i>

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,900
<i>A heart was broken,</i>

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,574
<i>And Bree</i>

14
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:26,723
<i>buried her husband Rex.</i>

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,898
<i>My name is Rex Van De Kamp</i>.

16
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:40,100
<i>I always hated cemeteries
when I was alive.</i>

17
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,447
<i>Now that I'm dead,
I like 'em even less.</i>

18
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:47,816
<i>Here's where I used to live--</i>

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,939
<i>a whole lot nicer, don't you think?</i>

20
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,674
<i>The place hasn't changed
much since I left--</i>

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,833
<i>as tasteful and tidy as ever.</i>

22
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,848
<i>Everything perfect...</i>

23
00:00:58,122 --> 00:00:59,719
<i>at least on the surface.</i>

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,968
<i>My family was the same way.</i>

25
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:05,142
<i>Look at us. You'd never guess.</i>

26
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:07,757
<i>How ticked off we all were
the day this was taken,</i>

27
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:10,333
<i>But that was the thing
about us Van De Kamps.</i>

28
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,425
<i>To really fit in,</i>

29
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,400
<i>you had to have a smile
that gave away nothing</i>.

30
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,380
<i>Like my son Andrew--</i>

31
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:22,619
<i>To look at him, you'd never know
he spent six months on the streets</i>.

32
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,714
<i>Supporting himself</i>

33
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:26,030
<i>with panhandling
and light prostitution.</i>

34
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,372
<i>Or my daughter Danielle--</i>

35
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Does she look like the kind of girl</i>

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,982
<i>who'd seduce her middle-aged
history teacher?</i>

37
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:36,065
<i>I mean, they're my kids,
and I love 'em,</i>

38
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:38,647
<i>But I'm pretty darn relieved
to be dead.</i>

39
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:42,621
<i>Here's the clown Bree
replaced me with--</i>

40
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,384
<i>Orson</i>.

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,342
<i>I don't mind saying,</i>

42
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:49,035
<i>he's creeped me out
right from the get-go.</i>

43
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:54,800
<i>To me, he always has the shifty look</i>

44
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:57,811
<i>of a guy who knows
where the bodies are buried...</i>

45
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,769
<i>and he should know</i>.

46
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,895
<i>He buried them</i>.

47
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:04,886
<i>But Bree thinks he's Sir Galahad</i>.

48
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:07,122
<i>The kids like him</i>.

49
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,851
<i>And all my friends...</i>

50
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:13,320
<i>now his friends.</i>

51
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:14,917
<i>So it pleases me to know</i>

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,221
<i>that at least one of
my old neighbors</i>.

53
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,316
<i>Sees right through the guy</i>.

54
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:22,880
Mike, you just missed Bree.

55
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,600
She's off to see her folks,

56
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:27,109
and then we're finally
taking our honeymoon.

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,176
Yeah, not a bad time
for you to leave town, is it?

58
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,633
Well, I don't follow you.

59
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,709
I just keep thinking about
that night at Monique's place--

60
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:38,200
How you made sure
I left with my wrench,

61
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:39,966
The one with her blood on it.

62
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,186
Well, it was your wrench.

63
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,151
Why are you rehashing this?

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,586
My ex-wife confessed
in her suicide note.

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,047
The case is closed.

66
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,160
Maybe it shouldn't be.

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,028
What do you think
the police would say

68
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:56,497
if they knew
you were there that night?

69
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:57,872
What do you think they'd say

70
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:00,221
If they knew
you threw me off a roof?

71
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,849
Oh, Mike.

72
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:07,279
We could make so much trouble
for each other,

73
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,500
or we can forget
what we think we know

74
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,513
and be good neighbors.

75
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,831
Your call.

76
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:21,299
<i>No, Orson Hodge
isn't exactly the guy</i>

77
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,447
<i>I'd have picked to head my family,</i>

78
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,636
<i>But I'll give him one thing--</i>

79
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,101
<i>He's got the smile down cold</i>.

Desperate Housewives - Season 03 -
Episode 16

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,587
"My husband, The Pig"

85
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,567
<i>Take a drive down
any street in suburbia</i>.

86
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,866
<i>Know what you're gonna see?</i>

87
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,804
<i>Desperate women.</i>

88
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,496
<i>That's right--</i>

89
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:24,559
<i>One unhappy housewife
after another,</i>

90
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:27,737
<i>Each completely miserable...</i>

91
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,672
<i>in her own unique way.</i>

92
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:34,877
<i>But I don't want to talk about them.</i>

93
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,618
<i>No, I want to talk about their men.</i>

94
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,639
<i>And what happens to a guy</i>

95
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:43,353
<i>when that special lady
in his life starts to lose it.</i>

96
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:46,454
<i>Like my friend Carlos.</i>

97
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,663
<i>He used to have it all--</i>

98
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,833
<i>hot wife, tons of dough,</i>

99
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,170
<i>then bam!</i>

100
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:56,426
<i>She gets a divorce,
and he gets stuck with the bill.</i>

101
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,500
<i>But does he sit around
and complain</i>

102
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,372
<i>like your average hausfrau?</i>

103
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,564
<i>No, sir.</i>

104
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,200
<i>He finds creative ways</i>

105
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:06,248
<i>to get what you can out of life.</i>

106
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:11,606
Hey, bro!

107
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,643
- Where you off to?
- Oh, the hospital called.

108
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:16,191
They found the stuff I had on me
the night of the accident.

109
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:19,654
Coma, murder rap--
you've had a tough year, buddy.

110
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,681
You know what you need?
Some pampering.

111
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,108
Tomorrow you're checking
in to a nice hotel.

112
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,178
Room service,
jacuzzi, my treat.

113
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,747
You trying to get me out
of the house?

114
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,333
Mike, why would I--
okay, there's this girl.

115
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:32,508
I knew it.

116
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:34,401
Dude, she's a dancer,

117
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:37,277
and if her online profile's
any indication,

118
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,855
she's a complete freak.
We're talking serious daddy issues.

119
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,975
Look, I'll stay in my room.
You'll never hear me.

120
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,733
Yeah but you'll hear me.

121
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,188
I'm kind of exuberant by nature,
and when I haven't had it in a while,

122
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:49,255
I kind of do this shrieking thing that,
I mean, is kinda--

123
00:05:49,336 --> 00:05:51,536
Okay. All right, I'll go.
Just stop talking.

124
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,483
Thanks, pal. I wouldn't want it
to put a weird spin on our friendship.

125
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,563
Too late.

126
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:00,042
<i>This is my friend Tom.</i>

127
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,976
<i>Have you heard
what he's been up to lately?</i>

128
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,318
<i>This silly bastard opened up
his own pizza place.</i>

129
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,700
<i>He thought that if
he was his own boss,</i>

130
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,118
<i>He could sleep in
as late as he wanted,</i>

131
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:16,296
<i>But the problem with that
logic is that married guys...</i>

132
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,034
hey. It's after 9:00.

133
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,600
Come on, thomasina,
it's time to get up.

134
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,392
<i>Are never their own boss.</i>

135
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,100
Are you as tired as I am?

136
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:28,538
More, but I'm tougher,
and I complain less.

137
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,565
Not when you give birth,
and you do that a lot.

138
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,025
Yeah?

139
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,500
Before I forget,
you got a call from "Chez Nous"

140
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,200
confirming your reservation
for our anniversary.

141
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,700
You heard that?
I wanted that to be a surprise.

142
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:45,100
Well, we've been going there
for the last seven years.

143
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:47,165
It's not exactly a surprise.

144
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,889
Anyway, I hope you don't mind,

145
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:51,948
but I canceled.

146
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,513
You canceled? Why?

147
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:59,400
Honestly, I just don't feel up
to going out this year.

148
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,800
But it's our anniversary.
It's our ninth anniversary.

149
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,213
Come on. The "big nine."

150
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,800
That's a year longer than
my mom said we would be married.

151
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:09,442
Come on. We gotta party down.

152
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,010
I'm exhausted.

153
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,050
Honestly, all I wanna do is pawn
the kids off on somebody else,

154
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,539
take a long bath and
be in bed by 8:00.

155
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:22,630
Okay.

156
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:23,734
Oh, thank you.

157
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,498
Thank you. Thank you.

158
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:29,410
Hold it.

159
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:32,298
What about my sex?

160
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,464
I always get sex on our anniversary.

161
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:37,528
We can still have sex.
Just try not to wake me.

162
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,670
<i>This is Ian.</i>

163
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,593
<i>Don't really know the guy,</i>

164
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,767
<i>But Susan Mayer seems to like him.</i>

165
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:52,274
<i>The other night,
He surprised her with a proposal.</i>

166
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,306
<i>She said yes,
but he's still a little skittish</i>

167
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,689
<i>About the competition.</i>

168
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:01,000
<i>But Ian knows that if love is war...</i>

169
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:03,609
<i>Hey. Where were you off to
so early this morning?</i>

170
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,663
<i>Sometimes you gotta
bring out the big artillery.</i>

171
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,360
<i>I should have had it
when I proposed.</i>

172
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:13,474
It's not very good form, I know.

173
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:17,306
Ian, oh, you can't be serious.

174
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,416
Oh, that's just... too much.

175
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,921
- It's huge.
- Well, we could go smaller.

176
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:25,299
Oh, no. No one's saying smaller.
No, that's crazy talk.

177
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:30,546
Rock me.

178
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:37,500
Oh, my! Oh, it's so beautiful!

179
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:41,121
Oh, okay. Ay, nobody move.

180
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,200
I got it.

181
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,073
I knew I should have
measured your finger.

182
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,122
No, it's okay.
I can get it resized.

183
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,907
You should go to
the jeweler's right now,

184
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,977
and when you get back, we can go and
look at some places for the reception.

185
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,038
Reception?

186
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:58,920
Yes, I was hoping we could pull
this together for next month.

187
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:01,234
What's the rush? Am I pregnant?

188
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:04,900
Of course not. I just well, I just
can't wait to be married to you.

189
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,944
Are you sure? 'Cause you
seem a little anxious.

190
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:11,112
What would I have to be anxious about?

191
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,600
Again, sorry for the mix-Up.

192
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,266
If you could just sign right here...

193
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:22,215
I don't remember this.
You sure that's mine?

194
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,310
It was on you
the night you were admitted.

195
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:25,913
I got hit by a car.

196
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,142
I don't remember anything
about that night.

197
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:31,869
Well, it looks like you were
gonna propose to someone.

198
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:35,542
"Susan, be mine forever. Mike."

199
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:40,262
Does that ring a bell?

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,193
It sure does.

201
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,704
Hey, Carlos.

202
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:53,698
Hi. I have a little visitor

203
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,045
That I thought you might
get a kick out of seeing.

204
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,916
Remember my little boy?

205
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:01,311
Hey, Travers. How you doing?
Put her there.

206
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:03,300
I'm Carlos Solis.

207
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,691
I think you came by my house
one time trick-or-treating.

208
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:08,310
I remember.
You gave me a protein bar.

209
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,096
Right.

210
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,998
Sorry. My wife forgot to buy candy.

211
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,403
Hey, is that football I hear?
Go on. Check it out.

212
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,636
I didn't know your son
was coming for a visit.

213
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:22,905
Neither did I.

214
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,700
His, uh, father just dumped him
here for four weeks.

215
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,800
So he could jet off with his
doctors without borders buddies

216
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,100
and fix cleft palates in Kenya.

217
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,900
Selfish son of a bitch.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,369
Come on. I mean, you barely
even see him. It'll be fun--

219
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:41,512
A chance to bond.

220
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,792
Yeah, that's true, but, um...

221
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,922
I have this major party tonight,

222
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:51,364
and I was wondering if maybe you could
just keep an eye on him for a few hours.

223
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,881
- Sorry. I can't tonight.
- Oh! Come on! You love kids.

224
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,726
I mean, didn't you rent
that chinese chick

225
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:58,411
So that you could have
one of your own?

226
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:00,400
I have a date, too,
with a chick so hot.

227
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,170
I had to turn off
the smoke alarms in my house.

228
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:07,000
Fine. Travers, come on.
Let's go.

229
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,000
This isn't a child-friendly house.

230
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:16,878
Bye, Travers.

231
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,757
It's good to see you.

232
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:29,980
She's a looker.

233
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,155
I'll say.

234
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,599
- Hey, what time's that fund-raiser?
- You got an hour.

235
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,200
Well, then...

236
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:39,900
let'have a little fun.

237
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:54,800
Look what you did!

238
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,687
Don't yell at me.
I'm just a passenger.

239
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:58,152
Well, your driver's an idiot!

240
00:11:58,257 --> 00:11:59,724
Hey, it's not clyde's fault.

241
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:02,950
I mean, what man wouldn't be
distracted by such beauty?

242
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,998
Now you're hitting on me?

243
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,104
I was talking about the car.

244
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,400
Well, good.
I'm glad you like it,

245
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
'Cause you're gonna pay to fix this.

246
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:14,300
Of course. $5,000 cover it?

247
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:16,234
Five?

248
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:19,201
Well, sure, I guess.

249
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,463
I'd rather not file
an insurance claim.

250
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,916
My opponent could find out
and try to make me look bad.

251
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:25,014
Opponent?

252
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:26,728
Well, I guess
you don't read the papers.

253
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,149
I'm running for mayor.
My name's Victor Lang,

254
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,427
and I hope I can count on your vote.

255
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:34,600
I ink I'd rather vote
for the other guy--

256
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,294
You know, the one
who didn't wreck my car?

257
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,900
Oh, you're off your game.

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,474
You didn't even get
a phone number.

259
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,467
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be seeing her again.

260
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,181
How can you be so sure?

261
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,472
I didn't sign the check.

262
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:06,500
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need to talk.

263
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:09,348
- No, we don't. Get out.
- Please. You won't return my calls.

264
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:10,489
Well, I've been busy.

265
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,566
Plus, my mom caught you
naked on top of my friend.

266
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,100
Just read this, and if you
still don't want to talk to me,

267
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,512
Then I'll never bother you again.

268
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Fine, I'll read it,

269
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,099
But only if you get out
of the car right now.

270
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:26,295
Now? But the hot wax is starting.

271
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,825
I know. Tick-tock.

272
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,600
You're still in there?

273
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,736
How long does it take
to pluck that unibrow?

274
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:46,053
Leave me alone!

275
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:48,343
Danielle, I have to be at
work in ten minutes.

276
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,671
Now can I please just come
in and brush my teeth?

277
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:53,610
I'm having a really
bad day, all right?

278
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:54,958
Just go away!

279
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:56,644
I'm gonna have
a really bad day, too.

280
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,468
I tend not to get tipped
when my breath stinks.

281
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:02,972
I'm pregnant.

282
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,900
Mike, what are you doing here?

283
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,758
Oh, hey, I'm just
selling some old jewelry.

284
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:23,666
I spoke to my manager.

285
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,997
There's gonna be a charge
to remove the inscription,

286
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:28,745
but, uh, we can refund you
for the engagement ring.

287
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:30,736
That'll be fine.

288
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,100
Was that the ring
that you bought for...

289
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,290
yeah.

290
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,119
Can I help you?

291
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:42,451
Yeah, I have to get this sized.

292
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:43,669
It's a little loose.

293
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,879
- Do you know your size?
- No.

294
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,331
Congratulations, by the way.

295
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:51,498
Ian... seems great.

296
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,752
Thanks.

297
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,537
I can't find my sizer.

298
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:57,900
Here.

299
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,459
Try this one.

300
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:00,739
No, th--

301
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,337
How's that fit?

302
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:12,063
It's perfect.

303
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,622
Great.

304
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:21,236
Can I have it back now?

305
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:23,625
Sorry.

306
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,660
Hey, you've got a cousin
in the limo business, don't you?

307
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:37,870
Actually, I've got a cousin

308
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:40,820
in the "limo as a front
for prostitution" business.

309
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,422
He's in jail. Why do you ask?

310
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,511
I'm just planning
a big thing for my anniversary.

311
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:48,223
Aren't you just gonna go to Chez Boring,
like you do every year?

312
00:15:48,306 --> 00:15:49,383
No.

313
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,575
Lynette's so over that, she was ready
to bag the whole night,

314
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:54,400
so got me thinking.

315
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:58,103
Nine years--
time to shake things up.

316
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:02,307
Now I'm planning the greatest
anniversary of all time.

317
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:05,002
Check this out.

318
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,988
Lynette's gonna open the door
to find a limo driver

319
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,900
with a dozen roses and a card.

320
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:13,097
The card is gonna tell her
to go with the guy,

321
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:15,095
Not ask any questions.

322
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,900
He'll drive her out to the country.

323
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:18,607
He'll drop her off,

324
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,571
then drive away.

325
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,353
Just as she is starting to freak out,

326
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,203
I show up in a horse-drawn carriage,

327
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:29,300
which takes us up to whitman's bluff,

328
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,693
where we eat a catered dinner,

329
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:33,042
listen to a professional violinist.

330
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:36,618
Afterwards, when we come home,

331
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,814
I'm sure Lynette will think
of a way to thank me.

332
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,768
You're one romantic son of a bitch.

333
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:46,086
I have my moments.

334
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:50,300
Of course I'm not questioning
mayor Johnson's family values.

335
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,229
I'm sure they're what prompted him
to put his sisters, brother-in-law

336
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,649
and six of his cousins
on the city payroll.

337
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,475
Now, if you'll excuse me,

338
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:02,058
I have to cut this interview short.

339
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:05,091
I have some very important
business to attend to.

340
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,093
Ms. Solis,

341
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:09,216
What a nice surprise.

342
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:11,998
Are you here to make
a contribution to my campaign?

343
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:13,416
Not exactly.

344
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,401
No. Did I forget to s--

345
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:18,619
I'm so sorry.

346
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,875
Let me make it up to you.

347
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,057
- I'll take you to dinner. My treat.
- It would be

348
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:24,442
your treat. I'm a hot date.

349
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:26,113
What's in it for me?

350
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:29,239
Well, I have, "an ingratiating wit",

351
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,110
"trustworthy smile",

352
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:33,154
according to the "plainview herald."

353
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,807
Yeah. Check, please.

354
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,097
My family also owns landing enterprises.

355
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,725
Dad's worth a...

356
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,581
few hundred mil.

357
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,622
Well, a girl's gotta eat.

358
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:55,280
Great. I'll take you to Cucina.

359
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:57,506
There's no place harder to get into.

360
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,104
That's what you think.

361
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:05,636
Mike, this is completely unnecessary.

362
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:08,600
My paying for your lawyer
was a favor. It wasn't a loan.

363
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,224
I appreciate it, but I just
don't like to owe anybody.

364
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,489
Well, I just don't want you

365
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:14,751
to have any trouble
getting back on your feet.

366
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,843
No, it's fine. I had a windfall.
The hospital gave me back

367
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:21,028
an engagement ring
I didn't even know I had.

368
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:22,600
Oh, really? So you sold it?

369
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:26,087
You should have kept it
till the right girl comes along.

370
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:27,437
Well, I...

371
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,492
couldn't give this ring
to just anyone.

372
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:31,792
Oh, right, the inscription.

373
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:38,696
How'd you know
it was inscribed?

374
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,902
Well, isn't that the custom?
I just assumed it was.

375
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:47,517
Well, listen, I've got
to get some fresh rags.

376
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:50,161
Thanks for the check.
I'll see you around.

377
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:56,312
Oh, you can count on it.

378
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,019
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

379
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:01,979
I peed on five different sticks.

380
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:05,377
Would you put that burrito away?
It's making me nauseous.

381
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,883
Join the club.

382
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,928
Look, I know your parents
are religious, but I know this clinic.

383
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,200
Absotely not!

384
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,711
So what other choice do we have?

385
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:15,030
Well, gee, you could,
like, marry me?

386
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:17,330
Marry you?!
I can't stand you.

387
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,400
Nice way to talk
to the mother of your child!

388
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:22,052
Oh, God.

389
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,614
Bathroom.

390
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,011
- Hey.
- Julie.

391
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:32,084
Hi. Hey.

392
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:34,608
Your door was open.
Can I come in?

393
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,413
What are you doing here?

394
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,881
I read your letter.

395
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,891
I had no idea
it would be so sweet.

396
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:47,090
I could really tell
it came from your heart.

397
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,048
I'm embarrassed to admit, I...

398
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:51,831
cried.

399
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:57,726
My aunt Edie sort of
tied one on last night.

400
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,701
Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is...

401
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:04,881
okay.

402
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:06,155
"Okay"?

403
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:08,443
We can try again.

404
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:11,732
Julie, that's great!
And I want to talk about this,

405
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:14,090
but I just kinda need
to take care of my aunt.

406
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:15,534
Can I call you tomorrow?

407
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,885
Sure.

408
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,359
We're gonna have
to take things slow,

409
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,391
'cause it'll be a while
before I can trust you again.

410
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:27,301
I understand.

411
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:35,800
Thank you, Bruno.
The veal was excellent.

412
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:38,300
Feel like dessert?
No, thank you. I'm stuffed.

413
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,600
Then let me propose a toast.

414
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,600
To a delightful evening,

415
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,294
and to the happy accident
that brought us together.

416
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:48,400
Victor, you are so full of crap.

417
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,034
What?

418
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,370
There was no accident.

419
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,006
I know you told your chauffeur
to ram my car.

420
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,264
Why would I do that?

421
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:58,500
For the same reason
you forgot to sign the check.

422
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,663
You've been working me
since the second we met,

423
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,980
and I've been on to you
every step of the way.

424
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,700
What? What's so funny?

425
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
I just called you a manipulative jerk.

426
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,000
I think I underestimated you.

427
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,300
I also think this relationship
just got a lot more interesting.

428
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,600
There is no relationship.
This is our last date.

429
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:20,234
You didn't have any fun?

430
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:23,800
It was okay. You know,
you told a few good jokes.

431
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,700
You're sorta charming.

432
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:28,900
You're not bad-Looking.
I just think I can do better.

433
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,391
Have you not noticed?
I'm a catch.

434
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:34,300
I have noticed,
and I'm throwing you back.

435
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,503
Gaby, let me tell you something.

436
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:39,300
For my whole life,

437
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,800
Whenever I've truly wanted something,

438
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,600
I've always gotten it.

439
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:45,500
And tonight, right around the time

440
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,600
you were calling me
a manipulative jerk,

441
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,623
I decided I truly want... you.

442
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
So brace yourself.

443
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,600
The chase is on.

444
00:21:57,352 --> 00:21:59,400
You can chase me all you want,

445
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:02,700
But trust me,
I'm way too fast for you.

446
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,911
Bruno...

447
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,500
I'm gonna marry that girl.

448
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:19,637
Can I just say something?

449
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:21,681
You are way hotter
than your online profile.

450
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:24,300
So many guys say that.

451
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:34,980
What's wrong?

452
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:36,900
Oh, my friend's kid is out there.

453
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,100
Oh. Hey, I got an idea.

454
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's go upstairs.

455
00:22:55,242 --> 00:22:56,500
I should warn you...

456
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:00,800
My therapist says
I'm sexually compulsive.

457
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:03,500
This could take hours.

458
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:05,400
Whatever your issues are,

459
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,000
We will work them out together.

460
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,934
It's almost 11:00.
What is he doing out there by himself?

461
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,900
I'm sure his folks
know he's out there.

462
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,560
Now relax.

463
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,862
I'm so sorry.

464
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:36,450
I will be right back.
I promise.

465
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:41,727
Hey, Travers,
what are you doing out here?

466
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,760
Where's your mom?

467
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:44,265
She had to go visit
a sick friend.

468
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:51,568
Come on.

469
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,300
No way. I didn't come over here
to babysit some little brat.

470
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,500
Shh. He can hear you.

471
00:23:57,554 --> 00:23:58,728
I don't care.

472
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:03,000
Look, his mother's bound
to be home soon, all right?

473
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,800
Then we can pick up
where we left off.

474
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,158
Forget it.

475
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,600
I'm officially
no longer in the mood.

476
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:22,800
Sorry I ruined your date.

477
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:25,347
That's okay.

478
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,500
She was a very bad lady

479
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,500
who wanted to do very,
very bad things to me.

480
00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:35,500
Night, raoul.

481
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,141
I HAVE YOUR SON.
CARLOS.

482
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,961
Where the hell have you been?

483
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:56,057
Oh, I, uh...

484
00:24:57,302 --> 00:24:59,400
ducked out...
just for an hour.

485
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,231
That's funny, 'cause I found travers

486
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:02,821
Wandering the streets three hours ago.

487
00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:04,400
Look, he was fine when I left.

488
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:06,347
I just didn't know he'd go outside.

489
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:08,604
Yeah, you never know what
an 8 year old's gonna do.

490
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:09,962
That's why you supervise him.

491
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,700
You don't get to judge me.
You don't have a kid.

492
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, if I did,

493
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,293
I'd treat him a hell of a lot
better than you do.

494
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,691
Thank God he lives with
his father. I mean, come on.

495
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:21,674
What kind of mother are you?

496
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,447
If you are done lecturing me,

497
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,000
I would like my son now.

498
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,500
He's asleep.

499
00:25:32,357 --> 00:25:34,054
Come and get him in the morning...

500
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,284
when you're sober.

501
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Hey, buddy!

502
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,600
Ur mom's here for ya.

503
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,500
I know you think I'm a terrible person.

504
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:55,400
I never said that.

505
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:57,897
Terrible mother,
terrible person...

506
00:25:57,944 --> 00:25:59,100
It's the same thing.

507
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:03,200
Because no matter what else she does,

508
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:06,631
If a woman isn't a good mother,
she's a failure, right?

509
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,900
Look, um...

510
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,100
when I had travers, I, uh,
I knew I was in over my head,

511
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:21,700
and when
charles and I split, I...

512
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,800
I gave him custody.

513
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:30,200
Because I wanted my son
to have the best life possible.

514
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,100
And that doesn't make me
a good mother, but...

515
00:26:36,826 --> 00:26:39,300
I like to think
it makes me a realistic one.

516
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:44,900
Hey, mom.

517
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:46,700
Hey, champ.

518
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,516
I missed you.

519
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:51,100
Oh, I missed you, too.

520
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:52,900
Guess what?

521
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,800
I've got so many fun things
for you to do today.

522
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,413
- Cool.
- Yeah.

523
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,599
Thanks for the ice cream.

524
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:01,400
My pleasure.
I'll see you, little man.

525
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,076
Hey.

526
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:07,100
Travers said he's, uh,
staying at least a month.

527
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:08,864
Yeah.

528
00:27:09,532 --> 00:27:12,100
So if you ever need
a babysitter, just yell.

529
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:16,900
I appreciate that.

530
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:23,500
Hey! Wait for me!

531
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,499
No, I don't want a viola player.

532
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:28,400
I asked for a violinist. I don't
even know what a viola is.

533
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:30,700
Oh, it's just a big violin?

534
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:33,323
Okay. Yeah, sure.

535
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,100
Okay, I'll see you at 8:00.

536
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,596
What was that?

537
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,147
It's... just a little surprise, okay?

538
00:27:41,197 --> 00:27:42,199
Let it go.

539
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:44,100
"Let it go"--
That's cute.

540
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:46,343
Start talkin'.

541
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:49,300
I planned a little something
for our anniversary.

542
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
That is all I'm gonna say.

543
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:56,231
Okay. Okay. Okay.
If we're doing this,

544
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:57,919
I need to buy you something.

545
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,057
What do you want?

546
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:00,470
You don't have to buy me anything.

547
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:01,994
You didn't have to plan anything,

548
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:03,885
but you did, even though
we had an agreement.

549
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:05,999
You like ties?
You're getting a tie.

550
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,531
What are you getting so upset about?

551
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:11,091
I have been dragging my ass
all day, and the only thought

552
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,692
that's kept me going
is the hot bath.

553
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,883
And now I have do my hair
and shave my legs.

554
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:17,551
So what do you want to do,
Lynette?

555
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:19,099
Just tell me what you want.

556
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:20,813
I told you what I want.

557
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,500
Hot bath, bed early,
but you chose not to listen.

558
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:28,853
Well, okay, I guess I can
just cancel the whole thing.

559
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:30,538
You can have your dream evening alone,

560
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:32,599
And I'll get up
a poker game or something.

561
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:33,867
Thank you.

562
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:39,338
Hey. You know what? I've been
dragging my ass all day, too,

563
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:40,950
and you know
what got me through it?

564
00:28:41,028 --> 00:28:43,300
The idea of doing
something special with you.

565
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,700
Happy anniversary.

566
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,400
All right.
I'm off to join your mother.

567
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:58,502
The hotel number's on the fridge
in case there's a problem.

568
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,722
Bree said her cell phone
isn't getting good reception.

569
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:04,399
Uh, actually, we kinda
already have a problem.

570
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:06,025
Well, I'm already late for my flight.

571
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,099
Can this wait a few weeks
till we're back?

572
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:10,599
- Yeah, this could wait a few weeks.
- Oh, good.

573
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:13,200
I mean, heck, this particular
problem could wait...

574
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:14,951
nine months.

575
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,311
Good lord.

576
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:23,299
How was your bath?

577
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,538
Oh, I couldn't relax.

578
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:28,399
I just kept replaying the fight
I had with tom in my head.

579
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,700
Well, at least your husband
tries to be romantic.

580
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:33,699
Every anniversary,
gilbert bought me an appliance.

581
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:36,000
The last one,
he gave me a vacuum cleaner.

582
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:38,100
He died two weeks lar.

583
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:39,900
I didn't cry.

584
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:46,300
Who could that be? Here.

585
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:51,345
All right.
Here's what we're thinking.

586
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,261
Clearly, the idea of the two of you
getting married is ridiculous.

587
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,899
So what do you want me to do?

588
00:29:58,124 --> 00:29:59,400
Glad you asked.

589
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,999
Bree and I have decided

590
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:04,800
That danielle will join us
on our heymoon.

591
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:06,899
When we return, we'll tell our friends

592
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,679
She's decided to study abroad.

593
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:11,700
Once the baby is born
and adopted by a suitable family,

594
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:12,900
she'll come home.

595
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:17,305
What about me?

596
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:18,600
You leave.

597
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:19,899
Leave?

598
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,200
Get out of fairview
and don't tell a soul why,

599
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:24,344
- Not even your aunt.
- I can't do that.

600
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:26,455
- Why not?
- Because I've got responsibilities.

601
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,111
- People are counting on me.
- You should have thought of that

602
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,929
before you impregnated
my step daughter.

603
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:34,533
- I said I'm not leaving!
- Oh, easy there, turbo.

604
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:36,900
Uh... We'll be right back.

605
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,399
So who exactly is counting on you?

606
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,901
Hmm? Julie Mayer, maybe?

607
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,393
She gave me another chance.

608
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:51,545
I can't leave if I've still
got a shot with her.

609
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:53,445
And what's gonna happen
When julie finds out

610
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,721
you knocked up my sister?
Didn't your stepdad just say

611
00:30:55,818 --> 00:30:57,967
No one's gonna find out about that?

612
00:30:58,953 --> 00:30:59,972
Okay.

613
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:01,891
Try this.

614
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:03,800
Julie's a nice girl,

615
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:05,734
and you, well...

616
00:31:07,504 --> 00:31:08,600
you're a dog.

617
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:14,100
No knock.

618
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm a dog lover myself,

619
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:19,500
but julie deserves better.

620
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:22,400
You know you'll just end up
cheating on her.

621
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,300
No, I won't hurt her again.

622
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:27,200
Sure you will.

623
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:30,500
Not right away.

624
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,800
Maybe you'll hold out for six months,

625
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:35,900
But then it'll hurt her even more.

626
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,065
Am I wrong?

627
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:42,700
You just have to ask yourself

628
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:45,943
If you can be the kind of guy
she needs you to be.

629
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:47,772
If you can't...

630
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:50,328
walk away.

631
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,499
Beer is on the house, guys.

632
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:02,800
Drink fast, get stupid, lose money.

633
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,287
Mike!

634
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:06,300
How's it going, buddy?

635
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:08,899
Hey, you know, uh, Orson, right?

636
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,135
Oh, yeah.

637
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Hey, neighbor.

638
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:12,622
Hey, so let's get started, huh?

639
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:14,661
5-Card stud? $2 ante?

640
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,099
Good evening, gentlemen.

641
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:18,276
Ian!

642
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:21,000
Hey... Ian.

643
00:32:21,554 --> 00:32:22,900
Nice to see you, Mike.

644
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:29,200
What is "fish and chips" doing here?

645
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,399
Susan asked me to include him.

646
00:32:31,462 --> 00:32:33,533
Said he always wanted
to learn how to play poker.

647
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:36,446
So we're going to give him
some very expensive lessons.

648
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,800
Be careful.
He already knows how to bluff.

649
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:46,593
Hey.

650
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,899
Hey. How's it going?

651
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:50,900
Good. Good, uh...

652
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:54,400
Just wanted to tell you, I have
to leave town for a while.

653
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,800
Really?
Is something wrong?

654
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,400
No, no, no.
It's just family stuff.

655
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:04,400
I don't know exactly
when I'll be back.

656
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,100
It could be a while, though.

657
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,836
Okay.

658
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,700
I just want you to know that...

659
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,200
it means a lot that you were willing
to give me a second chance.

660
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,988
You're, like, the only person
that's ever done that.

661
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,400
Austin... what's going on?

662
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:30,800
Nothing, uh, it's just...

663
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:33,300
I have to go.

664
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,416
Good bye, Julie.

665
00:33:40,695 --> 00:33:41,755
Austin!

666
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,600
I'll raise you.

667
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,700
Mm. Out.

668
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,226
Ah, another courageous move
for "foldilocks."

669
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:16,200
All right. I'll call you.

670
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,000
Flush, king high.

671
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:23,299
Full house, 7s and knaves.

672
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,399
Jacks. We call them jacks.

673
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,203
Boy, this is your lucky room.

674
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:31,499
Yes, I heard about
your engagement the other night.

675
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:32,600
Congratulations.

676
00:34:33,058 --> 00:34:35,300
Yeah, about that, Ian,

677
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:38,315
Was that, uh, proposal spontaneous,

678
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:39,699
Or did you have it all planned?

679
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,401
Oh, it was entirely planned.

680
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,599
I thought it would be
the ideal occasion.

681
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,000
Wow. Well, if it was planned,
why didn't you have a ring?

682
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,000
Well, I thought Susan might like
to choose the ring herself.

683
00:34:50,494 --> 00:34:51,599
Ante up, boys.

684
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,400
So why'd she pick a ring
that was too big for her?

685
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,300
How did you know that?

686
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,236
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
we came here to play cards.

687
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:02,635
Why are we talking about jewelry?

688
00:35:02,636 --> 00:35:04,299
Sorry, Tom, but I just found out

689
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,400
I bought a ring for Susan myself.

690
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,500
It was in my pocket that night

691
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:10,200
some son of a bitch ran me over.

692
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:13,681
Hey, Tom's right.
We should focus on the game.

693
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,800
After our talk, I called the hospital.

694
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:20,445
They said my ring got in
with your wife's stuff.

695
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:21,941
So you saw it before I did...

696
00:35:22,258 --> 00:35:25,100
the same day you proposed to Susan.

697
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,199
And your point is?

698
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:30,300
That that's why you were
in such a big hurry.

699
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:31,880
You wanted to seal the deal

700
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:34,900
before I found out
about the ring and told her.

701
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:38,200
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

702
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,700
Maybe you should be.

703
00:35:40,494 --> 00:35:41,961
What do you think Susan would say

704
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:45,000
If she found out why your
proposal was so spontaneous?

705
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,700
Guys, can we just play?

706
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:49,400
I'm trying.

707
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,122
Fine.

708
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,564
Deal.

709
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:03,899
Hello?

710
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,926
<i>Mr. Scavo,</i>

711
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,599
It's Lamar,
from the limo service.

712
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:08,399
Uh, I got a flat,

713
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:10,699
So I might be late picking up
you and your wife.

714
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:12,800
What are you talking about?
I-I-I canceled you.

715
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,004
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. I left you a message.

716
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:17,300
Oh, I must have missed it.

717
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:20,300
Anyway, I dropped your wife off,
right where you told me.

718
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:21,966
Oh, God. When?

719
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:23,194
About two hours ago.

720
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,300
Guys, um, lock up when you're done.

721
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:37,787
I'll open.

722
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:40,861
I'm out.

723
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,300
And I'll raise you.

724
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:48,499
You want a beer?

725
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:51,100
Hell, tom's gone.
Let's go open up the good stuff.

726
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,869
Well...

727
00:36:57,034 --> 00:36:58,721
looks like
it's just you and me,

728
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,900
If you're still in.

729
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:04,300
With this hand?
You bet I am.

730
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:08,400
I'll re-Raise.

731
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:17,100
And raise again.

732
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:22,700
Your stack's looking kinda small.

733
00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:33,300
Will you take a check?

734
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:36,351
You know I can't match that.

735
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,000
How about this, then?

736
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:41,015
You win, you keep the money,

737
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,800
and you tell Susan whatever you want.

738
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,699
I win, you keep your mouth shut
about the ring,

739
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,600
and you leave me and Susan alone.

740
00:38:02,306 --> 00:38:03,322
Deal.

741
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:19,000
How was the game?

742
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:21,610
I won.

743
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,400
Lynette, I am so sorry.
I am so sorry!

744
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,679
You see, there was supposed to
be a horse-Drawn carriage and...

745
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:44,200
Oh, good. You got the flowers.

746
00:38:57,777 --> 00:38:58,799
Coffee?

747
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:00,124
Yes, please.

748
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,700
Yeah, she...
She likes coffee, too. Thanks.

749
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,856
I'm really really really
sorry...

750
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:12,066
Please stop apologizing.

751
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:14,029
I appreciate what
you were trying to do.

752
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,246
It was a lovely though

753
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:18,400
that just went hideously,
hideously, hideously wrong.

754
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,469
Wait till the kids find out
that you saw a real coyote.

755
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:24,610
Hideously.

756
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,600
Well, I learned my lesson.

757
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:32,699
Never again. No more surprises.

758
00:39:32,846 --> 00:39:35,221
From now on, I'll do
exactly what you say.

759
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,000
Oh, don't. You... dare.

760
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,122
What?

761
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:47,899
I had a lot of time to think tonight,

762
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:50,100
And I realized you were right.

763
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:53,200
We have to keep the romance going,

764
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:55,700
No matter how tired we are.

765
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:58,912
The only thing worse than

766
00:39:59,276 --> 00:40:01,519
just going through the motions is not

767
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:04,173
 bothering to go through the motions.

768
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:08,201
So you want me
to surprise you next year?

769
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:10,800
Knock yourself out.

770
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,385
Just wait, 'cause I will think
of something even better.

771
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,212
Well, after this year,

772
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:21,279
I would be happy with any date that
include food and shelter.

773
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,232
Nine years.

774
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:41,200
Nine years...

775
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,800
and I have loved every minute of it.

776
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:48,545
Me, too.

777
00:40:57,432 --> 00:41:00,100
<i>Take a drive
down any street in suburbia.</i>

778
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:02,003
<i>Know what you're gonna see?</i>

779
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:06,700
<i>A bunch of guys wearing
the same expression.</i>

780
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:10,000
<i>It's a look that says,</i>

781
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,800
<i>"Oh, crap.</i>

782
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:14,800
<i>My dreams are never
gonna come true."</i>

783
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:21,300
<i>"I'll never have a life
free from scandal."</i>

784
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:26,000
<i>"I'll never have
a son of my own."</i>

785
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:31,100
<i>"I'll never hold her
in my arms again."</i>

786
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,800
<i>"I'll never get to tell her
how I feel."</i>

787
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,100
<i>Yeah, the suburbs are filled with
a lot of men who've given up hope.</i>

788
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,599
<i>Of course, every once in a while,
you do come across</i>

789
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:54,200
<i>some lucky SOB whose dreams
are all come true.</i>

790
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:57,900
<i>You know you spot that?</i>

791
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:02,200
<i>They're the ones who can't stop smiling.</i>

792
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:07,100
<i>Don't you just hate those guys?</i>

793
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:10,084
