1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,500
Eli scruggs

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,400
Was the handiest
Of all handymen.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
You could ask Any of his customers,
And they would tell you,

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,200
There was nothing He couldn't fix.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,700
Whether it was a broken vase...

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,600
A leaky pipe...

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,300
Or a shaky banister,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Eli always knew How
to get the job done.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,800
But sadly,

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,200
The man who had fixed So many things
For the residents Of wisteria lane

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Was now about To break the hearts.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,100
Eli scruggs,
Get down from there!

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,000
Mrs. Mccluskey.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,500
Just found this note
In my mailbox.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Says you're retiring?
What the hell?

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,500
Yes, ma'am. It's true.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,600
Now why would you want to do
Something stupid like that?

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,000
My doc says I got a bum ticker,

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,800
Have to take it
easy From now on.

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,500
Well, once i'm done fixing
Mrs. Mayer's shingle

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,400
I'm on a plane to waikiki.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
Well, this is very annoying.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Who's gonna fix my water
heater When it breaks?

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,100
Oh, i met this young
guy Named toby.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,400
Very bright, just turned 30.
He'll take care of you.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,100
Ah, damn it, eli!

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,700
I am not comfortable
With strangers in my house.

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,300
Took me ten years To trust you.

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,500
I know.

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Most of those guys leave tools
And nails all over the place.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
You never leave a mess.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Thank you, ma'am.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,800
Have you told everyone
else You're leaving?

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I left copies of that same
note In everybody's mailbox.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,700
Well, that's not right.

36
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,100
After all these years, people
Will want to say good-Bye, And...

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
you know, maybe throw
you A party or somethin'.

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,100
Oh, no. I prefer to go quietly,
If you know what i mean.

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,200
I don't want a big fuss.

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
Well, i'll miss you, eli.

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,100
There will never be
Another one like you.

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,300
With that eli scruggs Climbed
his ladder For the very last time.

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,800
And once he had finished
Making his last repair,

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,100
Eli scruggs--
Quietly, with no fuss--

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,300
Had a heart attack and died.

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
And most importantly...

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Without leaving a mess.

48

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,800
It took an hour For
someone to finally notice

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,300
The body laying atop
Susan mayer's roof.

53
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,500
Aah!

54
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,200
It was Less than ten minutes later
That the neighbors Began arriving,

55
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,700
Each determined to get a look At
the various paramedics And policemen

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,400
Who were all frantically
Trying to figure out Exactly 

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
how To bring the body down.

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,200
And it took two days
For my friends to realize

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
This tragedy Had affected them...

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,600
We're ready! Come on.

61
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,200
More than They were
willing to admit.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Hey, gaby, did you
remember To get change?

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
'Cause when i cash in my chips,

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,500
I don't want to hear you say,
"All i've got is $50s."

65
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,200
Speaking of Cashing in your chips,
Anyone know When eli's funeral is?

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,500
Oh, i think it's saturday.

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
I wonder how many people
Are gonna show up.

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,900
Mrs. Mccluskey was saying
He didn't have much family.

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,600
Poor eli. We should make sure
He's got flowers at his funeral.

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm in. How much
are we talking?

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,500
I don't know. What
do you think, gaby?

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,100

These aren't even
In the states yet.

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,700
What's the catch?

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What are you talking about?

78
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,100
You never buy me a present
Unless i'm mad Or about to be mad.

79
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,000
And i don't think i am,

80
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,300

You just got home!

84
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,600
With shoes.

85
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,100
Don't leave me here.
I'm going out of my mind.

86
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Everyone is so boring And suburban.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
And how many Freakin' honor
students N that school have?

88
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,800
Can we please not argue
In front of the handyman?

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,900
He has a name.

90
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,700

- Eli scruggs.

91
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,300

Fine. I'll give up my job...

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,500

Notthe jimmy choos.

96
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,900
They're the only friends I've got.

97
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Thought so.

98
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm going to pack.

99
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,800
You know, It's none
of my business...

100
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,200
You're right. It's not.

101
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,100

Are actually pretty nice.

124
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,600
True story.

By the way...

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,100
You made quite an impression
At the poker game.

157
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,400
Really?

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,600

Stop talking about you.

159
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,700
Aw. Well, i'm sure It was kind of exciting
For them to have a star In their midst.

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Uh, let me think...
Did they say "star"?

161
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,800
I heard, uh, "stuck-Up,"

162
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,900
"Obnoxious," "bitch."

163
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
What?!

164
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,500
You know, i went out on a limb
To get you into that game,

165
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,300
And then you go in there Acting
like You're better than they are.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,100
Oh, myclothessaid that, Not me.

167
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, did you ask them
anything About their lives?

168
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,700
Why would they want To
talk about their lives?

169
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,800
Their lives are boring.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,700
Well, you know what's
Gonna be really boring?

171
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,900
You sitting here alone in this
Big house without any friends.

172
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,600
If i were you, I'd
drop the attitude.

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
Learn to like Your neighbors.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Well, Thanks for the advice.
You wanna add that To your bill?

175
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
No. It's on the house.

176
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,000
I brought muffins.

177
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
That's so nice.

178
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,400
We were just...

179
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Playing poker,

180
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,100
And i wasn't invited.

181
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,300
I know. I get it.

182
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,500
I just wanted To
tell you guys I know 

183
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,600
i made A horrible first impression.

184
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Now you know why
Models don't usually talk.

185
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,700
Because we say a lot Of
stupid, patronizing things

186
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,200
That make people
Want to avoid us.

187
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,800
What i should've said was...

188
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,300
My husband's never home.

189
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
I miss the city.

190
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,700
I miss my life.

191
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm lonely all the time...

192
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,800
And i could Really
use some friends.

193
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Anyway, here.

194
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Now that's how You make an entrance.

195
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Gaby?

1
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,300
- I'M SORRY. WHAT?
- WE'RE GETTING A WREATH
FOR ELI'S FUNERAL. ARE YOU IN?

2
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,200
ACTUALLY, WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME PAY FOR IT?

3
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,400
IT CAN STILL BE FROM ALL OF US.

4
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,800
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

5
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I SORT OF DO.

6
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
NOW LET'S PLAY SOME POKER.

7
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,600
ALL RIGHT, TIME FOR MY LUCK TO CHANGE.

8
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,600
THIS HAND IS FOR ELI.

9
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,200
HMM. NEXTHAND IS FOR ELI.

10
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,100
YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A GET-TOGETHER AFTER THE FUNERAL, 

11
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
WE SHOULD START
THINKING ABOUT FOOD.

12
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,300
AND BY "WE" AND "FOOD,"
YOU MEAN BREE, RIGHT?

13
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
I THOUGHT THAT WAS CLEAR.

14
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,600
I'D BE HAPPY TO.
ANY SPECIAL REQUESTS?

15
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,300
HOW ABOUT WE PICK SOMETHING
FROM YOUR COOKBOOK?

16
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,100
GREAT. GABY,
DO YOU HAVE YOUR COPY?

17
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,200
I'LL GO GET IT.

18
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,600
YOU USE MY COOKBOOK
TO BALANCE YOUR TABLE?

19
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,100
OH, IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

20
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,000
JUANITA NEEDED
HER COLORING BOOK BACK.

21
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,400
OH.

22
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,800
ALL RIGHT.

23
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,500
- WATCH OUT, LADIES.
- ???

24
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,800
???

25
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,700
I'M SORRY IF THE FRITTATA
IS A BIT DRY.

26
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,300
ARE YOU KIDDING? IT'S GREAT.
YOU SHOULD GIVE LYNETTE THE RECIPE.

27
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,000
YES, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WOMEN
IN THEIR EIGHTH MONTH REALLY CRAVE-- 

28
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
MORE STOVE TIME.

29
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,000
MINE IS SO ERRATIC. I'M NOT EVEN
SURE WHAT THE REAL TEMPERATURE IS.

30
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,500
OF COURSE, IF A CERTAIN DOCTOR
WOULD LOOSEN THE PURSE STRINGS...

31
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,900
WE'RE NOT GETTING A NEW STOVE.

32
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,300
IF YOU WOULD JUST TAKE ON A FEW
MORE PIENTS, WE COULD AFFORD IT.

33
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
WELL, IF I'M NOT SUPPORTING YOU
ADEQUATELY, MY DEAR, BY ALL MEANS, 

34
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,600
FEEL FREE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

35
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,900
- SUCH AS?
- WELL, YOU COULD MAYBE... I DON'T KNOW, 

36
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,300
GET A JOB?

37
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
I HAVE A JOB.

38
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,600
I'M A HOMEMAKER.

39
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,400
AND A DAMN GOOD ONE.

40
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,400
SO TO MAKE THIS, YOU-- YOU JUST S-SAUT'
SOME HAM AND SOME ONIONS--

41
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,500
IT'S NOT HAPPENING, TOM.

42
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,400
I JUST SOMETIMES THINK MAYBE YOU WOULD
APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR MORE

43
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
IF YOU HAD TO WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME.

44
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,800
AND I THINK YOU WOULD APPRECIATE
MYVALUE MORE IF, FOR ONCE,

45
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,500
YOU HAD TO COOK YOUR OWN FOOD
AND WASH YOUR OWN CLOTHES.

46
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,400
LYNETTE MAKES ME
SEW MY OWN BUTTONS.

47
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,100
I'LL SEW ANYTHING YOU WANT 

48
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,300
IF YOU JUST STOP
GETTING ME PREGNANT.

49
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,600
I WANT A NEW STOVE, REX,

50
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,300
AND IF I NEED TO GET A JOB
TO PAY FOR IT, SO BE IT.

51
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,100
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A STOVE,

52
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
WE'VE GOT ONE THAT'S
HARDLY EVER BEEN USED.

53
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,200
I WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME FOR MY UTERUS.

54
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,300
OH, YEAH.IRUINED THE BRUNCH.

55
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,400
HEY, HOW'S IT LOOKING
UNDER THERE, ELI?

56
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,200
IS IT GONNA COST ME
AN ARM AND A LEG?

57
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,400
NAH. A FEW FINGERS, MAYBE.

58
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
HONEY, MY STOMACH'S GROWLING.

59
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,900
WHEN'S DINNER?

60
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,300
OH, WE'RE HAVING LEFTOVERS. YOU CAN
HEAT THEM UP YOURSELF IF YOU WANT.

61
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,000
SINCE WHEN DO WE HAVE LEFTOVERS?

62
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
SINCE I STARTED WRITING
MY OWN COOKBOOK.

63
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,800
REMEMBER HOW YOU TOLD ME I SHOULD
START MAKING MY OWN MONEY?

64
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,000
WELL, I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
ALL MY OLD RECIPES,

65
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,900
AND I'VE GOT THIS GREAT IDEA FOR
A REAL HOME-STYLE AMERICAN COOKBOOK.

66
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,400
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS?

67
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,400
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

68
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,600
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS COMPLIMENTING
ME ON MY COOKING.

69
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,200
YOU'RE GREAT, BUT COME ON. 

70
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,000
EVERY BORED HOUSEWIFE WHO PULLS OFF A DECENT
LASAGNA THINKS SHE CAN WRITE A COOKBOOK.

71
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,300
YOU THINK I'M JUST LIKE
EVERY OTHER HOUSEWIFE?

72
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,900
NO. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M SAYING. IT'S JUST THAT...

73
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,800
WHAT DO YOU REALLY KNOW
ABOUT WRITING?

74
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
I'LL LEARN. 

75
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,000
AND I WANT IT TO BE
MORE THAN JUST A COOKBOOK.

76
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
TRADITIONAL VALUES

77
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,100
AND GIVE HELPFUL HINTS
ABOUT HOMEMAKING.

78
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
LOOK, LOOK, THIS IS MY FAULT.

79
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,300
YOU KNOW, I-I WAS RIBBING YOU
THE OTHER DAY ABOUT GETTING A JOB,

80
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,000
BUT YOU TOOK IT SERIOUSLY.

81
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,300
IF YOU REALLY WANT A NEW STOVE,
I'LL GET YOU A STOVE.

82
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,000
NOW CAN YOU STOP
THIS FOOLISHNESS AND 

83
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,800
MAKE ME SOMETHING TO EAT
THAT ISN'T LEFTOVERS?

84
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,700
MRS. VAN DE KAMP?

85
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,700
I FIXED YOUR BANISTER.
SHOULD BE FINE NOW.

86
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,300
I'LL JUST GO.
YOU CAN PAY ME WHENEVER.

87
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,300
I KNOW THIS IS
A ROUGH TIME FOR YOU.

88
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,200
THANKS, ELI.

89
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,400
BY THE WAY,

90
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,400
THE SERVICE FOR MR. V.
WAS REALLY NICE.

91
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,500
YOU WERE THERE?

92
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,100
Yeah, I SAT IN THE BACK OF THE CHURCH.

93
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,000
I WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MR. V.

94
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
SO, UH...

95
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,000
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO NOW?

96
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,700
YOU MEAN, WITH MY LIFE?

97
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,800
I DON'T KNOW.

98
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,900
MRS. V...

99
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,600
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GIVE THIS
TO YOU FOR A WHILE NOW... BUT I, UH,

100
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,700
COULD NEVER FIND
THE RIGHT MOMENT.

101
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,300
I KEPT IT FOR YOU, JUST IN CASE
YOU MIGHT NEED IT SOMEDAY.

102
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,900
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

103
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,300
OH, I GOTTA TELL YOU.
I MADE YOUR CAJUN MEATLOAF.

104
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,300
WHOO! THAT MAY BE
MY FAVORITE MEAL EVER.

105
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAVED THIS.

106
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,700
AH.

107
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,000
OF COURSE, I'M NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD
TO WRITE A COOKBOOK RIGHT NOW.

108
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
WELL...

109
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,300
MAYBE ONE DAY YOU WILL BE.

110
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
HEY, BREE, I KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN MAKE FOR THE WAKE--

111
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,800
THAT FLAKY-BREADED-SHRIMP THING.

112
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,700
THANKS, BUT I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA MAKE.

113
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,500
DAVE, IT WAS A NICE TRIP,
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,

114
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,300
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE SPENT ALL
THAT MONEY GOING TO THE BAHAMAS.

115
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,900
IF WE'RE NOT GONNA
LEAVE THE HOTEL ROOM,

116
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,700
THEN WHY NOT JUST COVER OURSELVES
IN SUNTAN LOTION AND HAVE SEX HERE?

117
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
YOU JUST GOT A MESSAGE
FROM MRS. McCLUSKEY.

118
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,400
OH?

119
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,000
SHE SAID YOUR HANDYMAN DIED.

120
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
ELI?

121
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,200
OH, MY GOD.

122
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,200
HE WAS WORKING ON SUSAN'S ROOF
AND DROPPED DEAD OF A HEART ATTACK.

123
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

124
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,700
NO, NO, NO. YOU ARENOT
GOING TO THE GYM AGAIN.

125
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
YOU SAID WE WERE GONNA
HAVE AFTERNOON SEX.

126
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,800
WE'LL DO IT WHEN I GET BACK.

127
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,900
YOU SAY THATEVERYTIME, UMBERTO,
AND THEN YOU'RE TOO TIRED.

128
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,300
MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE
IF YOU WEREN'T SO CLINGY.

129
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,500
CLINGY?

130
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,900
WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX
IN TWO WEEKS.

131
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,200
IT'S LIKE I'M 15 AGAIN.

132
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,600
WHAT'S WRONG WITH US?

133
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,500
NOT US.YOU.

134
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,900
YOUR LIBIDO IS OUT OF CONTROL.

135
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,800
- UMBERTO--
- LOOK, YOU'VE GOT
A DRAWERFUL OF TOYS. 

136
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,400
USE 'EM.

137
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,500
OH!

138
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,900
- AHEM.
- OH!

139
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
OH! ELI! I --

140
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
I FORGOT YOU WERE IN THERE.

141
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,000
YEAH. I'M DONE FIXING YOUR FAUCET.

142
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,000
ACTUALLY, I WAS DONE TEN MINUTES AGO,
BUT I WAS AFRAID TO COME OUT.

143
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,900
I'M SORRY YOU HEARD ALL OF THAT.

144
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,900
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

145
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,300
WHILE I WAS IN THERE,
I RE-GROUTED YOUR TUB...

146
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
FREE OF CHARGE.

147
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
WAIT A SECOND.

148
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,200
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY ASS?

149
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,800
SORRY?

150
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,400
MY ASS-- ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN.

151
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,000
WELL, I-I-I, UH...

152
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,000
TICKTOCK.

153
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,200
TEN. IT'S A TEN.

154
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
AND THE BOOBS?

155
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,600
PERKY AND FIRM?

156
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,400
YOU'VE NAMED THEM?

157
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,600
OH, COME ON, ELI. MY HUSBAND
WON'T HAVE SEX WITH ME.

158
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,300
I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE
IT'S NOT... ME.

159
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
IT'S NOT YOU.

160
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,600
ARE YOU SURE?

161
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,000
TRUST ME. I USED TO
WORK IN CONSTRUCTION.

162
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,000
MY BUDDIES WOULD'VE
GONE CRAZY FOR YOU--

163
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,000
CATCALLS, UH,
NASTY GESTURES.

164
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
"HEY, YOU, WITH THE SWEATER MEATS!

165
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,200
"IF YOU EVER NEED
ANY WORK DONE, CALL ME!

166
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,100
'CAUSE I GOT THE PERFECT
TOOL FOR THE JOB!"

167
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Y- YOU GET THE DRIFT.

168
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,900
YEAH. I DO.

169
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,700
THAT WAS INSULTING AND DEMEANING.

170
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
OH.

171
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,500
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

172
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,200
MISS BRITT?

173
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,200
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN.

174
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,000
I GOT THE PAINT.
YOU WANT TO CHECK THE COLOR?

175
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,300
EH.

176
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,100
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

177
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
THINGS ARE GREAT.

178
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,500
YOU WANT SOME WINE?

179
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,300
WE'RE CELEBRATING.

180
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,400
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

181
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
I AM NO LONGER MARRIED
TO A GAY GUY.

182
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,600
UMBERTO WAS GAY?

183
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,500
SO YOU WASTED YOUR TIME INSTALLING
THAT LIGHT IN THE CLOSET, BECAUSE...

184
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,400
HE WENT FLYING OUT OF THERE.

185
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,200
AT LEAST YOU KNOW NOW
IT WASN'T YOU.

186
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,800
WASN'T IT?

187
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,000
HE SAID THAT BEING
MARRIED TO ME WAS WHAT 

188
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,900
CONVINCED HIM THAT HE LIKED MEN.

189
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,000
YOU COULD IMAGINE WHAT A BOOST
TO THE EGO THAT WAS.

190
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,800
COME ON.

191
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
YOU HAD A GAY GUY SLEEPING
WITH YOU FOR TWO YEARS,

192
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,200
AND THOSE GUYS ARE
PRETTY HARD TO LAND.

193
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,400
NO. NO, TRUST ME.

2
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,800
NO NEED TO BE SAD.

3
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
YOU'RE A KNOCKOUT.

4
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,800
NO, I-I-I NEED THIS HAND BACK.

5
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,400
IT'S HARD TO BE A HANDYMAN
WITHOUT A-A HAND.

6
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
MISS BRITT,

7
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

8
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,700
YOU PUT THE MIRROR OVER MY BED.

9
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,700
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

10
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,400
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

11
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,600
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

12
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
OH,

13
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE GENTLE.

14
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,100
ANYWAY,

15
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,700
I GUESS THEY'RE
BURYING HIM ON SATURDAY.

16
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,200
OBVIOUSLY, YOU WANT TO GO.

17
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,300
YEAH.

18
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,500
I DO.

19
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,600
OH, LEAVE THAT BLACK DRESS OUT.

20
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,700
I'LL GET IT DRY-CLEANED
FOR THE FUNERAL.

21
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,000
A LITTLE SEXY FOR A FUNERAL, ISN'T IT?

22
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,500
OH, I DON'T THINK ELI WOULD MIND.

23
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,700
MOM?

24
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,300
THAT'S PENNY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

25
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,700
MOM!

26
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,900
HEY, SWEETIE.

27
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,000
WHAT'S UP?

28
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,100
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
HELP ME WITH MY MATH.

29
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,700
WE'RE DIVIDING FRACTIONS.

30
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,300
OH. I WISH YOU'D CAUGHT ME
TWO CHARDONNAYS AGO.

31
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,600
MOM, YOU PROMISED.

32
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,200
I KNOW, BUT MOMMY'S
STILL PLANNING ELI'S MEMORIAL.

33
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,500
START WITHOUT ME.

34
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,700
I'LL BE THERE IN A LITTLE WHILE.

35
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
OH, MY GOSH. LYNETTE, ARE YOU OKAY?

36
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,400
THE DOCTOR JUST CALLED. I'M PREGNANT.

37
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,900
THIS IS FANTASTIC!

38
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,200
- YOU--
- YEAH. WHOOP-DEE-DOO.

39
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,300
HONEY, YOU DON'T SOUND
TOO HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

40
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,000
I WAS PLANNING TO GO BACK TO WORK.

41
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,500
WHAT? WHAT A--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

42
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,800
I HAD IT IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND FOR A WHILE,

43
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,500
AND THEN YESTERDAY, I GOT A PH--

44
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,400
HOLD IT.

45
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,700
SORRY. I WAS HAVING TROUBLE
ATPAYING ATTENTION.

46
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,900
JEFFREY CUEVAS IS RETIRING IN SEPTEMBER.

47
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,600
I AM THE PERFECT PERSON
TO STEP INTO HIS JOB,

48
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,500
AND THAT IS EXACTLY
WHEN PARKER STARTS KINDERGARTEN.

49
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,900
THE TIMING IS LIKE A DREAM.

50
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,300
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR DREAM
OF HAVING A-A LITTLE GIRL?

51
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,800
THIS COULD BE OUR CHANCE.

52
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,100
OH, PLEASE.

53
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,100
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE A BOY.
IT'S ALWAYS A BOY.

54
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,100
IT'S JUST GONNA PEE IN MY FACE
AND HIDE DEAD THINGS IN MY SHOES.

55
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,000
I AM DOING THIS, TOM.
I AM GOING AFTER THIS JOB.

56
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
BUT WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS?

57
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,000
WELL, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
CUT BACK ON YOUR HOURS AT WORK.

58
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
I CAN'T DO THAT.

59
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,600
I HAVE A CAREER.

60
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT.

61
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,200
NO, I-I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T.

62
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,400
TOM,

63
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I CANNOT JUST STAY AT HOME
WIPING NOSES.

64
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,700
I NEED IT FOR MY SANITY,

65
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,800
AND I NEED YOU TO BACK ME UP.

66
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,200
OH!

67
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,600
MOM?

68
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,900
WELL, THE KIDS ARE UP.

69
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,900
THEY'RE GONNA WANT THEIR BREAKFAST.

70
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,300
AND I'M GONNA BACK YOU UP
BY, UH, MAKING IT FOR 'EM.

71
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
MY HERO.

72
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,100
JEFF CUEVAS IS FANTASTIC,

73
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,500
BUT I KNOW I COULD TAKE HIS
DEPARTMENT TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

74
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,000
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

75
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,100
OH, MY WATER BROKE.

76
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
TAKE THE OVERNIGHT BAG OUT TO THE CAR.

77
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,500
OH, THREE WEEKS. THAT'S A LITTLE SOON,

78
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,700
BUT, UH, SURE, I COULD MAKE THAT WORK.

79
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,100
FOR GOD SAKES, LYNETTE,
WE GOTTA GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

80
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,100
IN A MINUTE.
I'M TRYING TO LOCK THIS JOB DOWN.

81
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,600
WHAT KIND OF PERKS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

82
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,000
OKAY, YOU'RE HAVING CONTRACTIONS.
THAT'S IT. YOU--

83
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,200
I SWEAR, IF YOU TOUCH THIS PHONE,

84
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,100
I WILL HAVE THIS BABY RIGHT HERE
AND THEN BEAT YOU WITH IT!

85
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
YOU'RE INSANE.

86
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,500
WE HAVE TO GO.

87
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,900
COULD YOU HOLD ON ONE SECOND?

88
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
WE AGREED

89
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
I COULD GO BACK TO WORK
AFTER I GAVE BIRTH.

90
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,500
AFTER, LYNETTE, NOT DURING!

91
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,200
I'M SORRY.

92
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,600
IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD FINISH
THIS CONVERSATION TOMORROW?

93
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,600
OH!

94
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,200
L- L-LATER IN THE DAY
WORKS BETTER FOR ME, TOO.

95
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,500
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

96
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,500
BYE.

97
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
HEY. WHEW! I GOT THE JOB

98
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
CONGRATULATIONS.

99
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,300
THE BABY'S ARM IS STICKING OUT.
WHY DON'T YOU HIGH-FIVE IT?

100
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
TOM, I AM IN PAIN. DO YOU MIND?

101
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,700
OH.

102
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,300
YOU'LL SEE, TOM.

103
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,500
I KNOW.

104
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,100
PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU... OOH!

105
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,800
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL,

106
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,300
BUT I KNOW WE CAN.

107
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,000
OH, MR. SWENSON,
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM.

108
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,300
MAYBE YOU COULD
SCHEDULE A STAFF MEETING

109
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
SO I COULD HIT THE GROUND
RUNNING ON MONDAY.

110
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,100
NO, NO.

111
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,600
NO, IT CAN'T BE FRIDAY,

112
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,300
BECAUSE, REMEMBER, WE AGREED
THAT WE WOULD START NEXT WEEK?

113
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,800
SO AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

114
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,200
- MRS. SCAVO?
- YEAH?

115
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,200
I THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHIN'.

116
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,300
COULD YOU HOLD ON A SECOND?

117
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,900
OH, MY GOD.

118
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,600
OH, MY GOD.

119
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,100
I WAS ON THE PHONE.

120
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,000
I WAS TALKING TO
MY NEW BOSS, AND I...

121
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
SHE WAS ONLY IN THERE FOR A MINUTE.

122
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,800
BUT IT'S 85 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

123
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,500
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

124
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,600
YOU GOT A LOT ON YOUR MIND--

125
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,700
THREE KIDS AND A NEWBORN,

126
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,200
IT SOUNDS LIKE A NEW JOB.

127
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,700
YEAH, I DO.

128
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,300
YEAH. IT'S A LOT TO HANDLE.

129
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,800
THERE YOU GO.

130
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,000
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK
TO SUSAN'S WINDOWS.

131
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,300
UH, YOU TAKE CARE.

132
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,200
Lynette, are you still there?

133
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,400
Lynette?

134
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Hello?

135
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,800
Are you still there?

136
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,700
HEY. YOU COMING BACK IN?

137
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
NO.

138
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,000
I'M GONNA GO HELP MY DAUGHTER
WITH HER HOMEWORK.

139
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,100
HEY, PENNY! WAIT UP!

140
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,300
YARD SALE!

141
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
OH! GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.

142
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,000
HOW ARE YOU, ELI?

143
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,500
FINE. YOU?

144
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,300
GREAT.

145
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
YEAH, I HAVEN'T WORN
THESE JEANS IN A WHILE,

146
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,700
AND I FOUND 20 BUCKS
IN THE POCKET.

147
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,400
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE WHEN THAT HAPPENS?

148
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,900
ALSO, KARL LEFT ME FOR HIS SECRETARY,

149
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,400
SO I NEED YOU TO CHANGE THESE LOCKS.

150
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,200
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

151
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,800
OH, THANKS, BUT DON'T BE.
JUST HURRY.

152
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,300
KARL SAID HE WAS COMING BY
TO GET SOME OF HIS STUFF,

153
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,600
AND I WANT THIS PLACE
TO BE A FORTRESS BY THEN.

154
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,300
YOU'RE DOING ALL RIGHT, THOUGH?

155
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,000
OH, WELL, ON ONE HAND,

156
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,500
I GOT DUMPED FOR A PAIR
OF HEADLIGHTS NAMED BRANDY.

157
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,200
ON THE OTHER, I REPORTED
KARL'S CREDIT CARDS STOLEN,

158
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,900
AND I CUT THE POCKETS
OUT OF ALL OF HIS PANTS.

159
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,800
SO A LITTLE FROM COLUMN "A,"
A LITTLE FROM COLUMN "B."

160
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,800
OH.

161
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,000
SORRY.

162
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,800
WELL, IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
REDHEADS ARE NUTS.

163
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

164
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
THAT SHE'LL MAKE HIS LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

165
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,400
IT SOUNDS LIKE WH HE DESERVES.

166
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
BRANDY'S NOT A REDHEAD.
SHE'S BLONDE.

167
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
SO, UH, YOU MAYBE WANT TO GO
WITH A DEAD BOLT THIS TIME?

168
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,700
WHAT... DO... YOU... KNOW?

169
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,600
I SAW HIM AROUND TOWN
A COUPLE TIMES WITH A REDHEAD.

170
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
UH, PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WERE TALKING.

171
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,700
I- I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

172
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,100
I DIDN'T.

173
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,300
WOULD YOU FEEL ANY BETTER
KNOWING THAT, UH,

174
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,800
SHE'S KINDA CHUBBY?

175
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,000
JUST LEAVE!

176
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,000
BUT WHAT-- BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LOCKS?

177
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,700
I- I-IF KARL'S COMING...

178
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,000
CHANGE THE LOCKS, THEN LEAVE.

179
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,300
OKAY,

180
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,000
BUT I REALLY AM SORRY--

181
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,300
CHANGE THE LOCKS,
DON'T TALK TO ME, THEN LEAVE.

182
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,800
SUSAN?

183
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,600
SUSAN, DID YOU CALL ME?

184
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,300
I COULDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE MESSAGE.

185
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,600
OH, WOW.

186
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,600
YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK LATER?

187
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,200
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

188
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,000
NO. OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.

189
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I HEARD YOU AND MIKE
ARE GETTING DIVORCED.

190
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,300
I'M SORRY.

191
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,300
PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR,

192
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,500
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GREAT COUPLE.

193
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,700
THANKS.

194
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,000
SWEET.

195
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,400
DO YOU-- MAYBE YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU WTED ME TO DO?

196
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,600
LOCKS.

197
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,300
CHANGE THE LOCKS. GOT IT.

198
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,300
LET ME GO SEE
WHAT I GOT OUT IN THE TRUCK.

199
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
SUSAN...

200
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,500
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT LOVE.

201
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,700
I... I DABBLED IN IT ONCE OR TWICE,

202
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,200
BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMED
MORE TROUBLE THAN IT WAS WORTH.

203
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,700
I TOLD MYSELF I WASN'T MISSING MUCH.

204
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,300
BUT WATCHING YOU

205
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,200
ALL THESE YEARS,

206
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,100
HOW...

207
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
HOW HARD YOU'VE TRIED, HOW...

208
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,500
HOW HURT YOU'VE BEEN,

209
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,300
BUT YOU STILL...

210
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,000
KEEP GETTING BACK UP,
YOU DUST YOURSELF OFF,

211
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,100
THEN YOU TRY AGAIN.

212
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,700
MAYBE IAM...

213
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,600
MISSING SOMETHING. MAYBE...

214
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,800
MAYBE IT IS WORTH IT.

215
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,000
AND, UM,

216
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,400
I'M SURE IT'S NOT GONNA

217
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,400
HELP FOR YOU TO HEAR ME
TELL YOU THIS,

218
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,000
BUT YOU'RE DAMN HEROIC TO ME.

219
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,100
YOUARE.

220
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
YEAH.

221
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,500
HEY. JUST DROPPING THESE OFF.

222
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,000
I FINALLY GOT 'EM CUT.

223
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,400
TELL JACKSON I'M SORRY
IT TOOK ME SO LONG.

224
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,200
ACTUALLY, UM...

225
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,500
JACKSON AND I SPLIT UP.

226
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,200
WOW. I'M SORRY.

227
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,700
AM I SORRY?

228
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,700
OH, YEAH.

229
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,100
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

230
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,100
I JUST, UH, WANT TO
BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

231
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,900
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

232
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
OH, HEY.

233
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,400
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,

234
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,600
I THINK THERE'S
A LOOSE SHINGLE ON MY ROOF.

235
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,500
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU COULD FIX IT FOR ME?

236
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,600
OH, I'D BE HAPPY TO.

237
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,800
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

238
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,100
IT'LL BE THE LAST THING
I EVER FIX FOR YOU.

239
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,700
I'M RETIRING.

240
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,200
WHAT?

241
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,800
TODAY'S MY LAST DAY.

242
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,500
YOU CAN'T RETIRE.

243
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,900
I BREAK TOO MANY THINGS.

244
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,900
I KNOW. YOU PAID FOR THE TRIP
TO HAWAII I'M GONNA TAKE.

245
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,500
NO, IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE.

246
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,500
BE HAPPY FOR ME.

247
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,000
HEY, I AM HAPPY FOR YOU.

248
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,400
IT'S JUST, UH...

249
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,500
THIS IS GONNA SOUND CRAZY.

250
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,300
WHAT?

251
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,400
UM, I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN

252
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,800
THE MOST CONSISTENT
MALE RELATIONSHIP IN MY LIFE.

253
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,900
YOU'RE SO STABLE
AND RELIABLE, AND I JUST...

254
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,200
ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU'D BE AROUND.

255
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,900
WHICH IS FUNNY, BECAUSE I DON'T
REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

256
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,600
WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS--

257
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,300
I FIX YOUR SHINGLE,

258
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,300
AND WHEN I'M DONE,
YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING YOU WANT.

259
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,000
GREAT.

260
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,600
I WILL GO TO THE STORE RIGHT NOW
AND GET SOME WINE

261
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,900
SO WE CAN TOAST YOUR RETIREMENT.

262
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,900
I LIKE THAT.

263
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,200
PERFECT WAY TO END MY TIME
ON WISTERIA LANE.

264
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,800
OK.

265
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
WHAT KIND DO YOU LIKE--
RED OR WHITE?

266
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,700
EITHER ONE. JUST MAKE SURE
IT'S A SCREW TOP.

267
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,700
ELI SCRUGGS WAS BURIED
ON A SATURDAY...

268
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,900
AND ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT ELI HAD HELPED OVER THE YEARS

269
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,300
CAME TO PAY THEIR LAST RESPECTS.

270
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,800
BUT ONE PERSON WAS MISSING--

271
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,900
SOMEONE WHO HAD CHANGED ELI'S LIFE...

272
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,900
IN A WAY HE NEVER FORGOT.

273
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,900
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

274
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,100
HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING YOUR DAY.

275
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
NOT AT ALL.

276
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
CAN I HELP YOU?

277
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,000
I WAS HOPING I COULD HELP YOU.

278
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,300
I'M A HANDYMAN.
JUST MOVED INTO TOWN.

279
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,300
LOOKING FOR WORK.

280
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,700
SORRY. I, UM, I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING THAT NEEDS FIXING.

281
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,100
WELL, IF YOU EVER DO,

282
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
UH, HERE'S MY CARD.

283
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,300
"ELI SCRUGGS."

284
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,400
WHAT A DISTINCTIVE NAME.

285
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,100
PEOPLE DO SEEM TO REMEMBER IT.

286
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,400
SO IF ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS,
UH, NEED HELP,

287
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,800
I CAN DO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.

288
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,400
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

289
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,900
IF YOU HAVE A EXTRA CARD OR TWO,
I- I COULD HAND THEM OUT.

290
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,700
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

291
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,800
- OH.
- OH.

292
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,900
ANYWAY...

293
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,200
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

294
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,300
I HAVE A BROKEN VASE.

295
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,100
I'M SORRY?

296
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,000
I- I WAS, UH, DUSTING THE OTHER DAY

297
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,700
AND KNOCKED IT OFF THE BUREAU,
LIKE AN IDIOT.

298
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,400
ANYWAY, I SAVED THE PIECES.

299
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,200
IF YOU COULD GLUE IT
BACK TOGETHER FOR ME,

300
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,900
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

301
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,200
OH, MA'AM,

302
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,300
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

303
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,900
MR. SCRUGGS,

304
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,600
I NEED MY VASE FIXED.

305
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,400
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

306
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,900
NOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE ME BEG, ARE YOU?

307
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
NO, MA'AM, I'M NOT.

308
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,400
GOOD.

309
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,200
COME ON IN.

310
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
MR YOUNG?

311
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
OH. DIDN'T MEAN TO DISTURB YOU.

312
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,200
YOUR FRONT DOOR WAS WI OPEN.

313
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,000
OH.

314
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,400
ELI, I-I DON'T HAVE
ANY WORK FOR YOU TODAY.

315
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
I'M JUST HERE TO DROP OFF
THAT HANDLE YOU WANTED.

316
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,100
FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT MATCHED.

317
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,600
WANT ME TO INSTALL IT?

318
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,200
NOT TODAY.

319
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,700
OKAY.

320
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,200
I'LL JUST BE GOING THEN.

321
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,200
ELI, WAIT.

322
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,300
WHAT?

323
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,000
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?

324
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,500
OH, RIGHT.

325
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,200
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST THING
YOU EVER FIXED FOR ME.

326
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,800
YEAH, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN WHAT, UH,

327
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,900
- TWO YEARS O?
- YEAH.

328
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,500
I JUST THAT GLUE REALLY HELD, HUH?

329
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,400
YEAH.

330
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,900
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

331
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,800
WHAT?

332
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,700
WHY?

333
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,300
I'VE JUST BEEN DOING SOME THINKING
ABOUT THE PEOPLE I KNOW,

334
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,500
THE ONES WHO'VE
WALKED INTO MY FE

335
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,700
AND MADE IT BETTER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE...

336
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

337
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,700
ANYWAY, I'VE-- I'VE--

338
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,300
I'VE NEVER SAID "THANK YOU."

339
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,400
OH, NO, I'M-- I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD THANK YOU.

340
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,300
YOU-- YOU INTRODUCED ME
TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

341
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,400
MY BUSINESS COULDN'T BE BETTER.

342
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
I'M SO GLAD.

343
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,800
YEAH.

344
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,000
ANYWAY, I, UH,

345
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,100
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.

346
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,000
MRS. YOUNG. ..

347
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

348
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,700
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

349
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,100
ARE YOU SURE?

350
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,000
YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

351
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,100
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID, IT MAKES ME
SICK, I'M GOING TO TELL

352
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,100
SO I LOOK IN THE WINDOW,

353
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,000
AND THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE--

354
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,200
ALL OVER THE WALLS
AND THE CEILING...

355
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,100
NOT TO MENTION,
HER HARDWOOD FLOORS,

356
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,300
WHICH SHE JUST
HAD INSTALLED LAST WEEK.

357
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS THINKING.

358
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,000
I JUST WISH THERE
HAD BEEN SOME WARNING,

359
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,200
SOME SIGN THAT SHE WOULD
DO SUCH A THING.

360
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,100
ELI SCRUGGS SAT IN HIS TRUCK
FOR ALMOST AN HOUR,

361
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,000
DEVASTATED THAT HE HAD DONE
NOTHING TO SAVE ME.

362
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,900
HE THEN MADE A QUIET VOW TO GOD--

363
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,000
FROM THAT MOMENT FORWARD,

364
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,700
HE WOULD DO WHAT HE COULD
TO HELP PEOPLE,

365
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,400
TO HELP THEM FIX THEIR LIVES.

366
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,300
AND FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,

367
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,500
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID.

368
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,800
THAT WAS A LOVELY SERVICE.

369
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,000
ELI WOULD'VE LIKED IT.

370
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,100
HELL OF A TURNOUT.

371
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,800
WHO KNEW HE HAD SO MANY FRIENDS?

372
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,700
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

373
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,500
I CAN'T HELP FEELING THERE'S MORE
WE COULD HAVE DONE TO HONOR HIM.

374
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,000
WELL, LET'S JUST MAKE SURE
WE REMEMBER HIM.

375
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,700
ELI WOULD HAVE SAID
THAT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE GET.

376
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,500
AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT...

377
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,900
AS USUAL.

378
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,400
WAIT.

379
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,200
I WANTED TO FIX SOMETHING
FOR ELI FOR A CHANGE.

380
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,500
AND SOMEWHERE,

381
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,900
IN A PLACE RESERVED
FOR THE VERY BEST OF US,

382
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,900
ELI SCRUGGS SMILED AND SAID,

383
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,200
"THANK YOU."

384
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,500
