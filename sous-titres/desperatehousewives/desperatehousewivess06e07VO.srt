00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:02,419
<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:05,709
- <i>Old friends fought.</i>
- You knew that Julie was in trouble,

3
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:08,552
and you chose not to come to me.

4
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:11,089
<i>New lovers lie.</i>

5
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:14,718
- Where did you get it, Bree?
- She bought it? I'm assuming.

6
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:18,467
Yes, at that little antique store
down on Pearl Street.

7
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:21,813
Sorry. We sell furniture.
She must have gotten it somewhere else.

8
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,603
- <i>And suspicion was born.</i>
- Do you know where Katherine was

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,058
the night that Julie was attacked?

10
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:34,377
<i>Julie Mayer
was having trouble sleeping.</i>

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,270
<i>You see, every time
she closed her eyes,</i>

12
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:41,999
<i>she dreamt of her neighbor.</i>

13
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:46,518
<i>They met when
she came to tutor his son.</i>

14
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:50,837
<i>Later, a chance encounter at a café</i>

15
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:53,977
<i>led to hours of conversation.</i>

16
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:57,260
<i>He asked to see her again...</i>

17
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,390
<i>and again...</i>

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,406
<i>and again.</i>

19
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:07,562
<i>And the next thing Julie knew,</i>

20
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:12,359
<i>she was having an affair
with a married man.</i>

21
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,238
<i>But then, after a close call,</i>

22
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:18,840
<i>she came to her senses</i>

23
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,993
<i>and told the man it was over.</i>

24
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:29,965
<i>Unfortunately for Julie,</i>

25
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:31,612
<i>some men</i>

26
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:34,442
<i>can't take "no" for an answer.</i>

27
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:36,168
Can I come in?

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,474
<i>What, that's it?
It's that simple to you?</i>

29
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:49,563
<i>- You have to leave now.
- Come on. Let's just talk about this.</i>

30
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:53,545
<i>- There is nothing to talk about!
- Yes, there is! Come on. Talk to me!</i>

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
What's up?

32
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,498
I'm just dropping off
that band candy

33
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,621
your mom bought from Penny.
Everything okay?

34
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:09,420
Yeah. Everything's fine.

35
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,877
Mr. Bolen was just leaving.
Right?

36
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:14,107
I guess I was.

37
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:21,996
What was that about?

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,670
What do you mean?

39
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,933
I don't mean to pry. It's just...

40
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:31,096
When I was walking up,
I heard you two arguing.

41
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,351
He's the guy.

42
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,068
The guy?

43
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,322
The guy I was...
Having the affair with.

44
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:46,411
- Why did you tell me this?!
- You asked.

45
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,166
Why not lie? I'm late for work.
I would've bought anything.

46
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,805
- Don't freak out. It's over.
- Not for me.

47
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,502
Now I have to tell your mom!

48
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,386
- No, you don't.
- She was pissed

49
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,883
when I didn't tell her you might be
pregnant. If I don't tell her, I'm dead.

50
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:02,399
- Come on, Lynette.
- I am serious!

51
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,096
She already shot Katherine.
Now she's got a taste for blood.

52
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:07,739
There's no reason
to tell her anything.

53
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:09,267
I broke it off weeks ago.

54
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:13,188
- Then why was he here?
- He wants me to take him back.

55
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,732
Threaten to tell his wife.

56
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:18,151
He doesn't care.
He says he loves me.

57
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:21,517
Honey, you're smart enough
to know that that's a lie.

58
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:22,687
Right?

59
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:30,093
I keep trying to get over him,

60
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,630
but then he comes over here
and he says all this stuff,

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,877
and I just get so confused.

62
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,001
Listen to me.

63
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,966
I will handle this.

64
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:43,962
Really?

65
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:47,305
And you won't tell my mom?

66
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,685
No, I won't.

67
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:54,673
Thank you.

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,400

<i>Fine.</i>

85
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,874
Let me make it more interesting
for you. Say I take Mrs. Doolittle,

86
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,747
you favorite doll,
and I chop her into thirds.

87
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:55,833
<i>I bury one third in the yard.</i>

88
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,293
<i>I put another third
down the garbage disposal.</i>

89
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:00,795
How much of Mrs. Doolittle
do you have left?

90
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,839
You're not gonna hurt her, are you?

91
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:05,258
It depends on how you answer
the question!

92
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,094
Can I see you for a sec?

93
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:16,718
What is going on?

94
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:19,356
- I'm teaching math.
- By threatening her toys?

95
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:22,334
Maybe teacher's
a little tired, okay?

96
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,343
It's not the only thing
I have to do.

97
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:26,491
I also have to cook and clean.

98
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:30,168
I hear you. It isn't fair
that all this falls on you.

99
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,104
I'll get you some help.

100
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,120
- Thank you.
- We'll get a housekeeper.

101
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:36,456
What? I'd rather have a tutor.

102
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,922
You'd rather scrubs toilets
than teach your daughter?

103
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,127
At least the toilets
won't talk back.

104
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,514
She just had to leave
her school and all her friends.

105
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,403
Now her mother's gonna abandon her
and leave her to some stranger?

106
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,188
- I don't think so.
- No, but...

107
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:52,148
No buts. Juanita needs you
right now. You're doing this.

108
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:59,217
Don't worry.
Your doll's safe.

109
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:03,947
If I'm gonna chop anything off,
it's gonna be something of your daddy's!

110
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,486
You're saying
you won't even talk to her?

111
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:08,738
We already interviewed Mrs. Mayfair.

112
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:12,163
That's when you thought
Danny Bolen had attacked Julie.

113
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,829
You treated her like a witness. Now
you need to treat her like a suspect.

114
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,769
We're not trying
to dismiss your concerns,

115
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,971
but women don't commit
this kind of crime.

116
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:24,379
They tend to keep at a physical
remove from their victims...

117
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,756
Vehicular assaults, poison.

118
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:31,694
Maybe Katherine
was thinking outside the box.

119
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,028
Did you get any mayo?

120
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:40,252
I was skeptical, too,
but she does have a motive.

121
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:43,189
- She hates Susan.
- That's a motive to attack her.

122
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:46,419
Maybe Katherine saw Julie

123
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,862
taking out the garbage
and thought it was me.

124
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:51,745
She mistook you for a 23-year-old?

125
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:58,872
I'm sorry, Mrs. Delfino,
but unless you've got actual evidence,

126
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:01,748
we're gonna keep assuming
that this is a random incident...

127
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:04,377
One that your daughter
thankfully survived.

128
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:07,923
Damn it! They forgot the pickle!

129
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:10,338
What is with this place?

130
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:14,248
Is there anyone here that understands
a woman can be a psycho killer, too?

131
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:15,513
Maybe I can help.

132
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:17,557
You want me to take this one?

133
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,284
Have at it.

134
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,395
Thank you so much.

135
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,258
How about
I take a look at your file?

136
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:28,151
I will swing by tomorrow,
and I'll get your statement then.

137
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:30,096
Great.

138
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:35,756
It is nice to know that
someone cares about justice

139
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:37,744
more than pickles.

140
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:41,649
Come on, Mike.

141
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,044
Are you sure you want this case?

142
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:49,464
'cause I've got a serial killer
here that might be more fun.

143
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,931
She and I go way back.

144
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,815
She doesn't remember me now,
but she will.

145
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:04,271
I wish you hadn't
committed us to this.

146
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,286
Why? They're our neighbors,
and they've been asking us for weeks.

147
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:10,451
I'm not a fan of Angie Bolen.
She can be very forward.

148
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,607
I like her. She's earthy,
takes a real interest in people.

149
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:16,028
Yes. Last week, she asked me
how much my dress cost

150
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:18,937
and did I still get visits
from my aunt Flo.

151
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:23,048
- I believe that's a euphemism for...
- I know what it means.

152
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,408
By the way, I stopped by
that antique store today...

153
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,904
The one where you said
you bought that brooch.

154
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:32,327
I thought I'd get you a replacement
since you gave yours to Susan.

155
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:35,052
But the owner said
they don't sell jewelry there.

156
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,261
Just furniture.

157
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,381
That's odd.

158
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:43,155
I must've confused that store with
the jewelry shop on Maple Street.

159
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:46,175
Yes, I remember now.
That's where I bought it.

160
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:49,691
Look who's here!

161
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:57,073
My goodness.
Another course?

162
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,174
My grandma Bombelli always said,

163
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:02,621
"if the men can still button
their pants, dinner ain't over yet."

164
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:10,128
Is her braciole amazing or what?

165
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,465
I have to admit, I've never
had this before. And it is quite tasty.

166
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,477
Thanks, hon.
Hang on a sec.

167
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:20,918
You don't want to stain
that gorgeous blouse.

168
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:24,434
I'm actually a very neat eater.

169
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:28,438
When Nick here starts twirlin'
his pasta, nobody's safe.

170
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:31,650
I did get some friendly fire
from a meatball earlier.

171
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,570
I'm glad we're finally doing this.

172
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:39,449
- You two are hard to pin down.
- We've been incredibly busy.

173
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,453
I'll bet, especially since Katherine
wigged out and you give her the boot.

174
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:46,498
If you need someone to replace,
you could do a lot worse than Angie.

175
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:50,911
Her grandma Bombelli had
the best restaurant

176
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:53,004
in Little Italy,
taught Angie everything.

177
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:54,839
I mean...

178
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:56,925
if you're lookin' for help.

179
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,763
- If your food is all this good...
- We're... not hiring.

180
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:04,474
Sorry.

181
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,851
It's just a thought.

182
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,229
You sure, Bree?

183
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:11,940
She said no.

184
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:14,693
I'm just sayin'... You don't
know what you're missin'.

185
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:18,196
She's had four courses. She knows
what she's missing. Now zip it.

186
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,407
Don't bite my head off.
I'm tryin' to help.

187
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:22,659
By embarrassing our guests?

188
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:27,956
Just ignore him.

189
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,834
It was your idea to cook for her.

190
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:37,173
Thank you! Now they think that I don't
cook for people unless I have an angle.

191
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,364
I am so sorry.

192
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:48,018
Look at them. They're
wishin' they hadn't come.

193
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:50,429
- We're having a lovely time.
- We're thrilled!

194
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:53,246
Perfect! Now you're
makin' our guests lie.

195
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:55,734
I'm gonna go stir the sauce.

196
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:00,762
I'll get more wine.

197
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:02,574
We're gonna need it.

198
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,369
Just curious, how many more courses?

199
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:09,142
Three.

200
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:16,379
I never thought I'd say this to you
again, but please unbutton your pants.

201
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,780
If you have half a cabbage,

202
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,339
and someone gives you a quarter cabbage,
how much cabbage do you have?

203
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:31,061
None, because I hate cabbages
and I wouldn't take 'em.

204
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:33,271
Fine. They're balloons.

205
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,024
There's no such thing
as half a balloon.

206
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:38,326
There is a such thing
as half an allowance,

207
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:41,229
which is what you're gonna get
if you don't start to focus.

208
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,198
Why can't I just use a calculator?

209
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,196
Because you have to know this stuff.

210
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:48,497
If not, you're gonna end up
scrubbing other peoples toilets!

211
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,336
Sorry.

212
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:56,294
If you finish this page, we'll go get
some ice cream. How's that sound?

213
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:58,755
I don't want to have
ice cream with you.

214
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:07,996
I'm gonna get some air.

215
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,350
Will you make sure she doesn't
move from the table?

216
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,691
- What do you call this again?
- Foie gras mousse.

217
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,900
Tastes so elegant.

218
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:24,187
- Don't you think it's elegant?
- It's okay.

219
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:27,916
Would you like to sample
something else, Mr. Vitale?

220
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:30,704
Some salmon en croute
or perhaps some coq au vin?

221
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,039
Got anything I can pronounce?

222
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:37,403
You don't need to pronounce it.
You just gotta wipe it off your shirt.

223
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,213
You wanna end up on a plate
next to the salmon, keep it up.

224
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,034
I'm sorry we wasted your time.

225
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:45,984
My husband doesn't understand
elegant food. He's an ignoramus.

226
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:49,973
This ignoramus is throwing you
an anniversary party for 500 people.

227
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,017
500, you say?

228
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:56,135
Let's sit down
and figure something out

229
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,899
because I would really love
to cater this party.

230
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,521
You seem like a nice lady.

231
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:03,307
It's just that our guests
are comin' in from the Bronx.

232
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:05,151
They don't know from fancy food.

233
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,158
It's more of a sausage
and peppers crowd. I'm sorry.

234
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:11,995
I could make you braciole.

235
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,747
You can do braciole?

236
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,121
Yes, and...

237
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:19,961
gnocchi and tortelloni
and, lasagna verde.

238
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:22,088
But none of that stuff's
on your menu.

239
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:27,010
That's because they're family recipes
from... my grandmother Bombelli.

240
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,346
You're Italian?
You don't look it.

241
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:33,435
Papa was Irish. I may get
my hair from the O'rourke side

242
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,268
but my stomach, she's all Bombelli.

243
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:40,210
If you give me this job,
I will feed your family my stracotto

244
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:42,150
till the men
can't button their pants.

245
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:46,279
That's what we're lookin' for.
You're hired.

246
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,408
I feel better.

247
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:55,385
All right, let's get back to it.

248
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:01,557
Hold it. You got
all these problems right?

249
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:04,839
You cheated, didn't you? Confess!

250
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:06,925
No, Ivana helped me.

251
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:08,969
- Who's Ivana?
- That's me.

252
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:13,223
We met when you handed me
this bucket and rag.

253
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:15,851
Right.
Sorry.

254
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,561
You helped her?

255
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:22,190
I told her to look at fractions
like a big chocolate cake.

256
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,194
The bottom number is the whole thing,
and the top represents how many slices.

257
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,573
I should've known cake would
make everything come into focus.

258
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,955
Math is my specialty.
I have a PhD in engineering

259
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,930
from the university of Bucharest.

260
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,350
But it means nothing in
the American job market. So...

261
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:41,834
A doctor.
Impressive.

262
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:46,176
The upstairs bathroom has
a bunch of hair stuck in the drain.

263
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,998
Can you take care of that?

264
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:49,217
Sure.

265
00:14:50,316 --> 00:14:53,434
Mom, this next page doesn't
make sense.

266
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:54,708
I need help.

267
00:14:58,238 --> 00:14:59,238
Doctor?

268
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,522
I'm thinking that drain can wait.

269
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,835
Perfect timing.

270
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,619
I was just thinking about
busting open a bottle of wine.

271
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,662
Actually, I'm here to talk to Nick.

272
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:21,875
I was admiring your roses, and I was
hoping you could give me a few pointers.

273
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:25,572
Honey, you hear that? People are
asking us for gardening tips.

274
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:27,214
We are officially suburban.

275
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:30,842
So... Wine?

276
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,729
- You go ahead.
- All right.

277
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,344
Thanks, though.

278
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,249
Here's the key...

279
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:41,085
You cut going away from
the bud at a 45 degree angle...

280
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,105
I know about you and Julie.

281
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,525
For God sakes, you're twice her age.

282
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:51,446
This is none of your business.
No offense.

283
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:53,762
None taken. But...

284
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:56,151
you know who might
be offended? Her father.

285
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,773
If Karl finds out,
he's gonna come over here and

286
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:01,248
cut your buds off
at a 45 degree angle.

287
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,878
- Thanks for the warning.
- I mean it. If you don't stop

288
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,903
bothering Julie,
you will be sorry. Happy gardening.

289
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:09,083
Hang on a second. Hang on.

290
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:11,550
Julie said I was bothering her?

291
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,219
Did she also tell you that
she started this whole thing?

292
00:16:14,592 --> 00:16:15,992
She came after me.

293
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:18,265
There are two sides to every story.

294
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,183
Your side is married.

295
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,397
I tried to resist.

296
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:27,102
She just wore me down, talking about

297
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,035
how she'd never met anybody like me,
she never felt this way before.

298
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:31,533
She's been jerking me around

299
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,599
- since the day we met.
- I don't care!

300
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:36,416
- Just leave her alone.
- All right, fine.

301
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:40,998
If I find out
you told anyone about us,

302
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:42,831
you're the one who's gonna be sorry.

303
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:48,295
Like I said, you wanna water the roses,
a few times a week.

304
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:51,572
Don't get anything on the foliage.
That's how they get diseased.

305
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:53,804
All right?
Thanks, baby.

306
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:07,647
You okay?

307
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:13,716
I think I might know
who strangled Julie.

308
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:26,747
Good timing.
I'm putting dinner on the table.

309
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:29,536
I thought the housekeeper
was supposed to start today.

310
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:32,025
She did, and she's fantastic!

311
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:38,530
And her family escaped from
Romania with practically nothing.

312
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:41,264
What were they
fleeing from, cleanliness?

313
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,388
I didn't wanna just
throw work at her the first day.

314
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:48,523
- We needed time to bond.
- So when does she start

315
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,609
- bonding with the dishwasher?
- Daddy, look what I did! Fractions!

316
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,481
All right!

317
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:57,072
So mommy taught you how
to do fractions.

318
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:58,753
Mommy didn't. Ivana...

319
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,743
Ivana take all the credit myself!

320
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:05,342
Can you believe her?
After all the work I've done...

321
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:07,749
Let's go teach you some manners.

322
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:15,131
So the best I can figure, the attack
happened around 11:30 that night.

323
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,710
People saw Katherine leaving
the wedding in the afternoon,

324
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:22,971
and no one saw her again
until the next morning.

325
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:25,170
So... You have to wonder.

326
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:31,606
I'm sorry, but aren't you
gonna write some of this down?

327
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,817
You totally don't remember me,
do you?

328
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:40,156
Sorry.
Can I get a little help?

329
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,416
Denise.

330
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,283
Denise Lapera.

331
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,067
Of course!

332
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,209
A little more help, please?

333
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:55,130
Fairview High. I used to sit behind
you in Mr. Parsons' english class.

334
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,512
I am such an idiot!

335
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:09,102
Mr. Parsons.

336
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:12,155
"Pit-stain" Parsons.

337
00:19:12,923 --> 00:19:14,662
I wonder what ever happened to him.

338
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:17,032
I actually arrested him
few years back.

339
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,528
Twice. Drunk driving.

340
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,073
He got a little aggressive.
I had to use my taser.

341
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:26,528
Part of my was like,
"Zip! And that's for beowulf'!"

342
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,403
That's good times.

343
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:32,751
Good times.

344
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:36,213
And the good times just keep
rolling for you.

345
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:38,840
You got a handsome husband

346
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,343
and two beautiful children and

347
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:42,802
a lovely home.

348
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:47,182
How about you, detective Lapeera?

349
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:53,396
You have
done very well for yourself.

350
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:54,981
Professionally, maybe.

351
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:59,002
But I'm living
in my mother's basement.

352
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,468
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:06,039
- Divorced?
- Never married.

354
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:08,500
Dating anyone?

355
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:12,388
But I did bowl a 179
the other night.

356
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:17,092
Andyou're a detective.

357
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,661
So back to Katherine.

358
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:24,651
Is there... anything else
that you would need to know?

359
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,270
No, I'm good. I'll just
head over there now and

360
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,731
nose around and
see if she has an alibi.

361
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:33,716
Actually, Denise,

362
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,274
one more thing.

363
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,862
This is a very tight-knit community,

364
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,633
and I'm afraid if Katherine
finds out that I'm the one

365
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,118
that accused her of this,
things could get ugly.

366
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:45,745
We wouldn't want that, would we?

367
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:47,576
Exactly, so

368
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,584
maybe you could just say it was
an anonymous tip or something.

369
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
Sure.

370
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:53,915
Thanks.

371
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:56,423
- Say hi to your mom.
- Yeah, we don't speak.

372
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,353
- Look. What a nice gift.
- It's the least I could do to

373
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,656
- thank you for that marvelous dinner.
- Please, we should be thanking you

374
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:09,705
for not walking out when me and Nick
started screaming at each other.

375
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:13,189
It was just one course. The rest
of the meal was extremely quiet.

376
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,777
You are so tactful. You think
you can teach me some of that?

377
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:21,741
And take away that earthy charm?
I wouldn't think of it.

378
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:26,788
Listen, Angie, I have this friend
coming to town next week,

379
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:29,875
and I would love to serve her
that dinner you made for us if...

380
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:31,875
you don't mind sharing your recipes.

381
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,951
Gee, I would love to help,
but grandma Bombelli

382
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,547
was real strict about not
sharing the family recipes.

383
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:41,811
Please?

384
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:45,597
This friend just loves
good Italian food.

385
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,766
Take her to Piccolino.
Their food is good.

386
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,120
This friend...

387
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:53,628
she doesn't really go
to restaurants anymore,

388
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:55,245
not since the fire.

389
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:57,692
People stare, so...

390
00:21:58,389 --> 00:22:01,169
My God. That's awful.
You know what?

391
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:04,541
Grandma would want this woman
to eat well. Hold on.

392
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,770
We got the gnocchi, lasagna verde,
the tortelloni, the braciole,

393
00:22:11,937 --> 00:22:13,333
the stracotto, arancini

394
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,794
and the polenta cake.

395
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:18,095
But...

396
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,376
I'm making a big exception here,

397
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:22,717
so promise you won't go
passing these around.

398
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:24,307
Trust me.

399
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:27,927
I will treat these recipes
as if they were my own.

400
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:32,842
She has been over there
a long time, hasn't she?

401
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:35,480
Man, are there enough photos
of you in this yearbook?

402
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,528
Do you still have
this cheerleading outfit?

403
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,865
I just thought if you put it on,
it might jog your memory.

404
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:52,387
Looking at Denise's photo
might do the trick.

405
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:54,326
Hey, here she is.

406
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:57,737
Hair in the '80s...
What were you girls thinking?

407
00:22:57,904 --> 00:22:59,324
Oh, my God. Moose.

408
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:01,559
Too much mousse, if you ask me.

409
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:03,926
The animal. That was her nickname.

410
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:08,755
What's wrong?

411
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:11,516
This is Moose Lapera.

412
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,769
She was the only girl
that hated me in high school.

413
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:16,331
Why?

414
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:19,288
I may have mentioned
to Beth Porter that...

415
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:21,814
she had a laugh like a moose.

416
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:25,481
- You gave her the nickname?
- I just made that comparison.

417
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:28,825
Beth is the one that got
the entire school to go...

418
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,246
- Whenever she walked by.
- And she hates you

419
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,946
- because of that?
- Well, and also...

420
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:38,822
I kinda stole her boyfriend.

421
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:40,545
"Kind of"?

422
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:45,526
She spent all senior year
in love with Mark Malone,

423
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,846
and they went on like,
one date, and...

424
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:51,264
Mark noticed me and
dumped Moose to ask me out.

425
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,760
So the guy came after you.
Wasn't your fault.

426
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:57,002
Clearly you were never a high school
girl. Moose was convinced

427
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,273
that I stole mark from her,
just like Katherine is convinced

428
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,261
that I... Oh, my God!

429
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,199
I sent her over there.

430
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:05,785
It's like a...

431
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:09,324
a meeting of the "I hate Susan" club!
What am I gonna do?

432
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:10,909
This was a long time ago.

433
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,204
Nobody holds a grudge that long.

434
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,335
Maybe you're right.
Look at this.

435
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,090
I think...

436
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,131
she might be arresting Katherine
right now.

437
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,316
That is a perp walk.

438
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:31,054
She is taking Katherine
on a perp walk.

439
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:38,432
Looks more like a perp hug.

440
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,815
What is going on? What...
What is she doing?

441
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:47,369
I think she's showing us
how long someone can hold a grudge.

442
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:54,816
Juanita, I was thinking,

443
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:58,303
after you and Ivana
finish your schoolwork,

444
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:01,459
would you like to go see a movie
with me... just the two of us?

445
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:04,794
Cool! Can we have
junior mints for dinner?

446
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,008
Wouldn't be a movie if you weren't
throwing up candy on the ride home.

447
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:15,473
Hi. Can I help you?

448
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,183
Hola. I'm Christina.

449
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:21,521
From happy housekeeper?

450
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:25,810
There must be some mistake.

451
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:27,377
Our maid is Ivana.

452
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:29,821
I request Ivana.
Where's Ivana?

453
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,698
My english not so good.

454
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,502
It's okay.
It's our new cleaning lady.

455
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:36,069
Gracias por venir.

456
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:39,998
Would you excuse us
one moment? Un momento.

457
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,794
What do you mean, new cleaning lady?
Where's Ivana?

458
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,622
I called the agency and had them
send over someone else.

459
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:50,482
Why?

460
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,678
Because Ivana sucked, and not
in that good vacuum sort of way.

461
00:25:54,198 --> 00:25:56,254
Cut her some slack.
She's Romanian.

462
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,436
When your people are being chased
into Argentina by angry cossacks,

463
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:01,979
maybe a sparkling toilet isn't
that important.

464
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:07,203
How about you stick to fractions,
and I'll teach Juanita geography?

465
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,370
Goodbye.

466
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:10,541
Gracias.

467
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,953
So how do you feel about
teaching math to 7-year-olds?

468
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:19,512
My english...

469
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,456
Not so good.
Yeah, I know.

470
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:28,399
Knock, knock!

471
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:33,564
- What are you doing here?
- Your shortbread was so good,

472
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:35,714
I made you a batch
of my pignoli cookies.

473
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:38,259
How incredibly thoughtful of you.

474
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:41,405
I smell marinara. You cooking
my food for your friend?

475
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:44,729
- Yes, and I am way behind, so...
- Well, let me help you, then!

476
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:49,721
You sure got a lot of sauce here.

477
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:52,070
Lot of potatoes, too.

478
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:03,372
- This is all for three people?
- Well, with food like yours,

479
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,000
who wouldn't want leftovers?

480
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:13,717
"Vitale anniversary party...
Arancino, gnocchi, braciole."

481
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,942
You were stealing my recipes
for a catering job.

482
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:20,765
I wanted to serve foie gras.
The client demanded pasta.

483
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:24,037
So you come running to me with some
sob story about a burn victim who can

484
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:26,938
- only be healed by manicott'?
- I admit that was a bit tacky.

485
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,047
I lit a candle for that woman!

486
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,164
If you think about it,
it was a huge compliment.

487
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:34,866
And the compliment is that

488
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:37,741
my food is good enough
for your business, but I'm not.

489
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,993
I would never say
you weren't good enough.

490
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:42,811
Of course you wouldn't.
You're tactful.

491
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:45,398
But you know what? I'm not,
which is why I can say

492
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:47,623
that you're a two-faced,
condescending bitch

493
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,823
who will never make a nickel
off my dead grandma's braciole!

494
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,808
But enjoy the cookies!

495
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,958
- That's insane.
- I know this is hard for you.

496
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,268
It's impossible.
It couldn't have been Nick.

497
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:04,399
How can you be so sure?
It was dark.

498
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,850
You told the police you couldn't see
who attacked you.

499
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:08,939
This doesn't make any sense.
He loves me.

500
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,683
Exactly, and you broke up with him.
Honey, this is something

501
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,671
- we have to consider.
- Well, I can't consider it, okay?

502
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:16,826
I just can't.

503
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,012
We watched you grow up.
You're like a daughter to us.

504
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:28,904
We can't stand by and do nothing.

505
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:34,464
So you're gonna talk to the police
no matter what I say.

506
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,841
I think we have to.

507
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:45,674
It just couldn't be him.

508
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,358
You.
What are you doing here?

509
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:57,320
The agency gave me this address.
Please, Ivana, I need you to come back.

510
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,365
Your husband told the agency
that I am a lousy housekeeper.

511
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,969
You never told him
what I was really doing.

512
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:05,787
The agency almost fired me.
You have to leave.

513
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,748
Wait! Wait!
I need you!

514
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,398
Juanita needs you.

515
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,630
See? She needs you.
She has a test tomorrow,

516
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:18,153
and when I teach her, one of us ends up
in tears. Don't make me teach my baby.

517
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,594
I'm sorry. I have floors to scrub.

518
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,995
Forget scrubbing.
Ivana, you have a gift.

519
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,473
Share it with the world,
starting with my daughter.

520
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,869
What about the floor?

521
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,321
You missed a spot.

522
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,252
Got a minute?

523
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:57,297
This really isn't a good time.

524
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Gnocchi.

525
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:06,556
Tasty.

526
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,332
Don't patronize me.

527
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:12,097
Angie's are light as air.
Mine are like little shot puts.

528
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:15,164
Well, perhaps this will
cheer you up.

529
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:18,026
I went to that
jewelry store on Maple

530
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:20,153
and look what I found.

531
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,923
- You like it?
- I told you,

532
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,894
I don't have time for this.

533
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:27,512
You know, it's odd. I asked them
about the first brooch...

534
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,061
For God sakes, Orson,
would you just stop it?!

535
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,756
I have told you again and again
I want a divorce.

536
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:35,376
Do you think you can change
my mind with trinkets?

537
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,963
I don't want jewelry.
I don't want romantic gestures.

538
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:41,383
I want out! Now would you
please leave me alone?

539
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,192
Or for God sakes, I swear
I'll throw something at you!

540
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,014
Just not one of the gnocchi.
Those things could put a man's eye out.

541
00:30:52,426 --> 00:30:53,676
Sorry I'm late!

542
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:58,421
I had to take down some geezer
in the ten items or less line.

543
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:01,077
Ivana, you should probably split

544
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:02,944
<i>before Carlos gets ho...</i>

545
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:09,244
Yeah, I got off work early,
so I let our cleaning woman go home.

546
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:16,018
Juanita, good job.
Let's knock off early today.

547
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:27,846
Do you hear that?
I think celia fell down.

548
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,757
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,104
I asked you for help.
I asked for a tutor and you said no.

550
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,831
Because you're her mother.
You should be able to set aside

551
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,241
a few hours each day
to teach your own daughter.

552
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:44,779
And I will teach her. There's
so many things I'm gonna teach her...

553
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,442
How to dress, how to put on makeup.

554
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,817
I'll even show her how
to get a boy to notice her.

555
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:52,329
That's stuff I know. And we're
gonna have so much fun.

556
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:57,245
But fractions and grammar
and history...

557
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:01,213
It's just not my thing,
and she knows it.

558
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:05,033
And then she gets frustrated
because I'm frustrated.

559
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,400
And it's ruining our relationship.

560
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,971
Come on, Gaby.
Let's not exaggerate.

561
00:32:12,654 --> 00:32:16,504
Carlos, she turned me down when
I asked to take her for ice cream.

562
00:32:21,498 --> 00:32:22,498
I know.

563
00:32:23,187 --> 00:32:26,529
I know. Some moms are made to
homeschool and I'm just not one of them.

564
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:32,628
I get it.

565
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:38,336
We will figure something else out. You
won't have to homeschool her anymore.

566
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:42,354
- Thank you, Carlos.
- You're welcome.

567
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,910
Can I keep the housekeeper?

568
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:47,327
Absolutely not.

569
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,651
I know. I know.

570
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,959
- May I come in, please?
- What now?

571
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:05,323
I just...

572
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:07,895
came to say I'm sorry.

573
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:10,145
What I did was wrong,

574
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,926
and those names
you called me were...

575
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:14,093
harsh

576
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,787
but regrettably accurate.

577
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:19,708
I don't know if you'd even
consider working for me now but

578
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,544
if you would, I would be honored
to have you in my kitchen.

579
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:26,756
Well, well, well. You must
be drowning over there.

580
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,342
All right, I'm drowning.

581
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,305
- And you want me to save you.
- Please.

582
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:37,989
First, tell me this.

583
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,771
Why don't you like me?

584
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:46,026
I like you.
I find you colorful and...

585
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:47,861
Enough with the tact.

586
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:54,367
Fine. I...

587
00:33:55,531 --> 00:33:57,078
You make me uncomfortable.

588
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,544
I don't know how to respond when
someone is as candid as you are.

589
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:04,961
You say whatever pops in your mind.
You...

590
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,267
fight with your husband
in front of guests...

591
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:10,673
Not everyone's marriage is as perfect
as yours, Nancy Reagan.

592
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:14,381
My marriage is not perfect.

593
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,181
Come on.

594
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:19,752
Orson and I barely speak
to each other anymore. We haven't

595
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,937
shared a bed in three months.

596
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:25,023
Seriously?

597
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:31,771
Well, I never would've guessed.

598
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:33,288
That's the point.

599
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:37,105
Our problems are personal.
We don't share them with the world.

600
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:39,746
But you can't seem to keep
anything to yourself.

601
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:46,378
What?

602
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:51,061
Trust me, honey.

603
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:54,928
If there's one thing I know how
to do, it's keep things to myself.

604
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:04,688
Well... There we are.

605
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:07,566
You think I'm vulgar.

606
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:09,347
Excuse me. Candid.

607
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,570
And I think you're a tight ass.

608
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:17,360
But you need help,
and I need a job, so...

609
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,829
- let's get cookin'.
- You mean it?

610
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:24,223
Thank you, Angie.

611
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:26,342
You're a lifesaver.

612
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,610
So...

613
00:35:30,777 --> 00:35:34,136
No sex for three months.
What do you do, sit on the dryer?

614
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:36,453
Okay, now you're just goading me.

615
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:41,291
One ham on wheat, extra mayo.

616
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:44,305
Corned beef, lean, and of course,

617
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:46,563
an entire jar of pickles.

618
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:49,001
What's this about?

619
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,564
Honestly,

620
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:53,737
I don't think this new detective
is up to the job,

621
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:57,587
and I need a couple of seasoned pros
with old school savvy...

622
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:04,956
Why don't you call me "Moose"?
You know you want to.

623
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,291
Moose?

624
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:15,807
Denise, I'm glad I ran into you.
I came down here to apologize.

625
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:19,174
No, you came down here to
get me kicked off the case.

626
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,949
One more thing to apologize for.

627
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:25,127
So look...

628
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,848
I really am sorry about Mark Malone,
but that was ages ago,

629
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:31,865
and that guy had "loser"
written all over him.

630
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:36,327
He's the CEO of Malone Enterprises with
a 6-bedroom home overlooking the lake.

631
00:36:39,044 --> 00:36:40,194
The point is,

632
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:42,758
I'd hate for our history to cloud

633
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:44,412
your judgment in this case.

634
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:47,572
You think I'm behaving
unprofessionally.

635
00:36:47,962 --> 00:36:48,962
Well...

636
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,741
When you were leaving
Katherine's house

637
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:53,846
the other day, you two did look...

638
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:55,048
pretty chummy.

639
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,441
It turns out we have
a lot in common.

640
00:36:57,608 --> 00:36:59,469
We both had boyfriends
stolen by you.

641
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:03,223
I did not steal Mike.

642
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:07,185
Katherine just thinks that I did, which
is why I'm betting she strangled Julie.

643
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,841
She couldn't have, because
she was on the phone all night

644
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:12,654
with her daughter,
and the phone records confirm it.

645
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:14,985
- Are you sure?
- I know how to do my job.

646
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:18,607
In fact, I've discovered
some interesting facts

647
00:37:18,774 --> 00:37:20,774
while investigating this case.

648
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:22,993
Is it true

649
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:25,555
that on the evening
of september 16th

650
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:27,705
at approximately 11:45,

651
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:29,875
you shot Katherine Mayfair?

652
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,502
What? That was an accident.

653
00:37:33,105 --> 00:37:35,505
And you not reporting it
was a crime.

654
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,012
Let's not blow this
out of proportion. I hurt you,

655
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:45,181
but you've gotta get past this.
You can't keep blaming me

656
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:48,531
for the way that your life
turned out. It's just...

657
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:51,229
It's gonna make you
bitter and miserable,

658
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,729
like Katherine.

659
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:55,781
You need closure, Denise.

660
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:58,833
You have the right to be happy.

661
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:01,239
And you have the right

662
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:03,278
to remain silent.

663
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:07,590
In you go!

664
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:12,125
You know what this is called?
Closure.

665
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:21,860
The Julie Mayer assault?

666
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:25,013
We're not on that case anymore.
Detective Lapera's handling that.

667
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,347
Why?

668
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:28,725
We have some
new information to report.

669
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:30,977
The detective is out on a call
at the moment.

670
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,273
This needs to be checked out
right away.

671
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,280
What needs to be checked out
right away?

672
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,847
Did you guys ever talk
to Nick Bolen?

673
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:41,154
The dad of the kid we arrested.
Yeah, yeah, we talked to him.

674
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:45,242
I'm guessing he didn't mention that
he and Julie were having an affair.

675
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,203
She broke it off
right before she was attacked.

676
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:51,459
No kiddin'.

677
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,814
Hey, babe. What's up?

678
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,718
Good news.
I am a working girl.

679
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:02,085
Bree asked me to join her company.

680
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:04,741
That's great.

681
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:07,401
You're still
gonna cook for me, right?

682
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:10,018
Are you kidding?
You're my guinea pig.

683
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:12,553
Congrats.

684
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:15,566
And there was something
else I needed to tell you.

685
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,733
Right, right, right. Cops called.
They wanted to know where you were

686
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:21,152
the night that
Julie Mayer was strangled.

687
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:24,848
What?

688
00:39:25,716 --> 00:39:27,534
Why would they be asking about me?

689
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:31,329
I guess because you were
having an affair with her?

690
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:34,332
I don't know what they told you.

691
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,075
They didn't tell me anything.

692
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,628
I've known for weeks.

693
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,125
Don't.

694
00:39:42,872 --> 00:39:45,122
Don't embarrass yourself...
or me.

695
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:47,396
You did a stupid thing.

696
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:49,521
But...

697
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:53,330
I know you can't go anywhere,
and you know I can't go anywhere.

698
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:55,897
So we're gonna have
to get past this.

699
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:57,214
I'm so sorry.

700
00:39:58,736 --> 00:40:01,686
I've put you through a lot,
so you get this one.

701
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,053
But that's it.

702
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:05,238
You know I never attacked her.

703
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,631
And that is why I lied

704
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:10,730
and told the cops
you were with me the entire night.

705
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:14,080
So we're okay?

706
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,117
Now we're okay.

707
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:32,265
<i>The truth is,</i>

708
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:36,088
<i>there's only so much
we can learn from books.</i>

709
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:40,513
<i>They can't tell you
how to make your wife happy.</i>

710
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,592
<i>They can't tell you how
to appreciate your neighbor.</i>

711
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:54,237
<i>They can't tell you
if that man across the street</i>

712
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:55,705
<i>is dangerous.</i>

713
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:02,665
<i>No, the only way to truly learn</i>

714
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:04,935
<i>is from your mistakes.</i>

715
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:09,594
<i>Of course, if those mistakes
land you in jail,</i>

716
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:12,211
<i>it might be nice to have a book</i>

717
00:41:13,475 --> 00:41:15,074
<i>to pass the time.</i>
