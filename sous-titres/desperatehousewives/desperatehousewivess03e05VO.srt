1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,570
whatever you wanna do,I'm in your corner.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,130
Lynette made a promise...

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,280
Mr.Faladi...

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,720
I love him,and he loves me!

5
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,520
And bree's daughter fell  for her history teacher.

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,300
-While mike's history... -he suffered significant memory loss.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,510
Was being carefully rewritten.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,540
-Susan mayer. -We were close,huh?

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,320
That tramp treated you like dirt.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,560
the art of sabotage--  it's practiced every day  in the suburbs.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:36,560
Sometimes it takes the form  of a bundt cake  offered to a friend  who's on a diet.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,930
Other times,it's a cable cut just as a husband's friends arrive to watch the big game.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,100
And then there's always  that anonymous phone call  to the city zoning department.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:59,250
Yes,in suburbia,everyone you meet  is a potential saboteur...absolutely everyone.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,450
Good afternoon.I'm,uh,bree hodge,and you are?

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,790
Name's gus,and we're all booked up.

17
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,300
Actually,gus,um,I'm here to see one of your guests-- a gentleman named faladi.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,290
Oh,yeah,came in about an hour ago.You want me to call him for you?

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:19,590
No,no,no,no.I'd like you to take me to his room and unlock it so I can walk in unannounced.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,970
lady,I can't do that.

21
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,610
Besides,he has a girl in there.

22
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,020
Yes,I know.

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,280
She's my daughter-- my 17-year-old daughter.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,110
Uh,that would be,uh,room,uh,17.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,180
Now there's irony for you.

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,750
you don't have a gun in there,do you?

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,850
Because I just put down new carpet.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,950
Oh,gus,I don't plan anything unpleasant.

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,190
I'm simply going to inform mr.Faladi what repercussions he faces

30
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:51,510
if he continues this relationship and trust him to see reason.

31
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,500
-what the hell?! -mom!What are you doing here?!

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,470
You just can't walk right in here.

33
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,160
-How can you do this to me?! -What makes you think that you can walk in here...

34
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,820
yes,the art of sabotage--  it's practiced every day  in the suburbs...

35
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,580
I told you,it's over!but I love you!

36
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,270
Okay,didn't you hear her?!

37
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,530
So how'd it go?

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,440
Quite well,I think.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,750
But few do it as well s bree hodge...

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,760
oh,and,gus,the carpet is beautiful.

41
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,220
or as politely.

45
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,360
Family dinner--

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,360
there was a time when that phrase meant something on wisteria lane.

47
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,550
Of course,this was back when meals were lovingly prepared...

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,030
by wives who loved to cook...

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,530
for children  who remembered their manners.

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,560
But family dinners,like the times,had changed,

51
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:46,470
and there was only one house  in the neighborhood  where dinner remained  a family occasion...

52
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,480
and attendance  was not optional.

53
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,520
I don't know when I've tasted such tender spring lamb.

54
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Thank you,dear.

55
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,520
Danielle,you haven't touched your dinner.

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,010
She doesn't like spring lamb.

57
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,040
She prefers old goat.

58
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,260
I'm glad you guys think it's  so funny that my life is over.

59
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,440
Your mother was right to end that relationship.

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,220
-The man was your teacher  and married. -He's getting a divorce.

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,550
Well,that hardly bolsters his suitability.Danielle,please,eat something.

62
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,560
Don't worry,dear.

63
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,680
Hunger strikes demand self-control,and as we've seen,that's hardly her strong suit.

64
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,020
When are you gonna take me seriously?

65
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,180
When you start acting like an adult.

66
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,360
Well,she sleeps with them.That's a start.

67
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,120
I hate you!

68
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,850
I hate all of you!

69
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,300
remind me to buy paper plates.

70
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,800
We'll need them till a certain someone can be trusted with china again.

71
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,510
Wow,you're pretty good at that.

72
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,460
Hey,you are home early.

73
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,530
Yes...I am.What is all this?

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,210
We are having a celebration.

75
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,820
Sit.

76
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,720
what are we celebrating?

77
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,910
You being the greatest wife in the world.

78
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,910
thanks.

79
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,430
No,seriously,though.

80
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,020
I mean it.

81
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,330
How many wives would tell their husbands to follow his dreams,

82
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,400
and then have the patience to wait while he figures out what the hell it is?

83
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,810
Oh,my god!You know what you wanna do!

84
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,880
That's fantastic!What is it?

85
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,440
Wait for it,wait for it...

86
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,320
okay,I knew I needed to spend my days doing something I was passionate about,something creative--

87
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,740
yeah,have at it-- um,something where I interacted with the public

88
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,640
but I was still my own boss,and then this morning,it just like--bam,it hit me!

89
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,780
Okay,okay,I'm dying here.

90
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,930
What's the dream?

91
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,340
You're eating it.

92
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,480
Excuse me?

93
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,350
I'm gonna open up a pizza parlor!

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,420
I bet you didn't see that one coming.

95
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,710
No,that was a real frisbee to the head,that one.

96
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,560
But--but when you think about it,doesn't it make perfect sense?

97
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,460
I mean,marinara's in my blood.

98
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,490
You remember uncle vito?He came to this country with nothing.

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,400
He turned that trattoria into a gold mine.

100
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,110
Isn't he the one that...

101
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,950
asked us for a loan last christmas?

102
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,370
He has a gamblg problem,but don't ble the pizza.

103
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,430
Trust me.

104
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,430
I've got this thing all mapped out.

105
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:34,110
It's gonna have,like,a real family feel,with,like,big portions but small prices,crayons for the kids.

106
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,630
Oh,god,I feel good about this.

107
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,730
So what do you think?

108
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,450
I think...

109
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,870
I'm gonna open another bottle of wine.

110
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,440
But we haven't finished this one.

111
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,600
Well,hey,we're celebrating,right?

112
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,160
carlos,what are you doing in my room?

113
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,890
Oh,hey,gaby,you're home early.

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,350
God,carlos!

115
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,970
Strawberries and champagne?

116
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,100
Did you really think you're gonna seduce me?

117
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,550
Never entered my mind.

118
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,580
Oh,right,right.

119
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,030
You know,I may be living with you until the divoe is final,

120
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,940
but it doesn't mean I have to put up with your cheesy come-ons.

121
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,310
Gaby,can I just say one thing?

122
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
What,you've been doing some thinking,

123
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,010
and you realize that I'm your soul mate,and there's a vacancy in your heart only I can fill?

124
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,800
Gaby,listen-- it's over between us.

125
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,970
Just move on already.

126
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,600
Forget me.

127
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,300
as I was trying to say,I have company over.

128
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,880
This is trishelle.

129
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,210
trishelle,this is...

130
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,320
what was your name again?

131
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,810
I seem to have forgotten.

132
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,790
so the doctor said I should use as many things as I can to jog your memory.

133
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,950
And not just pictures.

134
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,820
He said I could use tastes and smells and sounds,so tonight is...

135
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,550
"sounds of the seventies.

136
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,300
well,you know,let me set the scene.

137
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,840
Um,we were at this funky little fish joint that you'd been dying to take me to--cappy'S.

138
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,260
Do you remember cappy's?

139
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,020
Okay,well,we were there,and,uh,we were just wolfing down the most delicious trout ever-

140
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,360
-how long till the music part? -Oh,it's coming.

141
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,760
Um,and--and this '70s cover band,well,they started to play,and...

142
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,510
that's how we got our song.

143
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,820
our song was "car wash"?

144
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,510
See how much fun we were?

145
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,340
so I dragged you out onto the dance floor,

146
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,840
and,you were giving me this look-- sortf like the look you're giving me right now-- and,um,

147
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,150
I started to do this...and then you did this...

148
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,890
I'm--look,I'm sorry,this--this isn't working.

149
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,190
Oh,mike.Come on,you're not even trying to remember!It was fun!

150
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,480
Oh,I know.Okay,sing with me.

151
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,770
Car wash   talkin' about the car wash   whoo,car wash,yeah.

152
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,560
you know,I'm really beat.

153
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,590
Okay,mike,I-I am not doing this to upset you.

154
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,140
I'm doing this to help.

155
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,120
I get that.

156
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,960
It's just...

157
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,300
the music is giving me a headache.

158
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,110
Okay,well...

159
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,990
I'll go,but I am not giving up on you.

160
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,250
You know,you are going to remember the night that we danced to "car wash,"

161
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,950
and not just because it was fun,but because

162
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,950
later that night,we did some things that,trust me,are worth remembering.

163
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,170
that jane doe from the golf course...

164
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,000
I think I missed something at the autopsy.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,590
Check it out.

166
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,220
You always gotta come at lunch,don't you?

167
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,070
Those blue marks on the back of her hand?

168
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,560
First I thought they were veins.

169
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,360
Now I think it's ink.

170
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,790
You mean,like some kind of writing?

171
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,230
I need to run some more tests,see if I can get a clearer image.

172
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,590
I could be wrong,but...

173
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,810
but what?

174
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
I think it's a phone number.

175
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,640
The oddest thing happened at the club today.

176
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,170
Tish atherton--

177
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,860
andrew,would you be a dear and make sure your sister's just breaking her own things?

178
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,790
Anyway...Tish atherton...

179
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,350
danielle?

180
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,990
yeah,I'll tell 'em.

181
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,050
I'm telling you,it was a deliberate snub.

182
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,450
I waved to her,and she looked right through me.

183
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,910
True,I never bought her eldest daughter a gift-- uh,mom?

184
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,340
Andrew,please don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.

185
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:53,350
True,I never bought her eldest daughter a gift,but you know my policy-- no husband,no baby gift.

186
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,750
Now what is it,dear?

187
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,500
Well,um,danielle's upstairs trying to commit suicide.

188
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,960
There's no rush.She's not trying that hard.

189
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,540
how can you sit there playing that ridiculous game?!

190
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,350
Your sister tried to kill herself.That doesn't upset you?

191
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,610
She tried to slit her wrists with a spoon.

192
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,490
How upset do you want me to be?

193
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,730
Mrs.Hodge?

194
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,110
Is my daughter all right?

195
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,250
She's a little groggy,but she'll be fine.

196
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,670
The wounds are fairly superficial.

197
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,930
so's the patient.

198
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,990
We'll release her tonight,but you understand that in cases like this,counseling is mandatory.

199
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,060
Of course.We'll get her all the help she needs.

200
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,470
She is resisting our efforts to pump her stomach.

201
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,330
She says she only took three sedatives.

202
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,980
She's disoriented.

203
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
Pump her.

204
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,770
Andrew!

205
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,720
Pump her.

206
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,160
They're sticking a tube down her throat.

207
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,660
Do you still think this is funny?

208
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,970
Mom,this was a half-assed bid for attention.

209
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,140
This was a cry for help,and if we don't listen,the next time she could do something even more dangerous.

210
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,570
Yeah,next time she might jump off the porch.

211
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,910
Stop it!

212
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,870
Suicide is the worst thing that can happen to a family!

213
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,180
I will not have it made light of!

214
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,690
orson's right.

215
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,350
We need to support each other as a family.

216
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,180
In fact,I say we all...

217
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,780
go for counseling.

218
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,730
tom actually said he's opening up a pizza parlor?

219
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,380
lynette,you're not serious.

220
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,430
Well,might as well stand in a vat of tomato sauce and tear up $100 bills.

221
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,460
I know,but I said that I would support him and help him follow his dream.

222
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,030
Well,he can't hold you to that,not if the dream is pizza.

223
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,710
She promised to stand by him,and once you make that commitment you have to see it through.

224
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,060
how's that divorce going?

225
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm done talking.

226
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,180
Hey,parker,be careful up there.

227
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,890
I just keep thinking he's gonna come to his senses and realize it's a bad idea.

228
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,200
That's never gonna happen.

229
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,290
Why?

230
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,560
Because men are genetically incapable of realizing that their dreams are stupid.

231
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,290
Care to elaborate,dr.Mccluskey?

232
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,600
My husband sold insurance for 36 years,and one day,

233
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,190
he woke up and decided he wanted to move to paris and paint naked ladies.

234
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,060
I told him,"gilbert,you can barely paint the garage.

235
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,810
What makes you think you can commit art?

236
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,170
" And for the rest of his life,he despised me.

237
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,230
He despised you for saying "no"?

238
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,570
Well,he also thought I was sleeping with his brother,and I'm sure that was mixed in there,too.

239
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,020
Okay,so I got kayla all unpacked.

240
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,680
Oh,great.So,uh,tom will drop her off at your house on friday.

241
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,090
Sounds good.Lynette,can I talk to you for a second?

242
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,660
okay,pardon me for having really big ears,but I heard about tom and this pizza place.

243
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,170
Do you wanna know what I think?

244
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,350
No,not really.

245
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,720
It sucks.

246
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,250
It's a sucky idea,and your friends back there-- they're just too nice to come right out and say it.

247
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,980
Luckily,I'm not your friend,so you can trust me.

248
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,230
Nip it...in...the bud.

249
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,390
And make tom resent me for the rest of his life.

250
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,840
I don't think so.

251
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,940
Well,you better do somethin','cause if you don't,

252
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,660
you and me will wind up working a pole to pay for braces.

253
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,480
Hey,julie.

254
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,420
I bought you some flowers.

255
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,350
Generally,when you buy flers,they don't still have the roots on them.

256
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,730
Okay,uh,I was hoping you could help me with my english lit paper.

257
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,390
Hi,I'm sarah.

258
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,520
So what do you say?

259
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,010
Actually,m sort of busy right now.

260
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,030
Oh,come on.

261
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,070
Look,aunt edie's gonna give me the boot if I flunk out.

262
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,500
-Wouldn't you miss me? -Oh,absolutely!

263
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,110
Whose motorcycle would wake us all up at 2:00 in the morning?

264
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,120
You drive a motorcycle?

265
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,390
please?Look,I could really use some help here.

266
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,550
Normally,I charge 12 bucks an hour for tutoring,but seeing as it's you...$15.

267
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,930
Great.See you friday.

268
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,280
oh,and just so you know,I charge $15 an hour to make out,so I'll probably break even.

269
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,060
Hi.

270
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,790
-You're new. -Where's marcy?

271
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,500
She's in honolulu on vacation.

272
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,330
-Can I help you? -Oh,I'm just going to see mike delfino.

273
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,380
What's that smell?

274
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,800
Uh,that's my maconi and cheese.

275
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,800
I-I was hoping it would trigger mike's memory.

276
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,090
I made it the first time we met two years ago.

277
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,360
You should've refrigerated it.

278
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,310
Edie?

279
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,920
Oh,you know ms.Britt?

280
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,230
Uh,yeah.

281
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,460
What is she doing here?

282
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,290
Visiting mr.Delfino.

283
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,990
You know,she was with him when he came out of his coma.

284
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,210
What?!

285
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,310
And she's been here every day since.

286
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,190
You!

287
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,700
Hello,susan.

288
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,170
Long time no see.

289
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,200
I've been wondering why mike's been so cold to me.Now it all makes sense.

290
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,480
I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.

291
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,970
For god sakes,take a bath.

292
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,090
Oh,that's my mac and cheese.Don't change the subject.

293
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,260
What have you been telling him about me?

294
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,970
Why would I say anything about you?

295
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,730
Mike has no idea who you are.

296
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,190
I envy him.

297
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,150
Ladies,is there a problem?

298
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,360
I want this woman banned from the hospital.

299
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,450
She's been like this ever since mike dumped her.

300
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,810
Imagine "fatal attraction"...with a much older woman.

301
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,110
Ma'am,mr.Delfino already has a visitor.

302
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,350
I think you should go.

303
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,420
Me?

304
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,580
But why doesn't she leave?

305
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,280
I-I'm the one who's been here every day for the last six months.

306
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,660
Well,I don't know you,but I do know his girlfriend.

307
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,690
Girlfriend?!Okay,you know what?

308
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,980
I want marcy's number in honolulu,and I want it right now.

309
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,130
You need to leavE. -what?!

310
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,590
You're disturbing the other patients.

311
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,400
No,what are you-- oh,this is ridiculous!

312
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,210
I mean,who am I disturbing?It's a coma ward!Don't you want them to wake up?!

313
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,590
Did not call you that!

314
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,860
Yes,you did!

315
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,060
I have never in my life used the word "retard.

316
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,150
" It's what you think.

317
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,090
You think I'm th immature moron who can't be trusted to decide what's best for her.

318
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,740
Well,you did try to off yourself.

319
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,240
I don't think you get to pull the "I know what's best for me" card.

320
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,730
Andrew!not in front of the therapist.

321
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,190
Actually,I think we're making great progress.

322
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,980
You feel danielle refuses to see you're acting in her best interest.

323
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,460
And you think your mother cares more about her image than your feelings.

324
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,650
Danielle,how can you think I don't care about your feelings?

325
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,000
Don't you know how much your mother loves you?

326
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,940
When I saw you in that tub,it was the worst moment of my life.

327
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,110
The thought of losing you is more than I can bear.

328
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,540
How does that make you feel?

329
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,840
Actually...kind of powerful.

330
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,930
Powerful?

331
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,690
You really  don't wanna lose me?

332
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,840
Of course not.

333
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,590
I already went through thinking I'd lost andrew.

334
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,440
I can't go through that again.

335
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,840
Well,then,here's what's going to happen--

336
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,160
I'm going to start dating robert again,and if you try to break us up or get him fired,

337
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,210
then I'm going to leave,and you will never  see me again.

338
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,400
-Daelle. -If that can survive on its own,so can I.

339
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,430
You don't believe me?Call my bluff.See what happens.

340
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,670
So...

341
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,870
what do we owe you for all this progress?

342
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,540
Come on,austin.Concentrate.

343
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,410
Okay,why did iago betray othello?

344
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,630
because the play would suck if he didn't?

345
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,260
What do you think you're doing?

346
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,650
Sorry.

347
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,070
No,no,no,no!No,no,we're here to work.

348
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,230
And if my mom came home,she'd flip.Now put that away.

349
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,450
You said,"put it away.

350
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,970
" Look,if--if you think I'm gonna sit here and write your paper for you while you're getting drunk--

351
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,790
no,ju help me get it started,okay?This is hard for me,all right?

352
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,080
I didn't read a lot of shakespeare in juvie.

353
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,940
I kind of majored in not getting stabbed.

354
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,660
Ugh,fine.

355
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,860
I'll write your intro,but-- but then you're on your own.

356
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,510
Thank you very much.

357
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,610
so...

358
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,390
why did they send you to juvie anyway?

359
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,640
"They" didn'T.

360
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,390
My mom did.

361
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,990
Why?

362
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,280
She had this boyfriend-- no job,big drunk,real catch.

363
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,410
One night,he pops her one,so I break a chair over his head,and,uh...

364
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,530
and she calls the cops...on me

365
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,410
But you were protecting her.

366
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,060
Yeah,that's what I thought.

367
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,120
But the guy said he'd leave if she didn't press charges,and...

368
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,410
well,my mom doesn't really like to be alone.

369
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,640
You know what?

370
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,300
You're tired.

371
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:48,080
Um,why don't you lay down for a couple minutes,and I'llust do a page or two?

372
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,390
You're a rock star,mayer.

373
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,780
carlos...

374
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,560
no trishelle tonight?

375
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,920
Ah,no.

376
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,020
About her-- I have a confession to make.

377
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,040
Does her pimp want the rest of the money?

378
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,930
You know,there is some cash in my purse.

379
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,040
Look,I know I crossed a line bringing her here,all right?

380
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,250
But I was trying to make you jealous,like the way you made me feel when you said you slept with john rowland again.

381
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,900
Well,I think it's more than that.I think you really hate me.

382
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,190
That's not true.

383
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,380
Oh,I think it is.

384
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,470
You know,introducing your spouse to someone you're about to have sex with?

385
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,340
There's only one reason to do that-- pure hatred.

386
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,710
You don't know what you're talking abouT.

387
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Oh,I think I do.

388
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,860
Phil,come meet my basically ex-husband-- thank you--carlos.

389
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,740
Carlos,this is my new friend phil lopez.

390
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,150
We've met,gaby.

391
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,330
Really?

392
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,340
Well,that's weird.

393
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,630
When?

394
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,170
Fairview chamber of commerce-- the annual dinner.

395
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,830
Oh,my god!That's right!That's right!

396
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,840
you were up for the latino businessman of the year award that phil won.

397
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,950
Well,actually,I beat him out twice.

398
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,100
No!

399
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,760
ooh,I remember.

400
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,670
Carlos was so annoyed.

401
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,280
What did you say,hon?

402
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,760
"He may have that trophy,but I've got you.

403
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,770
" Ain't life funny?

404
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,390
gaby,can we talk for a sec?

405
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,780
Mnh-mnh,not right now.

406
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,120
Phil and I are getting in the hot tub.

407
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,240
Ooh,phil,did you bring your suit?

408
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
You said I didn't have to.

409
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,130
Not in front of arlos-cay!

410
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,380
go outside.I'll meet you there.

411
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,360
Phil lopez?

412
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,920
You brought home phil lopez?!

413
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,540
I had no idea you hated me that much!

414
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,080
Well,now you know.

415
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,330
Hey,good news.

416
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,350
My realtor found me some sweet locations.

417
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,140
That'S...great.

418
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,660
hey,can we talk about this restaurant thing for a second?

419
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,020
What's up?

420
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't know if you noticed,but when you first pitched the whole pizza concepT...

421
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,400
I was a wee bit skeptical.

422
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,020
Yeah,I sensed that.

423
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:31,310
Of course you did,'cause you're a smart guy,which is also why you are gonna jump on the idea I have to make the whole thing work.

424
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,210
Okay,so you're not bailing on me?

425
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,820
No,no,no,I am totally on board.

426
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,460
oh,good!You had me scared there for a second.

427
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,320
Okay,so,well,what is this great idea?

428
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,850
I'm thinking...catering company.

429
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:57,500
Start small,have an italian theme,create some cash flow,and then later on,expand into the pizza thing.

430
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,460
But that's not mdream.

431
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,020
Well,think about it.

432
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,910
You're gonna do all these fun parties.

433
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,680
People will start talking-- "hey,this is great food.

434
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,660
This guy should open a restaurant.

435
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
"Yeah,yeah,I'd eat there," and then wham!

436
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,490
Five short years later,you have a built-in customer base.

437
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,120
But I said it's not my dream.

438
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,290
Pizza is my dream.

439
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,900
Know,I know.Catering's how you get there.

440
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,160
So why can't I just skip the catering,and go straight to the pizza?

441
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,030
Because you'll fail!

442
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,260
I'm sorry!God.

443
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,070
I shouldn't have said that.

444
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,950
But you're gambling with our life savings,and you have no experience.

445
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,630
You said that you'd support me.

446
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,570
I'm trying to.I am trying to.

447
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,470
But are you aware that 90% of restaurants tank in their first year?

448
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,050
Which means that 10% of them make it!

449
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,770
Why don't you ever think that I would be one of them?

450
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:55,860
No!No,do me a favor.Don't answer that.

451
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,350
Carlos!

452
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,580
I'm making a snack for phil.

453
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,640
Do you want something to eat?

454
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,320
Some sour grapes,perhaps?

455
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,970
Maybe a little crow?

456
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,520
okay,we need to move this over there.

457
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,790
Why?

458
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,660
Uh,feng shui.

459
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,200
Oh,no,no,don't just stand there.Help me!

460
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,210
hey,don't start without me.

461
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,140
oh,no,no,let's get something straight-- you and I are not gonna have sex tonight.

462
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,850
What?

463
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,380
I'm sorry.No offense,you're a nice guy.I'm just not into you that way.

464
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,610
Oh,god,phil!

465
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,830
Yes,yes,give it to me!

466
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,370
Okay.Oh,okay.

467
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,950
No,no,I'm not talking to you.Back off!

468
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,750
What--but I thought-- I mean...

469
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,730
you know,the hot tub...we were...

470
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,880
Yes,you saw my boobs,and you're gonna have that mental snapshot to use as you wish for the rest of your life...

471
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,530
but that is  all you're getting!

472
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,680
Wait,wait,so you're just using me?

473
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,350
You're unbelievable.

474
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,590
I'm what?!

475
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,770
you are unbelievable!

476
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,810
Really?

477
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,580
Oh,so are you,big boy!

478
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,520
No wonder you're divorcing her.She's a straight-up loon.

479
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,710
Oh,crap.She's blocking my car!

480
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,780
Always happy to help a brother out.

481
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,600
Hold on.

482
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,120
oh,god,yes!

483
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,220
Oh,ride 'em,cowboy!

484
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,110
Oh,yes,god!

485
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,250
Take me home,philly!

486
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,220
You should wear a saddle!

487
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,640
Stop it,phil.I told you to beat it.No means no!

488
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,820
I need your car keys.

489
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,600
You're blocking the stallion's hatchback.

490
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,950
"Oh,yes,yes,phil!

491
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,350
Fill me with phil!

492
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,010
" I never said that.

493
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,480
and you moved the bed.

494
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,290
-What were you thinking? -Shut up.

495
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,340
You know,if you were trying to hurt me,that's not the way to do it.

496
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,020
Well,then enlighten me.

497
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,370
How can I hit you so hard that you will never recover?

498
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,170
You can'T.

499
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,770
Oh,I have to,carlos.

500
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,550
I need you to give up on us.

501
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,050
We're not good for each other,and I can't keep doing this.

502
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,980
But I can.

503
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:00,810
You proved something tonight-- you had a rich,good-looking guy in your bed,and you couldn't pull the trigger.

504
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:07,540
That means you still care,and as long as I know that,I can take anything that you can dish out.

505
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,330
You know what?I'm tired.Can we talk about this in the morning?

506
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,450
Sure.

507
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,370
But you're bringing me breakfast in bed or no deal.

508
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,340
it's a date.

509
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,030
sarah?

510
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,160
What are you--oh!

511
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,890
Oh,julie!

512
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,100
Thank god it's you.

513
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,730
We totally thought you were the cops.

514
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,340
oh,hey,julie.

515
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,560
What are you,on buzz kill patrol tonight?

516
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,510
This is why you couldn't go to the movies with me?

517
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,030
Well,sorry,I thought you weren't that into him.

518
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,360
But,you know,if you are-- I'm not!

519
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,780
I'm just-- I'm mad that you blew me off.

520
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,240
Well,I would totally understand if you wanted to blow me off for a date.

521
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,030
you call this a date-- getting mauled in a car?

522
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,830
Hey,you wanna talk about this later?

523
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,980
I'm losing altitude here.

524
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,400
Ugh,you are disgusting!

525
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,410
Enjoy the rest of your date.

526
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,250
julie,there you are.

527
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,450
I think I found a way to get through to mike.

528
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,800
Let it go!He's not into you!

529
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,180
Gaby,rise and shine.

530
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,040
I made you some waffles.

531
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,350
I got a second wind last night,so I went to a bar.

532
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,680
That's where I met jason.

533
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,140
We spent the whole night-- how did you put it?

534
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,930
Pulling the trigger.

535
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,330
So did I hurt you,or should I keep trying?

536
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,550
you kicked ass in rehab today.

537
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,110
Yeah,I raised my arm over my head.Sign me up for the olympics.

538
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,870
Oh,be patient.It takes time.

539
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,440
Ms.Britt?

540
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,360
Phone call for you at the nurses' station.

541
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,660
For me?

542
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,670
I'll be right back.

543
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,240
There's a phone call for me?

544
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,430
Susan?

545
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,450
What are you-- shh!

546
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,120
I thought you could use some fresh air.

547
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,430
Hello?It's edie.

548
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,090
What the hell is this?Who's he?

549
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,710
Oh,this is hank,and he has very kindly offered to take us on a little field trip today...

550
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,520
for 60 bucks an hour.

551
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,050
Where are you taking me?

552
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,320
Uh,just a little jaunt down memory lane.

553
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,020
Oh,god,you're not taking me to that fish and disco place,are you?

554
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
no,no.

555
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,650
What we're doing today is a little more low-key.

556
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,690
Don't worry.You're totally safe.

557
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,510
We're not doing anything wrong.

558
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,110
punch it!

559
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,580
hello.

560
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,140
Look,mrs.Hodge,uh,I've only seen your daughter once since the motel.

561
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,510
She told me that you backed off.

562
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,700
Oh,mr.Faladi,I'm not here to threaten you.

563
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,940
I've come to give you my blessing.

564
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,320
Your blessing?

565
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,230
Yes,danielle made it quite clear that I'm powerless to stop this relationship,

566
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,990
and since she assures me that you love her-- you do love her,don't you?

567
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,400
Uh,yes,of course.

568
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,780
Good.Then we're all set.

569
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,370
Here are some of her clothes.

570
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,020
I'll bring her cds and her stuffed animals over tomorrow.

571
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,670
You want her to stay here?

572
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,070
This place is kind of small.

573
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,300
Well,that hotel room was small,and you seemed happy enough tre.

574
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,070
Oh,and I trust you to be discreet.

575
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,380
You wouldn't want your wife  find out about this and use it against you in your divorce.

576
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,340
Whoa,whoa,mrs.Hodge?

577
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,690
Things are getting a little bit complicated.

578
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,680
Could you please tell danielle that this is not gonna work out and that we--

579
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,770
Mr.Faladi,if you want to break my daughter's heart,I can't stop you,but I will not be an accomplice.

580
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,730
You'll tell her yourself.

581
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,400
Right.

582
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:28,580
And don't even think about blaming me,'cause if you so much as mention that we spoke,I'll phone the police.

583
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,490
Fine,I will leave you out of it.

584
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,490
Oh,and one more thing...

585
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,540
yes?

586
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,870
Danielle is applying to colleges.

587
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,220
I do hope she can count on you for a glowing recommendation.

588
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,340
Sure.

589
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:55,320
And when I lockemyself out of the house,that's where the bush was that you found me in...naked.

590
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,140
Surely you remember that.

591
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,340
Nope.

592
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,280
Ouch,that hurts.

593
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,090
Um,okay,remember this spot?

594
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,240
This is where we sat in your truck and had our first kiss.

595
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,540
Were you naked then,too?

596
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,440
mike,why are you being this way?

597
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,730
Because this is pointless.

598
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,660
I...I'm sorry.I can't--I don't remember being with you.

599
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,320
Okay,I know it's hard,but you gotta make an effort,

600
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,390
and,you know,if your head is a little foggy,then don't look there.

601
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:33,210
Look in your heart,because I'm in there,just like you're inside mine.

602
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,840
Okay,um,this is mary ace's house,and this is where we first met.

603
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,470
I was setting out my macaroni and cheese,and you we invited-- oh!Ow!

604
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,630
I'm good.

605
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,880
Finally,a smile.

606
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,170
You do that a lot,don't you?

607
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,480
Well,yeah,I've been known to take a spill or two,but,you know,my doctor says it's an inner ear...

608
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,390
wait,you remember that?

609
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,330
Yeah,I think I...do.

610
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,340
Yes!

611
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,440
That's progress!

612
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,280
See?Oh,it's all gonna come back.

613
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,780
We're gonna be us again!

614
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,560
But...what about the british guy?

615
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,110
mike...

616
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,330
I don't know what edie's beenelling you,but ian and I-- we're just friends.

617
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,540
Just friends?

618
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,690
Yeah...now.

619
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,690
look,you gotta understand.

620
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,400
The doctors were telling me that you would probably never wake up,and I just needed somebody to talk to.

621
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,230
And that's what you were doing in the country--talking?

622
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,840
mr.Delfino?

623
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,420
Are you okay?

624
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,650
I'm fine.

625
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,250
You can't just discharge a patient without permission!

626
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,760
Oh,but you--I was just trying to help him remember.

627
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,340
Tell her,mike.We were-- we were making progress.

628
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,080
Take me back to the hospital.

629
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,150
Oh,uh...mike!

630
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,570
Well,at the risk of stating the obvious,it's over.

631
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,790
He's mine now.

632
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,150
No,no,no,no!

633
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,650
No,no,this--this is not how this ends.

634
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,940
No,evil does not triumph over good.

635
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,360
That's how you see me?

636
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,680
Damn straight!

637
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,370
You lie,you cheat,you scheme!

638
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,350
You ruin people's relationships!

639
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,630
I mean,how do you sleep at night?

640
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,360
Soon with mike on top of me,if you know what I mean.

641
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,820
See?Evil!Evil!

642
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:48,260
Has it ever occurred to you that mbe mike and I are meant to end up together?

643
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,080
No!

644
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,410
You--you--mike?

645
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,720
You don't even want him!

646
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,740
You're just doing this to hurt me.

647
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,300
How self-absorbed can you be?

648
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,200
I have had a thing for mike since the day he moved in here,

649
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,450
and I even backed off when he fell for your little miss adorable act.

650
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,550
But he's over that.

651
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,740
It's my turn now,and I will be better for him than you ever were.

652
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,720
And if you do get hurt,well...that's just gravy.

653
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,030
All right,maybe that was a little evil.finally

654
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,550
Finally.Sorry it took so long.

655
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,110
That last digit was barely legible.

656
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,190
I thought you'd like to do the honors.

657
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,360
you've reached  mike delfino plumbing.

658
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,960
Please leave a message  after the beep.

659
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,600
Whoa,a d-minus.

660
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,890
That blows.

661
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,890
Yeah,it does,especially since it's not the one we did together.

662
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,950
You e-mailed me the wrong paper.

663
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,960
You didn't even read it before you turned it in?

664
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,370
I didn't think I had to!

665
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,820
The one you wrote that night was great.

666
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,180
Well,after you left,I decided I really should put it in your words.

667
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,620
Is this some weird chick thing you did 'cause you're into me?

668
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,750
Oh,please.

669
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,940
No,no.

670
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,380
No,it is.

671
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,960
You're,uh,pissed 'cause I hooked up with your friend.

672
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,020
No,I'm pissed because you told me some sob story so I'd write your paper for U.

673
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,230
Now you owe me 15 bucks.

674
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,490
You know what?

675
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,460
Here.

676
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,350
Oh,and,uh,i did learn something.

677
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,850
Iago betrayed othello because he was jealous.

678
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,470
Oh,danielle,I thought you'd be with mr.Faladi tonight.

679
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,570
Oh,you'll be happy to know he dumped me.

680
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,640
He dumped you?

681
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,830
Said it was getting too messy,that I was gonna complicate his divorce.

682
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,430
Don't pretend you're sorry.

683
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,070
I don't plan to.

684
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,780
Well,I hope this doesn't make history class too awkward.

685
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,500
Oh,you don't have to worry about that.

686
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,570
I went to the principal and got his ass fired,and then when he called to yell at me for squealing on him,

687
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:33,600
I recorded the call and sent a tape of it to his wife.

688
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,490
Thanks to me,he'll be getting nothing in this divorce.

689
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,820
Well,I must say that was rather underhanded.

690
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,370
Yes.

691
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,530
I wonder where she gets it.

692
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,400
-bye,daddy. -Bye,hipmunk.

693
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,810
I'll see you guys next friday,okay?

694
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,830
Kayla said that you're opening a pizza place.

695
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:01,720
Well,maybe.I mean,it's not a done deal yet.

696
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,810
lynette put the kibosh on it,huh?

697
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,170
What makes you say that?

698
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,880
well,you know...

699
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,690
lynette.

700
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,680
Well,she's probably right.

701
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,230
I mean,there's a bunch of dumb hmucks out there trying to open a restaurant,so...

702
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,630
you know,tom,I've tasted your pizza,and I have to be perfectly honest with you.

703
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,610
It was like I died and went to italy.

704
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,940
Really?

705
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,950
Oh,my god.

706
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,130
You are born to do this,and I just hate to see you give it up,because,well...

707
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,690
man,this is none of my business,but lynette does...

708
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,840
bully you sometimes.

709
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,400
Well,she doesn't mean to.

710
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,490
Then don't let her!You go to the mat on this one.

711
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,110
She will respect you a lot more if you grow a pair.

712
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,570
I'm not trying to insult you.

713
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,250
All I'm saying is that...

714
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:06,560
I know what you're capable of,and I believe in you.

715
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,910
I really needed to hear that.

716
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,830
thanks.

717
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:31,020
Sabotage--everyone is capable of it,but some go about it  more ruthlessly than others...

718
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,090
like the ones  who crave vengeance...

719
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,320
Or the ones  who hunger for love...

720
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,750
or the ones who are determined  to burn bridges.

721
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,080
And then there are those  who simply want something...

722
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,810
I wish daddy lived here so he could tuck me in,too.

723
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,530
Something that belongs  to someone else.

724
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,310
I'm working on it,piglet.

725
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,880
Mama's working on it.
