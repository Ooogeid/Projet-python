<i>Previously on??...</i>

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,100
Do you do weddings?

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,900
Oh, my goodness. Are you two...

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,600
Yes. Yes, we're getting married.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,400
- Oh, my god!
- Congratulations.

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,000
Those in love made the next step...??

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,500
or tried to.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,800
I need more from you.

9
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,000
Gaby, i can see them.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,200
That's wonderful!

11
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,900
Eyes were opened
in more ways than one...

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,300
the key is this doctor guy.

13
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,100
Maybe we should just
bite the bullet and go to boston.

14
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,500
You break up my family.
You burn down my business.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,900
I didn't burn down your club.

16
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>And a threat was made.</i>

17
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,700
Someday, you'll be
walking home from school,

18
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,500
And you'll just disappear.

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,900
Poof!

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,000
<i>There are important events
In the history of every family...</i>

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>Joyous births...</i>

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,200
<i>Tragic deaths...</i>

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,700
<i>Sublime weddings.</i>

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,500
<i>But the one event every family dreads
Is the moment when they finally meet...</i>

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
<i>The in-Laws.</i>

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,100
Mom, this is alex's mom melina cominis.

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,900
It's a pleasure to meet you.

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,900
Likewise, and thanks again
for letting me stay here.

29
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,400
I just can't afford a motel right now.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,100
alex mentioned that
you were laid off from your job.

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm so sorry.

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,400
Oh, that's okay.

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,200
You know what they say--

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,000
In a bad economy, The mature cocktail
waitress is the first to go.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Really? They say that?

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,100
Mom, we're gonna go get your luggage.

37
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,700
That way, you two can get acquainted.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,800
Thank you again For making
the long drive down from oakdale.

39
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,100
It's high time our families got together.

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,200
Absolutely.

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,100
Now speaking of family get-Togethers,
That reminds me-- I call christmas.

42
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,600
What?

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,100
Now that the boys are getting hitched,

44
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,400
We're gonna have to
split the holidays, so...

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,000
I call christmas.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,100
Wait, wait, wait. This is not
how we decide family get-Togethers.

47
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,300
What's the problem?
I'm letting you have thanksgiving.

48
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm a caterer.

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,000
I oversee events on thanksgiving.
It's the one holiday that i don't need.

50
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
Great. I call thanksgiving.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,400
Stop that! You can't call
all the major holidays.

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,500
No one's called easter yet. Going once...

53
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
I am not bidding on time with my son.

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Going twice...

55
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,400
melina, this is childish!

56
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,500
My hand's going up.

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,400
Fine! I call easter.

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
That wasn't so hard, was it?

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,600
Look, i know it's very difficult For
two families to negotiate the holidays,

60
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,700
But i feel strongly That this is
not the best way to handle it,

61
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,900
And i'm sure that
the boys would agree with me.

62
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Hey...

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,600
I called christmas fair and square,
And i wanna spend it with my son.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
So if you go to the boys
and try and screw me over,

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
<i>I'll remember that
for a really long time.</i>

66
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,500
Got it?

67
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,800
<i>Yes, there are important events
in the history of every family.</i>

68
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,300
<i>Meeting the in-Laws is one.</i>

69
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,400
Look at you two. Have i told you
how great you look together?

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Have i?

71
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,600

And i think the best way to celebrate

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,500
Is for my sexy husband
to take me out dancing.

87
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,800
Oh, babe. Not tonight.

88
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,200

And instead of letting me help you,
You're shutting me out.

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,700
I just don't like
to talk about my troubles.

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
And i don't like sitting at home doing
nothing When i feel like dancing.

Drag queens get their first drink free.

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Okay, well, let's try something easier.

141
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,800
After you left mr. Schilling's nightclub,
Where did you go first?

142
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,900
I don't recall.

143
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,200
Did you maybe drive somewhere?

144
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,200
Okay, porter, when the d.A.,
who also has this police report,

145
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,400
Asks you these questions,

146
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,900
And you suddenly "don't recall"
anything you said, That's bad.

147
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,100
Bob, you've been going
at this for over an hour.

148
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,200
Why don't we take a break?

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,300
Fine. Porter, go and chill.

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,300
I need to talk to your parents anyway.

151
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,200
Okay, what's going on here?

152
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Nothin'. You know, porter's just nervous.

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
He was also nervous
when i first interviewed him in jail,

154
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,700
But he was still able to
keep his story straight.

155
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Preston!

156
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,100
Where's my cd player?!

157
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,900
What?

158
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Parker saw you take it.

159
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,000
Mom, please tell preston
to stop taking my stuff.

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,200
Honey, that's porter.

161
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
No, it isn't.

162
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,900
Oh. Right.

163
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,700
Sorry.

164
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,000
You guys have something
you wanna tell me?

165
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,600
Gaby, you should've come.

166
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
You missed a beautiful walk in the park.

167
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,200
Mommy, look at what we found!

168
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
A ladybug!

169
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
Neat!

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,700
Why don't you guys go
wash your hands for lunch?

171
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Oh, look at her teeny black polka dots.

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
There's so many beautiful things
i used to take for granted

173
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Before i lost my sight.

174
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,600
Yeah, pretty.

175
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,000
What? You're gonna be late for work.

176
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,900
Yeah, about that...

177
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,100
I should've told you before...

178
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,000
What?

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,100
I don't want to give massages anymore,
So i quit the country club.

180
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,700
You quit?! Why?

181
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,400
Okay, i know this is gonna sound bad...

182
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,700
When i was blind,
i never realized that...

183
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
Naked people are gross,

184
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,400
especially the middle-Aged slobs
That belong to this country club.

185
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,100
Carlos, you don't just quit a job Because
of a few moles and a little back fat.

186
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,500
But i can find other work.

187
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,200
Now that i have my vision back,
the world is my oyster.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,100
In the meantime,

189
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,300
I just wanna spend a few days
with my daughters

190
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,300
And smelling the roses,
soaking in nature.

191
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,500
Like that beautiful spider right there.

192
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,500
God's perfect design.

193
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,700
Isn't it amazing?

194
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,800
Yeah, it sure is.

195
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,300
I'll get you the want ads.

196
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,800
What's all this?

197
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,200
andrew thought it would be nice To
have a formal dinner tomorrow night.

198
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Well, if it's a formal dinner,

199
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,600
Why aren't we using
your grandmother's tablecloth?

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,400
For melina? She'd probably
blow her nose on it.

201
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,100
No, i will not let that woman
defile nana's lace.

202
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,500
I know melina isn't what we hoped for,
But let's face it-- In-Laws rarely are.

203
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,700
Need i remind you of my mother?

204
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,100
Well, at least gloria had the good taste
To have a paralyzing stroke

205
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,800
So we don't have to deal with her.

206
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
True. That was a merry christmas.

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,500
But melina appears to be
in tragically good health,

208
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,400
Which means we've got Quite a few
beer-Drenched holidays ahead of us.

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,900
You have got to figure out
some way to be nice to her.

210
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know if i have it in me.
She's such a troglodyte.

211
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,600
Please.

212
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,500
No one's better At plastering on a fake
smile and pretending to like someone

213
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,000
Than bree hodge.

1
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,000
You're sweet.

2
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,200
all right. Get the lace tablecloth.
I will pretend to like this woman.

3
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Just like i pretended to like nana.

4
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
Bob, we're so sorry.
We meant to tell you. We really did.

5
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
So where the hell is porter?

6
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
We don't know.

7
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,000
That's why we've been trying to get you
To postpone the hearing date

8
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,300
until we could find him.

9
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh, we have a much bigger problem
than the hearing date.

10
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,800
What do you mean?

11
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Well, now that i'm aware of this,
I have a legalbligation to report it.

12
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,100
- What?! No, no, no, you can't--
- No! We can't--

13
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,500
Hey! Now my hands are tied.

14
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,100
But if the judge finds out
that porter's gone,

15
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,300
We have to forfeit the bail.

16
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,500
And since my genius wife
used our restaurant to post bond,

17
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,700
Our only source of income will vanish.

18
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,800
I feel for you guys. I really do.

19
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,100
But i'm not gettin disbarred over this.

20
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,900
Bob...

21
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,700
please. We're desperate.

22
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,100
I'm not meeting with the d.A.
For another two days.

23
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,300
If you find porter by then,
i won't say anything.

24
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,900
Thank you so much.
We are so sorry that we--

25
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,000
Just find him.

26
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,700
Yeah, yeah. I'm comin'.

27
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,500
Gabrielle solis?

28
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,900
Bradley scott. Remember?

29
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,900
Carlos and i did some business
back in his finance days.

30
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
right! How are you?

31
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,000
Good. Maria and i finally gomarried.

32
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,700
I started my own investment fund.

33
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,600
- How about yourself?
- Good, good.

34
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know if you heard--
Carlos got his sight back.

35
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,700
Oh, my--My god. I had no idea.

36
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,600
I know. Life is good.

37
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
Now all we have to do is find him a job.

38
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Well, your timing just
might be perfect here.

39
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Why? You need someone?

40
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
As a matter of fac i do.
Think he'd be interested?

41
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
I don't know.
I-I can't speak for carlos.

42
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
It's an upper-Level position
with lots of perks

43
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,100
And the salary's
in the high six figures.

44
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm now speaking for carlos.
He'll take it.

45
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,500
Great.

46
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,100
I'd kill to have carlos on my team.
That man was a shark.

47
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
- Have him call me.
- Yeah.

48
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,200
So long, sucka.

49
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,400
Hello.

50
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
Is dr. Heller in?

51
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,200
I'm sorry. He's not. Can i help you?

52
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,000
Not really.

53
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,900
See, we need to talk to him
about dave williams.

54
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,700
Dave williams?

55
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
Yeah. Dave is a patient of his.

56
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,400
I'm sure you know him--

57
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,900
Blond hair, blue eyes,
creepier than all get-Out.

58
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm not in a position to confirm that.

59
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,200
And i don't think the doctor Would
discuss his patients with you either.

60
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600
Oh, he'll talk to us.

61
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,300
Dave's been up
to some pretty sick stuff...

62
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,100
- yeah.
- And i-

63
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm bettin' dollars to doughnuts
dr. Heller Would wanna know all about it.

64
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,800
So when does he get here?

65
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,500
I couldn't say.

66
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,300
We'll wait.

67
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Is that a beer?

68
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,800
We're not in a position to confirm that.

69
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,000
Your new shoes are pretty.

70
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,900
Aren't they?
Daddy bought them for mommy--

71
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
He doesn't know it yet--

72
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,100
Because he has a wonderful new job.

73
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,000
He doesn't that yet either.

74
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,600
Good news! 

75
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
Me, too. Me first.

76
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,600
Remember bradley scott?

77
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,500
I ran into him today,
and he's giving you a job.

78
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,400
That's... nice.

79
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,200
But that's what i wanted to tell you.

80
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,600
I just got a job.

81
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,100
Fantastic!

82
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,900
Well, you didn't sign a contract
or anything, did you?

83
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,800
'Cause maybe we can
get them into a bidding war.

84
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,800
Unlikely. It's at the counity center.

85
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm gonna work with the blind.

86
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,600
Great.

87
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,900
And what's the signing bonus
for that--A cup of pencils?

88
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,300
<i>I thought you were gonna
get a better job.</i>

89
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,500
What happened to the world
being your oyster?

90
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,000
It's meaningful work.

91
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,200
Who cares? Bradley's offering perks.

92
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,300
What kind of perks is
this blind thing offering?

93
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,700
let me think...

94
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,100
Making the world a better place,
personal fulfillment.

95
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,700
Carlos, i've spent the last five years
working with the blind.

96
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,200
Trust me, it's not that fulfilling.

97
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Look, when i lost my sight,
those people were there for me.

98
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
i just wanna give something back.

99
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,900
Not to mention...

100
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
Bradley scott?

101
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,700
Kind of an ass.

102
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,700
No way i'm working for that guy.

103
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Hi, bradley, it's gaby solis.

104
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,000
I just talked to him, and he's intrigued.

105
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,000
How would you like to come over
for dinner And seal the deal?

106
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,500
This is so fun!

107
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,300
I haven't been out in ages.

108
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,800
Tonight, i am gonna...

109
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,400
* boogie-Oogie-Oogie *

110
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,100
You really haven't been out in a while.

111
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Go ahead.
What do you want to drink?

112
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,500
i'll have what you're having.

113
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,200
Cirrhosis of the liver,
coming right up.

114
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Hey, jackson.

115
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What?

116
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Really?

117
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Here you are.

118
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,200
Yeah, just taking in the scenery.

119
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,800
You know, we actually have Some very
comfortable patio furniture

120
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,300
in the backyard...

121
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,800
Along with a place
to put your recyclables.

122
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,300
No, i'm good here.

123
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,400
Hey!

124
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,200
Hi! What have you two been up to?

125
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
Edie was showing us some houses.

126
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,100
I didn't know know
you two were house hunting.

127
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,300
Yes. We've got to
get out of that apartment.

128
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,000
Did edie show you the adams house?

129
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
She did, and it's fantastic.

130
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,100
And if we could figure out a way to
move it Next to a toxic waste dump,

131
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
maybe we could afford it.

132
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Holy moly,
would you look at these prices!

133
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,400
You know, for this kind of money,

134
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,200
You could come up to my town And
get a 5-Bedroom house on the lake.

135
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm sure they could.

136
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,800
It's too bad your practice
is all the way down here.

137
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,900
<i>It is now,</i>

138
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,900
But it's not like there
aren't sick people in oakdale.

139
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,900
Who, undoubtedly,
already have doctors,

140
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,400
Just like your patients
in fairview have you.

141
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,500
Fine. Let them stay in
that teeny apartment.

142
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,200
Who cares if the other doctors
make fun of you?

143
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,800
You know, i think
we should talk about this.

144
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,400
You'd really like oakdale--

145
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,200
No traffic, fresh air.

146
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Hey, i'm open.

147
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,400
Maybe we can go up there
this weekend and look around.

148
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,400
What are you doing?

149
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,700
Just helping the boys
live the american dream.

150
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,300
I'll tell you what.

151
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,900
If the guys move up near me,
You can ha 'em for christmas.

152
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,300
I just wish there was some way
i could get back at bob.

153
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm so sick of his smug attitude.

154
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
"I'm the provider.
I bring home the bacon."

155
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,500
Well, you know what? I contribute, too.

156
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,900
I handle the bills. I clean the house.

157
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,800
I thought you had a housekeeper.

158
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,800
Jeez, you're an ugly drunk.

159
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,600
Come on. It's a joke.

160
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
What's with the face?

161
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,200
I just...

162
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,900
Jackson called earlier, and, um...

163
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,400
You know, he went to riverton
to visit his old art professor,

164
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,700
And she offered him a job.

165
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,400
That's cool.

166
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,300
And he wants me
to move there with him.

167
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,200
You gonna go?

168
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,300
Well...

169
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,000
I wanna be with him, so...

170
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
I think i have to.

171
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,300
<i>You're that serious about this guy?</i>

172
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,500
Yeah. Sure.

173
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Why not?

174
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,000
You sure you're not
just waiting for closing time?

175
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
What does that mean?

176
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,900
You know, 2:00 a.M., bar's closing.

177
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,200
You haven't found the perfect guy,

178
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,800
So you settle for... something like that.

179
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Oh, crap. Look away.
Look away. Look away.

180
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Lee, that is not what i'm doing.
Is jackson perfect? No.

181
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,300
But i don't think there is such a thing,

182
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,400
And i have a history
of sabotaging relationships.

183
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,100
No, i'm doing this.

184
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm moving.

185
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,600
Well, congratulations to you.

186
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,900
Scary guy's coming over.

187
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,000
I have to throw him off the scent.

188
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
Do you mind if i grab one of your boobs?

189
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Knock yourself out.

190
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,500
??

191
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,700
Jazz!

192
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,500
Oh, my god!

193
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,400
Why didn't you wake me?!

194
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,700
Bob is going to kill me.

195
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,200
But that was, uh, fun last night.

196
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,700
Different, but fun.

197
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,000
See ya.

198
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
??M, i talked to everyid in his
english class, The entire debate team.

199
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Porter hasn't contacted any of them.

200
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,600
Well, hurry home. We gotta
decide what our next move is.

1
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
All right. I love you. Bye.

2
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,000
Preston, why didn't you
pick up when i called you?

3
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,600
What?

4
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
I called you, like, five times.

5
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah.

6
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,400
See? You're not even on my call log.

7
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,800
Hey! Hey!

8
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Hey, dude. Is mom still there?

9
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Porter, it's mom. Where are you?!

10
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,800
Porter!

11
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,400
<i>- You know where he is!
- I don't. He won't tell me.</i>

12
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,200
But you have been talking to him.
What the hell, preston?!

13
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
I want my phone back.

14
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,100
Fine. You know what
you're going to do with it?

15
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,600
You are going to call your brother
And tell him to come home.

16
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,100
He's not coming home.

17
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,800
Mr. Schilling threatened to kill him.

18
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
What? What?!

19
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,400
That's why he ran away?

20
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,800
I thought he was afraid of going to jail.

21
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,400
Well, i'm sure warren schilling
was just trying to scare him.

22
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
??It worked! Rter's terrified!

23
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Okay, we'll get a--
We'll get a restraining order.

24
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,400
I don't think that's gonna stop this guy.

25
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
I can handle warren schilling.

26
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,100
But if porter doesn't show up for court,
We're gonna lose our restaurant!

27
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,100
A guy threatens to kill your son,
And that's what you're worried about?

28
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,900
No, i'm not gonna
let my brother risk his life,

29
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,000
So you and dad can sell pizza.

30
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,600
How do you sleep with
someone and not remember?

31
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,600
I don't know. I was drunk.

32
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,400
Okay, let's skip to
the important part--Who was it?

33
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,600
Just a friend.

34
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Oh, gaby,

35
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,800
Do you think i did this subconsciously

36
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,700
Just to sabotage
my relationship with jackson?

37
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,200
It was tom scavo, wasn't it?

38
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,500
Will you stop guessing?

39
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,700
Oh, god! Why won't i
just let myself be happy?

40
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,900
Was it lou?

41
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,000
My mechanic? Are you crazy?

42
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,300
Come on. You were with a plumber
and a housepainter.

43
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,200
I mean, let's face it--
You like your service providers.

44
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,500
Susan, you home?

45
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,300
Bob!

46
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,200
what are you doing here?

47
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,000
Well... it's about lee.

48
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,100
He told me he took you out last night.

49
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,200
Yes. Uh, we had a very nice,
uneventful evening. Why?

50
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,300
What did he say?

51
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
<i>'Cause he was pretty drunk,</i>

52
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,600
So he was... probably making stuff up.

53
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,700
Well, he didn't come home.
He claims he spent the night here.

54
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh, my god.

55
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,800
Oh, hi, gaby.
I didn't know you were here.

56
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Never mind her. She was just leaving.

57
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,800
No. I think i should stay
and clean this up.

58
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,600
It's a... huge mess.

59
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,200
bob...

60
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,600
lee did stay here last night.

61
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,500
He slept on the couch...
in the guest room.

62
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,400
So you have nothing to worry about.

63
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,600
Oh, thank god.

64
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
I just had this awful feeling That
he spent the night with another man.

65
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,900
Lee wouldn't do that. He loves you.

66
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,800
I know he does,

67
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,900
But he's got a few drinks in him,

68
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,400
He'll bang anything
with a pulse and facial hair.

69
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,700
You still haven't heard from him?

70
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,500
For the 17th time...

71
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,800
No.

72
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,600
Where does she get off
having all that attitude?

73
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,700
She's young and pretty, and we're not.

74
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>She's not that pretty.</i>

75
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,000
I can hear every word you're saying.

76
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,400
<i>From all the way over there?
Boy, she is young.</i>

77
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,500
Look, i'm very tired,
so i'm going to break the rules.

78
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,300
Dr. Heller went on some sort of trip.

79
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,700
He should've been back a week ago,
And i don't know where he is.

80
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Why didn't you tell us that
in the first place?

81
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,700
Because it's none of your business!

82
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,200
Hello? Dr. Heller's office.

83
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,900
hey. It's david dash. Is he in?

84
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,700
Did you hear that?
He should've been back by now.

85
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,900
Why isn't he back?

86
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,800
I'm sorry, mr. Dash.
Dr. Heller's out of town.

87
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,500
What are you saying?

88
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
You think dave has something to do
With heller being late from vacation?

89
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,400
Don't ask me why, but i got
a feeling there's a connection.

90
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,500
Well, can i still
get a prescription refilled?

91
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,300
suRe.

92
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,000
Dr. Lybrand's on call. Could you
see him tomorrow round 2:00?

93
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,500
Actually, i've moved.

94
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,600
- You know what?
- What?

95
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
I'm done.

96
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,200
Meaning what?

97
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,100
I'm sure we can work it out.
What's your new address?

98
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,600
What, you're just gonna abandon me?

99
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,100
I went on this wild goose chase
as far as i could.

100
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh, don't--Please don't go, roberta.

101
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,300
I need your help.

102
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,800
Then get somebody else.

103
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
I'm tapped out.

104
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,000
Roberta, wait!

105
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,500
"Wisteria lane."

106
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
What a lovely name.

1
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,300
Bree, you sure there isn't
anything i can do to help?

2
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,900
I'm just standing here
with my thumb up my butt.

3
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Uh, no help needed.

4
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,400
Certainly nothing
that would require your thumb.

5
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,500
Hey. Uh, sorry we're late.
We got hung up at the realtors.

6
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,900
Actually, you're right on time.
We're just about to eat.

7
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,700
Shall we?

8
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,000
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

9
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,200
Excuse...

10
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,900
Excuse me, melina.
That's my chair.

11
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,400
I just wanted to sit next to the boys.

12
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,300
Oh.

13
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,200
Well, did it occur to you I might
want to sit next to the boys?

14
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,800
Did it occur to you
that i already called it?

15
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,500
She did. She called it.

16
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
Why don't you sit here, bree?

17
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Guess who just called
the burnt lamb chop?

18
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,500
I just wanted to
see the look on your faces

19
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,400
When you heard my good news.

20
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,500
Really? What is it?

21
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, i told dr. Hardy
you're moving to oakdale.

22
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Uh, thinking about it.

23
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,100
They're thinking about
moving to oakdale.

24
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,100
Not after they hear this.

25
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,100
Anyway, he's retiring next month,

26
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,000
And he thinks you'd be
perfect to take over his practice.

27
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,300
Are you serious?

28
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,900
Wow, this could be
a good opportunity for us.

29
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,100
Yes. A good opportunity For andrew

30
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,400
to commute five hours to his job.

31
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,700
I don't know, alex.

32
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
This is all happening pretty fast.

33
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,600
But it's the only way
we're gonna be able to afford a house,

34
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,700
And if we're gonna have kids...

35
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,100
you're gonna have kids?

36
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,300
Oh, this is perfect!
I can look after them for you!

37
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,500
Oh! Let's toast to seal the deal.

38
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,000
Here's to oakdale.

39
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
I bought you the adams house!

40
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,900
- What?
- What?!

41
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
What?

42
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,000
It was going to be a surprise,
you know, for your wedding.

43
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Unfortunately, this
whole silly oakdale thing

44
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Has forced me to show my hand.

45
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,100
Mom, that's too generous.

46
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,900
Yes, that's, uh...

47
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,000
That's way too generous.
You shouldn't do that.

48
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,900
Oh, it's nothing you wouldn't do.

49
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,600
Bree, i don't know
what to say, except...

50
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,100
Thank you so much.

51
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,200
I really love you for this.

52
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Oh, and i love you, too.

53
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,600
Orson, dear, would you
pour melina another glass of wine?

54
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,700
Calling edie, are you?

55
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
You know it.

56
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,900
Hi, honey.

57
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,300
You remember bradley
and his wife maria.

58
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,700
They dropped by for dinner.

59
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,700
How fun.

60
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,900
Can i ask you something
about the trash cans?

61
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,900
Excuse me.

62
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,400
What is that miserable
s.O.B. Doing here?

63
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I already took the job
at the community center.

64
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,300
I know. Just listen to
what bradley has to say,

65
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,200
And if at the end of the evening
you're still not interested,

66
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,900
I support you completely. Deal?

67
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,500
If it'll get you off my back...

68
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,200
deal.

69
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,900
After i got concessions from the union,

70
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,100
I laid off a third of the workforce,

71
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,900
Outsourced another third.

72
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,800
A year later, i sold the company
for twice what i paid for it.

73
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,800
Wow. Impressive. Huh, carlos?

74
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,900
Very.

75
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It'll be a great story to
tell all the other c.E.O.S in hell.

76
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,900
Carlos, be nice.

77
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
No, it's fine.

78
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,400
Just taking care of my kids.

79
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Yeah. I've got a picture
of them in my purse.

80
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,900
Wanna see how many you can name?

81
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,900
More wine, maria?

82
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,600
So, bradley, if carlos
were to come work for you,

83
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,400
What would a typical week look like?

84
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,600
Oh, lots of high-End deal making,

85
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,600
Uh, international travel.

86
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,500
Oh, yeah. We travel
all over the world together.

87
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,400
It is so fun sitting alone
in a five-Star hotel

88
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,700
While your husband is
out crushing the third world

89
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,800
Under the heel of his jackboot.

90
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,700
You hear that, carlos?
Five-Star hotels.

91
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,400
Listen, bradley,

92
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Really appreciate the offer,
But i told you--

93
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,100
I already have a job.

94
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,600
Why can't you do your work
with the deaf on the weekends?

95
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,300
First of all,
because they're blind.

96
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
You tell him.

97
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,800
Um, honey, bradley's right.
You could take this job

98
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,300
And do your charity work in your free time.

99
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,700
No, don't listen to her.
You are a good man,

100
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,500
And you are going to help people.

101
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,800
And even if you
never end up making a penny,

102
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,600
You'll be worth more
than this soulless bastard.

103
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,900
I work very hard to
provide for you and the kids,

104
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,600
And i would like a little respect.

105
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,700
Well, you know what i would like?

106
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,300
A big divorce.

107
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,300
So...

108
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,900
Is eye care included in the health plan?

109
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,300
'Cause that's obviously
a big issue for carlos.

110
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,300
Daddy misses you so much.

111
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm so sorry.

112
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,900
Okay?

113
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,400
Bye-Bye! I miss you two so much.

114
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,300
Very soon, honey.

115
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,400
It's just a little teeny bit longer.

116
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh, my little girl.

117
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,600
You look so beautiful.

118
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
I've missed you so much.

119
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,300
We're gonna be together soon.
I promise you.

120
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,200
Just a teeny little bit.
It'll be fine. 

121
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,500
Dave?

122
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,500
Ow!

123
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,600
Aah!

124
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,700
I'm sorry. You scared me.

125
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,100
Who were you talking to?

126
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,600
No one.

127
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,200
I heard you.

128
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,600
Edie, please, j--

129
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm not feeling well.

130
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,600
Who the hell were you talking to?

131
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,500
Leave me alone.

132
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,400
Why did you turn down here?

133
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,900
I thought we were going to the store.

134
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,800
Mom, what is this place?

135
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,900
Before i became a mother,

136
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,200
I didn't know it was possible

137
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,600
To love another human being so completely,

138
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,600
And with that love comes this
need to protect you.

139
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,000
It wasn't a decision i made.

140
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,700
It's... primal.

141
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,800
It's just something in my d.N.A.

142
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,100
Whatever it is,

143
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,400
It makes me not care about myself,

144
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,200
And it reminds me

145
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,300
That my reason for being on this planet

146
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,900
Is to look after you kids.

147
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,700
Why are you telling me this?

148
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,100
Yesterday, you said

149
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,300
Warren schilling will kill porter

150
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,800
If he gets the chance.

151
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,200
I will never let that happen.

152
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,900
Mom, where are we?

153
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,700
You see that bar?

154
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,800
Warren schilling goes there every night.

155
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
All right, come on!

156
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,800
Tonight, when he leaves...

157
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm gonna do what i have to,
to make sure my family is safe.

158
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
So...

159
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,700
I need you to get out now.

160
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,600
You can't be in the car when this happens.

161
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,000
Are you serious?

162
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,800
You're gonna run him over?

163
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,100
Like i said, it's in my d.N.A.

164
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,700
That could be him.

165
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Get out.

166
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,600
Get out! Get out!

167
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
Okay! Stop it! I get it!

168
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll call porter and tell him

169
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,900
He doesn't have to
worry about mr. Schilling.

170
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,900
And you will convince him
to come back home.

171
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,700
Shut the door.

172
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,700
So...

173
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,800
Remember how you said
i just had to hear bradley out,

174
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,200
And then whatever i decided,
you'd support me?

175
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Well, you may be surprised,

176
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,000
But i am ready to render my decision.

177
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,200
Let me lay it out for you--

178
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,000
Either i do something fulfilling

179
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,500
Where i help other people
and feel good out myself,

180
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,800
Or i take a job i hate
where i make a lot of money,

181
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,300
But it eats my life and crushes my soul.

182
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,100
Hang on. Before you do that,
let me lay it out for you.

183
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,300
Either you let your family
continue to sacrifice

184
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,500
So you can feel good about yourself,

185
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,200
Or you grow up

186
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,900
And make real money

187
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
And look after us

188
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,500
Like we've been looking after you
for the past five years.

189
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,400
You know what these jobs are like, gaby.

190
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,300
I'd never be home.

191
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,200
And when i was,
i'd be tired or irritated.

192
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,900
It will take a toll on all of us.

193
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,200
It took a toll on us When we
couldn't pay the gas bill, carlos.

194
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,900
It took a toll on us When
juanita was sent home from day care

195
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,400
Because the check bounced.

196
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,100
But i handled it, and now
it's your turn to handle it.

197
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,800
Gaby, please don't make me do this.

198
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,300
Bradley? Hey, it's carlos.

199
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,500
Well, i've, uh, done some thinking,

200
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,100
And i actually...

201
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,200
I want that job,

202
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,100
If it's still on the table.

203
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,100
Yeah.

204
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,700
I was surprised, too.

205
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,200
Sounds great.

206
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,600
See you monday.

207
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,100
Hey, susan. I just made tea. Come on in.

208
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,200
Lee, um...

209
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,900
Well, there's just
no graceful way to ask this, so...

210
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,400
I'm just gonna say it straight out.

211
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
When you spent the night,

212
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,100
Did we get it on?

213
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,400
Ye gods, no. Are you insane?

214
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,400
Oh! So... nothing happened between us?

215
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Hello? Gay!

216
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,400
Listening to opera in a kimono.

217
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
What more do you need to know?

218
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,600
Oh, thank god.

219
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You know, when i woke up
next to you yesterday,

220
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,800
I just didn't know what to think.

221
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,400
But why would you think that?

222
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,900
'Cause you were mad at bob,

223
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,400
and i told you About how i
sometimes sabotage my relationships.

224
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,700
Ah. Well, you didn't.

225
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,300
Not this time, anyway.

226
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,400
Yay.

227
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,400
Now i can move in with jackson
with a clear conscience.

228
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,500
Good. Good.

229
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,800
Wait, so i just-- I have to ask.

230
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,100
Why exactly are you
moving in with jackson?

231
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
Because...

232
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,000
He loves me.

233
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,900
Do you love him?

234
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,100
I'm getting there.

235
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Don't you think maybe you should...

236
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,300
Wait until you've arrived?

237
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,200
Mike and i will never get back together.

238
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,600
I know that now.

239
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,400
And i really need to move on with my life.

240
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
You know moving on
doesn't have to mean moving in.

241
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,500
Jackson has made it pretty clear

242
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,300
That he doesn't do good
with long-Distance relationships.

243
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,700
- I could lose him.
- So lose him.

244
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,300
I'm not good alone.
I need a man in my life.

245
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,100
But why? We're so useless.

246
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,900
But you are fun to dance with.

247
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,400
I think you should
tell jackson you're not ready.

248
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,800
And if he ends up leaving,
Then, hell, i will dance with you.

249
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,100
At least until someone better comes along.

250
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,300
How does that sound?

251
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,800
If this is your attempt
at bedding me again, miss mayer,

252
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,700
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

253
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,200
C

254
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Mom really wants to talk to you,
just for five seconds.

255
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,200
Do it for me, okay?

256
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,500
Sweetie, where are you?

257
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,700
I don't want to tell you.

258
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,300
Porter...You have got to come home.

259
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,300
Everything will be fine. I promise.

260
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,000
How? Either warren schilling
kills me, or i end up in jail.

261
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,500
We can get a restraining
order to protect you,

262
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,300
And bob thinks there's a good shot
At getting the case dismissed.

263
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,500
You know, i've been reading
the fairview papers online.

264
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,900
Everybody thinks i did it.

265
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
There is not a shred of
evidence against you.

266
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,300
When people see that,
they will be on your side

267
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,300
Just like we are.

268
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,100
Sweetie, you have to trust me.

269
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,200
I do trust you. It's just i--

270
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Don't fall for it, kiddo.

271
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,500
I trusted her once,
and look where it got me.

272
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,900
Good morning.

273
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,100
Is it? I didn't get a lot of sleep.

274
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,000
Okay, about last night, uh...

275
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,700
I'm sorry.

276
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,300
Let me stop you right there.

277
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,500
I don't need an apology.
I need an explanation.

278
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
And...

279
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,100
if you can't give me one...

280
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,100
I'm thinking we're finished.

281
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,300
Look, i'm just stressed out.

282
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Stress doesn't make you
talk to people who aren't there.

283
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,100
What is going on?

284
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,700
Okay.

285
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,700
Before we met,
i was married to someone else.

286
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,500
But she died.

287
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,400
And last night she was...

288
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,800
Sort of on my mind.

289
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,000
You were married before?

290
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,100
She's dead, edie.
What does it matter?

291
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh, it matters.

292
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,300
You have until tonight

293
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,400
To get your things together.

294
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,400
Then i want you out of my house.

295
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,700
<i>Everyone needs a lovely home in suburbia,</i>

296
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,300
<i>Mostly so the neighbors will never suspect</i>

297
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,900
<i>What's going on inside.</i>

298
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,200
<i>Behind these freshly painted walls</i>

299
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,500
<i>You will find...</i>

300
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,100
<i>Parents wracked with guilt...</i>

301
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,100
<i>Wives tired of struggling...</i>

302
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,900
<i>Lovers who have been lied to...</i>

303
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,600
<i>Yes,</i>

304
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,900
<i>everybody needs
a lovely home in suburbia...</i>

305
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,000
<i>If for no other reason
than to have a place...</i>

306
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,600
<i>To come home to.</i>
