1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,310
Previously on Desperate Housewives

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,220
I love you.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,000
You're having sex with your best friend's mother?

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,780
An affair was revealed...

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,260
You must promise me that you won't say anything to her psycho husband.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,430
A good time was brought to an end...

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,750
-Back off! -Who do you think you are talking to?

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,050
We're done here. Good bye.

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,390
And a man's past was uncovered...

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,460
We're just trying to get some info on this guy. He just moved to fairview,

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,110
And he's really creeping people out.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,130
You're in fairview?

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,670
Yeah. Why? Does that mean something to ya?

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,630
Once a year, the owner of the white horse bar

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,970
Would host a competition known...

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,490
As the battle of the bands.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,840
Give it up for Cold Splash.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,560
And young musicians would come...

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,010
With their drums...

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,770
And guitars...

21
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,720
And dreams of stardom.

22
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,040
This year, those young musicians

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,030
Were joined by a group of middle-aged men...

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,910
Who came with their stiff joints...

25
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,540
And high cholesterol...

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,810
And dreams of being young again...

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,560
If only for one night.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,690
God, look at those guys. They'er so young.

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,090
No wonder they went first. They probably have homework.

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,330
Would you guys relax?

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,710
Rock 'n' roll's not just for young people.

32
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,510
Why are they so loud?

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,900
Not helping, carlos.

34
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,320
They're really good, and we're really old enough to be their fathers.

35
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,820
Okay, we may look a little old up there, and we may hit a few clams,

36
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,470
But who cares we're here to have fun. Yeah, tonight we're not the

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,350
Plumber and a masseur and a guy that makes pizzas.

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,170
We're a rock 'n' roll band right, dave?

39
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,950
Absolutely. Look, I've gotta check with the guy about the light cues.

40
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,760
You're sure we're not gonna humiliate ourselves?

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,300
I promise you it'll be a night to remember.

42
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,030
And it was...

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,110
...In ways they could never have known.

44
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,430
Oh, my god! Fire!

45
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,960
It's locked.

46
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,870
Straight back.

47
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,670
The next morning, news of the tragedy began to spread...

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,480
Along with rumors that the blaze had been set intentionally.

49
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,910
It wasn't long before the police began using the word "arson"...

50
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,650
And someone was taken into custody.

51
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,160
The Day Before

52
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,020
Oh! Look at my little girl.

53
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,890
Isn't she adorable? Oh, I missed her so much.

54
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,240
Oh, I can't wait to meet her. Oh, not yet.

55
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,760
I wanna give her new boyfriend the once-over wow.

56
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,200
He's as cute as she said-- nice smile, and look at that hair

57
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,670
Don't you just wanna run your fingers through it?

58
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,680
Fortunately for you, no.

59
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,900
You know, I'm very good at first impressions.

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm gonna like this guy.

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,630
Why is the cab driver handing julie's boyfriend money?

62
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,630
Why is julie's boyfriend getting back in the cab?

63
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,210
And why is the middle-aged cab driver kissing julie?

64
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:35,420
I think what's goingn is-- I know what's going on. Let me enjoy my denial.

65
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,340
Honey, I'm home. You wouldn't believe the traffic...

66
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,470
Hello, gabrielle.

67
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,010
Virginia came by to say hello.

68
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,540
Isn't that a nice surprise?

69
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,410
I have news I wanted to share.

70
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,880
You don't seem happy to see me.

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,570
Well, maybe that's because the last time we spoke,

72
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,690
You called me a greedy bitch, and I called you a scary old hag.

73
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,830
Weren't we a fine pair of hotheads.

74
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,270
But what family doesn't have its squabbles?

75
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,260
Family?! Lady, you had carlos fired.

76
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,220
That was a terrible misunderstanding.

77
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,310
And she straightened it out, and I got my job back.

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,020
Isn't that nice? Delightful.

79
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,460
Now leave before there's a terrible misunderstanding between

80
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:23,780
My foot and your ass gaby, could I see you in the kitchen... Now?

81
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,810
Save your breath, carlos.

82
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,270
There is no way we're letting grandma screw-loose back into our lives.

83
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,090
She put us in her will oh, my god! That woman is crazy.

84
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,310
Is she crazy or just desperately lonely?

85
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,550
I don't care. All she wants is some human contact--

86
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,400
To hang out with us on the occasional weekend,

87
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,600
Maybe a holiday or two. Right, and in exchange,

88
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,000
When she finally kicks the bucket, we wind up with a lamp.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,620
I'm sorry, carl we're the sole heirs of her entire fortu

90
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,830
And her blood pressure is 220/90.

91
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,950
Virginia! Why can't I stay mad at you?

92
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,830
All right, then, we'll see you soon.

93
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,490
The reporter's almost here. I am so nervous.

94
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,670
Why? You've done lots of interviews.

95
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,400
That w all local. This is "the new york dispatch."

96
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,080
If this goes well, my cookbook could be on the front page of

97
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,220
Their weekend style section.

98
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,670
Katherine, what did you do to your hair?

99
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,660
I've never seen it look so thick and lustrous.

100
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,630
I'm already planning to say nice things about you.

101
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,980
Good. I can check that off my list.

102
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,610
When's the reporter coming?

103
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,810
Any minute. Oh, my gosh, andrew. Don't you look sharp today?

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Don't worry. I-i won't tell her I'm gay. Check and check.

105
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,510
Mom, do you ow anything about this reporter?

106
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,140
Only that her name is sandra birch.

107
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,660
We just spoke, and she seemed very nice. She isn't.

108
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,550
I went online and pulled a bunch of her articles, and a lot of them are

109
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,330
Complete hatchet jobs. "a deeper look suggests something darker,

110
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,570
"something more ominous, a woman whose perky surface conceals a deep,

111
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,230
Almost demonic thirst for power. I doubt betty white saw that comi

112
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,330
Mom, if this woman tanks you, I could kill sales of the book.

113
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,560
You're gonna have to figure out a way to handlthis. Knock, knock?

114
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,050
I'm looking for bree.

115
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,770
You must be sandra.

116
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,230
What a sharp outfit.

117
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,130
And look at that hair-- so thick and lustrous.

118
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,240
Um... Mom, you got a minute?

119
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,940
I do. Why do I have a sense you're gonna take it away from me?

120
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,270
Porter got anne schilling pregnant.

121
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,040
Mom, are you okay?

122
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,920
Oh, yeah, I'm great. That it?

123
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,300
No. There's more.

124
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,940
They're planning to run away.

125
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,840
Okay. Well, your minute's up.

126
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,280
Aren't you gonna go talk to him?

127
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,130
No, I have to talk to someone else first.

128
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,580
Remember when you left that soda can on the coffee table,

129
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,210
And it left a ring, and I yelled at you I take it all back

130
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,200
And we always sell out, so I want the band there by 6:00.

131
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,710
Any questions?

132
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,850
Sounds good. When are we on?

133
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,640
Sec ond. You got the primo spot as a favor to my wife.

134
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,420
Since she rented you the space, she feels like part of the band.

135
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,330
Well, rock on, anne schilling.

136
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,900
If she requests "free bird," we're doing it.

137
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,810
Hey, uh, tom, I saw porter at my house the other day.

138
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,020
Yeah, he and kirby were shooting hoops.

139
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,890
I can't believe how big he's getting. Yeah.

140
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,620
They grow up fast, huh?

141
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,270
Yeah. Little too fast.

142
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,850
Uh, hey, doc, I know I owe you a phone call.

143
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,960
I'm gonna cut to the chase, dave.

144
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,140
Are you in fairview?

145
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,890
What? Where did that come from?

146
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,970
Doesn't matter where it came from.

147
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,100
Are you in fairview?

148
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,490
Look, I don't know what brought this on, but I'm really busy right now.

149
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,020
I'll call you tomorrow. I promise.

150
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,810
And we can talk about it then. Okay? Bye.

151
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,880
Excuse me.

152
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,750
Could you tell me how to get to wisteria lane?

153
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,230
So there we were, huddled under this broken umbrella, and...

154
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,440
He just kissed me.

155
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,050
It was so romantic.

156
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,650
She's skipping the part where one of the spokes got me in the eye.

157
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,920
Julie, I'm gonna take your suitcases upstairs now, okay?

158
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,900
Oh, I'll come with you. I need to check my e-mail.

159
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,070
Be right back.

160
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,840
So, susan, I'm...

161
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm sensing that, uh, you're a little freaked out about my age.

162
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,060
You know, when your 24-year-old daughter calls you and tells you

163
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,610
She's bringing home a boy from college, you sort of expect it to be, well

164
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,510
A boy.

165
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,350
Well, I just want you to know that we didn't srt dating until after the

166
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,830
Semester was over I don't date students. That's-that's a rule with me.

167
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,600
And a damn good one.

168
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,030
Although strictly speaking, I suppose my third wife was my teaching assistant,

169
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,620
But she was really more of my employee than my student.

170
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,830
-Your what? -Student.

171
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,040
Before that. Employee.

172
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,690
Before that. Third wife.

173
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,000
That's the one.

174
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,120
So you've been married three times?

175
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,890
Didn't julie tell you that? I don't believe so.

176
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,870
Although I may have blacked out after she told me you were 40.

177
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,910
So how does a man your age get married and divorced three times?

178
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,350
Well, my first wife and I were only married a few months,

179
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,430
So i-i almost don't like to count it.

180
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,630
Did someone throw rice at you? Yeah.

181
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,960
It counts.

182
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,280
Is this upsetting you? I-i thought you'd understand.

183
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,560
Julie said you'd been divorced yourself.

184
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,350
Yeah. Only twice.

185
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,340
Two. Small number. Much smaller than three.

186
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,270
And my first cheated on me, so that doesn't even count.

187
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,210
Did someone throw rice at you? Shut up.

188
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,280
Look, you and I both know that sometimes it just doesn't work out.

189
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,410
That's true.

190
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,450
And besides, it--it's different with julie. I love her so much.

191
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,630
It's very important that you know I take my commitments seriously.

192
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,760
Why?

193
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,400
Oh, my god.

194
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,510
Lloyd, come here.

195
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,340
I can't find my cell phone charger.

196
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,710
Please, please, don't say anything.

197
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,260
I want it to be a surprise. Thanks...

198
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,320
Mom.

199
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,860
And this is my own little kitchen.

200
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm pretty sure my husband's here somewhere.

201
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,710
Orson, dear, are you decent?

202
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,960
In here, love.

203
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,850
Nice to meet you.

204
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,520
I've had the most delightful time with your wife and stepson.

205
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,130
Your home is stunning.

206
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,790
You cannot run a business and do all this, too.

207
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,740
Tell me you have a housekeeper.

208
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,100
Why would I pay someone to do work that gives me such joy?

209
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,420
Now who wants a little snack?

210
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,200
Bree, the idea was for me to spend a typical day with you.

211
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,520
So this is legit?

212
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,760
You're really this donna reed housewife from the '50s?

213
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,570
You say that like it's a bad thing.

214
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,930
I think that decade had a lot to recommend it.

215
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,150
Mm, people had values then-- values this family strives to uphold.

216
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,520
But not everyone can keep a perfect house for a perfect

217
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,200
Family with perfect food and perfect flowers.

218
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,840
Of course they can. If they read my book, that is.

219
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,230
Okay, truth be told...

220
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,150
I'm far from perfect.

221
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,090
Only yesterday, I burned a whole tray of biscotti.

222
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,410
And to think, I was worried about finding a lead.

223
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,820
Andrew, please. The machine can get it.

224
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,850
We never answer the phone while entertaining.

225
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,950
So rude to one's guests. Mm.

226
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,980
Now, um, may I pour you some more tea?

227
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,070
This is mr. Jones for orson hodge.

228
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,410
Due to vacation schedules, I'll be filling in for your parole officer.

229
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,010
Give me a call, please.

230
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,870
So, mr. Hodge...

231
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,880
You've been to prison.

232
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,180
Now can I be gay?

233
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,370
Kirby, is that you?

234
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,540
I thought you went to the movies.

235
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,120
Are you really pregnant?

236
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,600
Yes.

237
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,500
A couple of months back, warren and i...

238
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,860
W-we fought.

239
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,820
I was pretty banged up, and--and...

240
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,640
Porter came by looking for kirby, and--and...

241
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,790
He was so...

242
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,970
Kind and... And gentle.

243
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,120
Don't.

244
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,640
Don't try and justify this. This is sick.

245
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,820
You are sick.

246
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,980
Your son...

247
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,220
Loves me.

248
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,130
And--and I love him.

249
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,810
And--and--and you know what?

250
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,890
I'm glad I'm having porter's baby.

251
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,160
Damn.

252
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,930
Not exactly what a husband wants to hear coming in the door.

253
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,760
I suppose dinner's not ready, either.

254
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,210
Warren, I'm sorry that-- thank you.

255
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,550
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

256
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,670
Don't go.

257
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,510
I need to talk with my wife right now.

258
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,820
I'm sorry for any pain this has caused your family, mrs. Scavo.

259
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,370
Damn it.

260
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,780
You think you can humiliate me?! You piece of filth! Aah!

261
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,550
Get off of her! Get off of her! I'm calling the police!

262
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,010
Stay out of this! Aah!

263
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,170
Okay, well, just so you know, I hit back.

264
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,470
Call the police.

265
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,120
I'd love to hear her explain her way out of statutory rape.

266
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,880
You don't live here anymore.

267
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,500
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

268
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,440
Thank you...For coming back.

269
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,380
Here we are, boys. Are you psyched or what?

270
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,170
Oh, I feel like I'm gonna puke again.

271
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,590
You guys cold splash?

272
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,850
Yes, sir.

273
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,260
"sir"?

274
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,140
We're blue odyssey. Yeah, I can see that.

275
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,580
So after the gig, we're having a party at our manager's loft.

276
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,820
You guys should come. Abso-tively.

277
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,640
We just gotta check with our wives.

278
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,200
Why were you talking to that woman?

279
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,470
She just walked up and asked if we knew you,

280
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,210
Wanted us to confirm a bunch of rumors. What kind of rumors?

281
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,800
Just... Stuff she'd heard around the neighborhood.

282
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,170
Were you really a boozehound?

283
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,600
Lee... No, I'm just saying, I wish I'd have known you then.

284
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,220
We'd have been such good friends.

285
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,780
She seemed to know an awful lot about you key word--"awful."

286
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,550
I cannot let this happen. I have to find her.

287
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,440
Well, she's gonna be at the battle of the bands tonight.

288
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,770
Why? She wants to hear orson, and I quote,

289
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,310
"sing harmony with the guy he tried to kill.

290
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,990
Oh, dear god. This woman is determined to make my life sound ten times

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,760
-Worse than it actually is. -yeah.

292
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,580
So was your first husband really into s and m hooker

293
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,000
And you wonder why we're never invited anywhere.

294
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,180
Okay, girls, mommy's leaving.

295
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,570
I love you!

296
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,760
I'm planning on having a massive hangover tomorrow,

297
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,290
So keep the girls up late so we can all sleep in.

298
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,050
My, don't you look festive.

299
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,190
Virginia.

300
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,760
What are you doing here?

301
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,500
What do you mean? We're going to watch carlos' band play.

302
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,350
You invited me this morning, remember?

303
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,220
No, uh, what I remember was you asking me to the movies tonight,

304
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,580
And me saying I couldn't because I was going to

305
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,890
Watch carlos' band play. You got invitation out of that?

306
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,300
Well, I'm here now, dear, and I have this lovely limo.

307
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,660
So come on. We'll ride over to the club in style.

308
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,590
Well, here's the thing.

309
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,580
I'm supposed to go with my girlfriends.

310
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,430
Oh, gaby, please, I was so looking forwardo this.

311
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,090
Don't make me go all alone.

312
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,530
Well, I guess we're all going to the same place.

313
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,650
I'll just see my friends there.

314
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,360
Oh, goody!

315
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,440
Dr. Smith to cardiac i.C.U.

316
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,210
Where's anne?

317
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,830
Oh! She's asleep. She's fine. What happened?

318
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,060
I went over to talk to anne about recent developments.

319
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,820
You went to her house? Yes, I did, porter. I had to talk to anne.

320
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,100
I didn't know that her husband was there, and he overheard us and...

321
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,240
The doctors say she's gonna be fine.

322
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,560
Porter, wh-- where are you going? Damn it!

323
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,450
"tonic water, bourbon, ketchup." this is your grocery list?

324
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,350
There's got to be something else on dave's phone bill that will help us.

325
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:05,120
Uh, there isn't oh, don't get broccoli. It is not your friend.

326
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,540
You're telling me that you cross-checked all those other numbers,

327
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,490
And there was nothing? Squat.

328
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,470
The key is this doctor guy. Yeah.

329
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,340
Maybe we should just bite the bullet and go to boston.

330
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,950
Yeah. Maybe we can get more out of him face-to-face.

331
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,350
Hey, you wanna go to a rock show tonight?

332
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,080
Me? With you?

333
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,400
Well, I'm a little out of your league, but if it'll get you there, sure.

334
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,870
I don't think I can, but thanks.

335
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,220
Here, in case you change your mind.

336
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,580
And then I noticed that maria's pockets were stuffed with silverware.

337
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,910
I'm telling you, it's impossible to find good help these days.

338
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,170
Well, you'll know soon enough when my cholesterol

339
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,510
Finally gets the better of me don't talk like that.

340
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,910
You want a cheeseburger or something?

341
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,430
That has got to stop. I'm gonna do something.

342
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,670
Why? Julie's a grown woman.

343
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,320
Uh-huh, she's a grown woman

344
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,790
With stars in her eyes who's in love with a 3-times loser.

345
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,160
If she wants to accept his proposal, that's her business.

346
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,410
But in the meantime, you're not gonna ruin his surprise.

347
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,430
Aren't i? No.

348
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,800
Aren't i? No.

349
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,070
You're right.

350
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,500
I'll stay out of it.

351
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,750
Oh, now where is the little girls' room?

352
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,750
Hey, why did that guy hand you a cd?

353
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,560
Your name isn't julie, is it? No. Why?

354
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,460
Well, there's a song on there he wants me to play.

355
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,670
I guess he's gonna propose to his girlfriend or something. Tonight?!

356
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,060
Isn't that lovely?

357
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,820
Hey, you two. What's going on?

358
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,960
Um, nothing. What's going on with you?

359
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,960
Oh, I just love this song.

360
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,440
And jackson doesn't like to dance, so...

361
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,010
Isn't this fun?

362
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,610
It was.

363
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,050
Oh, reminds me of being young and single.

364
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,960
Oh, I wish I'd never given up that.

365
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,380
Uh... Yeah, susan.

366
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,580
Listen, uh, I don't want to, uh, sound rude or anything,

367
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,150
But this is really a-a moment that's meant for two right! Right

368
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,720
You mind easing away so I can dance with my dauter?

369
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,310
Susan?

370
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,990
What are you doing?

371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,420
I'm... Just movin' to the music.

372
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,750
Mm, yeah. You're coming with me.

373
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,220
Uh, no. No. No, no.

374
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,630
No! No, no, no! Oh, all right!

375
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,860
But no matter what he asks you, promise me you'll say "no."

376
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,150
Susan!

377
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,040
Lloyd, I'm sorry. I can't help I i don't want my daughter to be

378
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,330
Someone's fourth wife wife? Were you gonna ask me to marry you?

379
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,260
Oh, uh, were we not clear on that by now?

380
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,830
You can't be serious. We've only been dating three months.

381
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,010
Well, yes, I know, but I have such a good feeling about us.

382
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,480
Right, better feelings than you had about wives one, two and three? Mom.

383
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,650
You are very sweet, but I'm not getting married...Ever.

384
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,920
"Ever"? W-what do you mean "ever"?

385
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,740
We'll talk about this later.

386
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,140
I just really need a moment to myself.

387
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,930
Thank you.

388
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,250
Bree, darling.

389
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,730
Spare me your "darling," sandra.

390
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,960
I know you've been trying to dig up dirt on me.

391
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,660
Mm, just doing my job.

392
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,960
And frankly, I didn't have to dig all that hard.

393
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,420
I wrote a cookbook, sandra-- meatloaf, pot pies, peach cobbler.

394
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,570
Why are you trying to crucify me?

395
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,780
Because it's not a cookbook, bree.

396
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,210
It's a "look how great I am" book--

397
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,450
One designed to make every woman who reads it

398
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,760
Feel like a failure if she doesn't measure up.

399
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,210
What you're selling's a total sham.

400
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,880
But it isn't, sandra, because I don't think I'm great.

401
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,440
I have fallen down more times than I can count,

402
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,570
Just like so many other housewives out there,

403
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,210
We're all just barely holding on, and we all think that we're alone.

404
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,670
So maybe you're right. Maybe it isn't a cookbook.

405
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,400
It's a lifeline from me to those other women,

406
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,650
Because I want them to know

407
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,100
There's always a chance to get something right.

408
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,000
Even if it's just a casserole.

409
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,640
Why didn't you just tell me that right up front, bree?

410
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,000
That's an angle I can work with.

411
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,640
I got some good news today.

412
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,650
I've been speaking with the headmaster at greenbrier country day school,

413
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,670
And I got them to reserve two spots for the girls.

414
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,120
They start next term.

415
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,740
Well, thanks, but the girls already have a school.

416
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,340
Yes, I know--a public school.

417
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,740
This is a good school.

418
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,520
Virginia, they're happy where they are. They love fairview.

419
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,820
Besides, greenbrier's, like, an hour away. So I'll get them a driver.

420
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,030
That would be a real treat for them. No, I want them to be close by.

421
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,220
They could need me during the school day-- get sick or something. Oh,

422
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,850
That's what school nurses are for dear,

423
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,700
This is a decision I feel very strongly about,

424
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,840
I'm afraid I have to insist.

425
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,880
Excuse me. You don't get to insist on anything

426
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,430
When it comes to my daughters.

427
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,050
I think, given the extent of my investment in this family,

428
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,820
I should have some say. I'll just give you some time to think about i

429
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,790
I don't need any time to think about it. Keep your money.

430
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,510
Now you're being reckless.

431
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,920
You know something? I like money. I like it a lot.

432
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,160
A couple years ago, u could've bought me with that big fortune of yours.

433
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,980
But I'm a mom now, and I make the decisions for my kids.

434
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,100
And that is something that cannot be bought.

435
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,920
Gaby, I can make a decision, too.

436
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,630
I can call my lawyer tomorrow morning and take you out of my will.

437
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,320
And that is your right as a crazy old rich lady.

438
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,200
Thank you.

439
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,420
Screening your calls now, dave?

440
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,180
Let me guess.

441
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,480
You can explain everything.

442
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,940
I'm really, really sorry, doc.

443
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,390
You changed your name and didn't tell me.

444
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,760
You're living in fairview--

445
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,060
The one place you swore you wouldn't go.

446
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,290
I didn't change my name to be deceptive.

447
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,730
I just wanted a fresh start.

448
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,610
Fairview is not a fresh start for you.

449
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,670
My wife edie-- she's from here, and she really wanted to move back

450
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,500
And I said okay did you tell her your history?

451
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:07,640
Did you tell her why it's not healthy-- or safe.

452
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,460
For you to be here?

453
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:16,390
She knows everything, and I'm in a really good place right now.

454
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,880
But...

455
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,690
Can we talk about this after the show?

456
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,210
These guys...

457
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,370
They're my friends, and they're depending on me.

458
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,620
The moment you're finished playing.

459
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,600
Let's start this year's battle of the bands with our first group.

460
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,810
Give it up for cold splash!

461
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,010
Spare me the apology for butting into my life for the millionth time.

462
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,480
What is this about you never getting married? Why would i?

463
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,820
If there's one thing I've learned from your experience,

464
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,070
Marriage is a joke hey, I believe in marriage.

465
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,200
Why?

466
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,120
First there was dad, who left you for his secretary, and then mike...

467
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,550
He was the love of your life, and it still went to hell.

468
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,130
I mean, honestly... Just tell me what the upside is.

469
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,270
Oh, julie, you're way too young to be this cynical.

470
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,810
I am not cynical.

471
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,260
I'm realistic.

472
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,520
I'm... I'm just trying to protect myself.

473
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,320
Well, putting a wall around your heart doesn't protect you.

474
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,230
It just keeps people out. I learned that the hard way.

475
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,000
Now with jackson...

476
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,250
I remember that I like feeling hopeful.

477
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,020
I like believing in "happily ever after."

478
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,680
I really wish that you felt that way, too.

479
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,720
Sorry about the tip, but I just lost $50 million.

480
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,640
Excuse me.

481
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,320
Gaby, have you seen porter?

482
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,460
No, I haven't. Why? Is he supposed to be here?

483
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,690
No. So if you see him, please tell me.

484
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,210
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

485
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,810
Yeah, come on. Tonight, we're not a plumr and a masseur and

486
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,980
A guy that makes pizzas. We're a rock 'n' roll band right, dave

487
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,130
Absolutely.

488
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,660
Look, I'm gonna check with the guy about the light cues.

489
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,630
Hey, doc.

490
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,490
He's in your band?!

491
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,490
Oh.  I know.

492
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,260
It sounds crazy, but we've worked through everything.

493
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,990
It's cool.

494
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,520
No. This is too dangerous.

495
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,410
I need to speak to him right now.

496
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,260
Doc, you just have to trust me on this one, okay?

497
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,490
Now, dave. I speak to him right now...

498
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,050
Or I call the police.

499
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,720
Okay. You win.

500
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,170
Come on.

501
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,300
I hope you realize...I'm only doing this because I want to help you.

502
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,960
I genuinely care about you, dave.

503
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,150
I know you do, dr. Heller.

504
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,750
And I like you.

505
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,710
Actually, I like you a lot.

506
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,520
I'm sorry.

507
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,460
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

508
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,940
But I can actually smell our fear.

509
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,530
If I could see where the exits are, I'd run for 'em

510
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:11,200
I can't believe we let dave talk us into this. By the way, where is dave?

511
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,680
Hey, jackson. Where are you going?

512
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,630
The guys are about to start.

513
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,320
Uh, bathroom. Back in a sec. Oh, the men's room's packed,

514
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,380
But there's an employee bathroom back there.

515
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,830
Thank you.

516
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,190
Hey, dave, is that the bathroom?

517
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,590
No. I think that's it there.

518
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,350
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

519
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,510
We're up. Where the hell is dave?

520
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,330
Sorry.

521
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,980
We thought you ditched us. Where were you?

522
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,290
Needed a little liquid courage.

523
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,160
Come on, boys. Let's do it. Odyssey! Odyssey

524
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,730
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, the battle of the bands is back,

525
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,080
So please give a big welcome to blue odyssey

526
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,980
Hey  warren. Yeah?

527
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,690
Get up, you little basrd!

528
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,990
Don't you touch him! Don't you touch him!

529
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,190
Go home now! I know what you did to anne.

530
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,940
Better listen to your mommy, little boy. Go home.

531
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,410
You're dead. I don't care what it takes. You're dead.

532
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,930
Stop it! Go on! Go on! Go on!

533
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,240
Hitting women and children?

534
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,380
You must be so proud.

535
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,490
Lock that door.

536
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,920
What were you thinking?

537
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,620
You could've gotten hurt in there!

538
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,860
You are responsible for this. Whatever happens is your fault.

539
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,410
Oh, my god! Fire!

540
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,770
What's--what's happening?

541
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,800
Jackson-- he's in the bathroom. Oh, there's an exit there.

542
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,760
He'll get out. Come on. We have to go now.

543
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,060
Hey! Hey! Open up!

544
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,410
Gaby! Your friend!

545
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,850
Crap!

546
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,560
Come on. Let's get you out of here.

547
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,670
Let's go.

548
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,990
Hey, since I'm saving your life and all, you wanna think

549
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,320
About maybe keeping us in your will? No.

550
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,100
Eh, it was worth a shot.

551
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,250
It's locked.

552
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,800
Look out!

553
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,820
Quit pushing!

554
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,000
Come on. No, I gotta make sure everyone gets out of here.

555
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,970
Go! Go!

556
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,750
Don't push! One at a time!

557
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,590
Jackson  Jackson

558
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,100
What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!

559
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,180
Jackson--he's still in there. He's in the bathroom.

560
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,590
I'll get him. Go. Just go.

561
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,620
Mike-- get out! Go!

562
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,200
Jackson  Jackson

563
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,430
Jackson. Thank god.

564
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,970
Where's mike?

565
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,700
I don't know. I didn't see him.

566
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,630
Is he still in there? Yeah! He went in there to find you.

567
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,800
What? Mike? Mike's still in there?

568
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
Dave, no!

569
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,500
Mike

570
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,600
Mike

571
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,990
Mom! Dad. Aah!

572
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,040
Porter, I told you to go home. What are you doing here?

573
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,330
You! You son of a bitch!

574
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,270
You did this! What are you talking about? Stay away from my kid!

575
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,050
Your kid burned down my club.

576
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,600
Susan, do you think he's still in there?

577
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,260
I didn't see him.

578
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,240
Look, my husband's still inside.

579
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,540
You've gotta go back in there!

580
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,190
I'm sorry. That roof is about to collapse.

581
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,560
Now please get back.

582
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,920
Someone's coming!

583
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,640
Hang in there. I'm not done with you yet.

584
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,630
There was a fire last night in fairview.

585
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:06,020
If you open up your morning paper, you can read about those who survived..

586
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,960
And those who were injured...

587
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,420
Those who barely escaped with their lives...

588
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,690
And those who didn't.

589
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:28,770
You can also read about a man who risked his life to rescue his neighbor.

590
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,620
What you won't read about are the reasons for this bravery.

591
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,060
You're the one who pulled that guy out of the fire.

592
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,330
Can I interview you?

593
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,550
And that's because...

594
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,840
No one ever doubts...

595
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,840
A hero.
