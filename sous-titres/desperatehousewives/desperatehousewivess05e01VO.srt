00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:03,092
<i>Five years ago,</i>

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:07,030
<i>Susan Delfino Gave birth to a son
in delivery room "A"</i>

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,100
<i>Of Fairview memorial hospital.</i>

4
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:12,475
<i>Moments later,</i>

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:16,139
<i>Lila dash gave birth to a daughter
in delivery room "B."</i>

6
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,607
<i>Around 10:00 the next morning,</i>

7
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:24,736
<i>As the two new mothers
Were leaving the hospital,</i>

8
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:28,225
<i>They nearly Ran into each other.</i>

9
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,951
<i>Of course, They never knew this.</i>

10
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:35,963
<i>In fact,
Susan and Lila would have been</i>

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:40,073
<i>Surprised to know How often their paths
Would cross over the years.</i>

12
00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:44,999
<i>They almost met
At the local coffee shop...</i>

13
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:50,598
<i>and another time at
Their veterinarian's office...</i>

14
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,111
<i>and again in the bleachers
Of the Fairview flyers.</i>

15
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:00,376
<i>But despite These close calls,</i>

16
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:02,725
<i>Susan and Lila never met...</i>

17
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,031
<i>until one tuesday,</i>

18
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,781
<i>When Susan decided To take her husband
To a fancy restaurant</i>

19
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:13,551
<i>For their anniversary...</i>

20
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:17,718
<i>at the same time, Lila decided
To take her daughter</i>

21
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:19,290
<i>To buy some ice cream.</i>

22
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:23,169
<i>That was the night
That Susan Delfino</i>

23
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:24,821
<i>And Lila Dash</i>

24
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,132
<i>Finally ran into each other.</i>

25
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,072
Mike!

26
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:21,448
<i>It will happen to all of us
Eventually.</i>

27
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,787
<i>The moment will come
When we ask ourselves...</i>

28
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,148
<i>where did the time go?</i>

29
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,784
<i>How did the children
I once cradled...</i>

30
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:37,062
<i>grow up so very quickly?</i>

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,000
<i>How did the life I dreamt of...</i>

32
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,723
<i>turn into a career</i>

33
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,402
<i>I never expected?</i>

34
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,568
<i>And how did that woman
I saw each day in the mirror...</i>

35
00:02:57,814 --> 00:03:00,902
<i>become someone
I don't even recognize?</i>

36
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,456
Juanita, this dress
Is awfully tight.

37
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,891
- I don't think You can get into it.
- No, it's pretty.

38
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:09,133
I can do it.

39
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:11,008
How's that one fit?

40
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:13,267
I think we're gonna need
The next size up.

41
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:22,990
There is no Next size up.
They don't make princess dresses

42
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,249
For girls over 7.

43
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:25,874
She's only 4 1/2.

44
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:32,204
Look, my daughter was invited
To a princess party,

45
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:35,300
So I can't let her Be the only girl
there without a princess dress.

46
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:37,265
Did you try The costume section?

47
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:40,473
I bet they'd have a Mrs. Shrek
Dress that would fit her.

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,433
Juanita, take off the dress!
We're going.

49
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:45,979
No! I candoit.

50
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:49,766
Look, I feel for you.
My niece also has A weight problem.

51
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:51,734
My daughter does not have
A weight problem.

52
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:53,658
She has a little baby fat,
That's all.

53
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:55,702
In fact, The only problem she has
Is this store

54
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:59,331
Being completely unprepared
For a perfectly average 4-Year-Old girl.

55
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:06,519
Just ring it up.

56
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,018
No!

57
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:14,702
For God sakes. What's wrong now?

58
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:17,399
Once again,

59
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:20,483
The concept is, sweetie,

60
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:24,922
You're taking the pie Out of the oven,
Your face aglow With surprise.

61
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,423
Why am I surprised?

62
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:28,312
Because it turned out So perfectly.

63
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:31,120
That's no surprise.
My pies are always perfect.

64
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,447
All right. It's your best pie ever.

65
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,530
You've topped yourself.

66
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:40,742
And I know this Before I've tasted it?

67
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:44,705
Sweetie, just make
Whatever face you want.

68
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:46,643
I just think
You'll sell more cookbooks

69
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:49,167
If you don't look like
You just made love To an ice cube.

70
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:54,645
Andrew, dear, I'm going to
Take a little break.

71
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:56,473
Would you pleaseTell this gentleman

72
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,585
That if he calls me "sweetie"
One more time,

73
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:01,471
I'm gonna grab his camera
And take a picture of his colon?

74
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,588
You got that, right?

75
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:11,457
Katherine, hi.
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,025
The waiters need to be paid,

77
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,150
And you took the key
To the cashbox... again.

78
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,455
Sorry. Paid for what?

79
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:20,020
The armenian wedding?
Lunch for 300?

80
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,866
It was right after the breakfast

81
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:24,202
For the garden club,
Which you also missed.

82
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:26,625
I'm sorry. I didn't know a photo shoot
Would take this long.

83
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:28,748
Who knew it'd be this
Hard to pose for a book cover?

84
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:30,153
You'll be fine.

85
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:33,264
If there's one thing You're really
good at, It's posing as a chef.

86
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,242
Okay, Katherine.

87
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:39,019
I know this book has been
Monopolizing my time,

88
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,594
And you feel overworked And undervalued.
But I do appreciate you.

89
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:44,263
In fact, I have a gift for you.

90
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,014
It's the galleys Of my new book.

91
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:48,364
Read page 2.

92
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:52,834
"For Katherine Mayfair..."

93
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:54,323
"A wonderful cook"

94
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:56,566
"And an even better friend."

95
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,770
You dedicated it to me?

96
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,743
You make this All possible.

97
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:05,645
It's the least I could do.

98
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:08,087
Excuse me. Time is money.

99
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,028
Chop-Chop, sweetie.

100
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,664
Do we have a backup pie?

101
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,849
Yes. Yes, we do.

102
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:20,593
Good.

103
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:32,445
And the big blind...

104
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:35,870
catches a jack On the river.

105
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:40,903
- Preston?
- Mom!

106
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:43,340
What the hell's Going on here?

107
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,692
Don't freak out.
We're just playing cards.

108
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:48,619
Why didn't you Play at home?
Why did you Have to sneak in here?

109
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:50,836
Tequila shots! 5 bucks!

00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,918
Asked and answered.

111
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:57,921
Okay, that's it!

112
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,409
Everybody out. Game's over.

113
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,127
Can I have your chair For a second?

116
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:13,938
You guys have pulled
A lot of stupid stunts.

117
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,058
But this?

118
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:18,711
This? Risking our liquor license,

119
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:19,998
Our livelihood?

120
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:21,494
Who's going to find out? I mean,

121
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:24,249
we've been running this
Game for a month, and nobody...

122
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:29,458
Unbelievable. You guys
Are grounded for two weeks.

123
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:31,627
- But we have mecoming.
- Keep complaining.

124
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:34,385
I'd love to make it a year.
Now clean this place up. Now!

125
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,649
That was fantastic.

126
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,873
Amazing.

127
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,164
- You were incredible.
- So were you.

128
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:57,490
Oh. And...

129
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:01,460
Time to go.

130
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,603
So it's been, what, Four months?

131
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,826
Are you ever gonna
Let me spend the night?

132
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:12,994
I don't know.
Come on, zippy, zippy.

133
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:16,004
It's just, you know...

134
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,005
Girls usually beg me
To spend the night.

135
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,210
Good, then you shouldn't Have
any problem finding a place to sleep.

136
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,068
Fine. I know the drill.

137
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:25,630
I can't spend the night.
I can't meet your friends.

138
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,300
I can't meet your son.

139
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,512
I'm just wondering... Is this ever gonna
Turn into something normal?

140
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:33,713
You know, you're a guy,
And we just had hot sex,

141
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,817
And I didn't force you To cuddle.

142
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:38,145
So run! Go! Brag to your friends.

143
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:39,126

I like you,

145
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,069
And I know you like me.
So why can't we be a couple?

146
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:49,276
'Cause I'm... not ready For that.

147
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:51,573
And what we've got...

148
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:53,351
That's all I can handle.

149
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:58,758
Go.

150
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,837
Okay, but that's only gonna work,
like, 500 or 600 more times.

151
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,474
- Good evening.
- Can I help you?

152
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:17,443
Wrong question.

153
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,645
The question is, can Ihelp you?

154
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,799
If you're trying
To sell me something,

155
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,589
I don't have any money.

156
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:24,775
You do now.

157
00:09:26,684 --> 00:09:28,325
I don't understand.

158
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:30,948
I'm here to buy you
Out of your lease.

159
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,014
- What?
- I know. It's sudden.

160
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,690
But there's something
About this house that...

161
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:39,372
well, it just
Feels like home to me.

162
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,166
So I'd like to move in...

163
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,919
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Are you crazy?

164
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,046
A little bit.

165
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:47,937
Okay, here.

166
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:50,193

Your moving expenses.

167
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:51,313
Look...

168
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,930
I-I'm all set up here.

169
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,306
Besides, my landlady
Would never allow it.

170
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,600
Why don't you let me
Worry about her?

171
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,825
No. I don't have
Anywhere else to go.

172
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:04,377
I think you should leave.

173
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,375
Look, Raymond...

174
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,332
- How do you know my name?
- I made you a very generous offer,

175
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:16,419
And I just know you're going
To make the right decision.

176
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:18,380
- Five.
- Five what?

177
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,319
What are you talking about?

178
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,874
- Four.
- Are you... I don't understand.

179
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,919
- Three.
- Okay. Hang on for a second.

180
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,176
Two.

181
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,061
Raymond, Thank you very much.

182
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:36,806
Here you go.

183
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,651
Take care.

184
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,274
All taken care of... mrs. Williams.

185
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,188
Thank you... mr. Williams.

186
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,588
<i>The next morning,
Edie Britt decided to announce</i>

187
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,431
<i>Her return to Wisteria lane</i>

188
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,827
<i>In a way...</i>

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,915
<i>that was guaranteed...</i>

190
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,814
<i>to make a big splash.</i>

191
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,073
Okay, you're not gonna
Believe this, but...

192
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:26,770
She's back.

193
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,580
Edie? Is that really you?

194
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,584
You know someone else my age
With a body like this?

195
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:49,264
So you're back?

196
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,209
What happened to your tenant?

197
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:54,216
He came into some money
And decided to move.

198
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:57,064
We thought,
What the heck? Let's move back!

199
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,389
"We"?

200
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,015
You don't know.
I have a husband now.

201
00:12:01,703 --> 00:12:03,434
Really? Whose?

202
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,334
So I'm in Vegas talking
To this real estate convention.

203
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:10,707
I do a little motivational speaking.
And there...

204
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:12,359
Sixth row, center aisle,

205
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:14,751
Is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

206
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,692
So after I finish,
I walk into the audience

207
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:19,075
And I ask this goddess out.

208
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:20,909
His seminar was called

209
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,791
"Getting what you want,"

210
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,602
And he did...

211
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,204
three times.

212
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,334
Before dinner.

213
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:30,586
It's certainly nice
To meet you, dave,

214
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:33,130
And let us be the first
To welcome you to Wisteria lane.

215
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,458
You know what? We should
Have a dinner or something.

216
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,843
Let's make it a party.
We could do it at my restaurant.

217
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,330
We'd be honored.

218
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:41,514
- Thank you.
- So, Gaby,

219
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:44,850
I have to ask.
What the hell happened to you?

220
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,595
I mean, look at you. Your clothes,
Your hair.

221
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:52,191
Carlos might be blind,
But the rest of us aren't.

222
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,733
I had two children.

223
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:55,583
For what? Breakfast?

224
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,945
On your first day back
In the neighborhood?

225
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:04,952
You're right.

226
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:07,048
I'm sorry, Gaby.

227
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:10,459
It was rude and insensitive,
And it won't happen again.

228
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,391
Really?

229
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:19,838
Now shouldn't we offer
Your friends something to eat?

230
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:21,804
I baked some muffins.

231
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:29,687
Please don't take This the wrong way,
but... we love you.

232
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:40,467
Mijita!Lunch is ready.
Go get your sister.

233
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,586
What's with all the cheese?

234
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:50,779
You know how Juanita feels
About brussels sprouts.

235
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,877
I'm just trying
To make vegetables more fun.

236
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:54,958
Next time, give her a carrot
And put her on a roller coaster.

237
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:56,588
Have you tried To lift her lately?

238
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,340
I know she's gotten chubby.
She'll grow out of it.

239
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:02,428
We can only hope with your D.N.A.
Running through her veins.

240
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,305
I do not have fat D.N.A.

241
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,898
Don't make me pull out
The Solis family photo album.

242
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:10,080
It's like a bunch of sea lions
Posing on a rock.

243
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,077
I'm sorry my relatives
Don't measure up to

244
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:14,654
the group of stick-Thin drunks
That you come from.

245
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,773
All I'm sang is that our
Daughter has a weight problem,

246
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:19,612
And the sooner we admit it,
The better.

247
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:20,891
She's only 4.

248
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:23,335
But you want her
To develop a weight problem?

249
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:25,022
Go ahead. Nag, criticize,

250
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:26,659
Make her feel self-Conscious.

251
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,287
See what happens.

252
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:36,022
And obviously I am not
Getting through to the twins,

253
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,523
Because no matter what I say,
They keep pulling this crap,

254
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:40,093
And I am sick of it.

255
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,311
Honey, could you...

256
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:43,992
Sorry.

257
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:48,087
- You want me to talk to them?
- You have to. I am tired

258
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,944
of being the bad cop.
You walk the beat for a while.

259
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:52,895
You know, boys this age,
They're more likely

260
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:55,606
To listen to their dads anyway.
I can handle this.

261
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,963
I really appreciate it.

262
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,277
Honey, you know what
I'd appreciate? Could you...

263
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:01,737
Sorry.

264
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,749
So Kirby has aces in the hole...
Which means that Bobby

265
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,196
Will have to wear a dress
To school on monday.

266
00:15:17,955 --> 00:15:20,211
You've got to get
A picture of that!

267
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:25,472
Can I talk to you a sec?

268
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,148
Don't you think

269
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:30,585
You were kind of sending
The wrong message in there?

270
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,831
I know we don't approve
Of what they did,

271
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:36,584
You gotta admit. Starting their
own casino is kind of creative.

272
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:39,590
"Creative" like selling
Fake I.D.s was creative.

273
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,337
And hot-Wiring McCluskey's car...
That was a work of art.

274
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,899
Honey, This is nothing like that.

275
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,024
I mean, the whole school is talking
About their card game.

276
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:51,662
Do you realize it was, like,
the place to be on a monday night?

277
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,018
Oh, my God.

278
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,626
- What?
- You think they're cool.

279
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:03,078
No, I mean you think they're cool
in that you wanna be them.

280
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,592
Oh, please.

281
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,288
You do! This is Tom,

282
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,455
Former high school nerd,
Living vicarusly

283
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:11,181
Through his awesome-ass kids.

284
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:14,345
I was plenty cool In high school.

285
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:18,272
Are we redefining "cool" To include
playing trombone in the marching band?

286
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,289
You're overreacting.
You're a little high-spirited,

287
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,658
But I trust them. So I've decided

288
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,575
to unground them
for the homecoming dance.

289
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,795
But I told them They couldn't go.

290
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,538
And you told me to handle it,
And I just did.

291
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:39,914
By the way, It wasn't a trombone.

292
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,180
It was a tuba.

293
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,344
Know your brass.

294
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:56,213
Juanita!

295
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:58,437
You said I could have cake.

296
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,813
I know, but so much?

297
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,732
You could've gone back
For a second piece.

298
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,611
This is my second piece.

299
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:15,583
- And it's not Juanita's fault.
- In this kind of situation,

300
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:16,860
I blame the parents.

301
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,457
My kid would eat
Sugar all day long if I let her.

302
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:22,938
Gaby's obviously one of those
Moms who just can't say no.

303
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,438
It's a shame, too.

304
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:26,554
Juanita has such a pretty face.

305
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:35,140
I'm back. You want something cold?

306
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:38,181
Well, actually,

307
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,754
I'm in the mood For something hot.

308
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:47,091
You know...

309
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:51,198
this is why It's taking four months
To get my house painted.

310
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:53,363
Haven't you ever heard
That expression,

311
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:56,537
"You can have it done fast,
or you can have it done right"?

312
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,908
I think I'll have it done
Right now.

313
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,346
- It's not really a good time.
- I just need five seconds

314
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:10,590
To bitch about Tom,
And then I'll...

315
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:12,177
Oh, my God.

316
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:14,214
Your painter isn't done yet?

317
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:20,602
He's hard to keep track of.

318
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:24,344
Anyway, Tom refuses to acknowledge

319
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:26,816
That the twins are turning
Into juvenile delinquents.

320
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,485
You poor thing!

321
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:29,826
You need a hug.

322
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:37,453
Have you been drinking?

323
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,110
Sorry to have barged in,

324
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,283
and thanks for letting me
Get that off my chest.

325
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:53,333
Anytime that you need to
Talk, you just ring my bell...

326
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:54,528
And wait.

327
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:57,139
Okay, new rule.

328
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,659
From now on, sex only happens
In the bedroom, door closed,

329
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:02,034
Between the hours
of 7:00 and 10:00 p.m.

330
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:03,308
You know what?

331
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:05,782
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
For me to follow the rules

332
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:07,624
If I knew why they existed.

333
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:09,506
I just don't want my friends
To know.

334
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,153
Why? You ashamed of me?

335
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,070
No, of course not.

336
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,991
It's just... complicated.

337
00:19:16,464 --> 00:19:18,843
I'm just a simple guy,
So I can't be

338
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:21,037
Your dirty little secret.

339
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:23,289
I need more from you.

340
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:28,378
I'm sorry.
I can't give that to you.

341
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:34,785
Honey, I know you wanna go home
And watch your cartoons,

342
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:36,789
But you had a lot of cake,

343
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,411
So I was thinking
I'd take you to the park.

344
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:42,768
That way, you could run around
And get some nice, fun exercise.

345
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,888
- No.
- You sure?

346
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:50,032
Running around in the sun and fresh air
would make you feel good.

347
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,297
Mm... no.

348
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:56,530
Why don't you
Go throw that in the trash?

349
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,604
And I'm gonna Get the car started.

350
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:15,217
Hey Juanita. You wanna play a new game
On the way home?

351
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:18,971
Winner gets a new doll.

352
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,483
Come on, then!

353
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:36,137
Mommy, what are you doing?

354
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,158
It's a new game I invented,
And you're winning 1 to nothing!

355
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:52,859
Katherine! Fantastic news.

356
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:55,635
"What's cookin'Fairview?"
Is sending out a camera crew tomorrow

357
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,735
To do a piece On me and the book.

358
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,800
Which I just finished This morning.

359
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:02,768
- You read it ready?
- Yes. I couldn't put it down.

360
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,799
But I have to tell you,
At least a dozen recipes are missing

361
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,727
A pretty crucial ingredient.

362
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:10,542
Really? What?

363
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:11,856
My name.

364
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:13,567
Excuse me?

365
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:15,861
Bree, your book
Is filled with recipes

366
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:18,697
That we developed together,
And some of them are flat-out mine.

367
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:21,362
Don't be silly. I may have based a few
on your recipes,

368
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:23,452
But I always Changed someing.

369
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:24,953
Like what? The font?

370
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,800
Name one difference between
This meatloaf recipe and mine.

371
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,221
Yours calls for
minced curly leaf parsley.

372
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,160
Mine calls for Minced flat leaf.

373
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,254
It's minced!
Who can tell the difference?

374
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:37,548
Bree, you have recipes in here
You can't even make.

375
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:39,261
Never heard anything So absurd.

376
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,179
The croquembouche cake
With the spun sugar netting?

377
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,862
I've never once seen you
Work with molten sugar.

378
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:47,112
- I always make that cake.
- Really, Katherine.

379
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,792
Just because I let you execute
a few eye-catching garnishes

380
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,105
That gratify your need To show off,

381
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:54,982
Doesn't mean that I can't
do them just as well myself.

382
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:56,294
You let me?

383
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,081
I thought we were partners.

384
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:04,603
We are. That's why your name is
on the dedication page.

385
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:09,646
You were right
About the dedication, Bree.

386
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:12,507
It really was
the least you could do.

387
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,395
18 to zero!

388
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:24,175
2 more points,
And you'll break the record.

389
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:25,875
Mommy, I'm tired!

390
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:27,516
Really?

391
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:31,050
I thought running through that
guy's sprinkler would've refreshed you.

392
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,063
- Now come on!
- No.

393
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,291
Looks like mommy's
Gonna score her first 2 points.

394
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,297
Come on, Juanita.

395
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,447
Show mommy What a winner you are.

396
00:22:54,352 --> 00:22:55,872
What are you doing?!

397
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,088
Juanita, stop!

398
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,549
And while I thought grounding you
Wasan appropriate punishment,

399
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:21,236
Yourdad convinced me
A little too hard on you guys.

400
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:22,696
Absolutely.

401
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:26,074
We have decided I was being To let you
go to the homecoming dance tonight...

402
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:28,159
That's right!

403
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,434
In your father's convertible.

404
00:23:33,271 --> 00:23:34,387
Hold on. What?

405
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:36,489
Come on, Tom.
I mean, we trust them, right?

406
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:40,251
Yes, I would trust them more
If they were driving your car.

407
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,578
No! You don't want

408
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:46,105
Two cool kids pulling up
To homecoming in a mom car,

409
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,364
Especially with that big dent
They put in it last month.

410
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:49,484
Here you go.

411
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,847
- Dude!
- Thanks!

412
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,614
Don't thank me. Thank your father.

413
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:54,269
- Thanks, dad!
- You rock!

414
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:56,364
Here... Some ground rules.

415
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:58,767
No muddy shoes
On my floor mats. No...

416
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:00,359
Tom, relax!

417
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:04,321
You high-spirited kids do
Whatever it takes to have fun.

418
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,693
I'm driving it, man.

419
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:13,015
And in three, two, one.

420
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:15,487
Welcome back
To "What's cookin'Fairview?"

421
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:17,062
We're talking
With Bree Van De Kamp,

422
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:18,425
Fairview's premier caterer,

423
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:20,836
Who's about to publish
Her very first cookbook.

424
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:23,485
Bree, could you show us inside?

425
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:25,120
This is my kitchen,

426
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:27,743
And this is my staff...

427
00:24:27,863 --> 00:24:29,930
The most gifted,

428
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,058
Hardworking team a cook
Could ever have hoped for.

429
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:36,046
I cannot say enough good things
About them.

430
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,787
So which one of you has
Worked with Bree the longest?

431
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:40,169
That would be me.

432
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:42,484
So tell me, what's it
Really like working with Bree?

433
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,174
It's inspiring.

434
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,244
There is absolutely nothing
She can't do.

435
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,287
Katherine, I'm blushing.

436
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,900
Working with her Has been...

437
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,975
suchan education

438
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,545
That I...

439
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,898
- God. Are you all right?
- I think I strained my wrist.

440
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:05,841
God, it hurts.

441
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:08,459
You poor dear. Could someone
Please get some ice?

442
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:12,052
No. And I was just about to put

443
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,931
The spun sugar netting

444
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:16,385
On our famous croquembouche.

445
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,522
Would you mind doing it?

446
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:25,944
Katherine, I'm sure your wrist
Is just fine.

447
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,655
No, it's really throbbing.

448
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:31,548
Okay, it looks like Bree
To the rescue.

449
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,885
Be sure you get this.
Really something to see.

450
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:45,352
The secret to spinning sugar
Is this special whisk

451
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,382
That makes Lovely gossamer threads.

452
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,600
Careful, dear. You're clumping.

453
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,436
I can see that.

454
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:02,647
That stuff's hot!

455
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:03,918
Sorry.

456
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:16,745
So that's your idea of exercise?
Having her run after a car?

457
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:19,403
Carlos, our daughter
Sucked down half a sheet cake,

458
00:26:19,523 --> 00:26:21,479
And afterwards,
No one could find the candles.

459
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,417
Wake up! We have got a problem!

460
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:26,234
I just don't think the solution
Is to humiliate her.

461
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,781
Now even if she's... heavy,
Doesn't she have the right

462
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:30,289
To feel good about herself?

463
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:32,059
Hey, I'm protecting her.

464
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:34,484
She doesn't know the truth yet.

465
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:36,977
Women only have five seconds
To be young and beautiful,

466
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,547
And then it's gone.

467
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,728
And then before you know it,
We're old and fat and married

468
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:44,166
And wondering
Where our beauty went.

469
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,960
No, Carlos. I mean...

470
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,153
sometimes I'm glad
You can't see me.

471
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,656
Five years and two kids And no time

472
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:56,493
For facials or the gym.
It just... takes a toll.

473
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,995
And when Edie saw me the other day,

474
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:04,834
It was like she didn't even
recognize me.

475
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:07,930
Listen to me.

476
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:13,300
Nobody knows your face
Better than I do.

477
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:15,680
And I see it Every time I kiss you.

478
00:27:16,162 --> 00:27:17,664
In 5 years or 50,

479
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:20,226
You will Always be beautiful.

480
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:24,035
Hear me?

481
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:32,630
And now to finish, you simply transfer
Your spun sugar

482
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:35,365
To the croquembouche And gracefully

483
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:39,512
drape it around in a delicate swirl.

484
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,847
Did I meion that you...
Probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry

485
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,547
While working With spun sugar?

486
00:27:58,695 --> 00:28:00,810
There's no law that says
It has to be a delicate veil.

487
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,184
I mean, it could really
Just be a beautiful,

488
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:05,022
Little white...

489
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,033
ribbon.

490
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:11,538
Turn off the damn camera.

491
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:14,658
Actually, my wrist
is feeling a little better.

492
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:16,864
Why don't I give it a shot?

493
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,459
- Whatcha doing?
- Okay, where are they?

494
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,633
It's 30 minutes past curfew.

495
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:33,713
Actually, it's 32.

496
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,975
If there is a single scratch
on that car...

497
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:38,475
I mean, after all the time that
I spent restoring that thing...

498
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:41,916
Remember when you spent
The entire day on the internet

499
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:44,022
Trying to find
A new gearshift knob?

500
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:47,853
Worst anniversary ever.

501
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:51,098
I cannot believe
That you did this to me.

502
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:52,218
I know.

503
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,083
That car is your baby.

504
00:28:55,594 --> 00:28:59,391
If only there was something
I felt that intensely about.

505
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:01,951
Wait! There is... My actual babies.

506
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:05,532
You think I don't care
About our boys?

507
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:07,226
I know you love them,

508
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,039
But sometimes you find them
So cool and entertaining,

509
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,908
You forget to parent them.

510
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,671
No, listen.

511
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:16,194
This is important.

512
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,036
When they were little
And they'd act out,

513
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:22,435
And we'd always say,
"Relax! They're young."

514
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:24,357
"When they're older,
They'll get it."

515
00:29:24,477 --> 00:29:26,184
Tom, they're 16 now.

516
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:29,506
Not getting it.

517
00:29:31,032 --> 00:29:33,850
We have a lot of work to do
In a very short time,

518
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,601
And if you and I aren't in sync,

519
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:37,353
I'm afraid It's not gonna happen.

520
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:52,605
Hey, sorry we're late.

521
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:55,163
Yeah. But, dad,
You have to hear this story.

522
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:57,039
We just pulled up
At an intersection,

523
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:59,133
And there were
These two hot girls...

524
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:00,846
I don't want to hear it.

525
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,976
You ever hear of a thing
Called a cell phone?

526
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:04,846
We're only, like, 35 minutes late.

527
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:05,932
35 minutes,

528
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:09,309
During which time your mother
and I have been worried sick.

529
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,104
- But, dad...
- You broke the rules.

530
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,995
There are consequences.

531
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:17,729
You're both grounded For a month.

532
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:19,157
This sucks!

533
00:30:19,947 --> 00:30:22,564
You're only doing this 'cause you were
worried About your precious car.

534
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:25,047
You think? Get out of the way.

535
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,961
Any other opinions
You'd like to share?

536
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:49,952
Thank you.

537
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:52,915
But you didn't have to...

538
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,320
that mirror was scratched.

539
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,702
I already ordered A new one.

540
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:14,375
Mrs. McCluskey! You're still alive!

541
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:16,085
It's nice to see you, too, Edie.

542
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:19,506
This is my husband, Dave Williams.

543
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:23,104
So how did you two meet?
You run a free clinic or something?

544
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,932
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- Karen Mccluskey,

545
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:29,910
- Edie's best friend on the street.
- It's a real pleasure to meet you.

546
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,341
What are you doing here?

547
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:40,276
- I just need to talk to you.
- Not here. Go home. I'll call you.

548
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:43,033
- When?
- I don't know. Later.

549
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:44,408
Just go.

550
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,789
I have to say, ladies,

551
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:55,333
This is quite a shindig.

552
00:31:55,493 --> 00:31:57,001
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

553
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:59,601
There's really not a lot of people
Who go to this much trouble

554
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:01,515
To say they're sorry.

555
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:05,050
- Excuse me?
- Well, the party.

556
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:07,512
It's just a beautiful way
to apologize.

557
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,470
This is not a "we're sorry" party.

558
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,768
This is a "we forgive you" party.

559
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:17,412
You forgive me?

560
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:20,727
I think what Gaby means is
You were fairly awful to us

561
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:23,212
Right before you left,
And this is our way

562
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:26,978
Of welcoming you back
To hopefully not do it again.

563
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,766
You gotta be kidding.

564
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,755
You froze me out.

565
00:32:33,406 --> 00:32:37,344
You threatened to ruin my business,
And you ran me out of town.

566
00:32:38,118 --> 00:32:41,543
Now it's taken me five years
To stop hating you.

567
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:44,922
Great party, ladies.
Thank you very much.

568
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:48,415
Now... mind if I steal my wife?
Sweetheart?

569
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:58,534
Isn't that your painter?

570
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:00,607
<i>I wanna be your boyfriend</i>

571
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,409
Is it? I can't tell.

572
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:04,863
<i>Sweet little girl</i>

573
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:07,153
<i>I wanna be your boyfriend</i>

574
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,227
<i>Do you love me, babe?</i>

575
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:14,329
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

576
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,205
<i>What do you say?</i>

577
00:33:25,194 --> 00:33:26,924
Didn't they pay the bill?

578
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:29,927
All right. Calm down.
I'll take care of it.

579
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,901
You, come with me.

580
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:36,849
Why would you humiliate me
In front of my friends?

581
00:33:36,969 --> 00:33:38,319
Are you a lunatic?

582
00:33:39,076 --> 00:33:41,291
I-I'm just trying
To get through to you.

583
00:33:41,411 --> 00:33:44,158
And, yeah, it's making me
kinda crazy.

584
00:33:47,323 --> 00:33:49,135
Why can't I meet your friends?

585
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:50,842
I mean, am I really That horrible?

586
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,781
No, of course not.
My friends would love you.

587
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:54,595
Then what is the problem?

588
00:33:55,321 --> 00:33:57,850
The problem is,
If you meet my friends,

589
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,350
Then we're in a relationship,

590
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,755
And I can't be
In a relationship right now.

591
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:04,587
But I promise,
I'll make you very happy.

592
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:06,654
Maybe I don't deserve To be happy.

593
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,443
A few years ago...

594
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:27,919
there was this car accident...

595
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:30,281
a bad one.

596
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:33,350
Take the high road?

597
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,892
Did you hear what
Those smug bitches said to me?

598
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:37,910
Edie, it's important
These people like us.

599
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,100
It's our home now.

600
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,660
I never should've let you
Talk me into moving back here.

601
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,293
Why? Why were you
So gung ho on Wisteria lane?

602
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,464
Listen to your husband.
We can be happy here,

603
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,954
But we need these people
To like us.

604
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:53,074
Why?

605
00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:58,182
It'll just Make everything easier.

606
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,268
That was an accident.

607
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:04,313
You can't feel guilty about it.

608
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:05,565
You know what, Jackson?

609
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,079
You're not gonna say anything
I haven't already heard a million times.

610
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,637
I only told you Because I...

611
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:14,453
I just want you to understand
why I can't let you in my life.

612
00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:22,705
Do you mind if I hang out

613
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:24,475
For the next few months

614
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:27,499
And see if You change your mind?

615
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,674
Yeah, I guess I could handle that.

616
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,476
Why don't you... go have fun
with your friends?

617
00:35:42,846 --> 00:35:44,394
And just call me When you're free.

618
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:10,276
Please, Danielle.
You have no right to take him.

619
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:12,575
I have every right. He's my kid.

620
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:15,830
We agreed I would raise him.
We agreed It would be best!

621
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,913
You said it would be best!
I'vehad no say in anything!

622
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:21,455
But I am married now,
And Leo's a lawyer.

623
00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:24,484
So do yourself a favor
And don't try to fight this!

624
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:27,955
Please, we can have
Any arrangement you like.

625
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:29,925
Please, just don't take him!

626
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,144
For God sakes, Orson's gone.
You kids are grown.

627
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:35,063
Benjamin's all I have!

628
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:38,224
You're just gonna
have to find something else.

629
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,828
Honey, come to bed.
It's after 2:00.

630
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,957
The cooking show
Agreed to redo my segment.

631
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:53,539
I wanna make sure
It's perfect this time.

632
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,081
Well, I won't tell you
How to run your business.

633
00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:58,417
It's your baby.

634
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,589
Yes, it is.

635
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:46,767
- M.J. Ready?
- He's upstairs waiting for you.

636
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:56,583
I told you the brakes were squeaking.
I asked you to get them checked.

637
00:37:56,703 --> 00:37:58,053
And I checked 'em!

638
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:00,621
I meant a mechanic... Not you.

639
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,773
It was not the brakes. If it had been,
It wouldn't have mattered.

640
00:38:03,893 --> 00:38:06,704
- They crashed into us!
- And we killed them, Mike!

641
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:09,206
We didn't kill them! They died.

642
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,774
They were a mother and a child.

643
00:38:11,894 --> 00:38:15,342
She was a mother, just like me...
With a child just like ours.

644
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,715
And if it weren't for us,
They would still be alive.

645
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:20,148
Yeah, we have been
Over and over this, Susan.

646
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:22,209
It's... It's like
You want to suffer.

647
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:24,142
It's like you don't care at all,

648
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:26,098
Like you feel nothing
For those people.

649
00:38:26,258 --> 00:38:28,641
I can't do this again!
I just can't!

650
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,237
Did you pack your dinosaur book
So you can read it with your daddy?

651
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,030
- Sure did.
- Good.

652
00:38:43,602 --> 00:38:45,409
Okay, you have fun, sweetie.

653
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:50,081
So, I'll probably bring him
Back sunday around 6:00 or so.

654
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,527
Fine.

655
00:38:54,277 --> 00:38:56,587
Have a good weekend.
Doing anything special?

656
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:01,675
I've sort of start seeing someone.

657
00:39:04,338 --> 00:39:06,263
So I might do something With him.

658
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:10,226
Good for you.

659
00:39:22,484 --> 00:39:25,009
<i>It goes by so quickly.</i>

660
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:30,371
<i>In a flash, the life we knew
Is gone forever.</i>

661
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:34,512
<i>And we're left To ask ourselves...</i>

662
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,795
<i>how could he have left me?</i>

663
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,814
<i>When did my beauty Start to fade?</i>

664
00:39:49,508 --> 00:39:51,727
<i>Why has my friend changed?</i>

665
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:59,108
<i>Was I the best mother
I could have been?</i>

666
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:04,507
<i>Of course, There are some people</i>

667
00:40:04,627 --> 00:40:07,337
<i>Who understand
How quickly time passes.</i>

668
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,613
<i>That's why they're so determined
To get what they want</i>

669
00:40:16,532 --> 00:40:18,646
<i>Before it's too late.</i>

670
00:40:22,874 --> 00:40:25,134
Dr. Heller.
I've been meaning to call you.

671
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:27,509
Yeah, I was getting concerned.

672
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,000
You're required
To check in once a month.

673
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,141
It was a condition Of your release.

674
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,106
Come on. That was a year ago.

675
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,101
But to be honest,
The meds are working so well,

676
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:37,897
I kinda forgot about you.
No offense.

677
00:40:38,215 --> 00:40:40,035
Dave, once a month.

678
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:42,063
Not optional.

679
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,942
Message received, doc.

680
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:47,200
But seriously, you don't need
To worry about me. I'm great.

681
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,506
I'll talk to you In a month.

682
00:40:57,732 --> 00:40:58,793
<i>Just tell me.</i>

683
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,171
<i>What are the magic words that I've gotta
say so you will let me out of here?</i>

684
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:03,881
<i>Dave, you've been here six weeks,</i>

685
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:07,282
<i>And you don't seem any closer
To coming to terms with your rage.</i>

686
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,013
<i>I've come to terms with it,
And I like it just the way it is.</i>

687
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:13,028
<i>The charges were dropped</i>

688
00:41:13,148 --> 00:41:16,129
<i>Because you agreed to put yourself
In a doctor's care.</i>

689
00:41:16,249 --> 00:41:20,007
<i>I'm not going to authorize your release
Until I see some real progress.</i>

690
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:22,316
<i>What's progress supposed
To look like to you, doc?</i>

00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:25,118
<i>I mean, should I just plaster
Some fake smile on my face</i>

692
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:27,830
<i>And pretend this thing
that's inside me isn't eatin'me alive?</i>

693
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,445
<i>'Cause I can do that If you want.</i>

694
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:32,630
<i>I need to make sure you're not a danger
To yourself or to others.</i>

695
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,061
<i>Listen, I've never been
A danger to myself.</i>

696
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:40,543
<i>And as far as the others
Are concerned,</i>

697
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:43,697
<i>There's only one person
Who should be worried.</i>
