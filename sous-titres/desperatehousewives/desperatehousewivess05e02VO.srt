1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,500
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,540
lives change in five years.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,470
Some families grow,
while others grow apart.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,460
So I thought I'd bring him
back sunday around 6:00 or so.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,170
Fine.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,660
And we find ways...

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,110
it's not really a good time.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,230
To ease the pain.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,990
Yes, in five years...

10
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,710
edie, is that really you?

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,170
I have a husband now.

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,510
Many things change.

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,550
you're required to
check in once a month.

14
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,520
It was a condition of your release.

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,660
all in all, susan mayer's boyfriend
knew he had a lot goingor him.

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,660
He was romantic...

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,920
Had a nice smile...

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,210
and was consistently thoughtful.

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,100
yes, jackson braddock had
many wonderful attributes.

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,910
Sadly...

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,370
a sense of timing wasn't one of them.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,800
Hello.

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,230
Can I help you?

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,380
I guess you could tell susan I'm here.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,680
Okay. who are you?

26
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,580
Oh, I'm mike... the ex-husband.

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,250
I, uh, I take it you're...

28
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,440
jackson. I'm, uh... susan's, uh...

29
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,190
- friend?
- Friend. That's right.

30
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,850
could this be any more awkward?

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,270
Well, your robe's open... so yeah.

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,090
yep.

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,030
well, you be the judge. I don't
know, man. It--it's pretty good.

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,340
Well, I got the feeling that...

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,690
Hey, your ex-husband is...

36
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,230
mike! Uh, what's going on?

37
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,590
I was just returning M.J.'S video game.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,970
He left it at my house.

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,070
Thanks.

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,630
So I guess you met jackson.

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,230
Yeah. Nice legs.

42
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,440
oh, clearly this is not how I
would've wanted the two of you to meet.

43
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,510
He's--he's
really a nice guy.

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,680
Yeah, well, just to make sure, I'm gonna need
to hang with him a little bit, check him out.

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,670
Oh, I don't know that that's necessary.

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,150
If he's sleeping in the same
house as my son, I think it is.

47
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,580
Oh, well, first off, um, M.J.Was
at a sleepover last night.

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,720
And, in fact, jackson
and he haven't even met,

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,250
so, uh, there's really no need for
you to be hanging... or checking.

50
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,660
oh, just... tell jackson I'll
pick him up here tomorrow night.

51
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,330
Hey, hold on.

52
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,050
You don't get to just decide
these things by yourself.

53
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,130
You remember how nice I was
about our custody agreement?

54
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:52,370
I can haul you back to court tomorrow if I'm
not 100% satisfied with who you expose my son to.

55
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,750
Got it?

56
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,040
uh, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,110
It's so not how I wanted to
meet your ex for the fimet ti.

58
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,180
Well, when you meet him for the
second time, you can tell him that.

59
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,210
He's picking you up here tomorrow night.

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,830
What?

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,370
I'll explain over breakfast.

62
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,000
Did you get the paper?

63
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,430
And that is w jackson braddock
realized he needed better timing...

64
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,450
who are you?

65
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,370
And a longer robe.

69
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,930
If there is one thing everyone
in suburbia can appreciate...

70
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,550
It's a good neighbor.

71
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
You know, the kind that helps
with the last bag of groceries...

72
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,240
or brings over misplaced mail...

73
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,780
or offers to mow your lawn.

74
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,920
Yes, everyone appreciates
a good neighbor.

75
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,300
You are so sweet to do this.

76
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,790
I just know how tricky
these bulbs can be.

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,380
And no one knew this
bette than dave williams,

78
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,780
who was determined to be the best
neighbor steria lane had ever seen...

79
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,360
assuming, of course, his
wife didn't get in the way.

80
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,060
- What's going on?
- Packing our bags.

81
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,090
Karen mccluskey insulted me again,
and I can't put up with it anymore.

82
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,910
All right, what did she
say to you this time?

83
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,300
Nothing. It doesn't
matter. We are moving.

84
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,490
Adults don't pack up and move
because of some good-natured teasing.

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,770
She said that my breasts were
a triumph oferman engineering.

86
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,580
You call that good-natured?

87
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,410
Come on. She's a cranky old lady.

88
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,760
It's not just her. It's all of them.

89
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,550
I mean, it's been five
years. I have changed.

90
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,820
But the people on
this street don't care.

91
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,270
To them, I will always be a joke.

92
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,360
I'm sorry you had a bad day.

93
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,080
Please don't use your
motivational voice.

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
I really hate that.

95
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,950
You're upset and you're tired.

96
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,190
Why don't you take a nice hot
shower, and I'll makus some lunch?

97
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,540
Does that sound good?

98
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,370
I just never understood it.

99
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,850
We--we could've gone and lived
in any city in this country.

100
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,480
Why did you insist on living here?

101
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,000
'Cause we can be happy here.

102
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,210
You just need to give it some time.

103
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,620
And I promise, I'll personally see to it that
people start treating you with a little more respect.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,110
You didn't answer my question.

105
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,360
Didn't I?

106
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,390
Carlos, we got invited to
michelle downing's party!

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,350
I'm gonna have to buy
something nice to--aah!

108
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,290
Gaby, I'm giving a massage.

109
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,600
I can see that.

110
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,470
I can see a lot of things--
things that can never be unseen.

111
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,650
Uh, sorry.

112
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,570
I guess the towel must've rode up.

113
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,740
Carlos? Kitchen. Now.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,300
I know you don't like it when I work down
here, but he couldn't get up the stairs.

115
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,520
He's got a bum hip.

116
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,120
He's also missing a testicle.

117
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,150
Carlos, how much more of
this am I supposed to take?

118
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,760
Okay, okay, maybe I could
set up my table in the garage.

119
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,290
No! That's only part of the problem.

120
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,660
Have you checked our
bank balance lately?

121
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,430
Gaby, I am not taking
the country club job.

122
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,790
Why not? You'd be massaging rich people.

123
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,310
They tip better and
they tend to flake less.

124
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, but I like working here.

125
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,130
I get to spend lots of
time with you and the kids.

126
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,320
Carlos, I don't need to
spend lots of time with you.

127
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,950
And frankly, the kids are on the fence.

128
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,750
Gaby!

129
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,580
Bottom line, I miss our
life. I miss shopping.

130
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,670
All I have to look forward to is the
occasional invitation to a fancy party.

131
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,310
And I can't even afford
a dress to go to it.

132
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,650
Carlos, please, I am begging you.

133
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,020
Fine. I'll-- I
will take the job.

134
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,070
Thank you.

135
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,380
sorry.

136
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,820
Ah, no.

137
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,560
Come on. I really don't think
mike's gonna care what shirt I wear.

138
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,970
Well, I do.

139
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,190
We need a shirt that says,
"I'm a responsible citizen,"

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,190
not "my favorite clothing
store also sells bongs."

141
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,390
Are you dissing my sense of style?

142
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,420
Absolutely.

143
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,110
Put this on. Now...

144
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,610
let's talk about acceptable
topics of conversation.

145
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,300
- You like sports, right?
- Yeah.

146
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,270
- I'm a huge socr fan.
- No, you're not.

147
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,330
You like football--
american football.

148
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,970
- Specifically the colts.
- Okay.

149
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,180
And here are some other things you
can talk about-- cars, barbue, fishing.

150
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,840
How about fire?

151
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,060
Mike like talk fire?

152
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,340
Jackson, please take this seriously.

153
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,870
I am. I'm just--I'm not gonna
pretend to be somebody I'm not.

154
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,010
If he doesn't like me, wh's he gonna do?

155
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,080
He could take me to court, and the judge
can make me choose between you and my son.

156
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,980
And I'm sorry. You will lose.

157
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,590
Peyton manning is the greatest
quarterback who ever lived.

158
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,630
Thank you.

159
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,410
Now go shave. You look like a hobo.

160
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,320
Got a sec?

161
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,010
Not really.

162
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,880
So I assume you know about
what happened to jimmy conrado.

163
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,770
I guess.

164
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,830
Your friend gets busted for dealing drugs at
school, and all you have to say is, "I guess"?

165
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,070
He's not my friend.

166
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,590
What are you talking about? You
were on the same little league team.

167
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,410
Yeah, like a million
years ago. Anything else?

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,510
No. Not really.

169
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,990
Parker. Can I ask you
something, just between us?

170
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,500
Does porter hang out with jimmy conrado?

171
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,080
I don't know. I could check out
his friends list on silverfizz.

172
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,210
His what on what?

173
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,890
It's like myspace. You have a web page.

174
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,000
It shows your hobbies, your favorite
music, and you can talk to people.

175
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,850
Really? Can anyone talk to him?

176
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,560
Yeah. He just has to invite you.

177
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,660
And, uh...

178
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,090
how would somebody make that happen?

179
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,380
Now it's just a mock-up, but this is
what the book is going to look like.

180
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,270
Mom, that's fantastic.
Good call on the font.

181
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,940
Thank you, dear.

182
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,740
Orson, what do you think?

183
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,870
Well, I think it's strange to see
my wife billed as "mrs. Van de kamp."

184
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,750
Well, you knew what the
book was gonna be called.

185
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,190
Yes, but it's differen
actually seeing it.

186
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,780
I mean, is it too late
to go with "mrs. Hodge"?

187
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,480
My company, which I formed when we were
separated, is called mrs. Van de kamp's catering.

188
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,730
It's how I'm known.

189
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,940
Oh, in fairview.

190
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,140
But this book will be national.

191
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,000
I mean, it's your chance
to rebrand yourself.

192
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,050
Is there something wrong with "hodge"?

193
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,340
I think I just heard the
milk go bad. I should check.

194
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,460
Orson, I adore you, but your name...

195
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,870
our name-- it
has no music.

196
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,040
"Van de kamp" trips off the tongue.

197
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,430
"Hodge" sounds like the
noise a plunger makes.

198
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,620
That's preposterous.

199
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,180
Listen... van de kamp. hodge.

200
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,440
Also, she's got a radio interview wednesday, and
they're already promoting her as mrs. Van de kamp.

201
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,820
See? The ship has already sailed.

202
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,580
Oh, don't be hurt. It's
my professional name.

203
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,520
In this house, I will
always be mrs. Hodge. Now...

204
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,810
would it help if mrs. Hodge cooked
you your favorite pot roast tonight?

205
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,860
Yes, I guess it would help.

206
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,340
Uh, meeting with your publicist?

207
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,560
Oh, right. Um, tomorrow for sure, then.

208
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,450
van de kamp.

209
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,260
hodge.

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,010
- here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

211
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,600
Toby, get off my chair. You know better.

212
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,420
so what's on yndr mi?

213
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,750
It's edie.

214
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,580
You said something to her
yesterday that hurt her feelings.

215
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,050
That thing about her breasts?
Come on. That was a joke.

216
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,370
Perhaps, but it upset her so much that
she suggested we leave wisteria lane.

217
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,910
I can't have that, mrs. M.

218
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,790
Hey, this is what edie and I do.

219
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,290
We tease each other.

220
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,400
I say she's easier to get
into than community college.

221
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,690
She says my face looks like a knee.

222
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,250
it's fun.

223
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,970
Still... I would consider it a personal
favor if you'd apologize to her.

224
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,820
You know, make her
feel accepted and loved.

225
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,830
No.

226
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,090
No?

227
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,960
If edie wants to change the way we talk to
each other, she's gotta ask me personally.

228
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,050
And I think you've got a lot of gall
making me feel like I did something wrong

229
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,070
when you don't even know me.

230
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,330
I know you, better than you think.

231
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,850
Oh, really?

232
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,830
For starters, you talk to
your cat like it's a person.

233
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,870
When I knocked on your door,
you immediately invited me in.

234
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,790
Doesn't take a genius to
see that you're lonely.

235
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,380
I'm thinking you had people
in your life at one time...

236
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,840
people who cared about you.

237
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,750
But somethg happened to them.

238
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,210
Some probably died. The rest, well...

239
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,270
they just don't come
around much anymore.

240
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,710
Why do you think that is?

241
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,680
I know you, mrs. Mccluskey.

242
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:26,460
and it seems to me that a woman le you would
like to keep the few friends that she has left.

243
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,700
I think you'd better go.

244
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,660
thanks for tonight.

245
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,610
And, uh, before I
forget, the colts suck.

246
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:03,430
oh, here's what sucks-- watching a zero-zero
game with no cheerleaders, soccer boy.

247
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,110
you guys were insulting each
other. That's good, right?

248
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,410
Yeah, we had a blast.

249
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,310
- Really?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,680
In fact, we're getting together
wednesday night at o'brien's,

251
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,080
which he claims has the best
bacon potato skins in town.

252
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,760
Potato skins at o'brien's?
You've made his inner circle!

253
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,130
This is fantastic! Thank you.

254
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,220
Ah, you can think of a more
creative way to thank me than that.

255
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,500
nice.

256
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,230
- yeah?
- Yeah.

257
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,120
You've never done that before.

258
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,940
wait. You've never done that
before. Why are you doing that now?

259
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,260
I don't know. Don't you like it?

260
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,330
Yeah. But how did you
know I would like it?

261
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,160
- Oh, my god.
- What?

262
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,280
Mike told you about the
ear thing, didn't he?

263
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,670
No.

264
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,730
So you just happened to stumble across my secret
turn-on the same night that you and mike became B.F.F.S?

265
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,260
But aren't we losing sight
of the fact that you like it?

266
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,300
This is... I mean, I'm just...

267
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,050
I have been violated.

268
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,870
Oh, honey,
come on--

269
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,300
don't touch me!Or my ears!

270
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,390
- My ears are dead to you.
- It just slipped out.

271
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,750
We were talking about how girls--
they--they all like different things, right?

272
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,110
And I-I was talking about this girl in high
school, how she liked to do it with her shoes on,

273
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,250
and--and mike talked
about the lobe nibble.

274
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,500
He has a name for it? okay. That's it.

275
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,400
You and mike are not
hanging out anymore.

276
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,020
And this little wednesday "potato
skins and susan sex tips night"?

277
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,340
I forbid it.

278
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:59,170
did mike mention he likes having his
toes sucked? that just slipped out.

279
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,120
Gaby...

280
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,160
bree! What's up?

281
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,840
Well, um, michelle downing
asked me to speak to you.

282
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,930
I don't know if you heard, but
I'm catering her birthday party--

283
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,990
I heard.I can't wait.

284
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,500
Ooh, I was gonna ask you. Should I wear the
navy blue chanel or the red sleeveless dress?

285
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,750
You can't come.

286
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,230
Sorry. I just had to
rip the band-aid off.

287
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,080
What? She's disig itinme?

288
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,160
It's not personal. You know how
carlos just started at the club?

289
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,420
Well, her guests are all members, and she thinks
they might find it awkward socializing with...

290
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,690
staff.

291
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,260
She called us "staff"?

292
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,490
Oh, gaby, it's just one
party. I'll save you some cake.

293
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,260
No! It's not just one party!

294
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,220
It's the kickoff to
the whole social season.

295
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,190
If people see we're off michelle's
list, then we'll be off everyone'S.

296
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,950
And then it's gonna be the start of our slow slide
from gowns and galas to flip-flops and keggers!

297
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,160
okay, if carlos working at the club is
the problem, then tell her he just quit.

298
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,290
Oh, hon, I don't think that's gonna fly.

299
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,580
He's already rubbed too many members.

300
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,180
What's happened to my life?

301
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,610
We used to have help.
Now we are the help!

302
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,710
what are you doing?

303
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,500
I am just...

304
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,620
talking to porter on silverfizz.

305
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,340
Who is saraj from macarthur high school?

306
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,140
Me. I'm 16 and cute.

307
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,390
I like graphic novels
and tokyo police club.

308
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,540
oh, my god. you--you're
pretending to be somebody else?

309
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,570
Our brooding son has a classmate
who got arrested for selling drugs.

310
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,500
I really think the end
justifies the means here.

311
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,910
okay, we'll address your major
ethical breach in a moment.

312
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,920
What did you find out?

313
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,720
Well, the good news is he really
doesn't hang out with jimmy conrado.

314
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,180
But I am a little worried about anita47,

315
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,760
who told him cherry fruit
pops are an aphrodisiac.

316
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,860
okay, great, you know who
he hangs around with now.

317
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
You got what you came for. Time to stop.

318
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,290
You're probably right. It's just...

319
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,790
did you know porter writes poetry?

320
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,560
- Serious?
- Yeah.

321
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,680
Our porter, the kid who communicates
with grunts and shrugs, writes this...

322
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,060
beautiful, heart-wrenching poetry.

323
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,770
Maybe one day he'll share it with
you instead of your fantasy alter ego.

324
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,420
Until then, shut it off.

325
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,420
Okay, okay. you're right. You're right.

326
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,430
I luvs me some Walt Whitman!

327
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,080
Enily.......

328
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,110
Yeah......

329
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,860
oh, really?

330
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,510
Is.........

331
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,190
Don't......

332
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,750
That's sweet.

333
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,440
Girls........

334
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,600
still talking to poetry girl?

335
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,410
Bite me.

336
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,270
Dude, she didn't put up her photo.

337
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,480
5 bucks says she looks
like she came out of an egg.

338
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,490
whatever.

339
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,550
toby?

340
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,750
toby! Where are you?

341
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,800
Toby!

342
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,110
Everything all right, mrs. M.

343
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,840
It's toby. I can't find him.

344
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,460
Oh, no. How did he get out?

345
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,120
The living room window was open, which is
bizarre because I don't remember opening it.

346
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,500
Can you help me find him?

347
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,500
Have you given any more thought
about apologizing to edie?

348
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,430
She's still pretty down in the dumps.

349
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,750
I've kind of been busy.

350
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,380
Of course you have. It's just that...

351
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,400
well, since I'm about to
help you find your cat,

352
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,500
it sure would be nice if you
could help me out with edie.

353
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,790
Doesn't that seem fair to you?

354
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,120
I guess.

355
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,260
Here.

356
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,690
Thank you. Okay.

357
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,220
Toby! Toby! Come here, boy!

358
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,290
toby!

359
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,260
So they'll finish with the news,do a quick
traffic update,and then we're on the air.

360
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,400
Uh,do you need anything?

361
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,790
No,I'm good.

362
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,530
How do I look?

363
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,680
we're on the radio.

364
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,070
I'm a little bit nervous. This
is my first national interview.

365
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,000
And I am a huge fan of your cookbooks.

366
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,360
Well,I've heard good things about you.

367
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,740
I understand you're catering michelle
downing's birthday dinner tonight.

368
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,860
Oh,you know michelle?

369
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,680
Yes,and I'll be there.

370
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,830
I can't wait to see what you dish up.

371
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,620
Okay,now I'm terrified.

372
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,220
Here we go.

373
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,540
Good afternoon.

374
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,310
I'm linda flanagan,and
this is "gourmet americana."

375
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,290
if you've been to
fairview's best parties,

376
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,320
then you've probably tasted the mouthwatering
food dished up by my first guest,bree van de kamp.

377
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,990
Now she's about to publish her first
book,"mrs. Van de kamp's old-fashioned cooking."

378
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,810
Welcome,bree.

379
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,940
Hi,linda.

380
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,760
Tell me.

381
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,360
Why "old-fashioned"?

382
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,660
Well,I think a lot of people
miss the way life used to be--

383
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,790
back when women had more time to cook.

384
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,130
It's always been important to me

385
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,370
to have the family gather around the table
every night for hot, lovingly prepared meals.

386
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,830
So you're a traditional kinda gal.

387
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,500
Is there a mr. Van de kamp?

388
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,440
No. Uh,mr. Van de kamp is deceased.

389
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,720
But in regards to my husband,I
should make one thing very clear--

390
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,050
his passing had nothing
to do with my cooking.

391
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
Is that my yeats book?

392
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,130
I love his poetry.

393
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,440
Yeah. I'm borrowing it for school.

394
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,610
This is the kind of poetry
that melts a girl's heart.

395
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,620
So romantic.

396
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,740
Here's a
great one--

397
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,100
"the lover tells of
the rose in his heart."

398
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,630
My first boyfriend gave me
this poem. I was a junior in--

399
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,880
mom,I'm--I'm running late.
Can I have the book back?

400
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,660
Sorry.

401
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,590
enjoy!

402
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,590
katherine,it is not too late
to change tonight's menu.

403
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,890
If linda flanagan likes my food,she
might give me a quote for the book jacket.

404
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,580
I have to knock her socks off,and I
am not betting the farm on haddock.

405
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,050
Argue with me all you like.

406
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,690
I just bought 40 pounds of
pork,so get your tushie over here.

407
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,530
Orson!

408
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,390
Did you get my message
about linda flanagan?

409
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,350
Yes,I heard.

410
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,930
Isn't it amazing?

411
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,010
Almost as amazing as
my on-air death notice.

412
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,810
What?

413
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,170
"So,bree,do you have a husband?"

414
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,690
"Nope. Used to. He croaked."

415
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,510
she didn't ask if I had a husband.

416
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,270
She asked if there was a mr. Van
de kamp,and there's clearly not.

417
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,760
Well,there's a mrhodge.

418
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,640
Would it have killed
you to have mentioned me?

419
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,360
And waste valuable airtime?

420
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,350
The show was about my cookbook,not
about my tortured marital history.

421
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,890
That's not what this is about.

422
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,280
It's because I went to jail,isn't it?

423
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,330
Orson,I have 6 hours to
prepare a meal for 80 people.

424
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,670
We're not having this discussion now.

425
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,620
Just admit it.

426
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,470
You're ashamed of me.

427
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,630
Should I be proud?

428
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,210
Do you want me to go on the radio and boast that
my husband served time for running someone over?

429
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,720
I went to jail because you told me it
was the only way you'd take me back.

430
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,650
And because it was
the right thing to do.

431
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,360
I just didn't know then that I
would be a public figure someday.

432
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,290
But I am. I have a name now.

433
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,940
And luckily for you,it's not mine.

434
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,620
Orson,please don't be hurt.

435
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,030
I am under so much pressure
and so terrified I'll fail

436
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,250
that I don't even know what
I'm saying half the time.

437
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,400
Just let me get through this.

438
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,460
As soon as the plates go out tonight,

439
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,900
I will come home and cook you
that pot roast I promised.Okay?

440
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,840
Okay.

441
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,090
it's just
that...I--

442
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,160
chives!

443
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,310
How could I forget chives?

444
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,690
hey,susan,it's me.

445
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,230
Listen,I'm not gonna be
able to make dinner tonight.

446
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,110
My college roommate's in town,and this
is the only night we can get together.

447
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,050
Is his name mike delfino?

448
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,010
Did you room together at liars' college?

449
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,370
Um,I know it's last-minute,and I'm
really sorry,but I stilwanna see you.

450
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,120
So how about I drop by later?

451
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,440
Call me if that's a problem.

452
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,090
yeah,you'll drop by later...

453
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,970
with potato skins on your
breath,you miserable two-timer!

454
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,550
What's wrong,mom?

455
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,170
Nothing.

456
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,930
Just,the answering
machine lied to mommy.

457
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,850
i finally found a poem as beautiful
as you. you're all i think about

458
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,840
"the lover tells of the rose in
his heart" by william butler yeats

459
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,760
oh,crap on things.

460
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,990
Crap on what things?

461
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,040
porter sent me a sex poem.

462
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,400
What?

463
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,690
Why?

464
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,350
He may be in love with me.

465
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,410
Why would he be in love with you?

466
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,360
Okay...

467
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,550
remember how you told me I
should stop talking to him online?

468
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,020
Well,of course,I didn't,and I sort
of told him I liked his poetry.

469
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,320
You told a teenage boy
that you liked his poetry?

470
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,090
Jeez,lynette! Why not
just flash him a boob?

471
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,360
He'll hear you.

472
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,210
So what are you gonna do?

473
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,680
Are you gonna tell him the truth now,

474
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,180
or are you gonna wait until after
he kills me and blinds himself?

475
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,250
Calm down.

476
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,660
I'm gonna break it off in an e-mail.

477
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,290
Oh,great.

478
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,350
Just like that?

479
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,900
That'll kill him.

480
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,190
I know that you have only been the
receiving end of break-up letters,

481
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,850
but I've actually written a few,and
I know how to let him down easy.

482
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,030
"Dear porter,"I really like you,but
I wanna see other offspring."

483
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,420
Go away.

484
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,230
you know,I'm kinda surprised we still made michelle's
list this year,what with me working at the club.

485
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,060
Oh,don't be silly,carlos.

486
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,370
We're still on everyone's list.

487
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,470
now let's go.

488
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,050
Okay.

489
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,080
gaby,are we in the banquet hall?

490
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,870
What's all the noise?

491
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,710
Oh,it's just the caterers putting
glasses and silverware on the tables.

492
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,190
They make some racket,huh?

493
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,370
But the decorations are stunning.

494
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,850
especially that waterfall effect.

495
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,340
Gaby?

496
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,270
Bree!

497
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,390
Shouldn't you be in the kitchen?

498
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,370
Don't move,honey.

499
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,790
The press is taking your photo.

500
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,670
What are you doing here?

501
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,620
You were disinvited.

502
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
I got it all figured out.

503
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,550
We duck inside,make sure we're seen by all
the right people-- except mrs. Downing--

504
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,570
and then after about
20 minutes,we cut out.

505
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,200
Well,I know nothing.

506
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,730
Just keep me out of it.

507
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,030
What is carlosoing?

508
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,640
where is he?

509
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,820
Where is who?

510
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,700
Like you don't
know-- jackson.

511
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,040
Well,he's not here.

512
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,750
Really?

513
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,220
Whose is this?

514
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,670
I...d--I
don't know.

515
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,640
Some guy'S.

516
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,980
"I...I don't know"?

517
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,960
Well,I hope that "some
guy" doesn't mind this.

518
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,060
No,susan,really,I wouldn'T...

519
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,310
lady,what are you doing to my beer?

520
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,730
We're not married anymore,so
I don't have to protect you.

521
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,610
I am...

522
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,860
so sorry.

523
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,230
Miss?

524
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,820
could you just...

525
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,810
please take good care of my friend?

526
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,850
Jackson canceled on me.

527
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,000
He said you weren't
comfortable with us hanging out.

528
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,840
He said that?

529
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,870
And I think I said,"meow."

530
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,870
I am such a jackass.

531
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,350
So why don't you want us hanging out?

532
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,910
Well,I was pretty ticked off that
you told jackson about the ear thing.

533
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,110
Oh,god. The second I said
that,I wished I hadn'T.

534
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,120
I-I'm really sorry.

535
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,120
apology accepted.

536
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,700
So if I promise to
behave,can we still hang out?

537
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,540
'Cause I really think
it'd be good for M.J.

538
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,970
Just seeing that we're all friends.

539
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,700
I don'T...

540
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,270
what?

541
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,800
I'm just not comfortable with you
and jackson getting that close.

542
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,510
Okay.

543
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,210
It's just...

544
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,210
I don't want him to see
me through your eyes.

545
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,050
How exactly do you think I see you?

546
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,820
Well,those last few months
we were together,I...

547
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,380
the things I said to
you,the way I acted...

548
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,130
I mean,I'm not proud
of the person I became.

549
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,100
That was a bad time,susan.

550
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,820
We're not those people anymore.

551
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:33,550
And if you could see yourself through my
eyes,you'd know you got nothing to worry about.

552
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,000
could you please take care of this guy?

553
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,430
He's my friend,too.

554
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,870
Boy,am I glad to see you.

555
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,040
Where you been?

556
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,600
Out,uh,doing some thinking.

557
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,340
And I've decided that I may have gone
a little overboard about you and mike.

558
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,090
In fact,I think it's cool if
you wanna hang out with my ex.

559
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,300
Hey,susie Q.

560
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,230
Just shakin' the dew off the lily.

561
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,610
And speaking of,that paint
job in the guest can is nice.

562
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,820
Kudos.

563
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,210
What are you doing here?

564
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,080
Well,julie needed me to cosign
some insurance stuff for her,

565
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,590
and I guess I lost track of time
talking to crunchy granola here.

566
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,910
Plumber to housepainter
in one move,susie?

567
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,290
Don't get dizzy climbin'
that social ladder.

568
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,430
can you leave,please?

569
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,540
Just think...

570
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,850
if I'd been a roofer,we
might still be together.

571
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,610
Sigh.

572
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,480
Get out.

573
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,030
See ya around,hacky sack.

574
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,670
so...

575
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,540
any more exes I should know about?

576
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,740
don't you just love michelle's parties?

577
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,220
Oh,they are fun.

578
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,760
But I enjoy my intimate
lunches with michelle even more.

579
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,700
We have intimate lunches.

580
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,820
We're friends.

581
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,780
Well,you simply must come to the charity
auction at ted's gallery next weekend.

582
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,530
Really?

583
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,120
We'd love to.

584
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,030
gaby!

585
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,190
Well,it's the caterer!

586
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,650
everything is fabulous.

587
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,240
But would you be a dear
and get me some more wine?

588
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,800
I would be happy to.

589
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,870
I just want to make sure
it's the kind you like.

590
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,840
you're still here?

591
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,220
Dinner is about to be served.

592
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,360
Whose seats are you in?

593
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,060
The bowmans.

594
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,120
I found out mrs. Bowman
is home with the flu.

595
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,780
Score!

596
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,170
Oh,will you unclench?

597
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,050
It'll be fine.

598
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,420
That was mr. Bowman,wasn't it?

599
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,580
Yes,and I'm pretty sure that elderly
woman with him was his mother!

600
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,150
What kind of man leaves his sick
wife at home to go party with mommy?

601
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,990
You can fix this.

602
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,560
Just tell them that you're at the wrong
table and then slip out the side door.

603
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,850
Right.

604
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,750
that was the maÓtre d',wasn't it?

605
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,420
Yes,and he appears to be
checking the guest list.

606
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,590
Which we're not on.

607
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,420
Okay,you can fix this.

608
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,510
Just explain you're going to a different party
here at the club and that you got confused.

609
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,790
Mrs. Downing never has to know.

610
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,120
Right.

611
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,400
that's mrs. Downing.

612
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,890
How am I gonna fix this?

613
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,290
At this point,I would just run
off screaming into the night.

614
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,970
Thank you.

615
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,510
get your hands off me.

616
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,860
Gaby!

617
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,080
Gaby!

618
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,190
Poor blind bastard.

619
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,730
I'll meet him outside.

620
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,170
what?

621
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,570
Hi,edie.

622
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,390
I just wanted to say I feel
awful about what I said to you.

623
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,160
You know,that crack
I made the other day?

624
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,810
Okay.

625
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,230
That's nice of you.

626
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,520
Are you all right?

627
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,220
Actually,no.

628
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,100
My cat's missing.

629
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,040
Toby?

630
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,020
Since when?

631
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,200
It's been two days,and he's
never been out this long.

632
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,840
Oh,I'm so sorry.

633
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,110
I'm sure he's fine.

634
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,780
Yeah. Well...

635
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,890
could you tell dave...

636
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,940
tell him I apologized?

637
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,170
And,uh,you and I are good,huh?

638
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,320
I guess I could.
Why do you want him--

639
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,660
oh,just tell him,please.

640
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,620
I cannot believe you
pulled a stunt like that.

641
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:47,200
What? I was just trying to salvage
what's left of our social life.

642
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,060
Now just let it go and start
thinking about where we're gonna move.

643
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,580
This is not a joke,gaby.

644
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,410
I work with these people.

645
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,640
I have to show my face tomorrow.

646
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,000
It's humiliating.

647
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,610
You wanna know what's humiliating?

648
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,660
Waking up one day and
finding out you're invisible.

649
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,530
Now it's official.

650
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,790
I've lost everything.

651
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,240
Everything?

652
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,990
First our money,then my figure,now
the last shreds of our social standing.

653
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,640
We haven't lost a thing except the chance
to hobnob with a bunch of unhappy snobs.

654
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,830
What do you mean,they're unhappy?

655
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,760
They're rich!

656
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,530
They have jewels and cooks.

657
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,100
They use "winter" as a verb.

658
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:30,470
I rub them,gaby,and there is nothing
that a blind masseur doesn't hear about.

659
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,670
Trust me.

660
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:37,250
They are every bit as miserable as I was
when I was out there chasing that stuff.

661
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,270
We have lost nothing that matters.

662
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,070
We have a home,we have each
other,we have work that supports us,

663
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:53,860
and we have two beautiful
little girls that...

664
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,010
love us more than ice cream.

665
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,820
I've never been happier in my life.

666
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,240
Are you serious?

667
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,340
yes,

668
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:12,090
and the only thing that would make me happier
is forou to realize how good we've got it.

669
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,280
"I have never talked
to such a wonderful guy,

670
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,560
but I should've told you I'm
already seeing somebody..."

671
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,170
blah,blah,blah..."

672
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,170
continue to trust your heart,and
your dreams will follow."

673
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,120
Wow,lynette.

674
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,960
Best dear john letter ever.

675
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,240
thanks.

676
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,070
except you might wanna change that
part where you signed it "love,mom."

677
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,640
What?

678
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,740
No I didn'T.

679
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,820
Yeah,you did...

680
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,910
right there.

681
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,400
you sent it?

682
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,970
Oh,my god!

683
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,810
Oh,my god!

684
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,130
Oh,my god! Oh,my god!

685
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,590
Why didn't you say something?

686
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,490
I did!

687
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,730
You said it was great.

688
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,980
Way to bury the lead,tom!

689
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,660
tom,don't you dare!

690
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,350
Hey,one of needs to live to
take care of the other one.

691
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,020
oh,god.

692
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,850
Mind if I join you?

693
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,950
Okay,I know what I did...

694
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,630
was unforgivable.

695
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,090
And I am not trying
to make excuses,but...

696
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:49,900
we used to talk all the time,and then
one day it just stopped,and it killed me.

697
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,910
I felt like I lost you.

698
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,260
And then I was saraj,and I had you back,

699
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,390
and we were talking again,and
you were telling me thin.

700
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,040
I wasn't telling you anything.

701
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,670
I was telling her.

702
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,210
Okay.

703
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:19,330
Well,for what it's worth,I loved
our conversations,and I'M...

704
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,960
going to miss them.

705
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,130
Me,too.

706
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,570
orson,you're still up.

707
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,280
Oh,I wish you could've been there.

708
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,350
Linda flanagan loved my food.

709
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:48,030
She said I was "god's gift to the table" and
that I could quote her on the book jacket.

710
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,070
Are you all right?

711
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,240
I'm hungry.

712
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,340
It's after midnight.

713
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,490
Haven't you eaten?

714
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,270
I was waiting for you.

715
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,320
You said you'd make me pot roast.

716
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,520
I am so sorry.

717
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:04,010
I-I lost all track of time,and linda
had so many questions about the food.

718
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,940
I'll make you that pot
roast tomorrow,okay?

719
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,680
No.

720
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,570
I want it now.

721
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,600
Now?

722
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,860
You promised.

723
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,190
Orson,I've been cooking all day.

724
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,550
I...I'm so tired,I can barely stand up.

725
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,820
You really want me to
make you a pot roast now?

726
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,380
You promised.

727
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,940
toby!

728
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,700
Where in the world
did you come from,huh?

729
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:45,180
yes,everyone appreciates
a good neighbor...

730
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:52,170
you know,the kind that helps
you with the groceries...

731
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,880
but doesn't ask,"why
is your son so moody?"

732
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:07,040
the type that delivers misplaced mail but
doesn't point out your wife seems discontented...

733
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,430
the sort that offers to mow your lawn...

734
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:18,260
but doesn't mention
your husband seems cold.

735
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:25,880
But if you're not sure the man next door
is as nice as he would have you believe...

736
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,920
now why would you bring me flowers?

737
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,990
'Cause you've got a computer,and I need to
find out some stuff about edie's husband.

738
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:38,800
Do everything you can to
get to know him better.
