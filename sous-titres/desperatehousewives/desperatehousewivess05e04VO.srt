Desperate Housewives...

00:00:02,394 --> 00:00:04,262
<i>Bree's husband felt rejected.</i>

3
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:07,318
I think it's strange to see
my wife billed as "Mrs. Van de Kamp."

4
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:09,988
- It's how I'm known.
- Is there a Mr. Van de Kamp?

5
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,424
{\pos(192,230)}No, Mr. Van de Kamp is deceased.

6
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:14,567
{\pos(192,230)}Would it have
killed you to have mentioned me?

7
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:16,400
It's because I went to jail,
isn't it?

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,133
<i>Lynette's husband was excited.</i>

9
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:19,889
We're gonna start a garage band!

10
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:23,020
You were the one who said you wanted
to spend more time with your family.

11
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,703
Guys need to blow off steam.

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,851
<i>Edie's new husband had a past...</i>

13
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,980
You've been here six weeks, and you
don't seem any closer to coming to terms

14
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,072
- with your rage.
- I've come to terms with it,

15
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:33,701
and I like it just the way it is.

16
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:35,123
<i>Which remained a mystery.</i>

17
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:38,380
It's odd that you're married to some
guy you don't know anything about him.

18
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:41,221
She kept asking me all
this stuff about your background.

19
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:43,221
<i>And Susan tried to move on.</i>

20
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:46,010
- I sort of started seeing someone.
- Good for you.

21
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:56,471
<i>Every year, Ms. Elenora Butters</i>

22
00:00:56,648 --> 00:00:58,391
<i>would ask her kindergarten class</i>

23
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,262
<i>to draw a picture of their families.</i>

24
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:04,603
<i>Which she would then display
on "meet the teacher" night.</i>

25
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:07,662
<i>That's how Ty Richmond's parents</i>

26
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:10,021
<i>saw his depiction
of their fighting...</i>

27
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,840
<i>And Amy Hines' parents</i>

28
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,532
<i>saw her portrayal of their drinking.</i>

29
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,433
<i>And Jason Monte's parents
saw his illustration</i>

30
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:23,073
<i>of their hygiene.</i>

31
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:26,621
<i>You see,</i>

32
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,833
<i>Ms. Butters felt it was important
for parents to see themselves</i>

33
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,803
<i>through their children's eyes.</i>

34
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,491
<i>She knew the experience...</i>

35
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:38,820
Ed, he's got me vacuuming in my bra.

36
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,581
Do I do that?

37
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:43,952
...could be very educational.

38
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:46,232
I know, I know.

39
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,802
Did I not say 7:00?
You missed their little show.

40
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:50,210
M.J. was tooth decay.

41
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:53,383
Crosstown traffic killed me.
And I told you to videotape it.

42
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:57,000
Did you tell me to take off the
lens cap? Next time, be more specific.

43
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,482
Mr. Delfino, glad you made it.

44
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:01,942
Did you get to see M.J.'s artwork?

45
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,942
Not yet. Can't wait.

46
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:06,170
Look at that.

47
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:08,690
There we are,
standing in front of the house.

48
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:11,561
Look what he did with my hair.
I kind of like the bangs.

49
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:14,783
He put a wrench in my pocket.
And see how big my muscles are?

50
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:16,640
Which is a good thing,
'cause there's a

51
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:18,343
shark attacking the house.

52
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,023
Hey, daddy.

53
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:25,052
Hey, buddy. Your mommy and I were
just looking at your wonderful painting.

54
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:26,570
- You like it?
- I love it!

55
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:28,701
Especially how big and
strong you made me look.

56
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,933
That's not you. That's Jackson.

57
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,183
See the paintbrush in his pocket?

58
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:37,743
Oh, who's Jackson?

59
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,852
He paints our house...

60
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:44,241
Until my mom makes him
drink wine and have a sleepover.

61
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,872
Because...

62
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:51,981
Mike and I are divorced,
so that's why...

63
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:55,770
It was supposed to
be a picture of the family,

64
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:57,641
so you should've
put your daddy in it.

65
00:02:58,087 --> 00:02:58,963
I did.

66
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:08,413
The bug with the little hat?

67
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:09,623
That's you,

68
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:12,020
'cause you're always so far away.

69
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:14,823
Yeah, that's...

70
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:16,800
Now I see me.

71
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:19,763
<i>Yes.</i>

72
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:23,653

00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:18,662
{\pos(192,220)}I'm glad he likes my kid,
and my kid likes him. Here's a bike.

164
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:19,912
That's all it is.

165
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,021
Hey, guys.

166
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:26,621
{\pos(192,220)}Jackson, look at my new bike!

167
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:28,712
Pretty cool.

168
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,861
{\pos(192,220)}That's a custom titanium frame.

169
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:36,190
{\pos(192,220)}Make sure M.J. nows that.

170
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:43,443
{\pos(192,200)}Mommy, can Bethany go home now?

171
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:45,310
{\pos(192,220)}She's only been here 20 minutes.

172
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,371
{\pos(192,220)}We invited
her over to play, so go play.

173
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:49,352
But all she does is spin.

174
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:56,190
Honey, we want Bethany
to be our friend,

175
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,113
so if she wants to spin,
just suck it up and spin.

176
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:05,452
Why are you shoving that
little weirdo down Juanita's throat?

177
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:08,583
That little weirdo is the
key to you and I having more sex.

178
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:13,502
I know I should ask a few questions,
but I'm in.

179
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:17,062
Bethany's mom hosts a weekly playdate.
I'm trying to get Juanita an invitation.

180
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,930
How does that lead to
quality time with your boobs?

181
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,793
The only time you
and I have to ourselves

182
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,720
is late at night,
but by that time, we're too exhausted.

183
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:29,373
And now that we have
Celia in afternoon preschool,

184
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:31,890
all we have to do is unload Juanita,

185
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,091
and then we can get
back to doing the nasty.

186
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:36,321
This doesn't seem right.

187
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:38,823
Dumping our kid off
on some unsuspecting woman

188
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,360
so that we can have sex?

189
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:43,793
Wake up! Playdates were invented
by mothers for this exact purpose.

190
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,190
Shopping,
sex, drinking in the afternoon--

191
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:49,243
playdates make all
these things possible.

192
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:51,083
I don't know.

193
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:53,491
I feel bad making my
kid playing with someone

194
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:55,711
that she obviously doesn't like.

195
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:59,101
Bethany's mom will take Juanita
once a week for two whole hours.

196
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:00,590
That is sex and a nap.

197
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:07,020
I don't hear you spinning!

198
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:11,191
I don't understand.
You said the job was going so well.

199
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,461
It was. Then three weeks ago,
my parole officer

200
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,051
left me a message at work.

201
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:18,540
That's when they found
out I lied on my application

202
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,631
when I said I didn't
have a criminal record.

203
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,900
So you've been pretending
to go to work for three weeks?

204
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,002
I know you're angry.

205
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:29,243
I'm not angry.

206
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:32,882
I'm hurt that you didn't
feel like you could tell me.

207
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:34,910
I was embarrassed.

208
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:38,272
When we married,
I was the breadwinner.

209
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:41,313
Now you have your company
and you have your book.

210
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:43,701
I'm a felon who can't
hold on to a job.

211
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,563
Orson, we're partners.

212
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:49,173
We share everything.
Any success I have

213
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,271
is just as much yours as it is mine.

214
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:55,360
Thank you, darling.

215
00:10:58,728 --> 00:10:59,533
So...

216
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,340
Why did the Chamber
of Commerce call?

217
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:06,741
Apparently, we've been
named businesswoman of the year.

218
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,170
Is that good enough?!

219
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:31,681
You'd be killer in our band.

220
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,472
Wouldn't he be killer?

221
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:36,233
Donald, why don't you let us
talk it over and we'll get back to you?

222
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,363
No problem. I have to get back
to the office anyway. Quarterly tax time

223
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:40,612
has got me swamped.

224
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,912
We'll definitely call you today!

225
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,431
Thanks, gentlemen.

226
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:48,243
Don't you think he crushed it?

227
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,303
He was good... technically.

228
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,190
He didn't really have heart.

229
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:56,811
What do you mean? When he played Voodoo
Child, it was like Hendrix has risen.

230
00:11:58,348 --> 00:12:00,993
What about Mike?
I thought that's who we were gonna get.

231
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:03,563
I asked, but he said he's too busy.

232
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:06,930
Too busy to live a little?
Not gonna fly. Call him.

233
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,443
- Give him my number. I'll talk to him.
- Okay, sure.

234
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:12,282
But what about Donald. 'Cause
if we don't get Mike, I wanna make...

235
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:14,283
Tom, Donald's out, all right?

236
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:18,770
Have Mike call me.

237
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,870
What a rehearsal.

238
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,802
Dave and I, were smokin'.

239
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:36,921
Did you hear us?

240
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:43,752
I'm sorry. What?

241
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:46,100
Never mind.

242
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:49,382
What are you working on?
What, is this Bree's ad stuff?

243
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,333
God, no. Her agency really whiffed.

244
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,790
So I'm coming up with
a whole new campaign.

245
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,733
I was looking through my
old portfolio for inspiration.

246
00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:58,980
I remember this one.

247
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,333
"Feet? Meet your new best
friends." It was a classic.

248
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:06,733
It's been years since I looked through
this stuff. I'd forgotten I was...

249
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,250
kinda great.

250
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:10,213
You were awesome!

251
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:13,750
How lucky is Bree to have a neighbor
that used to be a advertising hotshot?

252
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,331
Maybe I'm the lucky one.

253
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:19,211
This could be a perfect way for
me to stick my toe back in the business.

254
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:24,092
Nothing big,
maybe just pick up some freelance work.

255
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:26,612
If you do that,
where you gonna find the time

256
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,311
for the family and the restaurant?

257
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:31,052
Gee, I don't know.
I guess the same place

258
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,181
that you find time
for your garage band.

259
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,242
I'm just saying that if you...

260
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:47,462
I dropped off Celia at preschool,
and Juanita's at her playdate.

261
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:48,642
Drop trou.

262
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,213
Why don't you put
on that sexy red Teddy?

263
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:53,981
Can I ask why? You can't see it.

264
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,350
Yeah, but I can feel it,

265
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:58,161
and I love the sensation
of sliding silk off your body.

266
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,041
What's it like, Carlos?

267
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:06,742
What?

268
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:08,812
Sex as a blind man.

269
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:11,692
You used to be so... visual.

270
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,473
Is it still as good?

271
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:16,540
It's better.
Having to rely on your senses of

272
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:19,851
touch and taste and smell...
It's actually way more intense.

273
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:22,401
Really?

274
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,092
You're so lucky.

275
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,262
What, you want blind sex?

276
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,512
I think I can arrange that.

277
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:33,791
Hey there.

278
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,962
Looks like somebody's
job interview went well.

279
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,912
Nope. They turned me down flat.

280
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:43,791
But as I was driving home,
it suddenly hit me.

281
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,131
I may be persona non grata
at every company in this town,

282
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:50,111
but there's at least one employer
I know who would love to hire me.

283
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:51,390
Who?

284
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:54,460
You.

285
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:57,853
You wanna work here?

286
00:14:58,948 --> 00:14:59,950
Why not?

287
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:02,712
I'm great with food.
I understand business.

288
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,273
I can't beat the commute.

289
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:08,500
That's certainly
an intriguing notion.

290
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,981
But wouldn't it be awkward
having me as your boss?

291
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,242
Absolutely.

292
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:14,363
But as you said in the park,

293
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:16,203
we share everything.

294
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,441
So I would be more of a... partner.

295
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,602
Partners...

296
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:24,050
Bree, would you give me
a hand with this arrangement?

297
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:26,141
Just give me a sec.

298
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:31,003
I think the lilies
need their own vase.

299
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:33,663
If you hire him,
I will cut you with these scissors!

300
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,953
I don't think we need to do that.

301
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:38,872
I think they're
crowding the irises out.

302
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:42,500
Just like he's trying to crowd me out.
You Already have a partner, remember?

303
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,091
I think the irises
and the lilies could work,

304
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:49,092
- together.
- Nope. One of them has to go.

305
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,582
- If I may offer an opinion
- Not a good time.

306
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:57,373
Tell him now, or I will walk.

307
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:02,252
Orson, you really
don't wanna work with me.

308
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:04,993
You only see me at home.
But at work, when the pressure's on,

309
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:06,503
I can be a bit of a handful.

310
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,833
- Katherine's seen how I get.
- Oh, yes.

311
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:11,093
Bitchy, Tyrannical, shrill--

312
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,673
He gets it, dear.

313
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:17,963
You're my partner in life.

314
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:21,643
But if we want to keep it that way,
we shouldn't mix marriage and business.

315
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:24,100
But no one else will hire me.

316
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:26,090
You've only been
looking for a few weeks.

317
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,942
Give it another...
say, month or two,

318
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:31,521
and you still haven't found anything,
then we'll

319
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:33,102
revisit the idea.

320
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:38,652
It was just a thought.

321
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:50,073
So what'd you think?

322
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,003
Oh, my god, you were right.

323
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:54,560
Blind sex is incredible.

324
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:58,503
Give me ten more minutes and an
energy bar, and we can go one more time.

325
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,683
No, I think we're done.

326
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,601
Honey!

327
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:13,323
What are you doing home?
I thought you were at Bethany's.

328
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:15,733
I got a tummyache.
Her mom brought me back.

329
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:19,653
How long have you
been standing there?

330
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:22,261
I don't know.
What were you two doing?

331
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:24,892
We were...

332
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:27,203
We were wrestling. Wrestling.

333
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:31,002
Did daddy hurt you?
You were making loud noises.

334
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:34,101
That wasn't real.

335
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,750
Sometimes I fake it
when I wrestle with daddy.

336
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:40,723
Please don't wrestle with mommy.

337
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:43,341
You're too big. You could hurt her.

338
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,140
Yeah, Carlos, stop that.

339
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,252
Go to your room, and I'm gonna
bring you something for your tummy.

340
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,613
- I think she bought it.
- The story of how daddy beats up mommy?

341
00:17:56,878 --> 00:18:00,350
- Relax. I told her I was fine.
- I could hear the worry in her voice.

342
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:02,131
Why don't we just
tell her the truth?

343
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:04,293
What, that sometimes
mommy rides daddy

344
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,222
like a mechanical
bull to get jewelry?

345
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:08,841
She's 5. She's too young
to understand either half of that.

346
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:11,230
It's the facts of life
she's gonna learn 'em eventually,

347
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,242
and it's the most natural
thing in the world.

348
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:16,811
If she was standing there
any longer than five minutes,

349
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:19,172
there was nothing natural
about what she saw.

350
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:22,012
By the way, thank you for that.

351
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:32,172
Hey, it's me.
Listen, I've got some free time.

352
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,840
So I thought I'd come over and
teach M.J. how to ride his new bike.

353
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,293
Great. He's so excited to learn.

354
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,580
Are you sure he's ready
to go without training wheels?

355
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,702
<i>He'll probably have
to take a few spills, but,</i>

356
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:44,980
luckily, he'll have his
old man there to pick him up.

357
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,451
He's been asking when you're coming.

358
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,053
I can't wait to tell him.
I know he'll be just...

359
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:55,451
- What's the matter?
- Spider!

360
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:57,832
Big one. Gotta go!

361
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:02,743
Mommy, look, no traing wheels.

362
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:05,303
I know! You did great!

363
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:06,910
Jackson, can I see you a sec?

364
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,760
That was amazing!
He learned so fast.

365
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:12,062
You know what I learned?
Mike is on his way over here

366
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,891
to teach his son how
to ride the bike he bought.

367
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:17,603
Something he was looking
forward to until you ruined it.

368
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:20,001
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't know I had to tell you

369
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:21,912
not to steal a father's
precious moment.

370
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:24,021
He just kept asking me.

371
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,211
- He made me do it.
- You could've walked away.

372
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:27,442
I couldn't!

373
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,320
He said, "pwease!"

374
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,453
Damn it.

375
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:34,530
As you can see,
the graphic works just as well

376
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,922
on a free-standing display unit.

377
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:37,990
Neat, huh?

378
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,640
Goodness. When you offered
to share your thoughts on my campaign,

379
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,882
I wasn't expecting anything quite so...
elaborate.

380
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:47,540
Who knew your marketing
guys were such lame-os?

381
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,461
What they came up with is so...

382
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:51,580
Tepid.

383
00:19:53,288 --> 00:19:55,810
I think "understated"
was what they were going for.

384
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:58,893
They overshot and
wound up in "bland,"

385
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,380
right on the border of "sucky."
You need to grab your audience.

386
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:05,173
Just grab 'em.
I've gone for jazzier colors,

387
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:06,642
bolder fonts.

388
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:09,502
I have really played
up the whole nostalgia angle.

389
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:14,660
"Let Mrs. Van de Kamp turn
your oven into a time machine."

390
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,082
I see women really
responding to that.

391
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:19,540
Do you?

392
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,000
Because I see,

393
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,933
children crawling into ovens,
hoping to see dinosaurs.

394
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:28,933
Well,

395
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:30,963
I've got a whole
bunch of alternatives.

396
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:33,503
I appreciate everything you've done.

397
00:20:33,678 --> 00:20:35,903
but I've actually approved
the old campaign, and,

398
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:38,152
I can't just tell them
I've changed my mind.

399
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:40,911
You don't have to. I'll be the bad guy.
Just tell 'em you've hired me,

400
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,690
and I'll go in there,
six-guns ablazing.

401
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:47,040
So... do we have a deal?

402
00:20:47,217 --> 00:20:48,491
Just give me the word.

403
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,622
Sorry, but I prefer their campaign.

404
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:56,892
But mine is better.

405
00:20:57,266 --> 00:21:00,082
You're... entitled to think so, but,

406
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,072
I don't.

407
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,382
Look, Bree...

408
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:06,990
I think I know a little
more about marketing than you do.

409
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,162
When I was in it, I owned this town.

410
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:11,163
I had every big account.

411
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,502
Hell, I was even named
businesswoman of the year.

412
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:17,822
I'm familiar with that award.

413
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:19,742
In fact, I'm this year's recipient.

414
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:22,602
- Really?
- Yes.

415
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,770
There's a luncheon on the 12th.
I do hope you can make it.

416
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:31,000
By the way,
you're right about those colors.

417
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:33,453
Very... jazzy.

418
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,533
Come on, M.J. your daddy's waiting.

419
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:51,550
Mommy, I don't wanna fall.

420
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:56,953
You know how you like to push
the button when we go on the elevator,

421
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:59,751
and if somebody else pushes it first,
it makes you sad?

422
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:01,481
But I don't wanna fall

423
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:04,430
Just listen.
Daddy really wanted to be the one

424
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:07,241
to teach you to ride your bike,
and if you can already do it,

425
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,091
it's gonna make him sad.

426
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:11,832
So just let daddy push the button.
Understand?

427
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:14,033
Oh, man.

428
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:24,632
He's really picking it up fast.

429
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,561
Yeah. I think it's
just beginner's luck.

430
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:32,902
Are you sure he hasn't
been practicing?

431
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:36,641
He was absolutely waiting for you.
I think I'm gonna go check his helmet.

432
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,561
What are you doing?
We talked about this.

433
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,800
- You're supposed to be new at it.
- I don't want to fall. I'm scared.

434
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:46,952
Of what?
You're 3 inches off the ground.

435
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,563
You're completely padded.
So just do what I say,

436
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,202
wobble, wobble.
"Daddy, look at me!" crash.

437
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:01,903
He was just telling me how
glad he is to have his dad here.

438
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,710
Really? 'cause I almost
feel like he doesn't even need me.

439
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:06,970
That's just silly.

440
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,913
Whoops-a-daisy!

441
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:27,190
It's a good thing your dad's
here to teach you how to do it right.

442
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:29,462
Looking good,
buddy, but remember, when you stop,

443
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:31,330
you gotta put your foot down first.

444
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:35,830
- Does that hurt right there, buddy?
- He's fine.

445
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:38,130
No, mommy. It hurts.

446
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:46,453
- This is all my fault.
- Will you stop?

447
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:48,272
The doctor said
it was just a sprain.

448
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:50,332
I know, but still,
I shouldn't have pushed it.

449
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:52,910
Why look for blame? Kids fall.

450
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,610
If you have to find fault,
blame the pavement, not yourself...

451
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:58,251
or me.

452
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,253
Mommy!

453
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:04,943
He should have his pitching
arm back in no time.

454
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:05,942
Thank you.

455
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:09,321
But I did wanna ask, M.J.
said that he fell on purpose.

456
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:12,773
Something about you telling him
to "let daddy push the elevator button"?

457
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,141
You told him to fall?

458
00:24:19,145 --> 00:24:20,950
Remember,
it's the pavement you're mad at.

459
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:23,552
What the hell, Susan?
Why would you do something like that?

460
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:26,393
Jackson taught him to ride the bike.

461
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:29,961
Who's Jackson?

462
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:32,381
He does sleepovers with mommy.

463
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:33,922
They drink lots of wine.

464
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:38,982
Hey, doc. Don't you hand
out lollipops to brave little boys?

465
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:46,590
I'm sorry.
M.J. was excited about the bike,

466
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:50,092
so Jackson took off the training
wheels and taught him. He didn't know.

467
00:24:50,268 --> 00:24:53,161
He didn't know I'd wanna be the one
to teach my own kid how to ride a bike?

468
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:54,352
You know what?

469
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:57,913
This is not Jackson's fault.

470
00:24:58,087 --> 00:24:59,832
You can't give a 5-year-old a bike

471
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:02,821
and expect him to wait
to ride it until you have time.

472
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,430
You know,
this is what it means to be divorced.

473
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:11,262
It means that sometimes
you won't be there.

474
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:13,422
I know.

475
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:14,882
It's...

476
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:21,370
Just harder than
I thought it would be.

477
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:25,101
It's hard for me, too.

478
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,141
I miss things when he's with you.

479
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:29,862
And I...

480
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:34,350
am trying to come to terms
with my guilt, because...

481
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:37,532
I have to.

482
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,071
So do you.

483
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,121
There's nothing else you can do.

484
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:55,131
Has Mike called?

485
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:57,680
Hi, honey. You're home.

486
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:00,601
Sorry, hon.

487
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,820
So did he call?

488
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:09,161
Listen to this.

489
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:11,422
Mrs. Hudson's putting
her house up for sale.

490
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:13,030
I think we should buy it.

491
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:14,600
Why?

492
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:18,570
As an investment. It's fantastic.

493
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,203
My friend Mary Alice blew
her brains out in this house, and,

494
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:24,450
all I'd have to do is let that slip,
and we'd get it for a song.

495
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:27,550
I don't think so.

496
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:30,350
Why not? We'll rent it out.
We could make some serious money.

497
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:32,833
Last thing I wanna be is a landlord,

498
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:35,712
get a phone call every
time a toilet overflows.

499
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:39,250
- That's why we hire a management company.
- Damn it, I said no!

500
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:48,680
Why are you yelling at me?

501
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:52,223
I don't know.

502
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:56,270
I'm sorry.
I just got a lot on my mind.

503
00:26:59,145 --> 00:27:00,142
I'm sorry.

504
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:34,630
Hi, Bethany.

505
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,731
I'm here to pick up Juanita.
Is she around?

506
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:38,730
Boys have sperm.

507
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:40,863
Excuse me?

508
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:43,492
We need to talk.

509
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:50,220
Apparently, after we had
our little chat with Juanita,

510
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,641
she went straight to Bethany
and passed on the facts of life

511
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,170
in excruciating detail.

512
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:56,690
Did you explain to Peggy
why we had the little chat?

513
00:27:56,868 --> 00:27:59,550
She didn't wanna hear it. Not
with Bethany running around the house,

514
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:06,292
- So we're out of the playdate?
- Yeah. Way out.

515
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,073
I guess it's back
to the old schedule

516
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,100
of ten minutes of grope 'n snore
at midnight.

517
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,972
I'm not going back. I can't.

518
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:17,430
If she doesn't get her playdate,
you're not getting yours.

519
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:19,991
Fine. I will fix it. I just,

520
00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:23,153
don't know why. Peggy's making
such a big deal out of this.

521
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:24,552
Sperm!

522
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:30,463
Stop talking to your sister!

523
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:36,340
What are you doing
in the guest bedroom?

524
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:37,993
I couldn't sleep.

525
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:39,662
You were snoring too loudly.

526
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,171
Me? Snoring?

527
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,203
Like a donkey with a head cold.

528
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:47,331
Honey, I don't snore.

529
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:49,620
You can't always hear yourself.

530
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:51,120
But I hear you...

531
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:52,801
Loud and clear.

532
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:57,731
For heaven sakes, come back to bed.

533
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:02,243
I'm good here.

534
00:29:11,098 --> 00:29:12,062
Dave Williams.

535
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:15,801
Hate to bother you, but I
got a busted pipe outside the house.

536
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:18,153
- Probably some kids playing a prank.
- No problem.

537
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:20,350
I'm across town finishing
up on another job, so,

538
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,373
depending on traffic,
give me, say an hour?

539
00:29:22,665 --> 00:29:24,172
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

540
00:29:39,037 --> 00:29:41,613
So when Juanita thought
that I might be hurting her mother,

541
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:44,403
we decided it was best
that she knew the truth.

542
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,053
It just seemed like the
right thing to do at the time.

543
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:48,712
See, honey?

544
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:51,151
I knew there had to
be a rational explanation.

545
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:55,713
I guess under the circumstances,

546
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:57,620
you didn't have y other choice.

547
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:01,501
So... do you think
there's any chance

548
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,642
Juanita could rejoin your playdate?

549
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:07,690
We've talked to her.
She will never discuss sex ever again.

550
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:09,922
Not if she wants to see
her favorite dolly alive.

551
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:15,581
Gaby, we don't need to let
them know all of our parenting secrets.

552
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:17,630
I... think that'd be okay.

553
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,820
I probably overreacted.

554
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:22,911
We just wanna keep Bethany's
innocence as long as we can.

555
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:24,660
We totally agree.

556
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,740
Kids are forced to
grow up way too fast.

557
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:30,302
No kidding. I want my girls to believe
in Santa Claus as long as possible.

558
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:32,831
They're gonna find out
soon enough that it's all a lie.

559
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,722
What?

560
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,640
There's no Santa Claus?!

561
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,090
So...

562
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:48,613
next playdate's monday at 1:00?

563
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:51,993
Whoever did this
really went to town.

564
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:54,171
Yeah, I know. Damn kids.

565
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:57,682
By the way, did you put any
more thought into joining the band?

566
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,832
Sorry.
I've been meaning to get back to you.

567
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:02,811
I appreciate the offer, but
I'm really stretched thin these days.

568
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:05,952
Come on. Every man's
got time for a little music.

569
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:07,990
Believe me,
I'd love to play with you guys,

570
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:10,552
but, I live 30 minutes away,
an hour in traffic.

571
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,591
- Time I've got left's for my son.
- Yeah, I hear ya.

572
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,652
You ever look into
living a little closer by?

573
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:18,813
With the rent prices
in this neighborhood?

574
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:20,721
I might play guitar
like a rock star,

575
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:23,943
- but I don't earn like one.
- Sorry.

576
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:26,633
- I wasn't thinking.
- It's all right.

577
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:28,472
Appreciate you trying to help.

578
00:31:30,218 --> 00:31:32,573
Believe me, I wish I could do more.

579
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:41,543
I've never seen Bree so happy.
She's glowing.

580
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:44,480
She won't be glowing when
that agency sinks her book.

581
00:31:46,055 --> 00:31:49,771
I'm telling you, the only thing staler
than that ad campaign is this dinner roll.

582
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:52,270
Yeah, and the water was
as flat as the ad campaign.

583
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:54,992
Your Martini was as dry
as the ad campaign. Let it go.

584
00:31:56,455 --> 00:31:58,992
Hi, everybody!
You having a good time?

585
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,380
- This is...
- Stu!

586
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:04,040
Lynette Scavo.
I thought that might be you.

587
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:07,333
Everyone, this is,

588
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:10,781
my old assistant, Stu, Durber.

589
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,063
This was one great guy.

590
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:16,640
He would schlep all
the way across town

591
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:18,810
just to get me my chinese food.

592
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:20,180
So...

593
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,073
what are you up to?

594
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:25,362
Actually, Stu's company
is doing all my advertising.

595
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:30,961
Your company? You have a company?

596
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:32,371
It's three years now.

597
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:35,232
How about you?
Are you still at Parcher & Murphy?

598
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:38,462
No, I... also went
into business for myself.

599
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,581
Her place makes the
best pizza in town.

600
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:42,872
You own a pizzeria?

601
00:32:43,158 --> 00:32:44,581
It's really my husband's.

602
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:46,623
And I'm still doing
some freelance stuff.

603
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:49,822
That's great.
We're always working late.

604
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,433
Give me your card.
We'll order from you some night.

605
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:55,442
Of course, we're across town,
so it may be a bit of a schlep.

606
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:58,212
It was great catching up.

607
00:32:58,385 --> 00:33:00,580
Bree, let me introduce
you to some people.

608
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:03,060
Great.

609
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:19,901
There's my beautiful wife.
What are you up to?

610
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:23,351
Why? Looking for a
reason to scream at me?

611
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:26,102
You're right.
I was awful the other day.

612
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:29,703
How about I make it up to you
by buying you Mrs. Hudson's house?

613
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,331
- Seriously?
- I thought about it, and I agree.

614
00:33:33,506 --> 00:33:35,112
It's a good investment opportunity.

615
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:37,673
Thank you!

616
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:45,810
And I promise that we'll
rent that place out for top dollar.

617
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,223
I'm not worried about that.

618
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,723
But first...
I want to do someone a favor.

619
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:00,562
Where are you? It's after 2:00.

620
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:02,582
I'm getting ready
for my job interview.

621
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,890
That's not until 4:00.

622
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:08,161
I'm reading the company's annual
reports. I want to be prepared.

623
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:11,643
Honey. Everybody's asking about you.

624
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:14,443
I want you to be here.
It's my big day.

625
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:16,510
Well...

626
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:18,260
enjoy it.

627
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:20,011
You've earned it.

628
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:33,361
You know what this
tastes like? More.

629
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,542
It would seem somebody's taking
their designated driver position...

630
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:38,943
a little lightly.

631
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:44,282
Stu is doing Bree's ad campaign?

632
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:47,272
I rode in his hatchback once.

633
00:34:47,558 --> 00:34:49,801
It smelled like mu shu.

634
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:51,023
I gotta warn her.

635
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:53,671
Wait! Why don't you wait
till after the ceremony?

636
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,380
Just until you can blink
both eyes at the same time.

637
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,943
Guys, I am just gonna
offer her a little advice.

638
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,981
- Still waiting.
- Great thing about the internet is that

639
00:35:08,155 --> 00:35:10,252
with a minimal investment,
you actually can reach

640
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:12,162
all your specific target audience...

641
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:13,430
Coupons.

642
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:19,391
Do a cross-promotion with
some of the major food companies.

643
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,020
Knock off 20%,

644
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:25,532
on some of the items
featured in your recipes,

645
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:27,751
then they do the same

646
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,452
towards the purchase
of your cookbook.

647
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:33,470
Our research shows,
people aren't so hot on gimmicks...

648
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:34,982
Zip it, Stewie.

649
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:37,492
Would you excuse us, please?

650
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:41,862
Lynette, you're drunk.

651
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:44,040
That's immaterial.

652
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:45,720
What do you think of the coupons?

653
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:49,013
I am really not able
to deal with that right now.

654
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:51,261
I know.

655
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:52,722
You've got your book and,

656
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:55,563
your big fancy award,
and I'm just a housewife.

657
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:57,601
I never said that.

658
00:35:58,395 --> 00:36:00,711
When I had a high-powered career,

659
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:04,433
and you were just a housewife,
I never looked down on you.

660
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,490
If you could all
please take your seats,

661
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,750
it's time to present our award.

662
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:13,471
You need to leave now.

663
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:15,880
Fine.

664
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:17,421
And don't worry.

665
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:21,073
Even though I'd like to,
I'm not gonna make some big, ugly scene.

666
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:39,742
Hey. I bought M.J. some stilts,
thought I'd teach him how to use 'em.

667
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:43,491
Actually,
he's at Juanita's watching a DVD.

668
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,212
- Do you want me to call him?
- No. It's cool. I just wanted to

669
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:47,791
tell him about my new place.

670
00:36:49,328 --> 00:36:50,832
You're moving again?

671
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:52,683
How far are you gonna be away now?

672
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:58,583
- The Hudson house?
- Yeah, she sold it.

673
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,032
And Edie told me the
new owner wants to rent it,

674
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:04,723
So I'll have a fighting chance of being
around when M.J. hits his milestones.

675
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,383
Is this okay with you?

676
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:12,100
It's great.

677
00:37:13,036 --> 00:37:14,352
We'll be like...

678
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:17,920
one big, happy, divorced family.

679
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:19,583
You sure?

680
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:22,340
It's a little weird.

681
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:25,543
But, M.J. will be thrilled, and...

682
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,862
Yeah, I'm fine with it.

683
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:29,720
Good.

684
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:31,150
So...

685
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:34,541
I'll see you around, neighbor.

686
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:44,322
I still think it's strange you won't let
me tell Mike that we're the new owners.

687
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:45,853
The man's got a lot of pride.

688
00:37:46,238 --> 00:37:49,403
I want him to feel like I'm
his neighbor, not his landlord.

689
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:52,113
Landlord? Hell,
with the rent we're charging him,

690
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:53,620
you're his fairy godmother.

691
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:56,170
Consider it an
investment in good karma.

692
00:37:56,468 --> 00:37:59,610
Screw karma. I finally do something nice
in this neighborhood,

693
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:01,071
and I can't brag about it?

694
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:05,691
The man who is silent
in his good deeds

695
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:08,833
is the man who reaps
the greatest reward.

696
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:20,250
So...

697
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:23,342
Give me some guidance. Do I grovel,

698
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:25,312
send flowers, or...

699
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:26,913
just move?

700
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:29,132
I'm not angry with you.

701
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:31,290
I'm just sorry that you felt so...

702
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:33,273
Drunk? Jealous?

703
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:36,561
You have nothing to be jealous of.

704
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:38,980
Don't give me that.

705
00:38:39,156 --> 00:38:40,993
You are having the kind of success,

706
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:43,673
I only dreamed of back in my ad days.

707
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:45,592
That doesn't mean
I look down on you.

708
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:49,721
But watching you, I look down on me.

709
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:53,682
When I held your book in my hands,

710
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:57,412
I felt so jealous my stomach hurt.

711
00:38:57,978 --> 00:39:01,443
And I thought,
if I could just hitch a ride,

712
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:03,133
have a piece of it,

713
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:06,370
I wouldn't feel so
bad about your success.

714
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:08,723
For god sakes,
stop calling me a success.

715
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:11,131
There's nothing successful about me.

716
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:19,431
My friends think I'm gonna drop them,
my partner resents me,

717
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,071
and my husband...

718
00:39:24,138 --> 00:39:25,901
has moved into the guest bedroom.

719
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:30,893
Everything I gain comes at some

720
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:35,200
horrible price, and I'm starting
to wonder if any of it's even worth it.

721
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:37,110
It is.

722
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:42,803
You're at the start
of an incredible journey,

723
00:39:42,975 --> 00:39:46,242
and I am going to be
there every step of the way,

724
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,332
cheering you on,

725
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:50,322
telling anyone who will listen

726
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:52,331
that the Bree Van De Kamp

727
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:54,090
is my friend.

728
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,252
Thanks.

729
00:39:57,498 --> 00:39:59,361
And the rest of the stuff...

730
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,422
You'll find a way to fix it.

731
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:07,890
Just know that all your
friends are very proud of you.

732
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:13,122
Bitterly jealous, but proud.

733
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:28,791
<i>If you look closely into
the faces of those around you,</i>

734
00:40:29,437 --> 00:40:32,843
<i>you will catch a glimpse
of a certain green-eyed monster.</i>

735
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:41,783
<i>And then you'll see
they envy your career...</i>

736
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:49,080
<i>Your love life...</i>

737
00:40:57,147 --> 00:40:59,992
<i>The time you spend
with their child...</i>

738
00:41:06,738 --> 00:41:10,183
<i>How do you deal with such jealousy?</i>

739
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:17,381
<i>There are many ways.</i>

740
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:21,562
<i>But the best...</i>

741
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:24,731
<i>is to simply share,</i>

742
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:26,592
<i>what you have.</i>

743
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,400
Thank you.

744
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:40,303
Promise me you'll never
leave our bed again.

745
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:42,520
I promise...

746
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:44,422
partner.
