WHY WERE YOU
TALKING ABOUT CONDOMS?

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,900
BECAUSE WE KNOW
TWO KIDS AT SCHOOL WHO ARE,

171
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,700
AND THEY'RE
ONLY USING CONDOMS,

172
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,700
WHICH  REALLY STUPID BECAUSE
CONDOMS ARE ONLY 85% EFFECTIVE

173
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,600
YES. THAT'S RIGHT.

174
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,000
A CONDOM ALONE
WILL NOT PROTECT YOU.

175
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,400
I TOTALLY AGREE.

176
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,200
(women speaking indistinctly,
laughing)

177
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,800
(gasps) BREE!

178
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,600
ALMA! I-I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT, UH, YOU KNEW EDIE.

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,300
I TOLD YOUR FRIENDS
AT THAT DINNER PARTY

180
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,600
I WAS LOOKING FOR
A NEW HOUSE.
A HOUSE?

181
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,100
YES,
AND GABY INTRODUCED US.

182
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,300
OH. WELL, UM... (chuckles)

183
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,700
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU.

184
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,600
I'M SURE THAT EDIE HAS LOTS
OF OTHER HOUSES TO SHOW YOU.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,200
NOPE. WE'RE DONE. ALMA TOOK ONE
LOOK AT THE APPLEWHITE HOUSE,

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,900
AND BAM--
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
WHAT?

187
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,700
WE'RE GONNA BE NEIGHBORS.
NO!

188
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,500
I MEAN...

189
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,000
I MEAN, NO, ALMA,
YOU CAN'T BUY THIS HOUSE.

190
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,000
WHY NOT?
WELL, ARE YOU AWARE
OF ITS HISTORY?

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,600
THE PREVIOUS OWNER... (whispers)
WAS HARBORING A MURDERER.

192
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,700
IT WAS HER SON.

193
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
SAY WHAT YOU LIKE,
SHE WAS A GREAT MOM.

194
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
THEY HAD
A DUNGEON IN THE BASEMENT.

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
I MEAN, PEOPLE SAY
THEY STILL HEAR GROANS

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,500
COMING FROM THE HOUSE
 NIGHT.

197
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,500
(under breath)
THEY'RE GONNA HEAR GROANS

198
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
COMING FROM <i>YOUR</i> HOUSE
IF YOU DON'T ZIP IT.

199
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
DON'T WORRY, ALMA,
I'M SURE THAT, UH,

200
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,900
EDIE CAN FIND YOU A HOUSE
THAT WON'T GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES.

201
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,800
IT'S TOO LATE, BREE.

202
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,400
I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

203
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
AND AS FOR THAT HAUNTED HOUSE
STUFF--WELL, THAT'S JUST SILLY.

204
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,600
PEOPLE DON'T COME BACK
FROM THE DEAD.

205
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
DON'T I WISH.

206
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,800
I WILL <i>NOT</i>
HAVE THAT WOMAN AS A NEIGHBOR.

207
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
YOU HAVE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING.

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,700
I SAID I'D TALK TO HER.
SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

209
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,600
THE HOUSE IS DARK.
SHE'S NOT THERE.
OH, SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA ???

210
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,000
I WILL DEAL WITH IT.
BREE, PLEASE CALM DOWN.
HOW CAN I BE CALM?!

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,500
FOR MONTHS, PEOPLE THOUGHT
YOU KILLED YOUR FIRST WIFE.

212
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,800
NO SNER DOES SHE SHOW UP
AND CLEAR YOUR NAME,

213
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,500
THAN THE POLICE HAUL YOU OFF
TO ASK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER MURDER!

214
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,400
THEY JUST HAD SOME QUESTIONS.
EVERYBODY HAS QUESTIONS.

215
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
SUSAN AND I AREN'T EVEN
SPEAKING BECAUSE OF IT.

216
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,500
BREE, PLEASE.

217
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,300
I TRY TO HOLD MY HEAD UP
AND SMILE

218
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,400
AND JUST BAKE MORE PIES
FOR THE CHURCH SOCIAL.

219
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,700
BUT NOW YOUR EX
IS CAMPED OUT ON OUR DOORSTEP

220
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,300
LIKE I AM HOSTING SOME KIND OF
MORMON SLUMBER PARTY,

221
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,300
AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW I AM GONNA
BAKE MY WAY OUT OF THIS ONE!

222
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,500
DARLING, I SWEAR TO YOU, I WILL
GET ALMA OUT OF THAT HOUSE.

223
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE
TO LIVE UP TO MY REPUTATION

224
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,600
AND STRANGLE HER.

225
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,300
OH, YOU'RE A GOOD HUSBAND.

226
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,500
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
I AM <i>NOT</i> GETTING YOU THE PILL.

227
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,000
AUNT EDIE,
JULIE AND I ARE IN LOVE.

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,800
OH, <i>PLEASE.</i>

229
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,600
IT'S NOT LOVE YOU'RE FEELING.
IT'S HORMONES.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

230
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,900
OKAY, FINE.

231
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,600
IF YOU WANT
TO... EXPRESS YOUR LOVE,

232
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,500
YOU DON'T NEED
TO GO ALL THE WAY.

233
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,900
KISS. TOUCH. RUB.

234
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,800
I MEAN, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO HEAVY PETTING?

235
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,000
IT'S SO UNDERRATED.

236
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,300
THAT'S YOUR ADVICE?
WELL, I'M SORRY.

237
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,100
I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD AT GETTING
PEOPLE <i>NOT</i> TO HAVE SEX.

238
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,600
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP US?

239
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,400
JULIE, IF I DO THIS,
YOUR MOTHER WOULD HAVE MY HEAD.

240
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,800
YOU SHOULD
BE TALKING TO HER.

241
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,100
I CAN'T TALK TO HER.

242
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,400
THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS
COMPLETELY FREAKS HER OUT.

243
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,400
SHE STARTED SCREAMING,
"SEX KILLS."

244
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
HMM, SO NOW
IT'S ALL IN MY LAP.

245
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,500
GOD, SHE PISSES ME OFF.

246
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,100
LOOK, HOW ABOUT I SPRING
FOR A BOX OF CONDOMS?

247
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,800
WILL THAT GET YOU TWO
OFF MY BACK?

248
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
CONDOMS
ARE ONLY 85% EFFECTIVE.

249
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
IS THAT TRUE?

250
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,500
DAMN. I THOUGHT I COULD COAST
ALL THE WAY TO MENOPAUSE.

251
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,000
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEX
WHETHER YOU HELP US OR NOT.

252
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
WE'RE JUST
TRNG TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

253
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,000
(sighs) HMM.

254
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,000
ALL RIGHT.

255
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,800
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THE RESPONSIBLE THING

256
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,000
IS TO ABSTAIN FROM SEX
AND FOCUS ON YOUR STUDIES.

257
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,400
THERE. I SAID IT OUT LOUD,
JUST IN CASE ANYBODY ASKS.

258
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,900
GABY,
I NEED ANOTHER PILLOW.

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
(Gabrielle) ALL RIGHT.
DON'T TAKE THE BIG ONE.

260
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,500
THAT'S MY FAVORITE.

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,400
IT'S ONLY FOR ONE NIGHT.

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,300
'CAUSE TOMORROW
I'M GONNA BE BACK HOME

263
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,600
SLEEPING IN MY OWN BED.

264
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,800
WHAT?! YOU CAN'T ABANDON ME!
THERE'S A MADMAN STALKING ME.

265
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,400
MY LIFE IS ON THE LINE.

266
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600
DO YOU KNOW
HOW SCARED I AM?

267
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,100
YOU'RE KEEPING THAT?

268
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
HEY, I'M SCARED,
BUT NOT OF THE DRESS.

269
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,500
(car door slams in distance)

270
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
(whispering) CARLOS!

271
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,000
CARLOS, WAKE UP!
I NEED YOU!

272
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,000
OH, YEAH,
I THOUGHT YOU'D COME AROUND.

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,800
WHAT? NO!
HEY!

274
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,900
HE'S HERE.

275
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,900
DON'T! (grunts)
(Gabrielle screams)

276
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,900
CARLOS, BE CAREFUL!
HE MIGHT HAVE A GUN!

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
(groans)
I'M UNARMED. STOP KICKING ME!

278
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,400
, NOW YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE ME ATTITUDE?!
OW!

279
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,900
GABY, WE GOT HIM. MAINTAIN.

280
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,500
THIS JERK HAS BEEN
TERRORIZING ME.

281
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,200
HE BROKE INTO MY HOUSE!
IT WAS A $6,000 DRESS,

282
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,700
AND MY BOSS DIDN'T WANT ME
LEAVING IT ON THE PORCH.

283
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
YOUR BOSS?

284
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,600
HEY, UH, AHEM,
I'M SORRY TO WAKE YOU, SIR,

285
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,900
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM
DROPPING OFF THE GIFT.

286
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,600
YES, AND SHE'S, UH,
RIGHT HERE... WITH ME.

287
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,500
THIS IS GABRIELLE.
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

288
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,000
YES, I GOT
YOUR "TOKEN OF ESTEEM,"

289
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,600
AND I'M NOT IMPRESSED.

290
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,900
BECAUSE YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT,
THAT'S WHY!

291
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,600
NO, I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH IT COST.

292
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,100
THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.

293
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,800
REALLY? THAT MUCH?

294
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,400
TELL HIM IF HE DOESN'T STOP
HARASSING YOU,

295
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
YOU'RE GONNA CALL THE COPS.

296
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,500
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
TRYING TO BE ROMANTIC,

297
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,800
BUT IF YOU KEEP THIS UP,
I'M GONNA BE FORCED...

298
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
WHAT'D HE SAY?

299
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU,

300
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,800
BUT I AM NOT THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

301
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
TELL HIM YOU'RE GONNA GET
A RESTRAINING ORDER ON HIM.

302
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
YES, I-I MAY BE
IN THE TOP TEN.
GABY!

303
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,900
HEY, I'M TALKING HERE!

304
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
YOUR VOICE
SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR.

305
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,800
DO I KNOW YOU?

306
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
HE SAYS I KNOW HIM

307
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
AND THAT HE WANTS TO
REINTRODUCE HIMSELF AT DINNER.

308
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,800
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

309
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,200
I WOULD NOT FEEL
COMFORTABLE MEETING FOR DINNER.

310
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
GOOD GIRL.

311
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,600
HOW ABOUT LUNCH?
GABY!

312
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,700
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO STOP
BUYING ME THESE EXPENSIVE GIFTS.

313
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,300
BECAUSE I'M NOT
THAT KIND OF GIRL.

314
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,700
WELL, FOR THAT MANY KARATS,

315
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,000
YES, I COULD BE
THAT KIND OF GIRL.

316
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,500
UM, I GOTTA GO.
I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW!

317
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,600
OH, HOW ABOUT THAT?

318
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,700
AND HERE I WAS,

319
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,600
THINKING SOME GUY WANTS
TO MURDER ME IN MY SLEEP.

320
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
THE NIGHT'S STILL YOUNG.

321
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
HOW ARE THOSE RIBS?

322
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,700
AH, JUST NEEDED SOME TAPE.
MAN, THOSE GUYS WERE HARD-CORE.

323
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,600
YOU REALLY SAVED MY ASS.

324
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,900
DON'T MENTION IT.

325
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,400
NO. SERIOUSLY.

326
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,700
EVER ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU,

327
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD.

328
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,200
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

329
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,600
ALL RIGHT.

330
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,700
HEY, DELFINO.

331
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,300
YEAH, BOSS?

332
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,400
YOU MIGHT WANNA FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER PROM DATE.

333
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
GUY'S NOT YOUR FRIEND.

334
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,200
 HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

335
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,300
AFTER THOSE MUTTS KNOCKED YOU
AROUND THE OTHER DAY,

336
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
YOUR BOY PAID 'EM OFF.

337
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,900
YOU SURE?

338
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,300
I SAW MONEY CHANGE HANDS.
JUST WATCH YOUR BACK.

339
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,600
SO I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF TOTALLY FREAKING OUT

340
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,000
WHEN JULIE ASSURED ME
THAT SHE'S NOT HAVING SEX.

341
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,900
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I WAS.

342
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,700
UH-HUH.

343
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,500
DON'T SAY "UH-HUH" LIKE THAT.
JULIE WOULDN'T LIE TO ME.

344
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,600
???????????THEN SHE'S NOT HAVING SEX.

345
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,300
OOH-KAY.

346
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
YOU CAN'T SAY "OOH-KAY"
LIKE THAT, EITHER.

347
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,200
JULIE'S NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS.
SHE'S A STRAIGHT-"A" STUDENT.

348
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,500
AND YOU WERE VALEDICTORIAN.

349
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
WHAT WERE YOU UP TO THAT
YOUR MHER DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT?

350
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,000
OK, YOU SEARCH THE CLOSET.
I'M GONNA LOOK UNDER THE BED.

351
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,800
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
FIRST RULE OF RANSACKING--

352
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
REMEMBER
WHERE EVERYTHING GOES.
(camera shutter clicking)

353
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,800
YOU ARE GONNA MAKE
A REALLY GOOD MOTHER SOMEDAY.

354
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,100
SO WHAT DOES THIS DIARY
LOOK LIKE?

355
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,800
UH, IT'S SMALL.
IT'S GOT A PLAID COVER.

356
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,100
OH, AND WHEN YOU FIND IT,
YOU HAVE TO READ IT BECAUSE

357
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,300
I PROMISED HER THAT I WOULD
ALWAYS RESPECT HER PRIVACY.

358
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,800
NOW HELP ME
FLIP THIS MATTRESS.

359
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,900
(gasps) OH,  GOD!
YOU FOUND IT?

360
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,200
THIS IS ADORABLE!

361
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
YOU THINK MAYBE I COULD--
NO, YOU CANNOT BORROW IT.

362
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
(scoffs) FINE.

363
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
WHY DOES JULIE HAVE A VCR?

364
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,300
TO WATCH MOVIES.

365
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,700
PLEASE. KIDS DON'T WATCH VIDEOS
ANYMORE. EVERYTHING'S DIGITAL.

366
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,400
SEE? IT'S JUST A TAPE.

367
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,500
IS IT?

368
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,500
ALMA.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

370
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,200
MEASURING FOR DRAPES.
I'M THINKING DAMASK.

371
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,100
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

372
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,400
WHY HAVE YOU MOVED HERE?

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
WELL,
IT'S A VERY NICE STREET,

374
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
AND I'VE MADE FRIENDS HERE.

375
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,600
PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN
SUCH AN INTEREST IN ME.

376
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,100
YEAH, THEY THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

377
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,200
THE NOVELTY OF YOUR NOT BEING
A CORPSE CAN'T LAST FOREVER.

378
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
WHAT ARE YOU AFTER, HMM?

379
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
ARE YOU STILL PUNISHING ME?

380
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,000
YOU WANT ME TO PAY YOU
TO LEAVE? WHAT?

381
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,500
I WANT
WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED--

382
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,200
YOU.

383
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,800
I'M MARRIED.

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,200
AND--AND EVEN IF I WEREN'T,
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

385
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,000
YOU DIDN'T LOVE
THE OLD ALMA.

386
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,500
I'M NOT
THAT WOMAN ANYMORE.

387
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
I'M STRONGER,
MORE C CONFIDENT.

388
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,900
IT MAY TAKE YOU A WHILE
TO SEE THAT, BUT I CAN WAIT.

389
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,100
ALMA, I LOVE BREE.

390
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,100
BUT DOES SHE LOVE YOU?

391
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,500
OH, SHE MAY LOVE
THE ORSON SHE KNOWS...

392
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
BUT DOES SHE KNOW
WHAT YOU DID TO MONIQUE?

393
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,700
DOES SHE KNOW
YOU RAN OVER MIKE DELFINO?

394
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,500
I KNOW ALL THAT.

395
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,900
 <i>I</i> STILL LOVE YOU.

396
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,600
WOULD SHE?

397
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,200
SO I SEE
YOU'VE SPOKEN TO MOTHER.

398
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,500
YES. IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE
ON MY SIDE IN ALL OF THIS.

399
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,300
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T TELL BREE.

400
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,800
SHE MIGHT GO TO THE POLICE,

401
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
AND YOU'RE NO GOOD TO ME
IN JAIL.

402
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,600
BUT IF I THOUGHT I HAD NO CHANCE
WITH YOU, NO CHANCE AT ALL...

403
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,600
WELL, THERE'D BE NOTHING
TO STOP ME FROM TELLING.

404
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,500
PLEASE, ORSON,

405
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
DON'T TAKE AWAY MY HOPE.

406
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,900
SHE'S NOT GOING.

407
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,100
WHY NOT?

408
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,900
AND WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT
ON THE PORCH?!

409
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,500
SHE KISSED ME GOOD-BYE.

410
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,000
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,
SLUG HER?
YOU WENT OVER THERE

411
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
INSTEAD, IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
READING HER A BEDTIME STORY.

412
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,700
BREE, I TOLD HER
WE DON'T WANT HER HERE.

413
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,000
I THREATENED, I SHOUTED.
SHE REFUSES TO GO.

414
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,300
WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

415
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,500
HELLO?

416
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,400
(Lynette) Hey, it's me.
You wanna meet for lunch?

417
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,400
NO, HONEY, I GOT--

418
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
I GOTTA DRIVE TO GREENDALE
TO PICOUT NAPKINS.

419
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,200
REMEMBER? I TOLD YA.

420
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,900
Oh. Yeah, that's right.

421
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,800
So I'll, um,
I'll see you tonight.

422
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
OKAY. GOOD. I'LL SEE YA.

423
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,800
OH... MY... GOD.

424
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,400
HEY, MRS. SCAVO.

425
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,900
ANDREW, HI!

426
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T STARTING
UNTIL THE OPENING.

427
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,300
OH, YEAH, THERE'S JUST SO MUCH
WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

428
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,300
MR. SCAVO
ASKED ME TO START EARLY.
OH.

429
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,000
HE'S NOT HERE,
BY THE WAY

430
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,300
YEAH, I-I KNOW. AND HEY,
DON'T TELL HIM I STOPPED BY.

431
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,900
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.
I JUST WANTED TO SNEAK A PEEK.

432
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,700
SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORKING?

433
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,000
SHOULDN'T YOU NOT BE HERE?

434
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,800
TOUCHé.

435
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,500
SO, UH, HOW DO YOU
LIKE THE PLACE?

436
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,400
I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC.

437
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,700
IT'S REALLY COMING TOGETHER.
OOH, I LOVE THE BAR.

438
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,100
OH, YEAH, IT'S, UH,
IT'S PRETTY COOL.

439
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,200
IT'S TOO BAD
WE CAN'T GET A LIQUOR LICENSE.

440
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,500
WHAT?

441
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,200
OH, UH,
DIDN'T MR. SCAVO TELL YOU?

442
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,800
NO... HE DIDN'T.

443
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,200
DON'T, UM, RESTAURANTS MAKE
HALF THEIR MONEY ON THE LIQUOR?

444
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,100
OH. YEAH. WE'RE--
WE'RE COMPLETELY SCREWED.

445
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,300
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

446
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,300
UH, THE CITY, UH,
REZONED AND SAID

447
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,600
HE HAD TO GET ALL THE RESIDENTS
WITHIN A BLOCK TO SIGN A WAIVER,

448
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,500
AND THERE ARE SOME HOLDOUTS.

449
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,600
HE'S KINDA BUMMIN'.

450
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
WELL, THEN WHY ISN'T
HE DEALING WITH IT

451
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
INSTEAD OF
SHOPPING FOR NAPKINS?

452
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,400
WE COULD LOSE OUR SHIRTS
IN THIS DUMP!

453
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,800
IS THIS DR. MARVIN TASHMAN?

454
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
HI. MY NAME IS SUSAN MAYER.

455
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
UM, MY DAUGHTER JULIE
CAME IN TO SEE YOU...

456
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
YES, ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL.

457
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,200
SO I'M JUST CURIOUS...

458
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,600
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF PRESCRIBING
 <i>THAT</i> WITHOUT MY CONSENT?!

459
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,300
WHAT?! NO, I MOST CERTAINLY
WAS NOT THERE.

460
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,300
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE?

461
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,900
I DON'T HAVE BLONDE HAIR.

462
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,500
WAIT, DID MY BLONDE HAIR
HAVE DARK ROOTS?

463
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,400
OH!

464
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,600
I FORGOT TO GIVE YOU
THE KEYS TO THE SHED.

465
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,900
YOU GOT MY DAUGHTER
THE PILL?!

466
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,000
HERE. CATCH.

467
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,800
DON'T YOU WALK AWAY
FROM ME!

468
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,200
DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS NOW?

469
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
YES, WE DO.

470
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,000
YOU MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN YOUR
FIRST DIAPHRAGM WITH MILK MONEY,

471
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,300
BUT THAT DOESN'T
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT

472
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,700
TO CORRUPT MY DAUGHTER!
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
I WENT AFTER JULIE AND SAID,

473
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
"HEY, DO YOU WANNA GO OUT

474
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,200
FOR A BURGER
AND SOME BIRTH CONTROL?"

475
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,000
 <i>SHE</i> CAME TO ME.
YOU DO NOT
GET TO DECIDE THIS FOR HER!

476
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,100
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!

477
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,300
AAH! I WAS THINKING,
 <i>IF</i> JULIE GOT KNOCKED UP,

478
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,600
THAT--THAT YOU AND I
COULD BECOME FAMILY,

479
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,700
AND I'M SORRY,
I <i>CANNOT</i> TAKE THAT CHANCE.

480
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,500
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

481
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,300
IT WASN'T TILL
YOUR ROTTEN NEPHEW CAME TO TOWN

482
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,900
THAT JULIE WAS
A PERFECT KID,

483
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,500
AND NOW SHE'S LYING AND SCHEMING
AND HAVING CASUAL SEX!

484
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,200
SHE'S JUST A BOOB JOB AWAY
FROM BEING YOU!

485
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,200
LOOK, MAYER,
JULIE HAS DISCOVERED SEX.

486
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,800
THE GENIE
IS OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

487
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,600
AND YOU BETTER GET GOOD WITH IT,
OR YOU COULD LOSE HER FOREVER.

488
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,400
'CAUSE LIKE IT OR NOT,
SHE LOVES HIM.

489
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,100
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
HE LOVES HER.

490
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,900
AHEM!

491
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,400
(man) YOUR GENTLEMAN FRIEND
WENT TO MAKE A CALL.

492
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,500
HE'LL BE WITH YOU SHORTLY.

493
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,300
THANK YOU.

494
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,000
OH.

495
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,400
GABRIELLE.

496
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,200
ZACH YOUNG!

497
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,100
OH, MY GOD!
IT'S BEEN AGES.

498
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,400
(chuckles) WOW.

499
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
LOOK AT YOU!
SO HANDSOME IN A SUIT.

500
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,200
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

501
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,700
AREN'T YOU SWEET?
(chuckles)

502
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,800
UH, WELL, ANYWAY,
I--I'D LOVE TO CATCH UP,

503
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,300
BUT I'M KINDA WAITING
FOR SOMEE.

504
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,400
YES, I KNOW.

505
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,700
SO THE DRESS FITS. COOL.

506
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,000
I'D LIKE A BOTTLE

507
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,800
OF YOUR 1982 CHâTEAU LAFITE
ROTHSCHILD, PLEASE.

508
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,900
I'M SORRY.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

509
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,300
OH, UH,
WHY DON'T WE SAY...

510
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
100?

511
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,500
SO YOU ARE.

512
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,700
WOW, SOMEONE GOT AN ADVANCE
ON THEIR ALLOWANCE.

513
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,000
I WAS
MY GRANDFATHER'S SOLE HEIR.

514
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,800
I'M--I'M ACTUALLY
IN THE FORTUNE 400.

515
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,500
(laughs) DOES THAT--
DOES THAT SEEM WEIRD TO YOU?

516
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,600
I'M ON A DATE
WITH ZACH YOUNG.

517
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,200
NOTHING'S EVER
GONNA SEEM WEIRD AGAIN.

518
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
EVERY CENT WE HAVE
IS CIRCLING THE BOWL,

519
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,600
AND TOM NEVER SAID A WORD.
WHY DIDN'T HE COME TO ME?

520
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
WELL, CLEARLY,
HE'S EMBARRASSED.

521
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,100
BUT I'M HIS WIFE.
DON'T BE DENSE, LYNETTE.

522
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
HALF THE REASON MEN
WANT TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING

523
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,600
IS SO THEY CAN SHOW OFF
FOR THE WOMEN THEY LOVE,

524
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,900
AND WHEN THEY FAIL, THEY LIKE
TO KEEP IT TO THEMSELVES.

525
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,200
I'M GONNA TELL HIM.

526
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,300
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
I WENT TO THE RESTAURANT

527
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,900
AND THAT I KNOW HE SCREWED UP
AND THAT I'M GONNA FIX IT.

528
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,500
OH, FOR GOD SAKE, IT'S BAD
ENOUGH YOU CUT OFF HIS COJONES.

529
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,600
NOW YOU WANNA JUGGLE THEM?

530
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
MY HUSBAND IS IN TROUBLE.

531
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,800
I LOVE HIM.
SHOULDN'T I WANT TO HELP HIM?

532
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,600
WELL,
 YOU REALLY LOVE HIM,

533
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,800
YOU SHOULD HELP HIM WITHOUT
LETTING HIM KNOW THAT YOU DID.

534
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,200
YEAH, SO IN ADDITION
TO MY PENTHOUSE,

535
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,600
I ALSO HAVE
A CHâTEAU IN SWITZERLAND

536
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
AND A COTTAGE
IN THE HAMPTONS.

537
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,100
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,
HUH?

538
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,800
YOU GOT A LITTLE CHOCOLATE
ON YOUR SHIRT.

539
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,900
HMM? DAMN IT!

540
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,300
HERE, LET ME GET IT.
NO, I CAN DO IT!
I CAN DO IT!

541
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
I--I'D LIKE TO DO IT MYSELF,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (sighs)

542
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,900
I'M SORRY, I--

543
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,600
YOU KNOW, I'LL--I'LL BE NEATER
FOR YOU NE TIME.

544
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,000
NEXT TIME?

545
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,900
HONEY, LET'S GET REAL.
YOU ARE WAY TOO YOUNG FOR ME.

546
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I'M 2 MONTHS OLDER
THAN JOHN ROWLAND.

547
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,200
(scoffs) WELL,
JOHN ROWLAND WAS A MISTAKE.

548
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,400
I WAS LONELY.

549
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,900
YOU'RE NOT LONELY NOW?

550
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,400
YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT MY DIVORCE.

551
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,200
YEAH. YOU WERE REALLY SMART
TO GET RID OF CARLOS.

552
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
YOU DESERVE MU BETTER.

553
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,700
AND LET ME GUESS--
NOW YOU'RE MY UPGRADE?

554
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,700
WELL, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU NEED
SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU,

555
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,600
AND I'M RICH NOW. I CAN
GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT.

556
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,200
WAIT A MINUTE. WHO SAYS I NEED
SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF ME?

557
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,700
MY MOM, HER FRIENDS
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

558
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
THEY SAID IT WAS THE ONLY REASON
YOU STAYED WITH CARLOS,

559
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,600
CONSIDERING
HOW HE TREATED YOU.

560
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
WELL, THEY WERE WRONG.

561
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,600
THANK YOU FOR LUNCH, ZACH.

562
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,900
WAIT, GABRIELLE.

563
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
I'M NOT THAT AWKWARD KID
THAT I WAS BEFORE.

564
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,400
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST...

565
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,500
PLEASE TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.

566
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,600
I'M SORRY. I JUST CAN'T.

567
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,200
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

568
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,200
(sighs) OH, SWEETIE.

569
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,400
I REALLY WISH YOU WOULD.

570
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,000
FOR GOD SAKES, ZACH!

571
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,800
DON'T HIJACK A FERRARI
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE!

572
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
MR. GAUNT?

573
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,900
HI, I'M LYNETTE SCAVO.

574
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,000
MY HUSBAND
IS OPENING THE PIZZERIA

575
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,600
RIGHT DOWN THE BLOCK--
IF IT'S ABOUT
THAT LIQUOR LICENSE,

576
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
I'M NOT SIGNING.

577
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,000
PLEASE, I'VE BEEN AT THIS
FOR HOURS. JUST HEAR ME OUT.

578
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,700
WELL, I NEVER COULD RESIST
A PRETTY LADY.

579
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,100
OH!
COME ON IN

580
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,800
THANK YOU.

581
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,300
DID YOU LIVE IN LAS VES?

582
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,000
I WAS A CROUPIER FOR 40 YEARS,

583
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,900
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
I HAD A WEAKNESS FOR SHOWGIRLS.

584
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,600
I BET YOU WERE
QUITE THE PLAYER.

585
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,000
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

586
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
(laughs)
CAN I TOP YOU OFF THERE?

587
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,800
NO, THANKS. TWO'S MY LIMIT.

588
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,200
WELL, SUIT YOURSELF.

589
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,300
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LICENSE.

590
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,000
YOUR NEIGHBORS HAD THEM, TOO.

591
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,800
BUT THEY SIGNED THE WAIVER
ONCE I EXPLAINED TO THEM

592
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,100
THAT THIS IS
A FAMILY RESTAURANT.

593
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,200
NO LATE NIGHTS,
NO LOUD MUSIC.

594
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,300
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I LEARNED IN VEGAS,

595
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,700
IT'S THAT BOOZE TURNS MOST
PEOPLE INTO NOISY JACKASSES,

596
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,100
AND I DON'T WANT 'EM
PUKING ON MY DOORSTEP.

597
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,200
COME ON, HARRY.
YOU ARE MY LAST HOLDOUT.

598
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,300
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE? CASH?

599
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,300
UH, FREE PIZZA FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE? YOU NAME IT.

600
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,100
LOOK, I-I HATE
TO DISAPPOINT A PRETTY LADY,

601
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,900
BUT I'M NOT SIGNING.

602
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,900
HARRY, MY HUSBAND QUIT HIS JOB
TO START THIS RESTAURANT,

603
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,900
AND IF WE CAN'T SELL LIQUOR,
WE CAN'T MAKE A PROFIT--

604
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,000
AND WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HARRY.
(clicks tongue) EYES UP HERE.

605
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,800
OH, SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

606
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,000
SORRY.

607
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,600
THIS PLACE IS HIS DREAM,

608
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,000
AND IF HE CAN'T MAKE IT WORK,
THEN IT'S JUST GONNA KILL HIM,

609
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,500
AND CONSEQUENTLY
IT'S GONNA KILL OUR MARRGE--

610
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,200
AND, HARRY--
HARRY, WHAT DID I SAY?

611
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,000
I KNOW, UH, UH,
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE.

612
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
IT'S JUST THAT MY SHOWGIRL DAYS
WERE A WHILE AGO,

613
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,100
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME

614
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,000
I LAID EYES ON A...
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S...

615
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,800
BOSOM.

616
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,000
VERY BRIEFLY
REFRESH YOUR MEMORY?

617
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,700
COMPLETELY WORTH IT.

618
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,100
GLAD YOU THOUGHT SO.

619
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,000
MMM!

620
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,300
ME ON, BABY.
SAY IT ONE MORE TIME FOR MOMMY.

621
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,700
SO YOU CAN TEACH 'EM
TO SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT?

622
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,900
OH, YES.
THESE BIRDS ARE VERY BRIGHT.

623
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,600
I THINK
THEY'RE SMARTER THAN PEOPLE.

624
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,500
 <i>SOME</i> PEOPLE, ANYWAY.

625
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,300
BREE! COME IN.
I JUST MADE SOME LEMONADE.

626
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
THIS ISN'T A SOCIAL CALL.

627
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
WE NEED TO TALK.

628
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,500
ABOUT WHAT?

629
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,500
ABOUT WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE

630
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,300
TO GET YOU
TO SELL THIS HOUSE AND MOVE.

631
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,700
MOVE? WHY?

632
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,700
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND'S EX-WIFE.

633
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,300
YOU DISAPPEARED SO PEOPLE
WOULD THINK HE KILLED YOU.

634
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,300
DOES MY SCOMFORT REALLY NEED
ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION?

635
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU FELT THIS WAY.

636
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,900
OH,PLEASE.

637
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,100
ORSON MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR
WE DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

638
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,600
(chuckles) OKAY,
NOW I'M REALLY CONFUSED.

639
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,400
WHEN ORSON CAME BY,
ALL HE SAID WAS,

640
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,800
"WELCOME TO THE STREET"
AND DID I NEED HELP UNPACKING.

641
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

642
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,700
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I-I THINK I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

643
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,100
HOW ABOUT THAT LEMONADE?

644
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,000
MA'AM,
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE THIS?

645
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,300
OOH, UH, UPSTAIRS.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

646
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,800
HERE, DRINK THIS. YOU LOOK
A LITTLE PALE. BE RIGHT BACK.

647
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,500
(parrot) DON'TELL BREE.

648
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,200
DON'T TELL BREE.

649
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,800
OH, MY...

650
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

651
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,300
I'M SO SORRY.
I BR--BROKE A GLASS.

652
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,700
DON'T WORRY. I'LL GET IT.

653
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,800
WELL, OKAY... I HAVE TO GO.

654
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,000
OH, BREE...

655
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,000
WAIT.

656
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,300
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU MIGHT
FEEL A LITTLE THREATENED

657
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,600
ABOUT MY MOVING IN HERE.

658
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,100
BUT IN TIME,
YOU'LL SEE I'M...

659
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,900
I'M PERFECTLY HARMLESS.

660
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,100
SO... HOW WAS
THE MYSTERY DATE?

661
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,000
UH, IT WAS FABULOUS.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

662
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,900
OH, COME ON.
I WANT DETAILS. WHO IS HE?

663
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
OH, SOME GLOBAL FINANCIER,

664
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
SAW ME ON THE COVER
OF "PARIS MATCH."

665
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,800
GOOD-LOOKING,
JUST NOT MY TYPE.

666
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,200
REALLY?

667
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,400
'CAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT

668
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,200
THAT YOU AND ZACH WOULD MAKE
A REALLY GREAT COUPLE.

669
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,900
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU WERE THERE?

670
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,700
PARKED ACROSS THE STREET,
LAUGHING MY ASS OFF.

671
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,300
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FOLLOWED ME.
(laughs)

672
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,900
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MEETING
A PSYCHO KILLER FOR LUNCH.

673
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,700
I WAS WORRIED.

674
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,600
WELL, AT LEAST UNTIL

675
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,200
THEY BROUGHT OUT THE CRAYONS
AND CHILDREN'S MENUS.

676
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
ALL RIGHT, OFF MY PORCH.

677
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,300
OKAY, BUT DON'T FORGET,
YOU ASKED ME TO WATCH YOUR BACK.

678
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,300
YEAH, ABOUT THAT--

679
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,300
UM, I'M INSTALLING
AN ALARM SYSTEM TOMORROW,

680
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,700
SO I'M NOT GONNAEED YOU
TO LOOK AFTER ME ANYMORE.

681
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,900
GABY, I DON'T MIND.

682
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 <i>I</i> MIND. WE'RE DIVORCED.

683
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,600
I CAN'T KEEP RUNNING TO YOU
EVERY TIME I GET SCARED.

684
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,800
I WANT TO BE THE KIND OF WOMAN
WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

685
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,700
WELL...

686
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,400
GOOD FOR YOU.

687
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,600
I'M STILL
RIGHT DOWN THE BLOCK,

688
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,500
SO IF YOU DO NEED ME...

689
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,000
I WON'T. BUT THANK YOU.

690
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,500
HI.

691
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,700
HEY.

692
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

693
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,500
I'M CELEBRATING.
WE GOT OUR LIQUOR LICENSE TODAY.

694
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,000
REALLY? THAT'S GREAT!

695
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
YEAH, ANDREW SAID HE WENT
ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD

696
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,000
GETTING SIGNATURES.

697
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,500
GOOD FOR HIM.

698
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,700
BUT I THINK HE'S LYING.

699
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,900
I THINK SOMEBODY ELSE
GOT THE SIATURES.

700
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,900
OKAY, LET'S SAY
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT,

701
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,500
THAT SOMEONE ELSE DID--

702
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,100
SOMEONE WHO CLEARLY
LOVES YOU VERY MUCH.

703
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

704
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,400
NOTHING. NOTHING. ORDER HAS BEEN
RESTORED IN THE UNIVERSE.

705
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,500
YOU SAVED THE DAY.
I'M A LOSER.

706
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,700
AW, COME ON, TOM.

707
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,500
I TRIED FOR TWO MONTHS
TO GET THAT WAIVER SIGNED.

708
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,700
YOU DID IT IN A DAY.

709
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,700
????????????
YOU CAN'T DROWN IN SELF-PITY

710
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,000
JUST BECAUSE I HELPED YOU
WITH ONE TINY LITTLE THING.

711
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,700
OKAY, BUT IF I TELL YOU THAT
THE PLUMBING'S NOT UP  CODE,

712
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,500
THAT WE HAVE TERMITES

713
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,400
AND THAT THE CHAIRS WON'T
BE THERE UNTIL AFTER WE OPEN,

714
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,800
CAN I DROWN
IN SELF-PITY THEN?

715
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,200
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT ALL OF THIS?

716
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,800
BECAUSE I WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH
SOMETHING ON MY OWN.

717
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,600
 <i>I'M</i> THE MAN.

718
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,900
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RUN
TO MY WIFE TO BAIL ME OUT.

719
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,300
OW!

720
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,300
GAMBLING WITH OUR LIFE SINGS
AND NOT ASKING FOR HELP

721
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,100
DOESN'T MAKE YOU A MAN.

722
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,400
IT MAKES YOU AN IDIOT.

723
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,000
COME ON, TOM, FOR GOD SAKES,
WE ARE A TEAM,

724
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,300
AND THAT RESTAURANT
IS A HUGE UNDERTAKING.

725
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
NO ONE COULD DO IT ALONE.

726
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,800
YOU DON'T ASK ME FOR HELP
WITH YOUR AD CAMPAIGNS. OW!

727
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,400
I DON'T HAVE TO.

728
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,800
YOU'RE ALWAYS GIVING IT TO ME,
INSPIRING ME.

729
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,400
REMEMBER THE MOUTHWASH JINGLE?
 <i>YOU</i> CAME UP WITH THE HOOK.

730
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,000
AND--AND WHAT ABOUT
THE BARTLETT CAMPAIGN?

731
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,400
WOULD I HAVE EVER COME UP WITH
TANGO-DANCING FLEAS? ALL YOU.

732
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,900
THERE'S NOTHING
THAT I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED

733
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,300
THAT I COULD HAVE DONE
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

734
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,900
OKAY, FINE.
I HELP. WE'RE A TEAM.

735
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,600
JUST DON'T HIT ME AGAI

736
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,600
SO TOMORROW, FIRST THING,
WE'LL FIX THE PLUMBING,

737
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,500
WE'LL CALL AN EXTERMINATOR,
WE'LL RENT SOME CHAIRS

738
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,200
AND WE <i>WILL</i> OPEN ON TIME,
AND IT'LL BE A GLORIOUS SUCCESS

739
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,300
THAT <i>YOU</i> WILL HAVE ACHIEVED
WITH MY HELP, OKAY?

740
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,300
OKAY.

741
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,800
AND TONIGHT I'M GONNA
SLAP ON SOME SEX PERFUME

742
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,900
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET NAKED,

743
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,200
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA SEE
WHO THE MAN IS.

744
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,200
D, I HOPE IT'S ME.

745
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,200
OH, M SURE IT WILL BE.

746
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,500
HEY, MOM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

747
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,700
OH.

748
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING--

749
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,200
DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT GONNA
GET MAD. JUST SIT DOWN.

750
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,400
YOU KNOW WHAT
UPSET ME THE MOST?

751
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,500
THAT YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME ENOUGH
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

752
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,900
I TRIED TO.
YOU FREAKED OUT.

753
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,100
WELL, OF COURSE I FREAKED OUT.
I'M A PARENT.

754
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,900
YOU KNOW,
WE HOPE THAT OUR CHILDREN

755
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,700
WILL WAIT TO HAVE SEX TILL...
AFTER WE'RE DEAD.

756
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,100
AND YOU WONDER WHY
I WENT TO EDIE.

757
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,100
OKAY, THAT'S THE OTHER THING.
THAT CANNOT HAPPEN ANYMORE.

758
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,700
YOU AND I HAVE ALWAYS HAD
AN AMAZING RELATIONSHIP.

759
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,000
LET'S NOT MESS IT UP NOW.

760
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,700
OKAY.

761
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,400
I'M SORRY.

762
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,200
LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M TOO YOUNG, BUT...

763
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,900
AUSTIN AND I ARE IN LOVE.

764
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,700
YEAH, UM...

00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,500

A PILL YOU COULD TAKE

767
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,800
TO PROTECT YOUR HEART.

768
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,300
