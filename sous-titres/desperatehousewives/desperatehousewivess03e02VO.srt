WOULD BE JUST AS NICE,

A STRING QUARTET?

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,000

MAYBE PEOPLE COULD DANCE,

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,000

I MEAN, I WAS CKY
TO FIND THESE--

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,300
NOT EASY PUTTING
A WEDDING TOGETHER IN TWO WEEKS.

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,800
THEN WHY THE RUSH?

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
YEAH, BREE,
I'D HAVE THOUGHT OF YOU

I WILL THINKF A JOB FOR YOU.

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,300
SPINAL CORD.
UH-HUH.

167
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,400
AND IT, OF COURSE,
ATTACHES TO THE BRAIN.

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,500
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DUMB IT DOWN FOR US, DOCTOR.

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,300
WE'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH JANE'S CONDITION FOR YEARS.

170
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,600
OH, GOOD. UM, WELL,
THEN LET'S--LET'S GET TECHNICAL.

171
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
UH, LET'S GIVE
DR. MAYER THE NIGHT OFF.

172
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
SHE WAS IN SURGERY
FOR TEN HOURS TODAY

173
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,700
PERFORMING A CRANIOTOMY.

174
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,900
THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROCEDURE
JANE HAD. HOW'D IT GO?

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
UH, WELL, IT JUST--

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,800
WOW!

177
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,200
I HEAR MY--
MY PHONE VIBRATING.

178
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,600
UM, HELLO, UH, DR. MAYER.

179
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,000
YEAH, WHAT?

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
YOU SAY THAT
HIS BRAIN SHUT OFF?

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,300
OH, WELL,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

182
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,600
UM, STAT. I'M SORRY.
(chuckles nervously) DUTY CALLS.

183
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,900
ORSON?

184
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,500
I MOVED THE FURNITURE BACK!

185
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,300
GOOD LORD, BREE,
NOT AGAIN.

186
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,000
 <i>(jazz music playing)</i>

187
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,500
DON'T YOU WANT
OUR FIRST DANCE TO BE PERFECT?

188
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,800
THERE'LL BE 200 PEOPLE
STARING AT US.

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,100
YOU KNOW, BREE...

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,500
SINCE THAT INCIDENT
AT OUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

191
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,300
THERE'S BEEN A LOT
OF DARK TALK ABOUT ME.

192
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,500
WELL, I DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO GOSSIP.

193
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,100
I'M JUST SAYING I WOULD
UNDERSTAND IF YOU HAD

194
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,400
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT MARRYING
A MAN WHO'S UNDER A CLOUD.

195
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,400
WELL, NO ONE WHO KNOWS YOU
COULD SERIOUSLY BELIEVE

196
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,700
THAT YOU COULD HURT
A WOMAN.

197
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,500
STRANGERS MAY TALK,
BUT I KNOW THE TRUTH.

198
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
REALLY?

199
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
MEN HAVE LIED
TO ME BEFORE.

200
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,100
BELIEVE ME,
THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

201
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
SO YOU TRUST ME
COMPLETELY?

202
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,000
CLEARLY, I DO.

203
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,400
THE BODY IS UNUSUALLY
WELL-PRESERVED

204
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
BECAUSE IT WAS BURIED
IN CLAY.

205
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
DO WE HAVE
A CAUSE OF DEATH?

206
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,100
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

207
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,500
I WANT YOU TO PULL
ALL THE MISSING PERSONS REPORTS,

208
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,200
CROSS-CHECK AGAINST
HER HEIGHT, AGE AND WEIGHT.

209
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I'M ALSO RUNNING
A D.N.A. PANEL

210
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,900
SINCE WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO USE HER DENTAL RECORDS.

211
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,100
WHY NOT?

212
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,400
WHOEVER KILLED HER
PULLED OUT ALL HER TEETH.

213
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,300
NORA? WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK?
ARE YOU OKAY?

214
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,400
SHUT THE DOOR!

215
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,700
OKAY.

216
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,600
I DON'T WANT KAYLA
TO FIND ME LIKE THIS.

217
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
WHAT'S WRONG?

218
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,100
TURK AND I HAD A FIGHT.

219
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,600
WHAT? NO! NO, NO, NO!
WHAT HAPPENED?

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
WHAT HAPPENED IS,
TURK IS AN ASS!

221
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,200
ON THE WAY TO THE RIVER,
WE STOPPED OFF AT THIS BAR.

222
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,900
AND WE WERE AYING POOL,
AND I GOT A LITTLE BITCHY

223
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,800
WITH ONE OF THE WAITRESSES.
WHO CARES, RIGHT?

224
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,100
I MEAN, WHO CARES? IT'S A BAR,
AND WE ALL DO IT, RIGHT?
R-RIGHT.

225
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,200
SO HE TELLS ME
TO WATCH MY MOUTH.

226
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,700
AND I'M LIKE, WHOA!

227
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,700
GET A LOAD
OF MR. TWO STRIKES

228
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,200
TRYING TO TELL ME
HOW TO ACT IN PUBLIC.

229
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,600
AND THEN HE CALLED ME
A WHORE.

230
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
WE'RE DONE.

231
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
OKAY, WHOA! WHOA!
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
YOU DON'T BREAK UP
WITH A GUY

233
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
BECAUSE IN A WEAK MOMENT
HE CALLS YOU A WHORE.

234
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
AND THEN ON THE WAY OUT,
HE THREATENED TO HIT ME.

235
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,000
OKAY, BUT HE DIDN'T. HE DIDN'T.
AND, YOU KNOW, UNTIL--

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,100
OH, JEEZ, LYNETTE,
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?!

237
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,400
I'M ON THE SIDE OF LOVE.

238
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,100
YOU GUYS SEEM LIKE
SUCH A PERFECT COUPLE.

239
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,100
I KNOW.

240
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,400
I JUST--I-I...

241
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,100
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANNA
THROW THAT ALL AWAY

242
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,100
'CAUSE OF A <i>LITTLE</i> FIGHT
WITH NO HITTING.

243
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,900
(sniffles loudly)

244
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,300
NO. IT'S OVER.

245
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,200
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH TURK'S PAROLE OFFICER,

246
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,900
AND I WAS LIKE, "GUESS WHO AIN'T
IN NEVADA NO MORE?" CLICK.

247
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
(sobbing)

248
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,500
I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO STAY HERE TONIGHT.

249
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
(rattling in distance)

250
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,000
(door opens in distance)

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,300
(rustling in bushes)

252
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
(loud rattling)

253
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,500
(grunting)

254
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
FREEZE!

255
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,000
AUSTIN?

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
HEY, AUNT EDIE.

257
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
ANYWAY...

258
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,500
MOM JUST GOT BACK
FROM HER CRUISE TO JAMAICA

259
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,000
WITH NEW BOOBS
AND A 24-YEAR-OLD CABIN BOY.
OOH.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,800
NEEDLESS TO SAY,

261
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,000
ME AND MR. "CAN I GET YOU
SOME MORE HOT TOWELS?"--

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
WE DIDN'T EXACTLY HIT IT OFF.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,200
SO AFTER I BROKE HIS NOSE,
I, UH, FIGURED IT WAS

264
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
A GREAT TIME TO COME VISIT
MY FAVORITE AUNT.

265
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,900
YOUR MOM ALWAYS DID HAVE
LOUSY TASTE IN MEN.

266
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,100
SO, UH, I FIGURED
I'D CRASH HERE FOR THE NIGHT.

267
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,800
THEN HITCH DOWN
TO MEXICO--

268
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,700
HANG OUT, PARTY.

269
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,600
YEAH, I'M THINKING, LIKE,
NO WAY IN HELL.

270
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,700
YOU'RE GONNA
STAY HERE WITH ME

271
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
UNTIL THINGS BLOW OVER
WITH YOUR MOM, OKAY?

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,900
COOL. THANKS.

273
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,000
OH, WAIT,
YOU'RE 18, RIGHT?

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,300
WELL,
THAT'S WHAT MY I.D. SAYS.

275
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,400
YEAH, MINE, TOO.

276
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,500
HEY, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON BED REST!

277
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,900
I'M BORED.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
PUTTING ON A PAIR OF PANTS?

278
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,800
THAT SHOULD KILL
A COUPLE OF HOURS.

279
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,700
(doorbell rings)

280
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
HEY, BABE.

281
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,900
HEY, WHAT IS SHE DOING
OUT OF BED?

282
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
THAT CAN'T BE
GOOD FOR HER.

283
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
OR THE STAIRS.

284
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,900
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
THE MEDIATOR WAS RIGHT.

286
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,600
A MONTH FROM NOW WE'RE NOT JUST
GONNA BE CARLOS AND GABY.

287
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,400
WE'RE GONNA BE MOM AND DAD,
AND I DON'T WANNA BE AT WAR

288
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,200
WITH THE MOTHER OF MY CHILD,
SO, HERE.

289
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,100
YOUR MAMá'S PEARLS?

290
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,700
CARLOS...

291
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,900
THANK YOU.

292
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,400
AND?

293
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,800
AND WHAT?

294
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,900
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO MAKE
SOME RECIPROCAL GESTURE?

295
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,300
FINE. YOU CAN COME TO BREE'S
WEDDING RECEPTION AS MY GUEST.

296
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,100
THANKS. WHERE IS IT?

297
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,600
HERE.
HERE?

298
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,600
YOU'RE THROWING
THE... RECEPTION?

299
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,300
YEAH, IT'S OUR WEDDING PRESENT
TO BREE.

300
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,500
SO I GIVE YOU
A PRICELESS FAMILY HEIRLOOM,

301
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,800
AND IN RETURN, YOU INVITE ME
TO A PARTY AT MY HOUSE

302
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,000
THAT I'M PAYING FOR?

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,100
WELL, WHAT KIND OF GESTURE
DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

304
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,700
(scoffs)

305
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,400
MMM.

306
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
THINGS I'LL DO
FOR JEWELRY.

307
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,300
SUSAN, I AM <i>SO</i> SORRY.

308
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,900
 <i>DR.</i> MAYER?

309
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,300
PANIC. PURE PANIC.

310
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,300
HERE. THESE ARE FOR RUINING
OUR FIRST DATE.

311
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,700
SHH!
NOT IN FRONT OF MIKE!

312
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
OH, LOOK, MIKE,
IAN BROUGHT YOU FLOWERS.

313
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,100
I'LL JUST GO PUT THEM
IN SOME WATER.

314
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,400
LOOK, I-I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT JANE'S PARENTS.

315
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,100
OH, PLEASE.
THEY STILL HAVEN'T
ACCEPTED THE FACT

316
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,200
THAT--THAT JANE
ISN'T GOING TO WAKE UP.

317
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,700
IF THEY KNEW
THAT WE WERE ON A DATE,

318
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,100
THAT I WAS TRYING TO MOVE ON,
WELL, IT WOULD DEVASTATE THEM.

319
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,400
THAT'S A REALLY
LOVELY EXCUSE,

320
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,100
BUT IT ISN'T
THE WHOLE STORY, IS IT?
EXCUSE ME?

321
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,600
A PART OF YOU FEELS
THAT YOU'RE CHEATING ON HER.
NO!

322
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,600
WELL, PERHAPS A SMALL PART,
BUT THAT--THAT DOESN'T MEAN--

323
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,400
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
'CAUSE I FEEL GUILTY, TOO.

324
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,300
THAT--THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD
JUST STOP IS RIGHT NOW,

325
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,200
BECAUSE IT'S
ALL WAY TOO COMPLICATED,

326
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
AND I-I THINK
WE'D BOTH BE HAPPIER

327
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,100
IF WE JUST WENT BACK
TO BEING FRIENDS.

328
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,400
WELL, I-I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THAT.

329
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,700
THE--THE TRUTH IS,

330
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,000
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU
AS JUST A FRIEND

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,700
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,500
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE
LET MYSELF FEEL THAT WAY,

333
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
BUT--BUT I HAVE.

334
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,800
AND I CAN'T GO BACK.
I'M SORRY.

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,600
WELL, IF WE CAN'T
BE FRIENDS...

336
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,500
THEN I GUESS
WE'LL BE NOTHING.

337
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
 <i>(rap music playing loudly</i>
 <i>in distance)</i>

338
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
 <i>(music volume increases)</i>

339
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,300
 <i>(rap music</i>
 <i>continues playing loudly)</i>

340
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
(decreases volume)

341
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,500
HEY, LEAVE THAT ALONE.

342
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,600
SORRY, I WAS JUST...

343
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,500
TURNING IT DOWN.

344
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,900
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
A MUSIC FAN?

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,100
SURE, IT'S JUST, UM...

346
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,300
GOT ANYTHING WHERE
A PIMP ISN'T BEATING H HO?

347
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,600
(chuckles)

348
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,400
I'M AUSTIN,
EDIE BRITT'S NEPHEW.

349
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,600
OH. (chuckles)

350
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,000
I'M JULIE,
SUSAN MAYER'S DAUGHTER.

351
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,400
 <i>OH.</i>

352
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,600
ANYWAY, UM, I WAS TRYING
TO DO MY HOMEWORK, SO...

353
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,900
ON A SATURDAY?

354
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,700
WELL, MAKE SURE
AND TAKE REGULAR BREAKS

355
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,200
AND STOP
FOR A SENSIBLE DINNER.

356
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,900
JUST KEEP IT DOWN.
YOU HAD IT REALLY LOUD.

357
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,500
THAT'S H I LIKE IT.

358
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,700
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,900
YOU KNOW WHAT?

360
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,800
YOU'RE NOT THAT HOT.

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
HEY, WHATCHA DOING?

362
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
OH, I'M WORKING ON
A SEATING CHART--MWAH!

363
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,100
FOR BREE'S WEDDING.

364
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,600
NORA? WHO INVITED HER?

365
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,800
I DID. WE NEED TO FIND HER
ANOTHER BOYFRIEND,

366
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,700
AND WEDDINGS
ARE CRAWLING WITH SINGLE MEN.

367
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
HEY, I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT SEATING HER

368
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
NEXT TO ANY OF <i>MY</i> FRIENDS.
HEY, SACRIFICES
MUST BE MADE, TOM.

369
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
NO, JERRY RAWLINGS!
NOT JERRY RAWLINGS!

370
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,700
YES!
SHE GETS HER PSYCHO HOOKS
INTO JERRY RAWLINGS,

371
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,200
HE WILL NEVER
SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

372
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,500
OH, THERE ARE OTHER UROLOGISTS
IN THE WORLD.

373
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,200
GO BACK TO THAT OTHER GUY.
THE ONE
WITH THE COLD HANDS?

374
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,300
OH, IT'S ONCE A YEAR.
SUCK IT UP.
GET A GRIP, LYNETTE.

375
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,500
"GET A GRIP"?!

376
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,600
I AM HANGING ON
FOR DEAR LIFE HERE.

377
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,700
 <i>YOU</i> ARE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT
 <i>THIS</i> LITTLE PROBLEM

378
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
INTO OUR FAMILY,

379
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,500
AND THE ONLY THING
I SHOULD BE HEARING FROM YOU IS,

380
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,200
"HOW CAN I HELP?"

381
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
I AM ALSO PUTTING
STEVE HANSON AT HER TABLE,

382
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,200
SO YOU MIGHT WANT
TO START SHOPPING AROUND

383
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,300
FOR A NEW GOLF BUDDY.

384
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,500
GET A GRIP.

385
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,900
(cans rattling)

386
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,600
(chuckles)

387
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
HI.
MY NAME IS SUSAN MAYER.

388
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,400
YOUR NEIGHBOR TOLD ME
I COULD FIND YOU HERE.

389
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,800
YEAH?
WELL, I WAS

390
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,400
AT MY FRIEND
BREE'S ENGAGEMENT PARTY

391
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,200
THE OTHER NIGHT--

392
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,800
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU CAME IN
AND YOU DID THAT WHOLE

393
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,600
"ORSON KILLED HIS WIFE"
THING?

394
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU COULD ELABORATE.

395
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,200
HE KILLED HER.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?

396
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,400
WELL,
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

397
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,800
DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF?

398
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
LOOK, I CAN'T TALK NOW.
I GET OFF AT 6:00.

399
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,000
MY FRIEND IS MARRYING THAT MAN
IN TWO HOURS. PLEASE?

400
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,800
OKAY, I-I NEED, UM,
$10 IN UNROLLED PENNIES,

401
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,900
AND I NEED
TO SEE YOU COUNT IT,

402
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,600
'CAUSE LAST TIME
YOU STIFFED ME.

403
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,700
AFTER ALMA DISAPPEARED,

404
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,400
THE POLICE CAME
AND SEARCHED THE HOUSE.

405
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,900
THE POLICE?
WHAT DID THEY FIND?

406
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,100
NOTHING.

407
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,300
AND THAT'S BAD WHY?

408
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,600
DON'T YOU GET IT?
WHEN THE POLICE SHOWED UP,

409
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
ORSON HAD SCRUBBED EVERY INCH
OF THE PLACE CLEAN WITH BLEACH.

410
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
NO FINGERPRINTS,

411
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,300
NO SKIN CELLS, NO D.N.A.

412
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,500
IT WAS LIKE
ALMA HAD NEVER EXISTED.

413
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,500
WHO CLEANS
A HOUSE LIKE THAT

414
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
UNLESS HE HAS
SOMETHING TO HIDE?

415
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
SO WHEN I LEFT THE BANK,

416
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I CALLED THE DETECTIVE
THAT WORKED THE CASE,

417
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,500
AND HE SAID THAT THE ONLY REASON
ORSON WAS NEVER CHARGED

418
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,900
SO HE WAS
AN ACTUAL SUSPECT?

419
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,500
HE WAS THE <i>ONLY</i> SUSPECT.
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

420
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,000
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

421
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
THAT WAS CLOSE.

422
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,600
THE FLORIST PUT THREE MUMS
IN MY BRIDAL BOUQUET,

423
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,900
BUT NOT TO WORRY.

424
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,100
CRISIS AVERTED.

425
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
BREE... WE HAVE TO TALK.

426
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
AH, REVEREND.

427
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
ANY WORD
OM THE BRIDAL PARTY?

428
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,900
THEY'RE STILL
IN THE BRIDE'S ROOM.

429
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,600
YOU KNOW WOMEN.

430
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,500
THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THERE
FUSSING ABOUT MASCARA AND BLUSH.

431
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,800
HE DID NOT HACK HER UP
AND DISSOLVE THE PIECES IN ACID!

432
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
I SAID IT WAS A THEORY.
THE POINT IS,

433
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,100
ALMA DISAPPEARED UNDER
VERY SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.

434
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,500
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
I'M GETTING MARRIED NOW.

435
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,100
THIS IS YOUR DAY. YOU CAN PUSH
THE CEREMONY BACK AN HOUR.

436
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,400
NOW GET THAT DETECTIVE
ON THE PHONE,

437
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,900
TALK THINGS OUT WITH ORSON.

438
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,600
I CAN'T TALK TO ORSON.
IT'S BAD LUCK

439
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,700
FOR THE GROOM TO SEE
THE BRIDE BEFORE THE WEDDING.

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,400
YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY BAD LUCK?
MARRYING A WIFE-KILLER.

441
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,600
IF THE THREE OF YOU
DON'T DROP THIS RIGHNOW,

442
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,900
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

443
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,000
BREE, WE ARE JUST DOING THIS
BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU.

444
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,800
BUT...

445
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,000
IF YOU CAN
HONESTLY TELL US

446
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,700
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT...

447
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,200
NONE WHATSOEVER.

448
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,800
HMM.

449
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,800
(Mendelssohn's "Wedding March"
playing)

450
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,300
DEARLY BELOVED,
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TOGETHER

451
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,300
IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
TO JOIN THIS MAN AND WOMAN

452
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,600
IN HOLY--
EXCUSE ME?

453
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
COULD YOU GIVE US
JUST A SECOND?

454
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,900
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
I JUST NEED A MOMENT.

455
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
(guests murmuring)

456
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
BEFORE WE DO THIS,

457
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,100
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO ASK YOU.
WHAT?

458
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,500
DID YOU KILL YOUR WIFE?

459
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,700
SUSAN TALKED
TO THAT CAROLYN WOMAN.

460
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,600
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THATTHE POLIC

461
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,400
BECAUSE IT'S EMBARRASSING,
AND THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

462
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,300
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU SCRUBBED
THE HOUSE SO THOROUGHLY?

463
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,100
WHEN I'M UPSET, I CLEAN.

464
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,600
FOR GOD'S SAKE, BREE,

465
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,600
I SWEAR TO YOU
I DID NOT KILL MY WIFE.

466
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,200
OKAY.

467
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,800
PROCEED.

468
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
DEARLY BELOVED,

469
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,400
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TOGETHER
IN THE SIGHT OF GOD

470
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,400
TO JOIN THIS MAN AND WOMAN
IN HOLY MATRIMONY,

471
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
WHICH IS
AN HONORABLE ESTATE...

472
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,807
HEY!
LOOK AT YOU, MISS POPULAR!

473
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,484
SO ARE YOU HAVING
A GOOD TIME OVER THERE?

474
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,976
 <i>AS IF,</i>

475
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:49,064
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IDIOT
STUCK ME AT THAT TABLE,

476
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:51,646
BUT EVERY GUY OVER THERE
IS JUST A BORING STIFF.

477
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,018
ALL OF THEM?

478
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:55,793
WHAT ABOUT... JERRY?
JERRY'S FUN.

479
00:24:57,335 --> 00:25:00,802
YOU MEAN MR. FATTY HAIR PLUGS?
OH, YEAH, HE'S A BLAST.

480
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,187
(imitates gunshot)

481
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,168
UM, HOW ABOUT STEVE?

482
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,802
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HEAR HIS FAMILY HAS MONEY.

483
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:09,802
WELL, THEN MAYBE
THEY COULD ALL CHIP IN

484
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:11,604
AND BUY HIM
SOME DEODORANT.

485
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,457
I'M THROUGH
WITH THOSE LOSERS.

486
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:14,655
I'M GONNA STAY
RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

487
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:17,445
ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

488
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:23,562
(gasps) HEY, LOOK AT YOU!

489
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:25,550
(sighs)
GOD, I HATE WEARING A TUX.

490
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,741
ON MY WAY IN, BREE'S AUNT FERN
ASKED ME TO PARK THE CAR.

491
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,936
SHE'S GOT GLAUCOMA.

492
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:31,783
TO HER, YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A HISPANIC BLUR.
(chuckles)

493
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:33,886
LET ME FIX YOUR TIE.

494
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:37,695
HEY, YOU'RE WEARING
MAM?S PEARLS.

495
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,085
YEAH.

496
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:45,136
OH!

497
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:47,813
HEY, JULIE!

498
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,213
HAVE YOU MET
MY NEPHEW AUSTIN?

499
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:51,154
YEAH, WE'VE MET.

500
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:53,112
I JUST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM
WITH HIS SHIRT ON.

501
00:25:57,835 --> 00:25:59,701
SHE COULDN'T
TAKE HER EYES OFF MY ABS.

502
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:01,062
I FELT VIOLATED.

503
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,996
HI, EDIE.
NICE PARTY, HUH?

504
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:09,294
IT WAS.

505
00:26:13,382 --> 00:26:14,485
PERFECT.

506
00:26:14,882 --> 00:26:17,346
WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU TWO
GETTING ALONG AGAIN.

507
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,488
WE'VE SORT OF
TURNED A CORNER.
REALLY?

508
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:21,384
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE GONNA
BE GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

509
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:22,762
MAYBE.
GOD, NO!

510
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,309
WOW, IS THAT SHRIMP?

511
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:29,768
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK

512
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,826
I WOULD EVEN CONSIDER
TAKING YOU BACK?

513
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,962
WELL, YOU INVITED ME
TO BE YOUR DATE.

514
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:37,738
"GUEST," CARLOS.
I SAID "GUEST."
COME ON, YOU'VE BEEN FLIRTING
WITH ME SINCE I CAME IN--

515
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:39,170
"HERE, BABY,
LET ME FIX YOUR TIE."

516
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,619
I MEAN, FOR A WOMAN
WHO'S NOT INTERESTED,

517
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,155
YOU SURE ARE SENDING
SOME MIXED SIGNALS.

518
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:44,197
YOU WANT A CLEAR SIGNAL?HOW'S

519
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:49,001
(band playing jazz music)

520
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:50,250
IAN!
SUSAN!

521
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:51,955
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

522
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:55,367
WELL, MY--MY COUSIN IS--IS
DR. HODGES' DENTAL HYGIENIST,

523
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:57,367
AND HER HUSBAND--
HE--HE COULDN'T JOIN US

524
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:59,567
SINCE HE'D COME DOWN
WITH A SPOT OF IMPETIGO,

525
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:00,611
SO SHE CALLED ME,

526
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:02,995
KNOWING HOW MUCH I LOVE
A GOOD GARTER TOSS, AND SO--

527
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:03,880
IAN.

528
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:07,676
YES, I-I'M SUCH
A TERRIBLE LIAR.

529
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,907
I MEAN, IMPETIGO--
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

530
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:11,761
HMM.

531
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:13,661
SO WHAT ARE YOU REALLY
DOING HERE?

532
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,545
(sighs) LOOK...

533
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:20,532
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT US,

534
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:22,677
ABOUT HOW GREAT
WE COULD BE TOGETHER,

535
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:24,557
AND I THINK
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

536
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:26,933
IAN--
SUSAN, PLEASE DON'T GO.

537
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,894
CAN'T WE AT LEAST
TALK ABOUT THIS?

538
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:32,278
I CAN'T, 'CAUSE I HAVE...
BRIDESMAID STUFF.

539
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:37,941
HI THERE.

540
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:40,355
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB...

541
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:41,864
TAD. (chuckles)

542
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:45,160
THAT'S, UM, THAT'S SUCH
A MASCULINE NAME.

543
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,922
MY BOYFRIEND
SEEMS TO LIKE IT.

544
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:49,984
OKAY, HERE'S THE DRILL.

545
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,782
MY EX IS HERE,
AND I WANNA PISS HIM OFF,

546
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:53,128
SO JUST ACT LIKE
YOU'RE ALL HOT FOR ME,

547
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:55,574
AND THERE'S A 100 BUCK TIP
IN IT FOR YOU.
RIGHT.

548
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:59,401
UH, SO SHOULD I...
CUP YOUR BOOB?
NO, I'LL DRIVE.

549
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:04,734
(laughing loudly)

550
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:05,968
OH!

551
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,000
TEQUILA, STRAIGHT.

552
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,615
HEY, ARE THERE ANY DECENT
SINGLE WOMEN ATHIS WEDDING?

553
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:19,625
NOT THAT I'VE SEEN.

554
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,492
AH, DAMN IT. NOT A ONE.

555
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:26,521
HEY, CARLOS.

556
00:28:26,634 --> 00:28:28,488
YOU SHOULD COME OVER
TO OUR TABLE.

557
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:30,267
THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE HOTTIES ARE.

558
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:31,383
HEY, EVERYONE!

559
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:34,434
I'D SAY IT IS TIME THAT
WE GET BREE AND ORSON UP HERE

560
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:36,585
FOR THEIR FIRST DANCE
AS A MARRIED COUPLE.

561
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:37,467
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

562
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:41,697
I GIVE YOU
MR. AND MRS. ORSON HODGE!

563
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,324
ORSON,
YOU LOOK SO SERIOUS.

564
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,021
I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER
MY STEPS.

565
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:13,206
YOU'RE UPSET, AREN'T YOU?

566
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:15,588
YOU'RE STILL THINKING ABOUT
WHAT I SAID AT THE CHURCH.

567
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,489
WHICH PART, DARLING--

568
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:18,409
THE "I DO" PART,

569
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:20,073
OR THE "DID YOU
KILL YOUR WIFE?" PART?

570
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,303
I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAD TO ASK.

571
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:26,284
THAT'S MY POINT.

572
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:28,305
YOU HAD TO ASK.

573
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:34,524
(up-tempo jazz music playing)

574
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:36,924
(squealing)

575
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:39,491
YOU ARE GONNA
ROT IN HELL FOR THIS.

576
00:29:40,023 --> 00:29:42,445
HEY, I JUST BROUGHT
TWO LOST SOULS TOGETHER.

577
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,337
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?
HE CHEATED ON MY FRIEND.

578
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,857
HE DESERVES EVERY BIT OF...
(singsong voice) CRAZY

579
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:53,742
SHE'S GONNA
RAIN DOWN ON HIM.

580
00:29:56,877 --> 00:30:00,232
HELL... ROT... YOU.

581
00:30:02,243 --> 00:30:05,243
(slow jazz music playing)

582
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:11,656
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

583
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,146
ROUNDING SECOND
AND HEADING FOR THIRD.

584
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:19,195
UH-OH.

585
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:23,642
CARLOS!

586
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:25,955
OH, HEY, GABY.
LOOK, I MADE A NEW FRIEND.

587
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:28,134
YES, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
MAKE YOUR NEW FRIEND,

588
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:31,043
AND IT'S DISGUSTING!
DO YOU MIND?
WE'RE TRYING TO DANCE HERE.

589
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:32,949
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU,
ANYWAY,

590
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:35,019
AND WHY THE HELL
ARE YOU AT THIS WEDDING?!

591
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:38,161
THIS IS NOT
GONNA END WELL.

592
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:41,354
THEY'RE JUST TWO RANDOM PEOPLE
WHO MET AT A WEDDING.

593
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:43,253
CAN'T PIN IT ON .

594
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,286
IT WAS <i>HER!</i>

595
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:49,139
LYNETTE SCAVO,
I WANNA TALK TO YOU!

596
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,223
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

597
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:55,043
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

598
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:56,190
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU HERE

599
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,049
TO EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.

600
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,836
OH, NO, YOU JUST
WANTED ME TO WATCH

601
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:02,434
WHILE YOU SUCKED THE ZITS
OFF SOME TEENAGE WAITER!

602
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:04,917
THAT'S IT.
I TAKE MY INVITATION BACK.

603
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,851
YOU ARE NO LONGER WELCOME
IN MY HOUSE.

604
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:10,027
FINE, I'LL GO!
JUST GIVE ME BACK THE PEARLS.

605
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,717
NO!
GABY.

606
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,802
CARLOS, NO!
THEY WERE MY MAM?S!

607
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:14,367
NO! (gasps)

608
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,346
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

609
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,423
MRS. SOLIS!

610
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:23,316
NO, CARLOS!
HEY, GIVE ME THAT!

611
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,440
GIVE ME THOSE!
PARDON ME. EXCUSE ME.

612
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:27,714
GET AWAY! THOSE ARE MINE!
NO, THE HELL THEY ARE!

613
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:28,940
MRS. SOLIS?

614
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,034
NOT NOW, XIAO-MEI!
MRS. SOLIS!

615
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:32,597
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, WHAT?!

616
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,833
(liquid splashes)

617
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:36,933
(guests gasp)

618
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,399
(woman) ARE YOU KIDDING?

619
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,869
I THINK MAYBE IT'S TIME.

620
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,300
AND I WISH YOU BOTH
A LIFETIME OF HAPPINESS.

621
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:53,100
(rim shot, applause)

622
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:54,576
WOW.

623
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,540
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, AUNT FERN.
THANK YOU.

624
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,576
HEY, THEY MOPPED UP
ALL THE AMNIOTIC FLUID,

625
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:04,178
SO WE SHOULD FEEL SAFE
 START THE CONGA LINE!

626
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:06,385
(piano starts playing)
ACTUALLY, I'D--I'D LIKE
TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

627
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:09,477
(piano stops playing)

628
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:13,361
BREE, ORSON,

629
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:16,599
YOUR LOVE
IS AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL.

630
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,216
THAT'S VERY SWEET.
HMM.

631
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:21,115
HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

632
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,886
I THOUGHT
HE WAS ON YOUR SIDE.
MNH-MNH.

633
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,043
WELL, I KNOW
THIS IS A SECOND WEDDING

634
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,227
FOR BOTH OF YOU,
AND I THINK YOU'RE JOLLY BRAVE.

635
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:31,472
SO OFTEN, PEOPLE FIND EXCUSES
NOT TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN.

636
00:32:31,522 --> 00:32:32,741
THEY'RE--THEY'RE AFRAID.

637
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:36,566
BUT IT'S RARE TO FIND SOMEBODY
THAT YOU CONNECT WITH,

638
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:38,631
SO WHEN YOU DO,
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

639
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:41,198
BREE, ORSON,

640
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:43,507
I SALUTE YOU.

641
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:47,566
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THE MUSIC CRANKING AND THE--

642
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,739
WAIT, ACTUALLY, TOM,
COULD YOU JUST HANG ON A SECOND?

643
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:52,540
UH, I-I ALSO WOULD LIKE
TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

644
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:55,720
TO BREE AND ORSON, UH, YES,

645
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,572
WHAT COULD BE BETTER
THAN A SECOND LOVE?

646
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:01,538
AND THIS TIME YOU ENTER INTO IT
A LITTLE OLDER, LITTLE WISER,

647
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:02,337
BUT ALSO--

648
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:04,357
AND THIS IS KEY--UH...

649
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:06,167
WITH A BIT OF CAUTION.

650
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:08,989
BECAUSE...

651
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:12,750
WHILE LOVE CAN BE SPONTANEOUS
AND WONDERFUL,

652
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:16,182
IT CAN ALSO BE SELFISH.

653
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:17,622
AND SOMETIMES

654
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:20,673
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO
IS JUST TO WALK AWAY.

655
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:27,958
UH... I--NOT YOU TWO.

656
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,075
I MEAN, YOU TWO CRAZKIDS
ARE GREAT. (laughs)

657
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,034
CONGRATS, YEAH.

658
00:33:33,022 --> 00:33:34,113
WELL, THEN, LET'S--

659
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,053
HANG ON. I'D LIKE
TO RESPOND TO THAT TOAST.

660
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,146
BREE, ORSON,

661
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,346
SOMETIMES WALKING AWAY
 <i>CAN</i> SEEM THE BEST CHOICE.

662
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,280
IT'S--IT'S CERTAINLY
THE SAFEST.

663
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,380
BUT... BUT WHAT DO YOU DO

664
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:47,880
WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE
WHO MAKES YOU FEEL JOY

665
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:51,513
WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU NEVER WOULD AGAIN?

666
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,847
DO YOU--
DO YOU JUST LET THEM GO?

667
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:58,747
NO.

668
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,847
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

669
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:14,480
(microphone feedback squeaks)
YOU--YOU WANNA...

670
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:18,013
NO.

671
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,680
I'M GO.

672
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:22,480
ALL RIGHT THEN, LET'S DANCE!

673
00:34:22,513 --> 00:34:24,780
**

674
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:38,948
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
NEED A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

675
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,418
YOU'RE STILL
MAD AT ME, HUH?

676
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,773
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
SETTING CARLOS UP WITH SKANK?!

677
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:48,820
I'M SORRY.
I WAS DESPERATE.

678
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:51,027
I HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH
TO DRINK.

679
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:53,527
AND YOU
 <i>ARE</i> DIVORCING CARLOS...

680
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,627
NO, LYNETTE,
CARLOS WL NEVER BE FAIR GAME.

681
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,590
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

682
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,268
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU ARE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

683
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:00,425
I'M SO SORRY.

684
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:03,575
IT'S JUST...

685
00:35:06,244 --> 00:35:06,979
WHAT?

686
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:10,680
I'M SO UNHAPPY.

687
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:14,564
EVER SINCE THAT WOMAN
PUSHED HER WAY INTO OUR LIVES,

688
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:16,882
I-I CAN'T EVEN
WO UP A SMILE.

689
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:19,373
AND THE MORE SHE PUSHES,
THE MORE I RESENT TOM--

690
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:22,590
TOM, FOR SOMETHING HE DID
12 YEARS AGO.

691
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,508
AND I'M AFRAID
IF I CAN'T FIX...

692
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,590
THIS, THAT...

693
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,722
THE ANGER IS JUST GONNA
FESTER UNTIL...

694
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:31,010
LYNETTE, LISTEN TO ME--

695
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,404
YOU AND TOM
WILL SURVIVE THIS.

696
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:36,155
NO, SERIOUSLY, GABY,

697
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:39,167
I AM <i>SO</i> TIRED
OF PRETENDING TO SMILE.

698
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,254
YOU AND TOM...

699
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:42,749
WILL SURVIVE THIS.

700
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:44,113
YEAH?

701
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,316
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

702
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,207
BECAUSE SOME MARRIAGES
WERE BUILT TO LAST...

703
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,839
AND SOME AREN'T.

704
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,151
TRUST ME,
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

705
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:05,735
(applause)

706
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,635
(both chuckle)

707
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,200
I'M LOOKING
FOR BREE VAN DE KAMP.

708
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,545
RIGHT OVER THERE.

709
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:14,416
COULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR JUST A MINUTE?

710
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:14,831
MM-HMM.

711
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:20,850
ORSON, CONGRATULATIONS.

712
00:36:20,884 --> 00:36:23,765
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU MRS. VAN DE KAMP?

713
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:25,464
IT'S HODGE NOW.

714
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,471
YES, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
TO BARGE IN LIKE THIS,

715
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:30,789
BUT WE NEED YOUR HUSBAND
TO COME DOWN TO THE MORGUE.

716
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:33,438
WE MAY HAVE FOUND
HIS WIFE'S BODY.

717
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,238
(grunting)

718
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,531
PUSH, XIAO-MEI. PUSH.

719
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,737
(groaning)

720
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:50,630
OKAY, OKAY.

721
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,206
DEEP BREATHS NOW.
YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE.

722
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:55,277
IT'S TIME! I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING!

723
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:57,027
I THINK I'M GONNA CRY.

724
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,809
CARLOS,
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THE--

725
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:03,491
YEAH, I--ME, TOO. ME, TOO.
I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

726
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:06,683
I FORGIVE YOU. IT'S WORTH IT
WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE

727
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,452
A MOMENT
AS BEAUTIFUL AS THIS.

728
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:11,449
(grunting)

729
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:12,056
OKAY,
I CAN SEE THE HEAD NOW.

730
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:13,971
OH, GET THE CAMERA!
GET THE CAMERA!

731
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:18,736
(grunting)

732
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,079
OH!

733
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:21,834
(Gaby) OH, MY GOD!

734
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,869
(baby crying)

735
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:35,704
OH, MAN,

736
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,297
I GOTTA GET THE COLOR FIXED
ON THIS THING.

737
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:47,970
HOW COULD THIS
HA HAPPENED?

738
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,369
WHAT KIND OF HALF-ASS FERTILITY
CLINIC ARE YOU RUNNING?

739
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,748
UH, PRIOR TO IMPLANTATION,

740
00:37:50,798 --> 00:37:53,699
OUR EMBRYO WAS ACCIDENTALLY
SWITCHED WITH ANOTHER CLIENT'S.

741
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,809
SO IF WE GOT THEIRS
AND THEY GOT OURS,

742
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:57,922
THEN--THEN IT'S POSSIBLE...

743
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:00,103
NO, I'M AFRAID
YOUR EMBRYO DIDN'T TAKE.

744
00:38:00,122 --> 00:38:03,041
AGAIN, ON BEHALF OF THE CLINIC,
I AM SO SORRY.

745
00:38:03,505 --> 00:38:06,166
IT'S RARE,
BUT THESE THINGS DO HAPPEN.
EXCUSE ME.

746
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,685
YOU SCREW UP OUR LIVES,
AND THE BEST YOU CAN DO IS,

747
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,536
"THAT'S THE WAY
THE COOKIE CRUMBLES"?!

748
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:11,712
AND WHO IS THIS GUY?

749
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,987
WHY IS HE WRITING DOWN
EVERYTHING I SAY?
THIS IS MR. DARBY,
OUR ATTORNEY.

750
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:16,594
WE THOUGHT IT WISE
TO HAVE HIM PRESENT.

751
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,528
DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WOULD'VE BEEN WISE?

752
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:21,287
STICKING THE RIGHT BABY
IN THE RIGHT BELLY!

753
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:23,090
MRS. SOLIS, PLEASE.

754
00:38:50,071 --> 00:38:51,223
THAT'S NOT ALMA.

755
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:56,103
ARE YOU SURE?

756
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:56,963
ABSOLUTELY.

757
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,503
THANK GOD.

758
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,039
CAROLYN.
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

759
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,829
YOU DIDN'T HONESTLY THINK

760
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:10,443
THEY'D TAKE YOUR WORD
FOR IT, DID YOU?

761
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:18,269
IT'S NOT HER.

762
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:24,194
WELL, THAT'S IT THEN.
SORRY FOR WASTING YOUR TIME.

763
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:25,706
THIS MEANS NOTHING.

764
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,580
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT MAN IS AS GUILTY  SIN!

765
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,731
WE KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.

766
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:32,095
NOW WOULD YOU PLEASE
LEAVE US ALONE?

767
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,426
HE'S A COLD-BLOODED KILLER.

768
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:37,655
HE'S KIND AND DECENT,
AND NOTHING YOU COULD SAY

769
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:39,130
WILL EVER MAKE ME
DOUBT HIM AGAIN.

770
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,058
NOW PLEASE GO.

771
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:48,730
YOU DESERVE HIM.

772
00:39:55,264 --> 00:39:58,230
DARLING, I AM SO SORRY
YOU HAD TO ENDURE THAT.

773
00:39:58,264 --> 00:39:59,494
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

774
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:02,011
I'M FINE. LET'S JUST GO BACK
TO OUR GUESTS

775
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:05,124
AND FORGET ANY OF THIS
EVER HAPPENED.
ALL RIGHT.

776
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:15,277
 <i>TU ME MANQUES,</i> MONIQUE.

777
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:31,722
WELL...

778
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:32,355
YEAH.

779
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:36,421
