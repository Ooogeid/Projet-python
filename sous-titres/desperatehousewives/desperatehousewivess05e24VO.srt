00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,413
<i>The first thing Lila Dash thought about
that fateful morning</i>

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,422
<i>was her husband Dave.</i>

3
00:00:14,654 --> 00:00:18,129
<i>It occurred
to her she should buy him a new tie.</i>

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,684
<i>She thought of her husband
again that afternoon...</i>

5
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,922
<i>And decided she would make
him something special for dinner.</i>

6
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:36,501
<i>That evening, Lila once
again thought about her husband...</i>

7
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:41,246
<i>And she asked herself what she had done
to deserve someone</i>

8
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:44,080
<i>so wonderful.</i>

9
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:48,744
Hey, you.

10
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,462
What are you thinking about?

11
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:52,847
Nothin'.

12
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:57,913
What do you say we
all go out for ice cream?

13
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,710
I'd love to,
but I brought work home.

14
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:04,145
- Again?
- I know. I'm so boring.

15
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:06,793
Why don't you two go?

16
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,992
- We'll all go tomorrow.
- How can you make this face

17
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:13,141
wait a whole day for ice cream?

18
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,851
Look sad.

19
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:20,530
Fine.
I'll take her now.

20
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:23,646
Come on, sweetie.

21
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:30,864
How about tomorrow night,
I'll leave my briefcase at the office,

22
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:34,529
and we do something special,
just the three of us?

23
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,921
It's a date.

24
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,201
<i>But there would be no tomorrows</i>

25
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:51,610
<i>for Lila and Paige Dash...</i>

26
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:56,069
<i>Because that was
the night they crashed</i>

27
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:59,239
<i>into Susan and Mike Delfino.</i>

28
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:13,668
<i>The last thing Lila Dash
thought about before she died</i>

29
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,025
<i>was her husband Dave.</i>

30
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:20,310
<i>She wondered what
her death would do to him.</i>

31
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,748
<i>Luckily for Lila,</i>

32
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:33,314
<i>she would never know.</i>

35
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,198
<i>There was a wedding recently</i>

36
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,969
<i>at Fairview presbyterian church.</i>

37
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:55,599
<i>The minister spoke about
the nature of marriage</i>

38
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:58,801
<i>and then said what all ministers say</i>

39
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,134
<i>to conclude such matters.</i>

40
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:03,806
You may now kiss the bride.

41
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:10,953
<i>It was then the church
bells began to ring,</i>

42
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,709
<i>telling brides-to-be everywhere</i>

43
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,231
<i>their turn was next.</i>

44
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:21,397
Hello, groom.

45
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:24,949
Guess what? I called the hotel
to tell them we were getting married.

46
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,520
They promised to upgrade us to a suite
and have champagne on ice.

47
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,613
- Isn't that terrific?
- Yeah, that's great.

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,193
I hope you can muster up a
little more enthusiasm for the "I dos."

49
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:38,873
I'm sorry.
I'm just thinking about Susan and M.J.

50
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:41,299
Why?

51
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,915
When they left,
I just got a weird vibe from Dave.

52
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:48,516
Dave always gives off a weird vibe.
That's just Dave.

53
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,580
No, I think I should call them.

54
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,862
Or maybe you should get our bags
in the car so we don't miss our flight?

55
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:57,253
Because if we miss our flight,
we're going to miss our wedding day,

56
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,438
and if we miss our wedding day,

57
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,312
we're gonna miss our wedding night.

58
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,467
Yeah, you're right.

59
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:10,441
I'm probably worried about nothing.
I'll load the car.

60
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:13,413
We need to stop at the store.
I have to get videotape for the camera.

61
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,239
I got some old ones in the desk.
Just grab one. We'll record over it.

62
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:29,497
She's two blocks away.
She'll be here any second.

63
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,738
Great.

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,620
Are you nervous?

65
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,329
Why would I be nervous?

66
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:38,090
You're about to have
a teenager in the house.

67
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,316
I didn't say I wasn't sedated.

68
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:43,315
I'm a little freaked out, too.
But we're doing the right thing.

69
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:48,328
When I think about everything
that little girl's been through...

70
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:51,720
Her dad walked out, her mother's
in jail, the way she bounced

71
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,466
from relative to relative, I just want
this to be the end of the line for her.

72
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:56,806
Me, too.

73
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:01,045
Mommy, here comes the taxi!

74
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:04,251
- I wonder if she'll even remember me.
- I doubt it.

75
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,057
You haven't seen
her since she was 6.

76
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:09,537
Yeah, and I used to spend a lot of time
with her and her dad before he left.

77
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:14,322
I remember taking her
on the swings at the park.

78
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,655
I remember buying her ice cream.

79
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,600
I remember giving
her piggyback rides.

80
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,150
I don't remember that.

81
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:38,548
- You told him about the divorce?
- I had to. He found the storage unit.

82
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,854
He wanted an explanation.
I was in such a state of shock,

83
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:44,347
I couldn't think
of anything else to say.

84
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:47,515
- Bree, this isn't good.
- You have no idea.

85
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:50,576
Now he's saying if I try to divorce him,
he can go to the police

86
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:53,598
- and report me.
- Report you? For what?

87
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:56,253
Filing a false insurance claim.

88
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,241
He's the one who filed it,
but he's gonna say that I told him to.

89
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:01,238
Crap.

90
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,499
I told him I don't love him.
He said he doesn't care.

91
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,413
He wants us to work on our marriage.

92
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,877
Clearly, the guy's a little crazy.

93
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:11,846
A little? The man put
chives in my parisian salad!

94
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:13,742
He should be in a straightjacket!

95
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:17,936
Calm down.
This isn't the end of the world.

96
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:21,601
Isn't it? I'm being blackmailed
by a man I'm starting to despise,

97
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:25,324
and if I don't pretend to love him,
he can have me arrested.

98
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:34,138
I don't want you to worry about this.
We're gonna think of something.

99
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,851
What can we think of?
He's holding all the cards.

100
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,838
Trust me.
None ever holds all the cards.

101
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,597
<i>Lynette, get down here!</i>

102
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,037
- What's going on?
- It was the university.

103
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:13,614
- I'm in!
- Really?! You passed the test?!

104
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:16,702
Not only did I pass the test,
your genius husband

105
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:20,298
scored in the top 5%,
Drunk out of his mind!

106
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,939
Which, by the way,
I am not condoning, ever.

107
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:28,505
- Congrats, dad!
- Thank you, baby.

108
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,463
I can help you study if you want.

109
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:34,282
I'm not sure how much help you're
gonna be. I'm majoring in Chinese.

110
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:36,670
I know how to say "take
me to a strip bar" in mandarin.

111
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:40,347
I'm so proud.

112
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:42,788
Porter, aren't you gonna
congratulate your father?

113
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,107
Congratulations on ruining my life.

114
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:49,493
If you see me on campus,
you're not allowed to talk to me.

115
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:52,251
Okay, that's everyone.

116
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:56,056
This calls for hot fudge sundaes.

117
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,511
Everybody, in the car!

118
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:02,779
- You coming?
- I'm gonna make a quick phone call,

119
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,722
and I'll be right out.

120
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,436
Hi. This is Lynette Scavo.
May I please speak to Dr. Rushton?

121
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:17,617
Tell him it's important.

122
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:24,779
Dr. Rushton, I need to come
in and see you as soon as possible.

123
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:28,306
I think the cancer's back.

124
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,100
Mommy, can I have a juice box?

125
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,898
Sweetie. You just had one,

126
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:43,048
and we don't want to have to stop ten
times so you can go to the bathroom.

127
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,773
I miss diapers.

128
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:49,800
The joys of being a parent.

129
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:51,486
I remember.

130
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,285
You do?

131
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,454
I had a little girl.

132
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,991
She died.

133
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,119
Oh, my god...

134
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:04,820
I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

135
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:06,898
That's okay.

136
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:09,845
I'm learning to deal with it.

137
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:17,589
- I can't believe Edie gave you a key.
- Why not? She trusted me.

138
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,541
And I only used it when
I was out of milk or bread,

139
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:21,678
or cash.

140
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:26,306
Look for anything
that could tie Dave to Dr. Heller.

141
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:29,983
Look through his files,
his papers, even his trash.

142
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,077
Roberta, what are you doing?
We're trying to catch a murderer.

143
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:39,865
Before I get to the bottom of that,
I'd like to get to the bottom of this.

144
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:41,929
Look!

145
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:47,509
- Muscle relaxers, score!
- Put that back! They're not yours.

146
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,867
Apparently, they're not his either.
Who's David Dash?

147
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:55,870
- <i>Mr. Williams? It's the police.</i>
- Cheese it!

148
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,841
<i>We need to ask you a few questions.</i>

149
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:01,309
Please tell me
you don't have anything illegal on you.

150
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:05,362
I do, but it's hidden.
And if they find it, we got a lawsuit.

151
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:09,298
<i>Ladies?</i>

152
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,366
Open up, please.

153
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:23,835
Hi there.

154
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:27,975
- Can I help you?
- I hope so. Are you Orson Hodge?

155
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,718
Yes, I am. You are...

156
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:34,503
You want me to let go?

157
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:37,497
You want me to let go?

158
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,060
There, I let go.

159
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:49,270
- You gotta do the same.
- I don't know what you mean.

160
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,704
I think you do,

161
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,966
and I am dead serious.
If you don't let go...

162
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:56,359
Next time, neither will I.

163
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:08,208
Brought you a laundry basket. You need
me to show you how to use the washer?

164
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:13,583
It's my clever way of saying
you're gonna be doing your own laundry.

165
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,952
The girls have chores, too.
It's how we teach them responsibility.

166
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:24,747
Speaking of which,

167
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:27,859
curfew's 10:00, 11:00 on weekends.

168
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,842
Does that seem reasonable?

169
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:31,668
Sure. No problem.

170
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:36,051
This teenager thing isn't so bad.

171
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,435
What are my other chores?

172
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:42,633
Not to push my luck, But I was
thinking you could sweep the front porch

173
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,453
and take care of the guest bathroom.

174
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:46,946
You got it.

175
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,335
That's a pretty dress.

176
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:54,942
It's Versace!

177
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,300
It's all right.

178
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:01,304
"All right"?
Young lady, if you live under my roof,

179
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:03,330
you will not disparage Versace.

180
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:07,497
- Sorry.
- No, I'm just kidding. It was a joke.

181
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:10,330
Funny.

182
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:13,978
I guess I'm gonna get
started on my laundry.

183
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:16,204
Vera Wang!

184
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:20,430
- Where are you getting all these dresses?
- They were gifts.

185
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:22,629
From boyfriends.

186
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,277
Boyfriends? How many do you have?

187
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:28,369
Not as many as I used to.
I had to make some cutbacks.

188
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,798
The economy has hit us all.

189
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:33,808
So...

190
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:37,560
What kind of boyfriends
can afford things like this?

191
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:41,547
They're college guys with rich
parents who can pay for everything.

192
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,202
And, they give you designer clothes,

193
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:47,011
and you give them...

194
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,156
The pleasure of my company.

195
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:54,926
Don't take this the wrong way,
but that's not exactly

196
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:56,648
from the Versace virgin line.

197
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,067
I don't have to do anything.
They just have to think I might.

198
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,605
And how long do you
think that will last?

199
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:07,990
Till 10:00, 11:00 on the weekends.

200
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,352
Just kidding. It was a joke.

201
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,446
Funny.

202
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,665
Are you all right?

203
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:35,075
What happened to your shirt?

204
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:38,055
Why don't you ask your friend?

205
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,292
The one you hired to assault me.

206
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:42,895
You were assaulted?

207
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:45,903
He grabbed me by the throat,

208
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:48,727
threw me to the ground
and told me to "let go."

209
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,304
Your message came
through loud and clear.

210
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,039
I had nothing to do with that.

211
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:57,438
Please.

212
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,373
Who else would have done it?

213
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:04,697
I don't know.

214
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:07,141
But I swear to you,
we may have our differences,

215
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,267
but I would never hire
someone to attack you.

216
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:14,366
You have to believe me.

217
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:18,917
I do.

218
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:22,816
Forgive me.

219
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:25,157
I should've known
you could never hurt me.

220
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,032
I'll stay.

221
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:31,727
What?

222
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:35,188
Once I've unpacked, I'll bring
you my shirt so you can mend it.

223
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,900
We're running to the store.
We'll be back in a bit.

224
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,852
- I'll sweep the porch.
- And if you don't mind,

225
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:55,320
will you make sure
Juanita and Celia do their chores, too?

226
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,536
Sure thing.

227
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,199
- I got the rest, Babe.
- All right, I'll see you inside.

228
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,205
You're back.

229
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,037
Oh, my god.

230
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,735
Ana, the house is so clean.

231
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,695
Just wanted to do my part.

232
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:29,223
How did you get everything
done so quickly?

233
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,515
We finished upstairs, Ana.
Anything else you need done?

234
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:42,154
They wanted to hang out,
but I had chores to do,

235
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,372
so they insisted on helping me.

236
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:46,111
Aren't they sweet?

237
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,868
I'm not bragging and
I don't recommend it,

238
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,157
but you could so eat
out of your downstairs toilet.

239
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:58,191
Okay, boys,
thanks for your hard work,

240
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:01,887
but maybe it's time to go home and
take a shower... Preferably a cold one.

241
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,561
- I'm Porter.
- I'm Preston.

242
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:10,466
- You can call me whatever you want.
- All right.

243
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:15,009
Mommy, it was so cool.

244
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,459
Ana got the boys
to do my chores, too.

245
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,099
Did she?

246
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:24,018
I wanna learn how to make boys do stuff.
Can you teach me?

247
00:16:24,343 --> 00:16:27,598
Juanita, go to your room.
And don't come out until you're 18.

248
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,680
Is something wrong?

249
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:34,108
The whole point of
chores is that you do them.

250
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:36,768
You don't bat your eyes
and call rent-a-horny-kid.

251
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:40,273
The house is clean.
Why do you care how it got that way?

252
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,934
I care about the message
it sends to my little girls,

253
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,417
and I'm starting to care
a little bit about your tone.

254
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,157
I'm sorry. How do you like
your housekeepers to speak to you?

255
00:16:52,314 --> 00:16:54,717
And the teenager
has finally arrived.

256
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:58,450
Ana, listen.
We want you to be part of this family.

257
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,634
We will love you and support
you and take care of you,

258
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:05,849
but in exchange, you will show us a little
bit of respect and obey our rules,

259
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:07,911
which means doing your own chores,

260
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:11,129
no boys in the house
and no more gifts from men.

261
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,249
I get it now.

262
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,049
You're jealous.

263
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,362
- Of what?
- Of me.

264
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:27,011
You're not young anymore.
You can't get guys to do things for you,

265
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,631
and that drives you crazy.

266
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,563
You wanna see crazy?

267
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:35,481
Make one more statement like that,

268
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:39,307
and I am throwing your ass
out on the street. You care to test me?

269
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,579
- What's wrong?
- I don't know what I did.

270
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,762
She wants to kick me out.

271
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,585
She had a couple boys
come over and do her chores.

272
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,230
- You've been doing the same.
- That's not the point!

273
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,295
- You didn't hear how she talked to me!
- I don't care!

274
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,964
You don't tell a kid who's
been bounced around her whole life

275
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:23,104
- that you're gonna throw her out!
- I didn't tell her that!

276
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:25,797
I just kind of threatened to.

277
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:30,424
Bottom line, she is my niece,
and she is not going anywhere.

278
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:33,341
You're the adult, Gaby.
Start acting like it.

279
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,057
I know this looks bad, but
we did what we did for a good reason.

280
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:52,494
Ma'am, you can't break into
a person's house for any reason.

281
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:55,366
What if there's a baby
inside and there's a fire?

282
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:59,798
Everything's not all cut and dry,
is it, rookie?

283
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,579
Roberta, don't piss him off. You can't
take a club to the head like you used to.

284
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,859
I just got off the phone
with Heller's secretary.

285
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,966
David Dash was definitely
a patient there.

286
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:15,049
That's why we couldn't make the match.
He changed his last name.

287
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:17,997
And get this. He's the same
guy whose wife and daughter were killed

288
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,452
in that car crash
up on Canterbury road.

289
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:21,914
Canterbury road!

290
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:23,501
I remember that accident.

291
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,948
My neighbors Mike and Susan
were in the car that hit 'em.

292
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:30,918
Wait. That's weird.
Why would Dave move onto the same street

293
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,193
as the people who killed his family?

294
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,393
The doctor has your results.
He'll be here in a minute.

295
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:46,501
Do you know what they are?

296
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:50,630
You'll need to talk
to the doctor about that.

297
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,563
Come on. I know you know.
It's cancer again. Am I right?

298
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:58,447
I honestly don't know.
Now please, he'll just be a moment.

299
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:03,614
If it's cancer, and I find out you knew,
I won't be dying alone.

300
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,126
Hello, Lynette.

301
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:13,828
I'm glad you came in.
We got the results back,

302
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:16,126
and the test did pick something up.

303
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:20,788
So it is the cancer.
God, I can't go through this again!

304
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:23,021
Nothing like that.

305
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:25,416
You're pregnant.

306
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:31,191
- Excuse me?
- About six weeks or so.

307
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:36,558
Are you sure it's not cancer?

308
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,459
Okay, Susan. But when you're out on the
boat, make sure you put on sunscreen.

309
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:44,771
And on your feet, too.

310
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:47,114
Remember our trip to Mexico?

311
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:51,718
I'll talk to you guys later.

312
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,040
Everything's fine.

313
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,412
I don't
know what I was worried about.

314
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,221
Are you sure you wanna do this?

315
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:05,159
Do what?

316
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:07,331
Go to Vegas, get married.

317
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,963
It is a whole weekend
away from Susan.

318
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:13,910
Katherine, I told you. I just
wanted to make sure M.J. was okay.

319
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,504
Why don't you just admit it?

320
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:19,795
- You're still hung up on her.
- Are we gonna do this again?

321
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:22,558
All I know is, it's our wedding day,

322
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:25,303
and you were in a crappy mood
until you talked to your ex-wife.

323
00:21:28,435 --> 00:21:29,927
I wouldn't be sitting here

324
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:31,986
if I didn't want to marry you.

325
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,740
Really?

326
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:38,845
Do I need to shout
it out in the airport?

327
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,314
- You wouldn't do that.
- I will, I'll do whatever I need to,

328
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,427
- to prove my love!
- No, it's okay!

329
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:46,678
You convinced me.

330
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:52,921
I am dying for a cappuccino.
You want one?

331
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:55,791
Yeah, I do.

332
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:58,474
You said it. "I do."

333
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:01,315
Can't take it back now.

334
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,462
<i>...should be allowed to just...</i>

335
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:05,110
<i>Walk away.</i>

336
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,069
<i>I know some people will wonder,</i>

337
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:10,428
<i>why didn't I just kill Susan?</i>

338
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:14,599
<i>But what good would that have done?</i>

339
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,902
<i>She'd be dead.
There'd be no... suffering.</i>

340
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:22,731
<i>And to those of you who hate me
because I took the life of an innocent,</i>

341
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:24,949
<i>young boy, I say...</i>

342
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:33,813
That woman I was with?
Tell her I had to go. It's an emergency.

343
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:51,562
Your friend asked me
to tell you he had to leave.

344
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:53,617
What?

345
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:56,340
He said to say he's sorry.

346
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,685
- What were you thinking?
- First, tell me if it worked,

347
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:16,594
then I'll tell you
what I was thinking.

348
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:19,958
Don't be glib.
Did you hire someone to attack Orson?

349
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:22,667
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

350
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:25,138
Your thug tried to strangle him.

351
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:28,166
If he had tried to strangle him,
he'd be dead.

352
00:23:28,336 --> 00:23:31,435
Orson had the upper hand in
this divorce. We needed to regain it.

353
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,439
Not by resorting
to physical violence.

354
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,578
I would never have given
my permission for that.

355
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,368
That's why I didn't ask you.

356
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:40,591
What's your beef here, Bree?

357
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:43,289
My beef is that from the
minute I walked into this office,

358
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:47,087
you have pulled me deeper and deeper
into your moral cesspool.

359
00:23:47,257 --> 00:23:49,949
- That is not why I hired you.
- Please.

360
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,662
That is exactly why you hired me.

361
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,205
Face it. You were tired
of being a good girl.

362
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:58,747
- You knew it was time to play dirty.
- I wanted to protect what was mine.

363
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,066
You have turned me into
someone I don't recognize.

364
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:04,375
- And you've loved every minute of it.
- No, I haven't.

365
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:07,185
Yes, you have!
And so have I.

366
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:10,943
Because the truth is,

367
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:15,490
I think you're the most fascinating
woman that I have ever met.

368
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:17,877
What?

369
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:25,870
If I have not been clear
about how I feel about you,

370
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,071
I apologize for any ambiguity.

371
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:31,283
Understand this... I detest you.

372
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,627
No, you don't.
I can see it in your eyes.

373
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:37,816
You want me to walk over
there and pull you up against me

374
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,879
and kiss you until
your knees buckle.

375
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,623
- You're fired.
- Good.

376
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:46,814
That keeps this from
being a breach of ethics.

377
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:02,037
My knees haven't buckled yet.

378
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:21,825
It's your daddy.

379
00:25:23,318 --> 00:25:25,052
Where are you? Are you with Dave?

380
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,760
Yeah. We are in the car, singing.

381
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,800
Listen to me. Do not react

382
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:32,859
<i>to what I'm about to tell you.</i>

383
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,337
- This sounds really...
- Susan! Do you understand me?

384
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,828
Dave's real name is David Dash.

385
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:45,800
<i>He's the husband of the
woman we killed in the accident.</i>

386
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,573
- Oh, my god.
- Don't react!

387
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:51,618
Problem?

388
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,213
That sucks.

389
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:59,140
How could they cancel your flight?

390
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,645
<i>You guys are in danger. Just get away
from him. Go to a gas station, a store...</i>

391
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:04,679
Anyplace there's people.
I'm on my way.

392
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:06,686
Right.

393
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:10,534
How long do you think
you'll be delayed?

394
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:13,624
I'm a half-hour from the lake.
I'm calling the cops right now.

395
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:17,118
Just get away from him. Get
out of that car and get away from Dave.

396
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:19,133
<i>And you call me the second you do.</i>

397
00:26:21,216 --> 00:26:22,849
I hope you get there soon.

398
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,497
Bumped his flight?

399
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:28,363
What a drag.

400
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:30,503
From the top.

401
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,931
It feels like we've
been driving forever.

402
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:48,344
Maybe we should stretch our legs.

403
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:50,721
We're almost there.
Let's keep going.

404
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:55,692
Aren't you hungry, though?
Maybe there's a restaurant up ahead.

405
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,664
I really don't want to stop.

406
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,241
It's no big deal.

407
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:22,606
Hon!

408
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,581
Look what I got for college.
I got pens. I got notebooks.

409
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,572
I got an English to Mandarin dictionary
'cause you never know

410
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:31,927
when you might need a...

411
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:34,877
And look at this.

412
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,333
Check it out.

413
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:40,153
They're scented.
You wanna smell grape?

414
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,017
What? They're...

415
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:45,791
Like candy.

416
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,140
I went to the doctor today.

417
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:51,695
What's wrong?

418
00:27:53,075 --> 00:27:54,352
I'm pregnant.

419
00:27:55,637 --> 00:27:56,952
Pregnant?

420
00:27:58,186 --> 00:27:59,294
With a baby?

421
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:03,655
How long have you been sniffing
those markers? Of course with a baby.

422
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,281
But you can't.

423
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:08,056
We can't.
We're old!

424
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:10,308
Apparently, not old enough.

425
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,962
What am I gonna do about school?

426
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,334
What am I gonna do about my job?

427
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,183
We're gonna have another baby.

428
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:32,315
Actually,
I have an addendum to that.

429
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:38,685
Please tell me you're about
to recite the girl scout oath.

430
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:40,507
No, Tom.

431
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,825
We're having twins...

432
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,091
Again.

433
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:55,717
I have to go potty.

434
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:57,503
Okay, sweetie.

435
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,757
Do you mind pulling
over at the next rest stop?

436
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:02,918
We're almost there. Can you hold it?

437
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:04,745
No. I really have to go.

438
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:11,063
Fine.

439
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,760
Just hold on a few more minutes.

440
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:21,895
Here?
He can't go here.

441
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:25,517
Come on, M.J. Let's go.

442
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:28,660
Can't we find a gas
station or maybe a diner?

443
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,473
He's a big boy.
He can use the bushes.

444
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:32,464
Don't go too far.

445
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:40,548
<i>Dave, detective Collins
with the Fairview P.D.</i>

446
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:43,648
- <i>We know everything.</i>
- I'm sorry. What are you...

447
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:46,227
<i>Heller, your wife, your child.
All of it.</i>

448
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:49,164
<i>If you come in now, I'll do everything
I can to help you. But let's end this</i>

449
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:50,590
<i>before someone gets hurt.</i>

450
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:00,035
Keys...

451
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,547
M.J., run!

452
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:22,190
Come on, honey!
Let's run! Let's run!

453
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:26,296
- Why are we running?
- We're playing a game with Dave.

454
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:27,962
So run as fast as you can.

455
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,164
Are you okay?

456
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:36,577
- I'm fine.
- <i>Susan! M.J.!</i>

457
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:38,592
Listen.

458
00:30:38,762 --> 00:30:40,664
It's really important
that you win this game.

459
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,675
I want you to find
a good hiding place,

460
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:45,957
and even if you hear Dave,
you don't come out no matter what, okay?

461
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:50,905
Don't worry.
I'm gonna hide, too. Now go.

462
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:52,328
Go!

463
00:30:57,987 --> 00:30:59,264
Where is he?

464
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:07,711
You are not gonna mess this up!
We are too close to the finish line!

465
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:09,112
Now call him!

466
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:14,018
Call him.

467
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:22,550
Don't come out!

468
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:35,990
You wanna go fishing,
don't you, buddy?

469
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:39,368
If you don't come out now,
we're gonna get there too late!

470
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:42,437
I'll let you drive the boat!

471
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:50,258
If you don't come out right now,

472
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:52,361
we're gonna leave without you.

473
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:57,632
You don't wanna be in this
scary graveyard after dark, do ya?

474
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,826
All right, M.J.,

475
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:05,783
we're leaving!

476
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,121
Mommy, wake up.
I get to drive the boat.

477
00:32:34,023 --> 00:32:35,600
Keep the volume really high.

478
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:39,406
You don't wanna hear
all the boring grown-up talk.

479
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:46,423
Buckle up.

480
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,268
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Shut up.

481
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:57,261
I'm trying to think.

482
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,495
Dave, please...

483
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,447
I'm so sorry about that accident.

484
00:33:12,597 --> 00:33:14,672
You don't wanna hurt M.J. or me.

485
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:16,682
You're a good person. I know you.

486
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:18,602
Don't analyze me.

487
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:22,246
The last guy who tried
that didn't do so well.

488
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,674
You won't get away with it.
Mike already called the cops.

489
00:33:27,844 --> 00:33:29,405
- They're on their way.
- Enough!

490
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,840
- Where are you?
- <i>Not up at the lake.</i>

491
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,538
You kind of screwed
up my plans here.

492
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:49,392
And, Susan says hello.

493
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,654
Take it easy.

494
00:33:53,036 --> 00:33:54,435
You aren't revenge?

495
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,405
Let Susan and M.J.
go. Take me instead.

496
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,752
How does it feel,

497
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:04,406
to know that you can't
save the people that you love?

498
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:06,472
Hopeless?

499
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:09,411
Like your entire
life has no meaning?

500
00:34:11,794 --> 00:34:12,981
Please.

501
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:15,753
I can't be that far behind you.
I'm on route 12.

502
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:18,535
You're on route 12?

503
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:21,308
<i>Yeah, come on.</i>

504
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:24,704
You don't wanna hurt them.
Let me be the one.

505
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:28,174
You're right. You should be the one.

506
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:32,673
- So we've got a deal?
- If I see one cop car,

507
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:34,846
they're both dead.

508
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:36,740
No cops.

509
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,013
- You just tell me where to meet you.
- Keep heading south.

510
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:43,198
There's an abandoned gas station
past the intersection of route 12

511
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:44,819
and Canterbury road.

512
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:48,838
Canterbury road? That's where we...

513
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:50,750
Yeah, it is.

514
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:04,639
Look familiar?

515
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:07,732
What are you gonna do to us?

516
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:10,144
Why did you bring us here?

517
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,481
I thought it would be poetic.

518
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:16,420
Mike should be here any minute.

519
00:35:17,427 --> 00:35:20,017
Dave, please. Don't hurt Mike.

520
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,440
It wasn't his fault.

521
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,266
It was your fault.

522
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,463
But he wants to be the hero, so...

523
00:35:31,014 --> 00:35:32,066
Get out.

524
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:37,484
- I'm not leaving M.J.
- M.J.'s coming.

525
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:39,674
I need send you up first. Get out.

526
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,247
Now.

527
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:49,775
Try not to scare M.J.
when you bring him here.

528
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:53,354
Actually, change of plans.

529
00:35:53,794 --> 00:35:54,636
What?

530
00:35:54,806 --> 00:35:56,308
M.J.'s staying with me.

531
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,667
He and I are gonna
pull into that intersection

532
00:35:59,837 --> 00:36:02,538
just as Mike comes
barreling down that road.

533
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:05,360
Oh, my God.

534
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,788
And you're gonna
stay there and watch

535
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,110
as Mike kills your child,

536
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,341
just like you killed mine.

537
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:16,690
I told you it was poetic.

538
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,160
Dave, please.

539
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:21,017
I cannot imagine the
pain you went through,

540
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:23,867
but you can't do this.
You can't kill my little boy!

541
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:25,449
Shut up.

542
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:28,975
What if your daughter
could see you now!

543
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:32,125
Is this how you'd
want her to see you?!

544
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:35,999
As a monster who could
murder an innocent child?!

545
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,590
I'm not a monster.

546
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:53,264
You don't need that.

547
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:56,305
You're a big boy now.

548
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,705
Stop!

549
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,586
Are you okay?

550
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:04,825
Dave told me to get out of the car.

551
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:19,629
Daddy!

552
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,159
<i>What do you say we
all go out for ice cream?</i>

553
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:52,061
I'd love to,
but I brought work home.

554
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:55,591
- Again?
- I know. I'm so boring.

555
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:58,150
Why don't you two go?

556
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:01,061
Fine. I'll take her now.

557
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:04,143
Come on, sweetie.

558
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:11,679
Wait.

559
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:13,634
Don't go.

560
00:39:15,323 --> 00:39:17,447
We have marshmallows and chocolate.

561
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:19,264
I can make s'mores.

562
00:39:19,596 --> 00:39:21,455
Would you like that,
my little princess?

563
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:27,646
You sure?

564
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:29,278
You said you had work.

565
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,632
It can wait.

566
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:36,806
I always have time for my girls.

567
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:47,284
<i>I always have time for my girls.</i>

568
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,715
Two Months Later

569
00:40:18,647 --> 00:40:20,619
<i>There was a wedding recently</i>

570
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,314
<i>at Fairview presbyterian church.</i>

571
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:27,992
<i>The Minister spoke about
the nature of marriage...</i>

572
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:34,488
<i>The sublime joy of giving birth...</i>

573
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:43,376
<i>The immense pleasure
of raising a family...</i>

574
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:51,623
<i>The importance of fidelity...</i>

575
00:40:56,194 --> 00:40:59,082
<i>And then he said
what all ministers say</i>

576
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:01,464
<i>to conclude such matters...</i>

577
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:03,480
You may now kiss the bride.

578
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:10,474
<i>For a moment,</i>

579
00:41:10,644 --> 00:41:14,240
<i>the groom wondered if
he was doing the right thing.</i>

580
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:20,174
<i>That's when the bells began to ring,</i>

581
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,813
<i>telling him he had.</i>
