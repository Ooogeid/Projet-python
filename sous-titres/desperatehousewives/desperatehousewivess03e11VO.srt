<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives.</i>

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,979
I will love her like she is my own.

3
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:07,464
<i>Lynette made a promise...</i>

4
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:10,916
His wife goes missing, and
his mistress turns up dead?

5
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:13,400
I just can't believe that
Orson could do such a thing.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,407
<i>Mike got arrested...</i>

7
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,521
Oh, thank god!

8
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:17,006
<i>And a friendship hit the rocks.</i>

9
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:18,387
I am not playing with a woman

10
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:21,084
that is willing to let Mike take
the fall for her psycho husband.

11
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:22,299
<i>Susan made a deal...</i>

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,999
I'll hire the best lawyer
in town on one condition--

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,499
you can't see him anymore.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,199
<i>and a missing wife returned.</i>

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Hello, Alma.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,100
<i>To understand the journey of Alma Hodge,</i>

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,700
<i>you first need to know how it started.</i>

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
<i>it began the day she wed Orson Hodge,</i>

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,299
<i>a man she had tricked into marriage</i>

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,499
<i>by getting pregnant.</i>

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,200
<i>Alma was confident
that as their family grew,</i>

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,900
<i>Orson's feelings for her
would grow as well.</i>

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,300
<i>but then something went wrong,</i>

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,100
<i>and the baby she had been
counting on never came.</i>

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>so Alma found herself married to a man</i>

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,100
<i>who seemed to despise her.</i>

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,300
<i>Still, Alma hoped
things would get better...</i>

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,499
Mama loves her baby.
es the baby love mama?

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,399
<i>Until the day she discovered</i>

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,673
<i>Orson was having an affair.</i>

31
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,018
<i>and Alma realized</i>

32
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,575
<i>the only way she'd ever get
her husband to appreciate her</i>

33
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:33,497
<i>was to leave him...</i>

34
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:35,803
<i>immediately.</i>

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,877
If you don't get back in
your cage right now,

36
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:52,281
I'm gonna have to leave
you behind. please!

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,900
Going somewhere?

38
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:17,432
I'm staying at a motel tonight.

39
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:20,799
Why?

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,700
I don't have time to discuss it.
I'm late for the bus.

41
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:26,589
All right.

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm going away because...

43
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:39,920
I know you're having
an affair.

44
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:41,737
Ah. I see.

45
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:45,499
Aren't you even gonna deny it?

46
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:47,632
On the contrary.

47
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,216
I wanna shout it from the rooftops!

48
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,956
For the first time in my life,
I'm actually in love.

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,004
How can you say that to me?
I'm your wife!

50
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,956
We both know why we got married,

51
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:02,097
and it had nothing to do with affection.

52
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,243
So you don't care if I go?

53
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
No.

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,899
Wait! this isn't what's
supposed to happen!

55
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,711
You should be begging
me to stay with you.

56
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,800
I deserve to be happy, Alma. So do you.

57
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,700
And we're clearly not
gonna find that together.

58
00:03:23,795 --> 00:03:24,909
Orson, no!

59
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:27,881
<i>It was at that moment</i>

60
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,337
<i>Alma realized it wasn't enough
to leave her husband.</i>

61
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:34,889
<i>He had to be punished.</i>

62
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,800
<i>Yes, this was the journey
of Alma Hodge...</i>

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,118
Bree Hodge?
I'm Alma Hodge.

64
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,463
I believe we have someone in common.

65
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,035
<i>and it wasn't over yet.</i>

Desperate Housewives - Saison 3
Épisode no 11 "No Fits,No Fights,No Feuds"

70
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:42,399
<i>There is a time of day all
housewives look forward to.</i>

71
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,299
<i>It occurs just after the chores
have been completed</i>

72
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,400
<i>and right before the children
come home from school.</i>

73
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,900
<i>It's a time for good friends
to get together,</i>

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>have a cup of coffee
and exchange gossip</i>

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,100
<i>aboutthe other good friends
who couldn't make it that day.</i>

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,300
Bree let Orson move back in.

77
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:07,887
You're kidding. When?

78
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:10,605
Yesterday. I'm so disappointed in her.

79
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,904
<i>Well, the police
did arrest Mike.</i>

80
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:14,699
I mean, I know you think he's innocent,

81
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:15,999
but surely you can understand

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
why Bree's feelings have changed.

83
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:18,800
Well, mine haven't,

84
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,555
and I know something
that Bree probably doesn't.

85
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:28,400
When Orson was 17,

86
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,115
he spent time in a mental institution.

87
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,800
How did you find that out?

88
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:35,900
I snuck into his office and
rifled through his things.

89
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:39,600
Of course you did.
But that doesn't prove

90
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,447
he had anything to do
with monique's murder.

91
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,088
No, but it's a piece of the puzzle.

92
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,800
<i>I mean, he did have an affair with her.</i>

93
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:46,932
And when you combine that

94
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,000
with the fact that
his first fe went missing...

95
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,822
So you're Alma.

96
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,405
Where have you been all this time?

97
00:05:57,605 --> 00:05:59,399
In canada. My aunt lives there.

98
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:01,199
Well, you should've told someone.

99
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,850
People thought you were dead.

100
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,211
Some even thought that Orson killed you.

101
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:08,305
Well, that's sort of what
I wanted them to think.

102
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,400
That's why I left my bird behind
and only took cash,

103
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:13,578
so they couldn't trace me
through my credit cards.

104
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:15,367
So you deliberately framed Orson?

105
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:18,854
I'm not saying it was my finest hour.

106
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:22,804
But you have to understand,
Orson hurt me very badly.

107
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:24,170
He cheated on me.

108
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,635
Yes, I know with monique polier.

109
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,218
And I thought, if I disappeared,

110
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:33,066
she'd get scared and leave
him, like he left me.

111
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:35,026
Isn't jealousy awful?

112
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:36,811
So why have you come back?

113
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,784
I found this fantastic therapist.

114
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:43,089
He told me that by holding
on to my anger

115
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,500
I was really just hurting myself,
which was hard to deny.

116
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,543
I mean, hello,

117
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm here in winnipeg with
a deaf aunt and no credit.

118
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,036
So I thought, it's time to make amends.

119
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:56,232
Darling?

120
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,796
Mrs. McLean canceled, so...
I'm free for lunch.

121
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,626
Um, actually, we have a guest.

122
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,926
Hello, Orson.

123
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:07,700
Oh, hello...

124
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,291
so... what is it with you and redheads?

125
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,703
I hope you don't mind me
springing this picnic on you.

126
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:24,415
I figured it'd be more fun
than some stuffy restaurant.

127
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:28,000
Are you kidding?
What could be more romantic?

128
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,300
Back off, you son of a bitch!

129
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:32,186
More wine?

130
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, keep it coming.

131
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,010
Hello?

132
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,900
Hey, who's the dork?

133
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:39,900
Carlos?

134
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:40,889
What's with that cap?

135
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,374
Extra, extra, read all about it!

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Where the hell are you?

137
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,677
- What are you doing at Mike's house?
- I live here.

138
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,848
What do you mean you live there?
Since when?

139
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,019
Gaby, my car's been in
the driveway for three weeks.

140
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,898
Even you can't be
that self-absorbed.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,679
Well, as you can see,

142
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:08,000
I have more pleasant thing to focus on.

143
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,368
So when you gonna tell Jimmy Olsen there

144
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:12,300
that you hate picnics?

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm gonna hang up now.

146
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,514
So where were we?

147
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:22,300
Your ex-husband moved
in across the street?

148
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,200
What's that gonna be like?

149
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:27,600
Yeah?!

150
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you gonna kiss him?

151
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:30,061
That's right, Carlos.

152
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,680
We have had some poblems

153
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:34,800
with raccoons getting into the trash.

154
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,500
So why don't you
just put a lid on it?

155
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Okay, they're here.
now listen, stand up.

156
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,999
Kayla has been through a lot,
so when she walks in the door,

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,799
I want you to make her
feel welcome, okay?

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,903
Give her a hug and be really nice.

159
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,932
I'm giving her my room.
how much nicer do I have to be?

160
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,800
Well, nicer than that, or she's
gonna get alyour toys, too.

161
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,069
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hi!

162
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,300
look who I found wandering
around the airport.

163
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:06,825
oh! hi, Kayla! we missed you!

164
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,405
we're so glad you're here.

165
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
okay, boys.

166
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,595
good. yeah, okay.
so give her some room.

167
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,899
hey, wow, look, are
those presents for Kayla?

168
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:29,600
Yes, they are.

169
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,432
hey, look at that. Preston gave
you a harmonica.

170
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,596
isn't that cool?

171
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,600
Oh. "harriet the spy."
sounds mysterious.

172
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,700
thanks.

173
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,808
and what did you get for her, porter?

174
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,106
A video game, but I get
to play it whenever I want.

175
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:48,900
porter!

176
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,200
I--you know what?
I got you something, too.

177
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:56,300
This...

178
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,300
is Nellie.

179
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,479
my grandma gave her to me
when I was little,

180
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,900
and I was hoping you could
take care of her for me.

181
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
thanks.

182
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,299
hey, honey, why don't you
take your stuff and go upstairs

183
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,962
and, uh, get ready for lunch, okay?

184
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,112
We I'm gonna ma some chili.

185
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,000
okay, daddy.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,700
honey...

187
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,600
that was so sweet...
to give her your doll.

188
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,500
oh. she didn't seem
that knocked out by it.

189
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,699
well, just give her some time.
she'll--she'll come around.

190
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,899
it's a tough adjustment.

191
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,600
okay.

192
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:48,099
I must say, Bree,

193
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:51,015
I don't know when I've tasted
such moist pound cake.

194
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:53,800
sour cream.

195
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
ah.

196
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:04,000
so whatever happened to my parrot?

197
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,300
I set it free.

198
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,200
mmm!

199
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,029
Orson, they don't fair well in the wild.

200
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:10,778
you should've--

201
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,892
For god sake, alma, who
cares about the damn bird?

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,300
You set me up.

203
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,641
why don't I wrap up
a piece of this pound cake

204
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:19,805
for you to enjoy later?

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

206
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:26,800
You almost ruined my life.

207
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:29,399
you've rebounded nicely. Bree's lovely.

208
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:30,699
don't change the subject.

209
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:34,475
you put me through a lot, too,
Orson, but I forgave you.

210
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,490
can't we just put this behind us?

211
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:39,507
And that's all you've
come back for--closure?

212
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:41,769
Of course. what else?

213
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm out of lipstick. can I borrow yours?

214
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:49,000
Sure.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,899
- Cherry berry?
- Austin likes the way it tastes.

216
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,100
oh, I so did not need to know that.

217
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,599
so, um, where you going?

218
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,500
Down to the jailhouse to talk to Mike.

219
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:04,100
but didn't you tell ian
you wouldn't see him anymore?

220
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,621
Yeah. but somebody's gotta
tell him about his new lawyer.

221
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:09,886
otherwise, the guy's gonna
show up, and he's gonna go,

222
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:11,895
"who the hell is he?"
Ian gets that.

223
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,699
Besides... why would it be a big deal?

224
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,000
Mike and I are over.

225
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:21,499
I was just wondering,
'cause, you know,

226
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,600
you're putting on lipstick
to go to a prison.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,511
thank you for clearing things up.

228
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,693
- oh, well,
- it was the least I could do.

229
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,950
Orson, I'm truly sorry
for the pain I've caused,

230
00:12:37,642 --> 00:12:39,368
and if there's anything else I can do...

231
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,100
actually, there is.

232
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,899
I'd love it if you could join us
for dinner this weekend.

233
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,900
there are some friends
that I'm just...

234
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,043
dying for you to meet.

235
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,800
you got me a lawyer?

236
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,799
Yeah, and he is fantastic.

237
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,700
you cannot believe the
scum he has gotten off.

238
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,500
<i>not that you're scum.</i>

239
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:10,459
But, you know, if you were,
you'd be sitting pretty.

240
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,399
I'm paying you back--
every penny.

241
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,699
oh, well, you know,
we'll figure that out later.

242
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,399
i-I can't believe that

243
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,000
I just listened to all that
stuff edie told me about you,

244
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,200
and it turns out you're
the only one standing by me.

245
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,300
You're a good friend, Susan.

246
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,265
Um, yeah, about that...

247
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,912
It's Ian.

248
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,300
He's not crazy about me
spending time with my ex.

249
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,369
Even an ex who doesn't
remember dating you?

250
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,900
I remember, and I guess
that's enough for him.

251
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,500
Well, I, uh, can't say that I blame him.

253
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
Take care of yourself Mike.

254
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,800
You, too, Susan.

255
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,500
Dinner's ready.

256
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,820
Kayla, i made your favorite--tacos.

257
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,800
Here u go.

258
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:29,999
But where's my daddy?

259
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:33,754
Sorry, sweetheart. he's working late,
trying to get the restaurant ready.

260
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:37,741
Oh, lovely, Parker.
Go wash your hands. go on.

261
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,000
Kayla, where you going?

262
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,800
To watch tv.

263
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,800
Oh, sweetie, we don't
watch tv during dinner.

264
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,471
But my show is on.

265
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Well, i'm sorry. Those are the rules.

266
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,800
My mommy let me.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,800
Well...

268
00:14:58,283 --> 00:14:59,500
Just this once.

269
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,225
Okay, okay, i know what
you're thinking, but...

270
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:12,882
Kayla's going through
a hard time right now.

271
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:13,799
Come and sit down.

272
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,899
letting her watch tv is like me

273
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,800
letting you eat ice cream
when you're sick.

274
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,900
But she's not sick.

275
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:23,406
well, that's true, but she's sad.

276
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,555
I'm sad I can't watch tv.

277
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,700
Eat your tacos.

278
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:39,834
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sit your butts down!

279
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:41,196
It's not fair.

280
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:43,800
I don't care. We have rules.

281
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:44,999
Well, she gets to.

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,926
She is special. Now sit down.

283
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:48,594
Come on.

284
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:52,783
Does she get dessert, too?

285
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:55,200
Of course I do.

286
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,899
What an amazing documentary, huh?

287
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,700
You know, I read the director
shot over 400 hours of film.

288
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,900
Really? I only counted half at.

289
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,800
I get it.

290
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,300
You pick the next one.

291
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,900
Okay.

292
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,799
Look at you!

293
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:20,216
Who knew you were such a romantic?

294
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,900
Actually, I... I didn't send them.

295
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,700
You didn't?

296
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,900
So, uh,

297
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,800
who's making me look bad?

298
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,900
Uh, there's no signature.

299
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,299
Sorry. This is kind of awkward.

300
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:44,059
No, I don't care who
worships you from afar,

301
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,900
As long as I get to do it up close.

302
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,500
That's sweet that you're not... jealous.

303
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,208
Carlos would've hit the roof
if some guy sent me...

304
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,200
Would you excuse me a minute?

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,400
Nice try, Carlos.

306
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,099
- Huh?
- Oh, don't act innocent.

307
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,784
You know you sent me these flowers.

308
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
Why would I get you flowers?

309
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
To sabotage my new relationship.

310
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,010
Oh, with picnic boy? What do
I care if you go out with him?

311
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:34,999
Oh, you care. first,
you move across the street.

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,166
and then, earlier today,
I catch you spying on me--

313
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,321
I was not spying.
I was mocking you.

314
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,100
- You need to move on, Carlos.
- I have moved on!

315
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:45,999
you're the one talking to your
ex during the middle of a date.

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,300
Is he that boring?

317
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,999
Bill is not boring.
he is vibrant...

318
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,300
And--and sexy.

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,500
And yet here you are.

320
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
She threw your doll in the trash?

321
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,799
No. first, she ripped off its
arms, stuffed it with chili.

322
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
Then she threw it in the trash.

323
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,200
So what did you do?

324
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,300
Nothing.

325
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,999
And this is after you let her
watch tv during dinner?

326
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,899
Well, I didn't know what else to do.

327
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,499
I'm trying to win over a little girl

328
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,362
who clearly doesn't want a new mother.

329
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,099
Well, I guess giving
her special treatment

330
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,230
isn't gonna lve anything.

331
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:58,215
You know what might solve something?

332
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,499
If you were home once in a while.

333
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,199
You're the one she listens to.

334
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,999
I am trying to open up a restaurant.

335
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,299
Our life savings is
riding on this thing.

336
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,299
I know, I know. I know.

337
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,399
You know what?

338
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't want you to be afraid
to take a firm hand with Kayla.

339
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
She's part of our family now, and...

340
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,900
you know what that means.

341
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
yeah.

342
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,500
I should treat her as badly
as I treat my own children.

343
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Exactly.

344
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,500
Uh...

345
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,900
Sorry. um...

346
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,299
I'm not sure
I'm... ready for that yet.

347
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,400
That's cool.

348
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,100
you can't blame me for trying, though.

349
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,099
Austin, you know I want to.

350
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,400
- It's just...
- Hey, don't sweat it.

351
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:58,929
If you're not ready,
you're not ready.

352
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,299
So he didn't pressure you at all?

353
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,700
What a great guy.

354
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,399
I know. I'm so lucky.

355
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,100
underneath all that
bad boy posturing, he's...

356
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,799
a real gentleman.

357
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,277
Wow, you're not only virgin.
you think like one.

358
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:19,100
Beat it, eavesdropper.

359
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,800
No, wait. um...

360
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,799
What did you mean by that?

361
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,400
Well, uh... guys need sex.

362
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,900
All right? It's basic science.

363
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,699
So if he's not getting it from you,

364
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,699
He'll end up getting it somewhere else.

365
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:36,399
you're a moron. not all guys
pressure girls for sex.

366
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,299
Yeah, gay guys don't.

367
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,400
But austin's not gay,
Not even after three beers.

368
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,800
Don't ask.

369
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,700
So what's your point?

370
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,800
If a guy has to wait too long
to see you naked,

371
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,000
He'll end up seeing you as a friend.

372
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,800
Again... science.

373
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:00,799
Don't listen to him.

374
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,399
You hold on to your virginity.

375
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,900
if Austin won't wait, then
he doesn't deserve you.

376
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,100
I just don't wanna lose him.

377
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,400
It's better than losing
your self-respect.

378
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,699
Take it from a girl

379
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,600
who's known at school
as "little miss Van De Tramp."

380
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
I thought you made that up.

381
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,199
Only 'cause it was nicer than

382
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,760
the other names they were calling me.

383
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,399
I really appreciate you
donating this stuff.

384
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,099
Anything for a good cause.

385
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,699
Everyone at the shelter's
gonna be so excited.

386
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,399
I mean, to you and me, these are
just a bunch of old clothes.

387
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,900
But to a homeless woman...

388
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,800
It's a chance for her
to feel pretty again.

389
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,500
You okay?

390
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,499
What?

391
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,800
I asked if you're okay.
You seem kind of distracted.

392
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,599
I... am fine.

393
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,700
Yes, I just remembered today's
my mother's birthday.

394
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,199
Can we stop by the florist
on the way to the shelter?

395
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Yeah.

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,399
Detective Ridley, my name
is Susan Mayer,

397
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,099
and I'm calling to "drop a dime"
on someone.

398
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,500
That's the expression, right?

399
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,899
Yes, ma'am.
You've got the lingo down pat.

400
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,700
<i>Good. uh...</i>

401
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,700
His name is Orson Hodge,

402
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,499
and he had an affair

403
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,199
with the woman that you
think Mike Delfino killed.

404
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,300
Monique Polier?

405
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:25,517
Are you sure? Because Mr. Hodge
saw her body in the morgue.

406
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:27,020
he acted like he didn't know her.

407
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:29,999
Well, he does, and so he's
pretending he didn't.

408
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,199
That's suspicious, right?

409
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,500
Well, um.

410
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,499
Oh, uh, can you hold on?
Hello?

411
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,499
Susan. Hi. it's Bree.

412
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,100
Bree? Uh... Hi.

413
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,100
Can you hold on a second?

414
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,499
It's Orson's wife. She can't
know I called you.

415
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,000
- Then how about you don't tell her?
- Right.

416
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,399
Sorry. uh, I'm just new
to this whole snitch thing.

417
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,300
<i>Hold on, okay?</i>

418
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,900
Bree, hi.

419
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,700
Sorry about that. Damn telemarketer.

420
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,999
<i>So what can I do for you?</i>

421
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,199
I just feel really awful
about our fight,

422
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,699
and I think it's time
for an apology.

423
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Bree, I am so relieved.

424
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Would you join Orson and me
for dinner tomorrow night?

425
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,600
Sure.

426
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,100
Good. I'll see you at 8:00.

427
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,200
<i>Bree...</i>

428
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,400
I just want you to know
that no matter what,

429
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,900
your friendship means the world to me.

430
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>oh, Susan, you know, I feel exactly--</i>

431
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,700
It's me again.

432
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,900
you should also know that Orson
spent a year in an asylum.

433
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,000
Hi. Can I help you?

434
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,499
Hi. uh, I received some flowers
from your shop yesterday,

435
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,400
and the card didn't say
who they were from.

436
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,399
Can you check?
The name is Solis.

437
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,900
sure, sure. Just give me a sec here.

438
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,299
Solis?

439
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,100
Yeah.

440
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,899
Solis... Solis...

441
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Huh. This is odd.

442
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,500
The buyer asked to remain anonymous.

443
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,299
Really? Uh, well,
the flowers were so beautiful,

444
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,800
I'd like to know who to thank.

445
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,599
Sorry. I have to honor their request.

446
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,400
why? They're just flowers.
they're not government secrets.

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
if you don't mind, I'm busy.

448
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,663
well, okay, wait, wait, wait,
let me explain.

449
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:25,500
what's to explain?
A pretty girl gets flowers.

450
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,199
Do you know how many girls
never get flowers?

451
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,699
I work in a flower shop.

452
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,900
I've never gotten anfreakin' flowers!

453
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,899
So stop your whining
about who sent them

454
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,200
and just be glad he did.

455
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,399
Uh, you're right,

456
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,800
and I am so sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

457
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,600
Sorry for doing this.

458
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,300
Hey what the hell are u doing

459
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,199
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

460
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,899
I'm gonna make it up to you, okay?

461
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,000
Once I'm done, I'll send you flowers.

462
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,700
Hey! You won't get away with is!

463
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,200
- I know where you live!
- yeah? Well, stop by. We'll hot tub.

464
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,200
Hey, mister, help!

465
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,700
She locked me in here!

466
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,900
Gaby?

467
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,999
This is totally her fault.

468
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,099
I mean, I simply asked her
if Carlos sent me the flowers,

469
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,095
and she refused to show
me the order slip.

470
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:35,838
Are you still hung up on that?
For god sake.

471
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,325
I just need a couple
more minutes.

472
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:39,999
- I need to know the truth.
- What truth is that, huh?

473
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,025
That you're still obsessed
with your ex-husband?

474
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,200
What?! No, he's obsessed with me.

475
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,599
You just imprisoned a florist

476
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,700
to find out if he sentou roses.

477
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,300
Okay, I see what you mean.

478
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
There. I'm done.

479
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,099
Let's go.

480
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,800
Actually... I think I'm done, too.

481
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
It's okay.

483
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm probably not ready to date.

484
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,000
thanks.

485
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,800
and just so you know,
I am ready to date.

486
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,600
All right, let's hit it.

487
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,199
Now come on, Kayla.

488
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,599
- I haven't finished my ice cream.
- Well, I'm sorry,

489
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,899
but we gotta go I have a
dinner party I have to get to.

490
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,000
They got to finish their ice cream.

491
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,509
well, they, uh, you know,

492
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,267
wolfed it down like kids
are supposed to.

493
00:26:58,268 --> 00:26:59,900
So... hurry it up.

494
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,400
Kayla, I'm not fooling around.

495
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,900
We--we're going.

496
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,400
Okay.

497
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,200
Boys, go to the car.
I'll be out in a minute. go.

498
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Listen, sweetheart, I don't
blame you for being angry.

499
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,670
Your mom's gone, and
you're stuck with me.

500
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,500
But...

501
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,199
The last thing she said to me was,

502
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,999
"promise you'll take care of Kayla,"

503
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,700
and I am going to.

504
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,700
But you're gonna have to help me, okay?

505
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,000
We can leave when I'm done.

506
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,800
Okay, let's go.

507
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,699
Hey, whoa! Whoa! Okay.

508
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,399
what the hell are you doing?!
Stop, stop! Stop screaming!

509
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,699
- Stop!
- Leave me alone!

510
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,200
You're not my mommy!

511
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,398
Guys, how would you like

512
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,137
to eat dinner in front of the television

513
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:48,900
for a whole week?

514
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,300
What are you guys doing here?

515
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Kayla, stop screaming!
you're hurting my ears!

516
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,900
Get in the car!

517
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,000
Come on! We're going home!

518
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,600
Get your seat belt on!

519
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,300
Kids-- They're always roughhousing.

520
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,900
Why'd you stop?

521
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Well, uh, it's getting late.
I got your blouse unbuttoned.

522
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,800
That's usually when we call it a night.

523
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Do you wanna call it a night?

524
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,400
What, do you wanna grab
a pizza or something?

525
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,700
I wanna do what...
you wanna do.

526
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,500
Well...

527
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
You know what I wanna do.

528
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,600
Well, okay.

529
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,000
Are you sure?

530
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,900
Yeah, I'm sure.

531
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,241
You can always spot the new guys

532
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:39,000
by the way they pick through their food.

533
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,859
So what did you do when you
thought no one was looking?

534
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,900
The cops say I kill a woman.

535
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,600
But you didn't, right?

536
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:54,200
Actually I have no idea.

537
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
I got pretty banged up in an accident.

538
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,800
The last two years are blanked.

539
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,300
Well that's a fresh approach.

540
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm not sure the jury's
gonna swallow it.

541
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
It's the truth.

542
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,700
I believe you.

543
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,699
Okay, Mrs. mccluskey's downstairs,

544
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,199
and we will be right across
the street if you need us.

545
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,300
Okay, daddy.

546
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,949
You know, I heard what happened
with Lynette today.

547
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,100
Hey, she's doing her best.
Why you being so hard on her?

548
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,800
'cause it's her fault
my mommy died.

549
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,899
No. no, no, honey. It's not.

550
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,399
Mom only went to that store

551
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,092
because Lynette was trying to steal me.

552
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:42,616
Okay, that it is not true.

553
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,789
Look, honey, it is way more

554
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,500
complicated than that.

555
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,899
I know you miss your mommy,

556
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,100
and she loved you very much.

557
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,000
But guess what?

558
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,100
Lynette loves you too.

559
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,100
That's why you gotta give her a chance.

560
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,500
Can you do that for me?

561
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,200
Okay. i'll be good.

562
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,500
That's my girl.

563
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,500
But I'm never gonna love her...

564
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:17,900
And you can't make me.

565
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, you've won.

566
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
What did I win?

567
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,558
Bill and I split up.

568
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
Can't say I'm surprised.

569
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,000
He wasn't right for you.

570
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,300
I know.

571
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:51,300
So just admit you sent the flowers.

572
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,600
I didn't.

573
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,373
Carlos, just tell me.

574
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,400
I won't be mad. I promise.

575
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:01,260
Gaby, if I was gonna send you flowers,

576
00:33:01,261 --> 00:33:02,800
I wouldn't send you
pink roses.

577
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,700
I'd send you white orchids,

578
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
Because I know they're your favorite.

579
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,500
And if I wanted to
cheer you up sunflowers.

580
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,100
and for the flu...

581
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,300
Blue irises.

582
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,800
I hate that you know me so well,

583
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,199
and it took so long for that to happen.

584
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,700
Now I have to start over again
with somebody else.

585
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,100
Yeah. That's what dating's for.

586
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
I know, and it sucks.

587
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,999
I mean, you saw me.

588
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,199
I went on a picnic and
ate pudding out of a can.

589
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
it was horrible.

590
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:51,199
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

591
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
I dragged to the ballet the other night.

592
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,900
So you are dating.

593
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,500
That's why you've been
lifting weights and jogging.

594
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,300
Well, if you wanna bag the big game,

595
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,700
Gotta work on the guns.

596
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,400
I'll give you this--

597
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,500
you're gon be a tough
act to follow, Carlos.

598
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,000
Back at ya, babe.

599
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,999
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting,

600
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,360
but I don't want to introduce you

601
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:47,000
- until all my guests are here.
- I don't mind.

602
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,600
By the way, um,

603
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,099
when my friends ask you what happened--

604
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,100
and they will--

605
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,200
I don't think it's necessary
to go into all that

606
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,199
unpleasantness about Orson and Monique.

607
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,099
All they need to know

608
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,900
is that you're back
and we're on good terms.

609
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
And Orson didn't kill me.

610
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,100
And Orson didn't kill you.

611
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,800
Oh, okay, just o minute.
That'll be Susan.

612
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,299
Hi. I brought you a bundt cake.

613
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,699
Don't worry. I didn't make it.

614
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,099
- Oh, you didn't have to do that.
- I was really touched

615
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,199
it was so big of you.

616
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,100
Well, when you're wrong, You're wrong.

617
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,799
Now that we're all assembled,

618
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,400
I'd like to introduce
the guest of honor.

619
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,518
I hope you'll all be as
delighted to meet her as I was.

620
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,700
You can me in now.

621
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,200
Everyone, this is Alma Hodge.

622
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,000
Orson's first wife.

623
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Oh, about that apology...

624
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,100
Any time you're ready.

625
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,800
So you have been in canada
this entire time?

626
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,399
Well, my aunt Agnes has
a place in Winnipeg.

627
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:28,299
I hadn't planned on staying slong,

628
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,423
but I needed the time to find myself.

629
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:32,651
It would've been nice if
someone to found you.

630
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,689
There was a whole lot
of drama around here.

631
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,699
Yes, I heard.

632
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,500
People actually thought
Orson had done away with me?

633
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,099
Amazing, isn't it,

634
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Where some people's minds will go?

635
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,399
- Well, you gotta hand it to her.
- Just when you think

636
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,299
Bree's thrown every
conceivable theme party,

637
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,599
she hosts a "shame on you

638
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,630
for thinking my husband
killed someone" dinner.

639
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:56,672
So Alma's alive. big deal.

640
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,299
We still don't know what went
down between Orson and Monique.

641
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,199
Susan, please. we look stupid
enough for suspecting him.

642
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,300
Just let it go.

643
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,500
It may be a little late for that.

644
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,999
Detective Ridley. Can I help you?

645
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,200
Yes. I'd like to speak to your husband.

646
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,299
Oh, well, I'm afraid he's not here,

647
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,200
but I will be happy to tell him
that you came by.

648
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,700
<i>Who is it, darling?</i>

649
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,100
Excuse us.

650
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,600
Can't this wait?
We're having a dinner party.

651
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,500
Hello, Dr. Hodge.

652
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
Detective Ridley.

653
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,299
We need you to come with us.
We have some questions

654
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,851
about that Jane Doe we
showed you in the morgue.

655
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:45,599
Why do you think I'd know
anything about her?

656
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,700
Well, you were having an affair
with her when she died.

657
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,300
Oh, where did you hear that?

658
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Susan?

659
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,300
I didn't know they were
gonna come tonight.

660
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,999
Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions

661
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,299
that you might have.

662
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,400
My apologies. Please, stay.
Enjoy the dessert.

663
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,399
I don't believe this.

664
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,099
You called the police?

665
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,999
Well, obviously, you weren't going to.

666
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,999
They needed to know that that
dead woman was Orson's mistress.

667
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,999
- I told you that in confidence.
- Did you seriously think

668
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,300
I could sit on information
that would exonerate Mike?

669
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,300
If you had seen his face
in jail the other day...

670
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,700
The other day?
You-- you saw Mike?

671
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
Yeah. I-- just to tell him
about the lawyer.

672
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,899
I know that Mike is innocent.

673
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,200
Right, just like you knew she was dead.

674
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,300
I thought we had an agreement.

675
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,999
We do. Can we talk about this later?

676
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,800
When?

677
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
After your next conjugal visit?

678
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,800
Ian. wait!

679
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Boy, when it comes to Mike,
there's no one you won't betray.

680
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,400
excuse me?

681
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,199
Hey, guys...

682
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,599
Please leave my house.

683
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,900
Bree! You heard me. Get out!

684
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,728
Okay, Bree, I know you're angry,

685
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,199
but for the sake of our friendship--

686
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,900
Oh, make no mistake,
our friendship is over.

687
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,299
Okay. you go...

688
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Okay.

689
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,600
So, Winnipeg...

690
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
must get pretty cold up there.

691
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,752
I'm just getting my coat.

692
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,999
Ian, please, I just lost
one of my best friends.

693
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,159
I can't lose you, too.

694
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:45,199
You said that you wouldn't
see him again.

695
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,599
but you had to know that
I would go one more time

696
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,099
- to just explain everything.
- Actually, no, I didn't.

697
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,000
Well, that's just crazy!

698
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,999
Why are you acting like a crazy person?

699
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,700
Because you've already
left me once for this--this guy!

700
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,299
Things are different now!
I love you!

701
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,600
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

702
00:40:02,143 --> 00:40:03,960
If we're gonna make
this relationship work,

703
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:07,600
then you have to trust me,
and why are you smiling at me?

704
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,600
- You just said that you love me.
- Yeah? So?

705
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,499
- Well, you've never said that before.
- Yes, I have.

706
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,299
No. I would've remembered.

707
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,099
well, I'm saying it now.
I love you.

708
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,699
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No, ma'am.

709
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,099
you--you--you can't kiss me now.
I'm yelling at you.

710
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,099
Well, I'm listening.

711
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,499
well... don't think that you can

712
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,400
get out of this, you know, by just...

713
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,899
Oh, god. oh, yeah, uh,
oh, yeah, right--right there.

714
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,908
Oh, right there.

715
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
Look, I think we should stop doing this.

716
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,899
I know it's my idea,

717
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,800
but it just doesn't feel right anymore.

718
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,000
You slept with Julie. It's no big deal.

719
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,655
Well, it is to her,

720
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:53,399
And I don't want
to see her get hurt.

721
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,800
Me, either.

722
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,900
So let's just not tell her.

723
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,500
<i>There's no place in fairview
that's more peaceful.</i>

724
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,700
All the floorsre hardwood.

725
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,900
Oh, there are brand-new appliances.

726
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,300
And the gardens are...

727
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,000
well, they're beautiful.

728
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,600
So... what do you think?

729
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,400
I'll take it.

730
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,799
Really? That's terrific!

731
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,700
I'll draw up the papers in the morning.

732
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,500
if you don't mind me asking,

733
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,800
Why were you so interested
in this particular street?

734
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,100
I've been moving around a lot
in the last few months,

735
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,099
and I need a place where
I can really settle down.

736
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,300
you know what I mean?

737
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,085
<i>I wanna live in a place where
children know how to behave,</i>

738
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,899
<i>where people still have
some sense of moral value,</i>

739
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,199
<i>and where friendships are good.</i>

740
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,900
<i>and strong and last forever.</i>

741
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
That is what I looking for

742
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:07,400
Then I think Wisteria Lane
is the place for you.

743
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,400
good.

744
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,300
more than anything,
I just wanna fit in.

745
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,099
Oh, you will, Alma.

746
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,400
<i>You absolutely will.</i>

747
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:20,500
