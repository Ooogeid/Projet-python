<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,125
Your ex-husband was
part owner in a business.

3
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>Susan came into
an inheritance.</i>

4
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:11,548
Who do I speak to about selling
my share of herpes on parade?

5
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>Lynette acquiesced...</i>

6
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,554
- Looks like we'll be going to therapy.
- That is great news! Thank you.

7
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:20,967
As soon as I graduate high school,
I'm going to New York to be a model.

8
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:24,432
<i>Angie's concerns
made her more protective.</i>

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,903
You know I've always felt bad
about the way we've had to raise you,

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,775
- being on the run and all.
- The door stays open.

11
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,991
- I want it closed.
- You stink.

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,740
And you're a whore! Here's
the difference. I can get clean.

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,229
- Stop!
- Say "please".

14
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:42,245
<i>- And Orson expressed his feelings.</i>
- Please!

15
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:45,308
That's the life I'm facing now.
Having to ask people for help,

16
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:48,085
for everything.
Do you know how hard that is?!

17
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:56,918
<i>Orson Hodge was smiling again,</i>

18
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:00,204
<i>and it was starting to worry
his wife.</i>

19
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:05,733
<i>You see, since his accident,</i>

20
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:07,894
<i>Bree Hodge had grown accustomed</i>

21
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:10,455
<i>to her husband's severe mood swings.</i>

22
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,488
<i>She had grown used to
his unexpected rage...</i>

23
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:20,617
<i>His sudden anguish...</i>

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,164
<i>His deep depression.</i>

25
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,006
<i>But lately,</i>

26
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:30,037
<i>an odd tranquility
had settled over Orson,</i>

27
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:33,785
<i>and his wife had the feeling
something was terribly wrong.</i>

28
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:35,887
<i>Sadly,</i>

29
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:37,867
<i>she was right.</i>

30
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:43,983
What's going on here?

31
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:49,145
Just thought I'd give away
some things I don't need anymore.

32
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,964
You got these in 8 and half?

33
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,068
Sorry, Roy. Just carry men's sizes.

34
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,890
I can understand why you might want
to give away your sporting equipment,

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,234
but why would you give away
your books and your CDs?

36
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,205
And for God sakes, you can
still use your headphones.

37
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:09,249
These are amazing!

38
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:10,937
Give me those.

39
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,635
What is wrong with you people?

40
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,672
Don't you realize
you're taking advantage

41
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,966
of a man who is
emotionally distraught?

42
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:20,059
He seemed to be in a great mood.

43
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,574
Until lady sunshine walked in.

44
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,639
Sorry, we assumed
you had talked about it.

45
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,635
We didn't. That doesn't excuse the fact
that you're acting like vultures.

46
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:32,499
It's a good thing I came home,
or you'd be picking through his closet.

47
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:36,038
You know what, guys? We should go.

48
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,069
And please leave
your plunder behind.

49
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:42,782
Come on. At my age,
it's just a short-term loan.

50
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,458
What has gotten into you?

51
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,543
I'm sorry, darling.
I had no intention of upsetting you.

52
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:58,007
Keep my things, give them away.

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,622
Ultimately, it doesn't matter.

54
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:04,377
<i>Yes, Orson Hodge was smiling again</i>

55
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,748
<i>and Bree would soon learn
the reason why.</i>

56
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:11,269
<i>You see, her husband...</i>

57
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:14,891

Hey, Mrs. Kinsky.

Look who's here!

70
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,051
The garbage police.

71
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:13,039
I hate to bug you, but you're still not
separating your glass and your plastics.

72
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,877
The city passed
that ordinance, remember?

73
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,866
How I envy you...

74
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,750
Young, pretty,

75
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,731
able to crouch
for hours behind a bush,

76
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,760
waiting for a neighbor
to dump her trash.

77
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,055
Maybe you don't get
how easy it is to recycle.

78
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:31,140
I get it.
I just don't want to do it.

79
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,707
I've been throwing styrofoam into
the trash since before you were born,

80
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:38,731
and the sky is still blue
and the grass is still green.

81
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,484
Maybe now, but what will it be
like for our grandchildren?

82
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,956
My son is shooting blanks,
and my daughter likes the ladies.

83
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,448
Grandkids are
the least of my concerns.

84
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,742
So you don't care
about our planet at all?

85
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:52,073
By the time
it's a problem, I'll be long gone.

86
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:55,299
Let the cockroaches
and the robots fight over it.

87
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,424
What was that all about?

88
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,468
- What do you think?
- Come on.

89
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:10,494
One old crank
doesn't want to recycle.

90
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:13,725
You don't care about that stuff
anymore, remember?

91
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:17,356
- Of course I still care.
- Yeah, fine. You can care.

92
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,689
Don't be blowing our cover.

93
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,359
So what am I supposed to do? Stand
back and watch her defile our planet?

94
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,697
That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

95
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,678
"Sometimes you chain
yourself to the tree,

96
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,246
and sometimes you go after
the guy with the saw."

97
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:38,917
That's what Patrick used to say.

98
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:42,462
We don't talk about Patrick anymore.

99
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,927
- I'm just saying.
- So am I.

100
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:56,277
So the lawyer says
you sign right here,

101
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:59,520
and you are officially bought
out of the strip club business.

102
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,652
Let's hope I don't get
my share in singles.

103
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,563
And here's a little something
to remember us by.

104
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,965
"Lap dancing...
It's a grind."

105
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,369
I will be sure to wear this on the
next field trip I take with my students.

106
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,282
- Thanks, Jimbo.
- Good luck.

107
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:17,452
You, too.

108
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:21,102
- Bye, Mrs. D.
- Take care, Robin.

109
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:25,004
"Moby Dick"?

110
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:28,091
It's not what you think.
It's about a whale.

111
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:31,052
Yes, I know. It's a classic.

112
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:35,564
I saw an article about a hundred
books you should read before dying,

113
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:36,838
and I thought,

114
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:39,727
with all the high cholesterol
in my family, I better get crackin'.

115
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,230
Good for you.

116
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,233
So what are you gonna do now?

117
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,206
This was never really my job.

118
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,905
I'm actually a teacher.

119
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,430
Really?

120
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:54,283
That is so cool.

121
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:57,078
I thought about being a teacher.
I went a couple semesters,

122
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:59,471
but then my family had
some money problems, and,

123
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,791
nine years later,
I'm still wearing tassels.

124
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,129
Robin, you're being requested
in the VIP lounge.

125
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:18,702
- Good luck with those hundred books.
- Thank you.

126
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,424
Not this guy again.

127
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:25,777
I keep telling him to keep
the tips and buy himself a toothbrush.

128
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:28,823
Robin, wait.

129
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:33,990
You don't have to keep doing
this if it makes you unhappy.

130
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,827
I've got bills to pay, Mrs. Delfino.

131
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:40,158
I know, but you don't
have to work here.

132
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:41,831
You could do anything you want.

133
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:43,708
That's easy to say.

134
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,447
I mean it.

135
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,337
It is never too late
to change your life.

136
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,274
Robin, now.

137
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,897
Thank you.

138
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:05,007
You're taking that with you?

139
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:08,281
When customers get grabby, I like
to have something to whack'em with.

140
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,924
I almost killed a guy with
"War and peace".

141
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,051
So, I'm driving.

142
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,581
- This guys pulls out in front of me.
- Cuts him off.

143
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:24,622
- I was a little pissed.
- You were furious.

144
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:28,176
But at the stoplight, when I start to
tell the guy off, Tom lays over and says

145
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:31,177
"Sorry. No big deal.
She's just having a bad day."

146
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,387
You didn't have to
take the guy's head off.

147
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:36,557
- She flipped him the bird.
- I was sticking up for you!

148
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,672
Yes, but Tom was driving.
Whether he chose to ignore it

149
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:42,600
or try to run the man
of the road, it's his decision.

150
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:45,066
Let him be in the
driver's seat sometimes,

151
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,817
literally and figuratively.

152
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,600
Bringing the score to Tom 4
and controlling bitch 0.

153
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:58,741
There's no scoreboard
in this room. You know that.

154
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,165
I think you both did
some great work today.

155
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:05,289
- Next Tuesday, same time?
- Thanks, doctor.

156
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,606
It felt really great.

157
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:09,710
Yeah, great.

158
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:16,740
I always feel so much better
when we get out of there.

159
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,083
- I bet you do.
- Don't you?

160
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,639
I really think she got this working.

161
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,668
Yeah, I think she's got this working

162
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:26,602
and this is getting beat up.

163
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:30,388
- Don't feel like that.
- It's true. She always sides with you.

164
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:32,002
I want a second opinion.

165
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,444
Maybe we should think about
seeing another therapist.

166
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,904
When we started, you loved her.

167
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:39,165
Yeah, and when we started,
I loved you, too.

168
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:40,616
Things change. Let's go.

169
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,730
Hold on.

170
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,501
I think I left my keys.

171
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,627
I can't.
I have dress rehearsal tonight.

172
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,172
Talk to you later.

173
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:57,232
- I'm sorry. I forgot my keys.
- That's okay.

174
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:04,098
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
Did you say you had dress rehearsal?

175
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:08,394
That. Yes, I'm sort of in a little
play that runs this weekend.

176
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,521
Really?
You're an actor, too?

177
00:10:10,781 --> 00:10:12,562
I dabbled in college.

178
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:15,276
I have a bit of a gift,
so I try to keep it alive.

179
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:17,487
What's the play?
We'd love to come see it.

180
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,636
"Antony and Cleopatra." But it's
just a community production.

181
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:22,700
I would never force you
to sit through it.

182
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:27,693
- If you don't want us to come...
- Here's a flyer. Matinees are half-off.

183
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,001
I need Ana to watch the girls
while I run to the store

184
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,126
and big shock,
she's not answering her cell.

185
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,675
No problem. Come on in.

186
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,929
They're just up in Danny's room.

187
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:47,418
Gaby's here!

188
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:50,353
So they're in Danny's room?

189
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,444
They were listening to music, it was
so loud I made'em shut the door.

190
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:56,805
So they're by themselves...

191
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,009
with the door shut?

192
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:02,379
Just a couple of teenagers
alone with their genitals?

193
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,698
Get your ass down here!

194
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:10,581
What's the big deal? They're
just hanging out in Danny's room.

195
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:14,269
With a mattress. Why don't you crack
a bottle of champagne on Ana's pelvis

196
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,556
and wish Danny a bon voyage?

197
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:17,964
Ana! Now!

198
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:20,216
Hold on. I'm coming.

199
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,511
I'm sure she meant she's on her way.

200
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:26,430
What's going on?

201
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,724
I have to run.
I need you to watch the girls.

202
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:31,935
That's it? Jeez, I thought
the house was on fire.

203
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:33,652
Let me grab my stuff.

204
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,693
So...
you worried they might be doing it?

205
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:41,237
Yeah. What I don't get is
why you're not worried.

206
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:44,532
They're healthy, red-blooded kids.
They're gonna do what they're gonna do.

207
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,867
So we say nothing
and just fluff their pillows?

208
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,658
We make sure they don't
do anything stupid.

209
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:51,539
Have you gotten Ana birth control?

210
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,375
I make her spend time with Juanita and
Celia. I was hoping that would do it.

211
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:57,467
Come on, Gaby.

212
00:11:57,637 --> 00:12:00,214
You have to talk to her
about safe sex, condoms.

213
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:02,717
She's only 17.
She's too young!

214
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:05,761
How old were you
when you first did it?

215
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,063
Ana, hurry up!

216
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,110
Gotta hit the pharmacy, too!

217
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,253
I didn't hear you come in.

218
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:35,857
"Dearest Bree,
I will always love you,

219
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:39,300
"but the will to fight on has left me,
so I've chosen to...

220
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:43,049
exit life on my own terms."
Is this a suicide note?

221
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,510
It's really more
of a suicide rough draft.

222
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:52,374
I didn't mean for you
to find out this way. But,

223
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,941
now that you know,

224
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:58,261
- we can discuss it like adults.
- There is nothing to discuss.

225
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,651
This is obviously
the depression talking.

226
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:05,117
We will get you some medication.

227
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:09,874
There's no need for you
to feel badly about this.

228
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,447
I've had a good life.

229
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:13,999
Let me go.

230
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,364
I will do no such thing.

231
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,919
I forbid this. Do you hear me?
You will not be killing yourself.

232
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:23,511
I will remove every knife,
rope and pill from this house,

233
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,759
and if I have to, I will be
with you 24 hours a day.

234
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,132
Being bored to death
wasn't how I was planning to go, but,

235
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:34,245
we can try it your way.

236
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:43,546
I'll give you some time
to adjust to this.

237
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:45,363
But understand me.

238
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,679
It's going to happen.

239
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:05,339
- What's with the condoms?
- Calm down. They're not for you.

240
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,804
Just what every man wants
to hear from his wife.

241
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,142
So?

242
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:14,807
Okay, hear me out. You know
how Ana is dating Danny Bolen?

243
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:18,477
- I'm gonna kill him.
- We have to be realistic.

244
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,206
- With my bare hands.
- They're not gonna listen to reason.

245
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:22,901
And bury him under the porch.

246
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:24,679
What choice do we have?

247
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:27,281
They're two teenagers
who are getting seriously involved.

248
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:31,078
- Isn't it better to be safe than sorry?
- Its like giving them our blessing.

249
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,618
That's how I felt first, but like Angie
said, nature's gonna take its course.

250
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,881
Easy for her to say.
She's got the boy.

251
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:41,044
What if the condom breaks?
What if he forgets to put it on?

252
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,669
If he knocks Ana up,
who's gonna end up raising the kid?

253
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,724
God, that'd be awful.

254
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:50,384
Getting up for those 3:00 AM feedings
after you've worked all day?

255
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,803
Not me. You.

256
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:54,972
You'll end up
taking care of the baby.

257
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,310
You better convince her to keep her legs
crossed til she's outta this house.

258
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,770
Wait. How is this my problem?
She's your trampy niece.

259
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,506
Because if she gets pregnant,

260
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:06,149
I'll be in prison for killing
what's buried underneath the porch.

261
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,072
Mrs. D.!

262
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,366
I hope you don't mind
me just showing up, but

263
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,733
I thought about what you said,
and you were right.

264
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,107
It's never too late
to change your life, so,

265
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,500
- I quit Double D's.
- You did?

266
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,219
I was pretty scared at first, but now
I think it's the best thing I ever did.

267
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,506
That's great.

268
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:32,426
I never would've had the guts without
talking to you. You're my role model.

269
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:33,925
Really?

270
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:35,471
That's sweet.

271
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:39,051
My old role model was Candi,
down at the club, but she OD'd.

272
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,113
I will try to do Candi proud.

273
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,870
Good for you, Robin.

274
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,108
I know change
takes a lot of courage.

275
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,116
It sure does.

276
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,197
So what do I do now?

277
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:55,991
You know...

278
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:59,203
What's my next move?
Where do I work now?

279
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:00,974
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:03,707
You quit without having
anything else lined up?

281
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:07,202
I know it was a little hasty, but
you said I could do whatever I wanted.

282
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:09,468
You sounded so sure.
You're still sure, right?

283
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:13,366
I'm very sure.
The world is your oyster.

284
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,095
You have saved up, right?

285
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,768
She stripped for nine years
and didn't put anything away?

286
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:25,849
Apparently there was a boob job
and a bad relationship

287
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,609
and the rising cost of glitter.

288
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,839
- I have to find a way to help her.
- And why is this your responsibility?

289
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,862
Because I'm the one
that told her to quit.

290
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:37,302
I didn't think she'd listen.
No one listens to me.

291
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:40,160
I keep telling you how much
I hate that shirt, and there it is.

292
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,539
We'll help her.
What do you have in mind?

293
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:45,583
We need to find her a job.

294
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:48,638
What can she do?
Does she have skills

295
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,630
that don't involve picking up
a dollar without using her hands?

296
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:58,053
Why are you so sad?

297
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:04,727
I need a job,
and I don't have any skills.

298
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,573
You're so pretty.

299
00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:08,314
You could be a princess.

300
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:13,186
Look.

301
00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:15,339
MJ is so smitten with her.

302
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:16,780
He's a guy.

303
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,201
And she's good with kids.

304
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:24,460
That's it.

305
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:29,159
They've been looking for an assistant
art teacher down at the school.

306
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:31,474
She always wanted
to do something like that.

307
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,317
You think she can handle it?

308
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:36,800
We glue macaroni to shoeboxes.
It's not the hardest job in the world.

309
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:40,012
How come when I say that,
you give me that look?

310
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:43,870
And there it is again.

311
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:47,811
Thanks for cheering me up, MJ.
You're so sweet.

312
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:50,898
You can give me a bath
if you want to.

313
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,978
- You scared the crap out of me.
- Where's Orson?

314
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:08,477
- You're supposed to be watching him.
- Don't worry.

315
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:12,294
I stuck him in the laundry room
and put a broom through his spokes.

316
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,939
Can we please cross Roy off
the suicide watch list?

317
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,934
You're alive. My job's done here.

318
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,695
Where have you been? You were
supposed to be back an hour ago.

319
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:34,430
I am sorry, but I had to stop
and pick up our guests.

320
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,193
What guests?

321
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:42,295
Orson, meet Chris and Ron.

322
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,124
I know you won't listen to me,
but you might listen to them,

323
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,865
- since you have something in common.
- Really?

324
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,165
Are you Gilbert and
Sullivan fans, too?

325
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,293
Sense of humor.
That's very important.

326
00:18:53,553 --> 00:18:56,642
I know there's no reason to go
on living, because you're paralyzed...

327
00:18:56,812 --> 00:18:58,173
So you thought, "hey!"

328
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:01,135
"You know what might cheer him
up? Two more paralyzed guys."

329
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:03,429
Please. Just hear them out.

330
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,557
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to make some tea.

331
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,092
So your wife tells us
you in a pretty negative place.

332
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,906
- That's to be expected but eventually,
- I know you mean well,

333
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,899
but I don't need
a handicapped pep talk.

334
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,194
We're not handicapped.
We're handi-capable.

335
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,247
Oh, Lord!

336
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,241
We play basketball, dance,
we make love.

337
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,285
And I hope
you're very happy together.

338
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:29,668
I, unfortunately, don't have
someone to join me on this journey.

339
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:32,207
You have a wife
who clearly loves you.

340
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:36,837
Paralyzed and blind. You must always be
the first one to board the plane.

341
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:40,943
We know what you're going through.

342
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,599
A lot of us feel unloved after
something like this happens.

343
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,509
You don't understand.

344
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:48,576
My wife stays with me solely
out of obligation.

345
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:53,854
- How could you say such a thing?
- It's true, isn't it?

346
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:57,114
You feel guilty because
I never would've been hit by that plane

347
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,748
if I hadn't gotten in
a fist-fight with your lover.

348
00:20:00,294 --> 00:20:01,627
This is the thanks I get?

349
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:04,336
I have bent over backwards
to make your life easier.

350
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,803
I should just let you hang yourself.

351
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,787
Don't we have
a basketball game at 2:00?

352
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:11,887
Can you be honest for one moment?

353
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,165
You don't love me.

354
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:15,483
Yeah, we should go.

355
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:18,003
- Please stay. I've made tea.
- See?

356
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:21,131
You can't deny it.
Go ahead, Bree. Correct me.

357
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:22,716
Say you love me.

358
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,224
I...

359
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:34,103
care very deeply for you.

360
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:38,868
That's what I thought.

361
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,349
I'm feeling
a little upset right now.

362
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:48,697
Would you mind
rolling yourselves out?

363
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,880
Ana, let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

364
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,047
Why?

365
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:00,830
Well, Carlos and I
want you to be happy.

366
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:04,072
Over the last few months, we've come
to thing of you as our own daughter.

367
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,434
Really?

368
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:07,390
In fact, your uncle

369
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,305
thinks it's about time you
and I had that little talk...

370
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,312
about the birds and the bees.

371
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:16,024
That's how I feel,
so we're not gonna be doing that.

372
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,318
- Instead I'm gonna write you a check.
- A check?

373
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,370
A check big enough to cover one
whole year of modeling school...

374
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:29,120
and to rent a decent-size apartment...
in New York.

375
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,663
Okay, what's the catch?

376
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,584
That's so cute that
you think there's a catch.

377
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:36,460
- This isn't signed.
- That's the catch.

378
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,287
I will sign it once you graduate
high school without having had sex

379
00:21:40,454 --> 00:21:42,258
or more sex, as the case may be.

380
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,385
Are you serious?

381
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:48,973
Ana, I could talk to you about morality
or saving yourself for marriage

382
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,684
or statistics about STDs,

383
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,055
But I think you're the kind of girl

384
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:56,523
who responds to cold, hard cash.

385
00:21:57,697 --> 00:21:59,108
You know me well.

386
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:01,547
So do we hava deal?

387
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:04,647
Are you gonna be a successful
model with a nice apartment

388
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:06,532
or a teenage mom with no future?

389
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:08,268
Well...

390
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:11,537
When you put it like that...

391
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:13,047
Good girl.

392
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,210
And to answer your earlier question,

393
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:19,456
I'm now very happy.

394
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:26,134
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

395
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:28,494
Three hours of Shakespeare

396
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:31,515
for a woman who has to pee
every 20 minutes.

397
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:34,963
Dr. Graham's been so supportive of us.
Can't we be supportive of her?

398
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,880
This isn't about support.

399
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:40,400
This is about
little Tommy teacher's pet

400
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,944
wanting a gold star
for butt-kissing.

401
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,740
That's not true.

402
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:50,405
Nay, but this dotage...

403
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,003
Please.

404
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:56,727
You brought her a
40 dollar box of chocolates.

405
00:22:57,284 --> 00:23:00,211
Last mother's day, you threw me a bagel
and called it breakfast in bed.

406
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:03,218
Admit it. You just have
a problem with her

407
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:06,175
because you hate it when
someone points out your flaws.

408
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,096
That's not true. I can take
constructive criticism justine.

409
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:13,391
- You're being a little loud.
- Sorry.

410
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,602
See? I can take
constructive criticism.

411
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,153
- You're still talking.
- You're still annoying. Relax.

412
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,640
She's making her entrance.

413
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,819
Grates me... the sum.

414
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:30,783
Nay! Hear them, Antony!

415
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,845
Fluvia Perchance is angry.

416
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:39,757
Or... who knows?

417
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:42,651
If the beard...

418
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,515
If the scarce-bearded Caesar

419
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:50,428
hath not sent you
his powerful mandate...

420
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,624
"Do this or this.

421
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,202
Take in that kingdom
and enfranchise that.

422
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,469
Perform it.

423
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,626
Or else we damn thee."

424
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,330
How was the play?

425
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:15,037
Lincoln had a better time
at the theater.

426
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:18,372
Really? So how bad was it?

427
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:21,560
You remember how horrible your
second grade arbor day play was?

428
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,027
But at least we were drunk for that.

429
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:27,340
Honestly,
how did Dr. Graham get that part?

430
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,791
Is she sleeping with the director?

431
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,804
Sleeping with, bathing, donating
a kidney... It's still not enough.

432
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:38,143
I just hope that I can erase this
from my memory before our next session.

433
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:41,646
Are you kidding?
We're not seeing her again.

434
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:43,338
Why not?

435
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:45,733
We're not going
to continue to take life lessons

436
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,986
from a woman who burped
during her death scene.

437
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,782
That has nothing to do
with her skills as a therapist.

438
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:56,702
Really? Did she not tell you
she has a "gift" for acting?

439
00:24:57,976 --> 00:24:59,972
Well, I can't trust
the judgment of someone

440
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:03,042
with absolutely no self-awareness.
We're not going back.

441
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,483
This is an excuse.
You have been looking

442
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,976
for a reason to dump her
ever since our last session.

443
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,336
Tom, I learned two things tonight...

444
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:14,319
Dr. Graham has no insight
into real human behavior, and,

445
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:17,473
there are 428 tiles
on the ceiling of that theater.

446
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:21,352
Say what you want.
We are going to our next session.

447
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:25,121
And, by the way,

448
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:27,214
It was 429.

449
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:41,238
Robin Gallagher, teaching assistant,
reporting for duty.

450
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,543
- Look at you!
- I wanted to look professional.

451
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,254
Do you like the glasses?
I don't even need them.

452
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,054
You look great.
That's a beautiful suit.

453
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:52,970
Thanks. It is so nice
to wear work clothes

454
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:55,262
that don't rip away
to reveal crotchless panties.

455
00:25:55,984 --> 00:25:58,284
Yeah, you're preaching to the choir.

456
00:25:58,568 --> 00:26:00,765
So, I'm just gonna get
the kids started painting.

457
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:03,437
And why don't you hang those
globes that we made last week?

458
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:10,995
Can I say something?

459
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:17,108
You really took a chance on me. No one's
ever done that for me before, so,

460
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,285
thank you.

461
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:20,882
You're welcome.

462
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:23,364
I'm really glad you're here.

463
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,573
Careful.
Never let the kids see you cry.

464
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,796
If they sense weakness, you're done.

465
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:34,087
Sorry we're late.
Forgot his backpack.

466
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:38,004
That's okay, Mr. Linwood. Come on,
Kyle. Let's get you painting.

467
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,990
Who's that?

468
00:26:41,491 --> 00:26:44,074
That's my new teaching
assistant, Miss Gallagher.

469
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:47,141
No, Bobby. That's not
how we use pipe cleaners!

470
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:51,818
I'm sorry.
Do we know each other?

471
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,779
I don't think so.

472
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:57,491
Are you sure?
You look so familiar.

473
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,241
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

474
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:09,211
What did you want to see me about?

475
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:13,316
You are aware, aren't you,
that as a private school,

476
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:16,261
we depend on the financial
support of our more

477
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,261
affluent parent donors?

478
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:19,971
I am aware of that.

479
00:27:21,077 --> 00:27:22,077
Good.

480
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:25,929
Because I just got a call
from Kyle Linwood's father,

481
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:27,395
a major donor.

482
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,418
Is it true that your assistant

483
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:34,527
can break a 5 dollars
by shaking out her underwear?

484
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:45,580
- I don't want to take a bath!
- Well, that's too bad.

485
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:49,217
It's time to give the Earth
back some of its dirt. Go!

486
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:53,421
I'm gonna be upstairs for a bit.
What are you guys up to tonight?

487
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,590
We're just gonna stay home
and study.

488
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:57,968
Good girl.

489
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:10,814
Why are you getting me all worked up?
I thought you made your aunt a promise.

490
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,193
I promised her I wouldn't have sex.
I didn't promise you wouldn't.

491
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,926
Fine! I'll sort it myself!

492
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:09,065
- Don't freak out, okay?
- What the hell are you doing?

493
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,767
- I'm sorry. This won't happen again.
- It's no big deal.

494
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:14,295
You think you can come into
my house and do this?!

495
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,462
<i>Answer me!</i>

496
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,133
Answer me! Answer me!

497
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:25,771
I catch you near her again,
I will kick your ass, boy.

498
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,138
Let go of him!

499
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,954
You know what I caught
your son doing in my house?

500
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,078
- I don't care.
- Carlos, what is going on?!

501
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:33,445
I said let go!

502
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,332
Angie, what the hell?!

503
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,112
- Wait for me outside.
- Ma, please don't.

504
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,362
Outside!

505
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:53,708
Look, I came in and
found him on top of her.

506
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,087
I don't care. He's my kid.
You ever touch him again, you're dead.

507
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:11,101
I see you tried to separate
my glass and plastic.

508
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:17,232
Suck it, Earth!

509
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,180
Come on, ma. Let's go.

510
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:40,032
So maybe you shouldn't just think
about what you want to say

511
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:43,049
But about how you say it,
so Tom can hear you.

512
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:50,151
That's... a theory.

513
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:53,143
Is something bothering you?

514
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,395
It's the pregnancy.

515
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:59,595
This morning she got mad at me
over the way I drank my orange juice.

516
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:01,407
Is that all?

517
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,779
You know you're in a safe place here.
We can tell each other anything.

518
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,580
Since this is a safe place...

519
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:18,209
Tom and I saw your play
the other night.

520
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:22,213
You did? Well, why didn't you
come backstage and say hello?

521
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,863
Well, the truth is, I didn't
know what to say, because...

522
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,261
I didn't really like it.

523
00:31:30,331 --> 00:31:31,331
I know.

524
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,580
Our Antony was dreadful.

525
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:36,686
You weren't the only one
who thought so.

526
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:40,756
Actually, I was talking about you.
You were...

527
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:43,806
really not very good,

528
00:31:43,973 --> 00:31:46,863
and now I've sort of lost confidence
in you as a therapist.

529
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:54,245
Do you want to elaborate?

530
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,081
No. I think I said
what I needed to say.

531
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:02,919
See, this is the same thing
in your marriage.

532
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:06,034
You criticize Tom,
but you won't be specific. It's...

533
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:07,926
sort of the coward's way out.

534
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:10,899
Coward?

535
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:16,457
You sucked.

536
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:18,686
You were really, really bad.

537
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:20,480
Three words...

538
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,792
Stink, stank, stunk.

539
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:24,807
Specific enough?

540
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:32,242
Good for you, Lynette.
I commend you for your honesty.

541
00:32:35,482 --> 00:32:38,629
Although, the <i>Fairview Herald</i>
had a different take.

542
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:41,584
They found my Cleopatra
"incandescent."

543
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:47,006
You actually believe that? See,
this is why we can't see her anymore.

544
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:51,427
You haven't weighed in yet.
What did you think?

545
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:01,086
I thought you were great.

546
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:03,012
What? Liar!

547
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,192
You said you've seen seals
playing horns that put on a better show.

548
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,652
There's no need to bully him
into agreeing with you.

549
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,656
I wouldn't have to bully him
if he would man up for once.

550
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,241
You're attacking.

551
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,612
Of course. Because I'm always
the bad cop, he's always the good cop.

552
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:18,580
Could you just once
not be such a wuss?

553
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,270
Damn right I'm the good cop.
Someone has to be,

554
00:33:21,437 --> 00:33:23,821
because
bad cop-bad cop doesn't work.

555
00:33:23,988 --> 00:33:26,713
I grew up in that house,
and it doesn't work.

556
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,522
That is not it.
You like me being the bad guy.

557
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:33,884
That way you can always be
the good guy. But guess what?

558
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:36,723
I'd love to be the good guy
once in a while, but I can't,

559
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,178
because when things get hard or
a difficult decision has to get made,

560
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:43,236
You run from confrontation,
and if I don't

561
00:33:43,403 --> 00:33:46,032
step into the void,
things grind to a halt.

562
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:49,402
Because I got news for you...
Good cop-good cop doesn't work either!

563
00:33:56,573 --> 00:33:57,702
You're right.

564
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:01,497
Really?

565
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:05,668
I like to be liked,
and because of that,

566
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:08,576
A lot of the ugly stuff
I defer to you.

567
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:11,299
And I'm sorry.

568
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:18,222
Your performance was
aggressively bad.

569
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:20,855
At one point during the second act,

570
00:34:21,022 --> 00:34:23,811
I started to choke on a mint
and thought about not fighting it.

571
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,691
Thank you.

572
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,771
Well, this was quite a breakthrough.

573
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:35,237
And you're right.

574
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:39,202
You're a wonderful therapist.

575
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:41,759
Thank you, Lynette.

576
00:34:42,132 --> 00:34:45,082
Now, both of you, get
the hell out of my office.

577
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,594
So we catch her son
on top of our niece,

578
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:53,894
- and we have to apologize?
- No, we have to apologize

579
00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:56,500
because you almost put
her son's head through a wall.

580
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:59,817
When are you gonna learn
violence is not the answer?

581
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:05,936
<i>I shouldn't have to tell you this!
You know better!</i>

582
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,606
<i>We've been doing it for 19 years.
You're smarter than this!</i>

583
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,195
<i>This is not the first time
we've had this conversation.</i>

584
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:13,923
<i>I feel like I'm talking
to a wall here, huh?</i>

585
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:16,036
What is going on here?

586
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:17,782
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?!</i>

587
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,450
He's ripping Danny a new one.

588
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,579
<i>- Damn it! Angie!
- Okay, Nick, just leave me</i>

589
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:26,790
- alone!
- No... You are getting sloppy.

590
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:29,488
- We should go.
- Yeah, we should.

591
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:32,922
<i>First you get into it with that
crazy lady about her recycling,</i>

592
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,256
which I told you not to do.
<i>And then guess what?</i>

593
00:35:35,423 --> 00:35:38,210
<i> She comes over this morning
and she's thinking about suing us.</i>

594
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:40,096
<i>- I lost my cool.
- Get it back!</i>

595
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,515
Cause this rock we are hiding under

596
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:46,060
is not that big, and if people
start poking around, we're done.

597
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,067
And then, bam! He fires her
for something she used to do.

598
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,987
It's so hypocritical. I mean,

599
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,199
why not get mad at the kid's father?

600
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,783
He obviously goes to Double D's.

601
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:05,449
I just hope I didn't get you into
any trouble, Mrs. D. I feel awful.

602
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,556
No. This is not your fault.

603
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:10,874
When I'm sad,
my mom gives me a big hug.

604
00:36:11,554 --> 00:36:12,654
Down, Tiger.

605
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,338
What am I gonna do?
I have no money for rent.

606
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:17,447
I'm just gonna end up homeless.

607
00:36:17,614 --> 00:36:20,552
You know, maybe I should go
and beg for my old job back.

608
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:24,454
No. You can't do that.
Quitting that place took a lot of guts.

609
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,308
How do you feel about
letting her move in here?

610
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:35,410
Julie's gone. We have her empty room.
It's just until she gets on her feet.

611
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:38,570
You're asking if I'm okay
with letting a stripper live with us?

612
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:40,515
- I'm gonna go with no.
- Why not?

613
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:43,221
I have no idea. I'm just really
sure this is a trick question.

614
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:46,266
She's a nice girl, and she's in trouble.
You know, I think of myself

615
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:49,006
as a good person
who cares about others, and,

616
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,837
how often do I actually
get to walk the walk?

617
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:54,854
This is an opportunity
to really help someone.

618
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:56,467
I want to do it.

619
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:05,347
Okay, let's go make ex-stripper
and a little boy very happy.

620
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,770
What's this for?

621
00:37:12,594 --> 00:37:15,398
The Lackeys' 50th anniversary party.
Don't you remember?

622
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,034
I'm sorry. I thought
I'd be dead by now,

623
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:21,124
so I wasn't paying much attention
to our social calendar.

624
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,260
Well, regardless, you're going.

625
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:26,940
And if you're still around next Saturday
we've got brunch with my family.

626
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:30,428
Well, now you're just daring me.

627
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:39,212
Walter is about to make a toast.

628
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,820
Don't you want to hear it?

629
00:37:41,987 --> 00:37:44,537
A speech about the joys
of wedded bliss?

630
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Pass.

631
00:37:54,002 --> 00:37:56,445
Walter and Shirley are about
to dance to a song

632
00:37:56,612 --> 00:37:58,942
that was played at their wedding.
But before they do,

633
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,930
Walter would like
to say a few words.

634
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,840
I want to thank you all for coming.

635
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:08,034
50 years...
Would it hardly seems possible.

636
00:38:08,812 --> 00:38:12,488
And now I'm not gonna lie to you
and say it's always been easy.

637
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:15,056
I mean, we've had
our share of tragedy and

638
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:18,323
we've said a few things
we wish we could take back.

639
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,305
But for the most part,
we've been lucky,

640
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:23,717
because no matter how old we get,

641
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,784
we've always been able to remember

642
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:29,351
what made us fall in love
in the first place, right, hon?

643
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:12,725
Stop!

644
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,675
Don't you dare throw yourself
in that pool!

645
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:19,043
I want to die.
Why can't you let me?

646
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:21,245
Because I want this, too.

647
00:39:21,412 --> 00:39:24,069
I want a party like this someday
to celebrate our life together.

648
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,821
What is there about
our life to celebrate?

649
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,407
Look at Walter and Shirley in there.

650
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,285
I was watching them dance
with such passion in their eyes,

651
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,616
but I know they haven't
always been like that.

652
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:37,208
They've had their rough times,
too, but they stuck it out.

653
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,158
Because they're in love.

654
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,712
I asked you if you loved me,
and you couldn't answer.

655
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,067
Fine. I'll answer you now.

656
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,369
I loved you once.

657
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:52,915
Can I love you again?

658
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:55,476
I don't know.

659
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,770
But I...

660
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:02,148
would like to recapture
whatonce had.

661
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,340
And how can we do that
if you're not here?

662
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,685
So... I'm asking you...

663
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,230
Please stay.

664
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:41,247
<i>In this never-ending
drama we call life,</i>

665
00:40:41,414 --> 00:40:43,524
<i>everyone has a part to play.</i>

666
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:50,057
<i>Some are cast as romantic leads.</i>

667
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:54,934
<i>Others end up being the victim.</i>

668
00:40:57,051 --> 00:41:00,740
<i>And a few always
provide comic relief.</i>

669
00:41:02,313 --> 00:41:03,501
<i>And then</i>

670
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:06,605
<i>there are those
who end up playing the hero...</i>

671
