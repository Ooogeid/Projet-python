1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,170
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,760
A tragic event...

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,329
Led to the end of a marriage...

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,089
He's dating a friend of mine.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,770
And the pain of moving on.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,989
Medical wonders were promises...

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,619
If we remove that bone fragment, you could regain your sight.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,399
Both large and small.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,489
My husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested.

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,619
Oh, the one to alleviate his snoring? Detectives...

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,759
And a devastating lie was told.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,689
The night of the fire, I saw somebody come out

13
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,890
His name is porter scavo.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,739
One morning, it occurred to lynette scavo

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,359
She could not remember

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,140
The last time her family had breakfast together.

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,410
So lynette did

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,629
What any mother would do

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,790
In that situation...

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,980
See ya later, mom.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,129
The first person who steps foot out that door will lose a leg.

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,990
She threatened her family with violence.

23
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,539
That was delicious.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,719
But I did promise chrissy I'd walk her to school today.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,349
Oh, you are such a gentleman. Sit your ass down.

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,340
Dad, make mom let me go.

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,829
Everyone at this table who thinks I have the power

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,640
To make your mom do anything, raise your hand.

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,210
Wish I could have helped.

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,339
Look, this family has been through a lot lately,

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,559
And your dad and I feel we'll be better parents

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,820
If we know what's going on in your lives.

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,120
So, parker, how's that science project you've been working on?

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,439
Hey. Can I help you?

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,809
Is this the residence of porter scavo?

36
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,429
Yeah. Why? I'm porter scavo.

37
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,799
Sir, can you step outside? Can you step outside?

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,909
Porter scavo, you are under arrest. What?

39
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,299
You have the right to remain silent. Wait. What's going on?

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,009
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to step back. Okay,

41
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,919
Guys. Look, if this is about warren schilling's bar

42
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,389
Porter had nothing to do with that fire.

43
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,739
Apparently, there's a witness that says otherwise

44
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,410
A witness? I-- now will you please step back and let us do our job?

45
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,399
If you give up that right,

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,159
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,099
A witness? What are they talking about?

48
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,739
It's gonna be okay. We'll call a lawyer.

49
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,680
We'll get through this.

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,819
Lynette scavo couldn't remember

51
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,419
The last time her family had breakfast together...

52
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,500
I guess we're done talking about my science project, huh?

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,529
Yes, sweetie, we are.

54
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,399
And she couldn't know

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,409
It would be many years

56
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,930
Before her family would have breakfast together again.

57
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,229
It's an awful thing to live in the dark,

58
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,029
Unable to see what others take for granted.

59
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,229
But sometimes for a lucky few,

60
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,509
A flicker of light pierces that darkness

61
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,410
And brings with it the promise of better days to come.

62
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,720
Do you see anything?

63
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,240
I see light...

64
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,320
And some fuzzy shapes.

65
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,479
That's it?

66
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,989
That's all he can expect to see right now,

67
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,899
But if he's able to see that much,

68
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,419
It won't be long till his full sight returns. Can you see me, babe?

69
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,779
Just your silhouette. I can tell you cut your hair short.

70
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,360
It kinda makes your ears stick out, but I like it.

71
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,599
Carlos, that's the doctor. I'm right here.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,969
It doesn't matter.

73
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,060
I can see something other than nothing.

74
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,610
Oh, this is a good day. Oh.

75
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,099
Now remember,

76
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,119
His eyes will be very sensitive for the next few weeks,

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,989
So low light indoors, dark glasses outside--

78
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,809
Uh, doctor, we are very grateful,

79
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,810
So don't take this the wrong way, but...

80
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,489
Well, your septum looks great, and you say your snoring's gone.

81
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,999
I think we're in good shape.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,320
Will we need to come in for a follow-up? No. I think we're done.

83
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,639
You know, I always tell my patients I'm gonna miss them,

84
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,469
But this time, I really mean it. Oh,

85
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,380
We feel the same way about you. You've been lovely

86
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,800
Ah. Please excuse me.

87
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,999
What are you doing?

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,859
Leaving the man a thank-you card.

89
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,829
For a doctor?

90
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,349
He helped you through a very difficult time.

91
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,080
The least we can do is let him know how much we appreciate...

92
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,390
What the hell is this?

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,029
You're living with the man? Since when?

94
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,889
Um, alex moved in six months ago.

95
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,599
Why the secrecy? Did you think I'd disapprove?

96
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,489
The man's a doctor, for heaven sakes.

97
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,139
You've done better than I did.

98
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,809
That was a bit of a drive-by. I'm just trying to understand

99
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,650
How my son could keep a secret like this from his own mother.

100
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,679
Mom, uh, come on. I mean, since I came out,

101
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,179
You haven't shown the slightest interest in my love life.

102
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,239
Of course I have. Handing me a pamphlet on the resurgence of gonorrhea?

103
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,100
That's not what I'm talking about.

104
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,089
Think about it.

105
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,180
Have you even once asked if I was dating someone?

106
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,779
You see? You didn't really want to know.

107
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,520
That's why I didn't tell you.

108
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,289
Well, I want to know now, so that's why I'm having

109
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,379
You and alex over to dinner tomorrow night.

110
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,509
What? Yes. If he's a part of your life, I want to get to know him.

111
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,959
I think I'll serve fish.

112
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,629
Actually, I said it wrong. Um, i-i think it's kind of cool

113
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,049
The way that you ignore my love life.

114
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,269
Nice try. Tell alex we dress for dinner. Mom, please don't.

115
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,519
Andrew, you can't criticize my parenting

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,250
And then deny me the chance to make up for it.

117
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,960
Orson and I will expect you at 8:00.

118
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,300
Okay.

119
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,059
Are you sure you want me there, too?

120
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,589
I mean, after all, I'm only a dentist.

121
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,790
Oh, for god sakes, orson. Let it go.

122
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,140
M.J., hurry up. Your dad's here.

123
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,339
Hey, katherine. What are you doing here?

124
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,139
Well, I'm a big zoo fan,

125
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,909
And when mike said he was taking m.J.,

126
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,219
I asked if I could tag along. So is that okay?

127
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,139
Of course. Why wouldn't it be okay?

128
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,710
I think it's...

129
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,320
Great.

130
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,370
Really, really great.

131
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,899
Sweetie, good news.

132
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,069
Katherine's gonna go to the zoo with you.

133
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,490
Why does she have to go?

134
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,239
Well, she and your daddy are friends,

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,930
And the more, the merrier. I just want daddy.

136
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,359
Oh, you got me, pal. Hey, we're all gonna have a great time,

137
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,399
And we'll show katherine

138
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,660
That funny swing the monkey goes on.

139
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,140
Oh, that sounds so cool. Will you show me that?

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,869
I guess.

141
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,900
Okay. Let's go.

142
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, don't forget his coat.

143
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,949
I'll find some way to get him to like me.

144
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,470
I'm sure you will.

145
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,280
Boy, I'll bet the gift shop at the zoo just loves divorce.

146
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,709
So... How you doing, son?

147
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,310
Not so good.

148
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,489
Okay, well, don't worry.

149
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,189
Bob here has agreed to represent you.

150
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,769
And when we're done here, I'm going to go to the d.A

151
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,219
And we're going to start talking about bail.

152
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,909
But first, I gotta ask you a few questions.

153
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,219
Like why do the police have a witness? Lynette.

154
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,309
The d.A. Says you were spotted coming out of the storage room

155
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,699
Right before the fire started. What gives?

156
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,709
I don't know what they're talking about. I have an alibi.

157
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,459
Oh. You do? G-great. Great.

158
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,619
Whoa. Why haven't you told anyone this?

159
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,120
It's just... So embarrassing.

160
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,289
You are up for manslaughter,

161
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,699
And you're worried about being embarrassed?

162
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,969
If we can verify your story,

163
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,579
I can probably get the charges dropped.

164
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,330
We wouldn't even need bail. So where were you? I was at edie britt's.

165
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,279
Oh, please.

166
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,269
Tell me you're not having sex with her, too.

167
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,129
Dad.

168
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,829
What is wrong with girls your own age?

169
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,170
Do you know what I would give to date a 17-year-old?

170
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,119
Okay, we're gonna talk about that later.

171
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,229
You were saying? I'm not having sex with edie.

172
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,740
After I left the club, I went to her house,

173
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,360
But only so I could break in and steal her gun.

174
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,849
Why would you do that?

175
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,330
Mr. Schilling beat up anne and then humiliated me.

176
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,889
I wanted to s-scare the hell out of him

177
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,489
Just to wipe that smug look off his face.

178
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,979
But when I got back to the club, it was on fire,

179
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,519
So I went home

180
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,480
And hid the gun in mom's flour jar.

181
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,410
Anywaythat's my alibi.

182
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,280
Think that'll help?

183
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,279
Did anyone see you do this?

184
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,740
No.

185
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,749
Then this is really not an alibi.

186
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,230
It's more a confession to another crime.

187
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,409
Well, you missed it.

188
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,479
Missed what?

189
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,560
Porter scavo got arrested today. I knew he set that fire.

190
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,689
Poor lynette. "poor lynette," my ass.

191
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,860
Poor seven people who got burned to death.

192
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,839
Boy.

193
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,140
I wouldn't wanna be in lynette's shoes right now.

194
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,810
Can you imagine what she's going through?

195
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,789
I mean, he is her son,

196
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,240
So she's kind of responsible.

197
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,850
God, the guilt she must be feeling.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,190
Dave, what the hell?

199
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,660
You-you're bleeding.

200
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,480
Okay, come on. In the house. Let's get this cleaned up.

201
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,360
Come here.

202
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,309
You're just gonna sneak it back into edie's house?

203
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,419
What, are you crazy? Tom, if you're gonna freak out,

204
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,869
Can you do that in the other room? I'm kind of busy here.

205
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,029
What has happened to us? I mean, w-we're posting bail,

206
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,419
Returning stolen guns-- when did this become our life?

207
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,869
If edie reports this gun missing,

208
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,759
You don't have to be the sharpest cop on the force

209
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,169
To figure out where to start looking,

210
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,620
And that's the last thing we need right now.

211
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,510
Thank god for you, lynette.

212
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,370
You always know what to do in a crisis. Well, I try.

213
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,979
You're my rock. Lynette. You know that, don't you?

214
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,579
Tom, your rock is trying to get fingerprints off a weapon.

215
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,410
You mind?

216
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,960
Thanks.

217
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,470
You're home kind of early. Is everything okay?

218
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,099
Go up to your room. I'll come in in a minute.

219
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,690
We'll talk about what happened.

220
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,329
What did happen?

221
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,290
Well, m.J. Threw his hot fudge sundae at katherine.

222
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,640
Seriously?

223
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,219
That's terrible. Is she okay?

224
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,279
Well, she's got nuts

225
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,519
And whipped cream all in her hair,

226
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,780
And that little plastic coconut bowl scratched her forehead.

227
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,099
Susan.

228
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,509
I'sorry. The--the image in my mind is

229
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,379
Probably way funnier than what actually happened.

230
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,999
Why did m.J. Do that?

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,389
I don't know. Katherine and I were talking

232
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,049
About spending christmas in bermuda,

233
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,209
And she said she didn't want to go,

234
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,869
'cause she thinks she doesn't look good in a bathing suit,

235
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,859
And I said she could be

236
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,359
On the cover of "sports illustrated,"

237
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,129
And bam! M.J. Throws his dessert. That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

238
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,459
Well, he is only 5. No, I'm talking about that line you fed her.

239
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,350
"sports illustrated"?

240
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,170
What's the issue about, the senior olympics?

241
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,380
I'm going to talk to m.J.

242
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,439
I mean, I could see her

243
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,510
On the cover of "menopause monthly."

244
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,869
Everything is still a little blurry.

245
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,009
I can only make out, like, shapes and shadows.

246
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,069
But in a week or so, everything should be clear as a bell.

247
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,549
Wow. The whole thing's like a miracle.

248
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,949
And gaby h been so patient through all of this.

249
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,049
She's really been an angel.

250
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,810
Damn it, carlos. What are you, a ron?

251
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,549
Ah, I hear a little voice from heaven now.

252
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,559
Why aren't you wearing your blackout glasses?

253
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,929
The doctor says your eyes can't be exposed to any light.

254
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,320
I can only handle my husband going blind once per marriage.

255
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,109
Whoops. Was that my baseball?

256
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,150
Yeah. I got it. What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

257
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,779
Uh, yeah. It's... Round.

258
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,830
Look at it. It was signed by lou gehrig.

259
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,899
Oh, looky there.

260
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,239
Lou gehrig. Wow.

261
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,439
It was a gift passed down from my grandfather to my father

262
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,739
Then to me. It was? I didn't know that.

263
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,679
I thought it was some stupid collectors item.

264
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,359
No. That's why I wouldn't let you sell it

265
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,430
When we were low on cash.

266
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,309
Uh, carlos, I think it's time to put your eyedrops in.

267
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,999
Why don't you go do that?

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,860
Excuse me, ladies.

269
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,419
Oh, don't look at me that way. I did what I had to do.

270
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,559
Gaby, you never sell a man's autographed baseball.

271
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,739
The car needed tires.

272
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,979
How was I supposed to know he was gonna get his sight back?

273
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,729
I mean, of all the rotten luck. Who did you sell the ball to?

274
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,310
I don't know. Some italian guy.

275
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,249
Hey, mike's into baseball.

276
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,659
He must know someone who can track down this lou gehrig guy

277
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,570
And get him to sign a new one.

278
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,010
What?

279
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,730
It's okay.

280
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,159
What's going on? Is there news? The judge just set bail.

281
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,899
Oh, thank god. How much? $20,000.

282
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,349
That's high. Where are we gonna get that kind of money?

283
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,389
I guess we'll have to tap our emergency fund.

284
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,669
We've got 14 grand in there.

285
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,929
We've got another 800 more in the christmas club.

286
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,130
Look, we'll scrape it together.

287
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,219
Oh, god. G--i gotta get to the restaurant.

288
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,279
Lynette, can you go to the bank and take care of that? Oh, sure.

289
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,860
Okay. Good. Thank you. Yeah.

290
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,959
Okay, well, I'll notify the judge

291
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,499
That you intend to post bail. Wait. Slow down.

292
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,699
What? You're my lawyer,

293
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,599
So anything I tell you is in confidence, right?

294
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,469
Well, technically, I'm porter's lawyer, so don't--

295
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,419
Just go with me on this. There is no emergency fund.

296
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,839
I gave that mone to anne schilling

297
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,230
So she'd leave town, and tom has no idea.

298
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,189
Okay, just so I have this straight,

299
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,089
You paid off a potential witness to get her to flee?

300
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,489
Hey. Whose lawyer are you anyway?

301
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,929
Again, I'm porter's--

302
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,200
What am I supposed to do? Where am I gonna get that bail money?

303
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,159
You could go to a bail bondsman, put up the house as collateral.

304
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,920
No. The house is mortgaged to the teeth.

305
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,590
Well, there is the restaurant.

306
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,080
I guess I have no other choice.

307
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,829
But again, this is all in the strictest confidence.

308
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,510
Remember, you are my lawyer, not tom's.

309
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,719
Actually, lynette, I'm--

310
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,230
Shut up!

311
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,159
So you see it belongs to my husband's grandfather,

312
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,999
And if I don't get it back,

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,470
I am telling you, I'm gonna be in the crapper.

314
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,999
(Speaking Italian)

315
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,940
...Crapper.

316
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
Speaking Italian

317
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,239
Speaking Italian

318
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,179
What does that mean?

319
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,129
...Means "no way." I'm sorry.

320
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,340
Oh, please. This is important.

321
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,160
Speaking Italian

322
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,189
Speaking Italian

323
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,880
Speaking Italian

324
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,749
Speaking Italian

325
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,820
Va bene. Va bene.

326
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,760
What? What's he saying?

327
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,620
He'd like to watch you dance...

328
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,620
What?

329
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,760
On the table.

330
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,299
Yeah, you know what?

331
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,739
I'm gonna have to call a big, fat...

332
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,440
On that one.

333
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,319
Oh. Hi, lynette. Hey.

334
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,559
So sorry about porter.

335
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,999
If there's anything that we can do... Well,

336
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,419
Actually, I wanted to borrow edie's yellow sweate

337
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,000
For the, uh, arraignment.

338
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,829
Sorry. Edie's not here.

339
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,660
Well, is it okay if I go up and get it?

340
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,349
Sure. Go ahead.

341
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,710
Thanks.

342
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,470
Please. You have to leave.

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,560
This isn't a good time, okay?

344
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,600
Fine. I'll--i'll come see you tomorrow.

345
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,269
Just know that I still love you,

346
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,450
And that'll never change.

347
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,569
Well, let me start by saying, it's so nice to see you

348
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,749
In a social setting, dr. Cominis.

349
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,169
Oh, please. I insist you call me alex now.

350
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,140
All right then, alex.

351
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,119
Oh, look at you two, sitting so far apart.

352
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,700
Scootch over.

353
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,699
Uh, mom, w-we--we don't need to scootch.

354
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,959
Well, I just want you to know, if you need to scootch, alex,

355
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,150
I am okay with scootching and...

356
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,180
The rest of it.

357
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,889
Uh, look, mom, as much as we appreciate your tolerance,

358
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,010
Uh, we can wait until we get home to make out.

359
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,959
Well, I just want you boys to know

360
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,549
That I am comfortable with your lifestyle.

361
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,020
Now who would like a strawberry daiquiri?

362
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,929
Are--are you expecting someone?

363
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,349
Well, orson and I thought it would be nice

364
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,630
To share this special occasion with some dear friends.

365
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,469
Bob and lee? What, are you sponsoring a float?

366
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,709
Bree, you handle the introductions,

367
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,009
And I will check on dinner.

368
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,179
Bob hunter, lee mcdermott, I would like you to meet

369
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,289
Andrew's new life partner, dr. Alex cominis.

370
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,789
Hi. Ooh. A doctor.

371
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,969
He's a plastic surgeon. Mm-hmm. You hear that, bob?

372
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,990
I like my eyes the way they are. You're so touchy. Hi.

373
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,370
Have we met?

374
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,759
Not that I recall.

375
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,199
No, we have. I-i can't think where, though.

376
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,749
I hear the gym is a popular meeting place.

377
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,560
No, it's not that. Oh!

378
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,790
My mistake. I must--i must have you confused with someone else.

379
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,219
Dinner's ready.

380
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,630
Shall we?

381
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,419
Not so fast. Do you know that guy?

382
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,640
Yes.

383
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,420
Oh, my god. You're right. It is him. Mm-hmm.

384
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,470
Carlos, what's wrong?

385
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,489
Gaby, I can see them.

386
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,039
What?! I can make out colors and shapes.

387
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,749
Everything's starting to come into focus.

388
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,780
Oh, my god. That's wonderful! Oh!

389
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,269
Look at all my girls.

390
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,089
Oh, you're right. She does look like mama.

391
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,979
Oh, I told you. Daddy, now you can watch me dance.

392
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,029
I know. I can't wait. Oh, it's amazing.

393
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,479
I can make out almost everything--

394
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,060
The fireplace, our dining table.

395
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,790
Where's the painting that we bought in greece?

396
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,099
Oh. I had to sell it a few months ago

397
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,669
So I could make the mortgage. I'm sorry.

398
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,989
Mm. I don't care about things. I can see my family.

399
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,489
That's what's important.

400
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,910
Really? That makes me feel so much better.

401
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,509
You wouldn't believe all the stupid things

402
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,869
I've been worried about. Like what?

403
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,239
Oh, it's silly. I sold that baseball of yours.

404
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,210
But you're right. You can see, and that's all that matters.

405
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,090
You sold my lou gehrig baseball?

406
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,709
Yeah, but it's just a thing. We don't care about things.

407
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,679
Right, right. But it was my father's

408
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,039
And his father's before him.

409
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,580
Yeah, and I know that now, but...

410
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,690
Juanita, dance for your dad.

411
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,929
Juanita, actually, why don't you take your sister

412
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,009
And, uh, go to the kitchen and get some cookies?

413
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,990
I'll be there in a minute.

414
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,389
This is a very special day for all of us,

415
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,729
So I'm not gonna get mad.

416
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,999
Uh, I'm just gonna say that I don't know

417
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,129
What was going through that featherhead of yours,

418
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,719
But I want that baseball back. Got it?

419
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,399
Hey, this featherhead kept this family afloat for five years.

420
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,749
You have no idea what I had to do

421
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,889
To keep this roof over our heads. Look,

422
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,939
There were two things that I asked you not to sell-

423
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,439
My baseball and my watch. I didn't sell your watch.

424
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,339
Only because you couldn't get it off my wrist, you little thief.

425
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,999
Gaby, you lied.

426
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,920
I want that baseball back, and you're gonna get it.

427
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,579
And you might want to lower the middle finger.

428
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,940
I can see now, remember?

429
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,860
Right. Damn.

430
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,839
Bree, that was hands-down

431
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,169
The best dinner I've ever had in my life. You are so sweet.

432
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,219
You know, bree is the number one caterer in fairview.

433
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,040
Oh, that's right. Do you do weddings?

434
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,319
Ow! I wasn't gonna say anything.

435
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,389
Say anything about what?

436
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,590
Uh, nothing. Nothing.

437
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,310
We're gonna have to tell them sometime.

438
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,080
Oh, my goodness, are you two...

439
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,210
Yes, yes. We're... We're getting married.

440
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,640
And I hate you.

441
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,319
Oh, my god. Congratulations.

442
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,179
Oh, my god. Yay.

443
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,139
Wow. See how excited they are? Why would you

444
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,389
Wanna keep it a secret? I am gonna handle everything for this wedding.

445
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,809
That's why.

446
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,910
Now let me give my new son-in-law a hug.

447
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,870
Butt out.

448
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,359
Well, if you'll excuse me,

449
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,910
I am going to go get a pie that you are going to love.

450
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,430
And you two are going to help me.

451
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,820
All right, you two, what is going on?

452
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,959
What are you talking about? Don't give me that.

453
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,419
You've been whispering to each other all night.

454
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,890
You obviously know alex. How? It's not important.

455
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,929
The man is going to marry my son.

456
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,709
If there is something about him I should know,

457
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,840
I want to hear it now, please.

458
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,380
We think we saw him in... An adult movie.

459
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,110
By "adult," you mean complex and sophisticated?

460
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,170
No, we mean gay porn.

461
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,759
What?

462
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,929
We saw this movie, "rear deployment."

463
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,289
All the actors played soldiers.

464
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,640
Bob likes uniforms, so... Oh, thank you.

465
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,609
No, no, no. This can't possibly be true.

466
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,309
The man is a doctor. Are you sure?

467
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,439
Well, we might be wrong.

468
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,649
No. We rented it last month.

469
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,389
We paid the late charges.

470
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,390
Trust me. That's him.

471
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,549
I just don't think they should advertise something

472
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,839
With a lifetime guarantee if it's gonna break

473
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,109
After four months. Or maybe you used your corkscrew as much in four months

474
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,730
As most people do in a lifetime. Ever think of that?

475
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,829
Your mommy lashes out at people prettier than she is.

476
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,830
You ever notice that?

477
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,970
Hey, katherine. What a cute top.

478
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,889
So, uh, where you guys off to?

479
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,780
Bowling. Come on, buddy. Let's get your jacket.

480
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,879
By the way, uh, I don't think you're gonna have any problem.

481
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,749
I had a little talk with m.J.

482
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,680
Sure you did.

483
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,389
What is that supposed to mean?

484
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,959
It means things will be a lot easier with m.J.

485
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,629
If you weren't talking trash about me and mike dating.

486
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,879
What? I don't do that.

487
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,269
Really? M.J. Always liked me before,

488
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,299
And then I start seeing mike,

489
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,810
And suddenly, I'm taking incoming rocky road.

490
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,259
All right. Let's go knock over some pins. See you, ladies.

491
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,290
Okay. Bye.

492
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,009
What?

493
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,179
I have never said a negative word about them dating ever.

494
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,199
I believe you. It's just-- you don't have to say anything.

495
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,209
It's the way you act when she's around.

496
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,079
Kids pick up on that stuff.

497
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,889
What do you mean, the way I act?

498
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,730
"oh, katherine, what a cute top."

499
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,189
Kid translation-- "have a nice time

500
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,140
At the bowling alley with my ex, whore."

501
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,019
Okay. It-it's a little uncomfortable,

502
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,869
This whole situation.

503
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,499
I mean, if m.J.'s picking up on it,

504
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,099
How am I supposed to fix that?

505
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,079
Well, I didn't say anything about fixing it.

506
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,070
Two of my friends involved in a nasty catfight...

507
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,400
I live for that stuff.

508
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,050
Thanks for the corkscrew.

509
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,159
There you go, sweetie. Is that tight enough?

510
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I guess.

511
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,139
What is going on? Why were you on the phone so long?

512
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,339
Um, susan's coming. What? Why?

513
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,119
Well, she wants m.J. To see us all having a good time together.

514
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,780
That way, he might be more accepting of you and me.

515
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,129
I suppose it's not a terrible idea.

516
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,759
Well, I think it's a good idea.

517
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,669
She feels like she's been sending the wrong signals,

518
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,050
And she wants to make up for it.

519
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,279
Well, it's nice of her to try,

520
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,909
But just how much of a show was she planning to put on for--

521
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,849
Hey, everybody!

522
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,760
Are we ready to have the best time ever?

523
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,729
Don't fall down, okay? I'm not carrying you home.

524
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,410
I'm fine. Stop worrying.

525
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,710
Look who just got bailed out.

526
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,859
You got a lot of balls, kid.

527
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,499
You nail my wife, you break up my family,

528
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,440
You burn down my business.

529
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,160
I didn't burn down your club.

530
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,000
And you can accuse me all you want, but I'm not going to jail.

531
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,229
If I were you, I'd want to go there.

532
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,230
It's a hell of a lot safer.

533
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,129
Otherwise, someday,

534
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,479
You'll be walking home from school

535
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,609
Or work or your buddy's house,

536
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,390
And you'll just...

537
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,370
Disappear.

538
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,680
Poof!

539
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,030
And if they ask me about it,

540
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,870
You know what I'm gonna tell 'em?

541
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,850
I was at the movies.

542
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,230
Enjoy your freedom.

543
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,829
Um, so right down the middle... Okay.

544
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,690
No gutter balls. Right.

545
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,389
They're getting along great, huh?

546
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,909
You're welcome.

547
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,810
Hey. I admit it. You being here does seem to be helping.

548
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,439
You're welcome.

549
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,870
Okay, let it go. All right.

550
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,709
God, look at him.

551
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,819
Remember when he needed one of those little kiddie balls

552
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,739
The size of a cantaloupe? He's getting so big. I know.

553
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,389
You know, that colts jersey you bought him doesn't fit anymore.

554
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,559
No. God.

555
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,390
I'm gonna try it.

556
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,119
How did that little peewee we brought back

557
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,939
From the hospital turn into this bruiser? Mm.

558
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,819
Mike, I need you. I got another split.

559
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,330
What did I say about aiming the ball?

560
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,920
I don't remember. Come show me.

561
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Um, be right there.

562
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,780
Hey there.

563
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,620
Do you have a second?

564
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,689
Now where did you get that?

565
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,660
A video store I will never return to.

566
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,159
Are you aware that one of the stars of this film is--

567
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,659
Yes. I know about alex's movie, mom.

568
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,669
You do?

569
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,120
Yeah. He told me a long time ago.

570
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,250
He calls it the biggest mistake he's ever made.

571
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,559
Why would he--

572
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,809
Well, he couldn't afford the tuition to med school,

573
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,559
And he was approached by this so-called director,

574
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,460
And well, he...

575
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,679
Anyway, I would appreciate it

576
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,260
If you didn't let on that you know.

577
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,830
And you're okay with this?

578
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,149
Yeah. Well, you know, I mean,

579
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,220
We both know that I have sort of an interesting past myself.

580
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,129
So, you know, uh,

581
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,940
Glass houses, stones.

582
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:11,190
Not to mention the fact that i-i love him...

583
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,550
Very much.

584
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,659
So...

585
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,490
He's the one?

586
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,899
Yes, mom.

587
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,410
Even with his sordid past, he's the one.

588
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,930
Why did you bring this here?

589
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,159
You're going to marry him.

590
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,809
I thought he wasn't being honest with you.

591
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,139
I wanted to protect you, so i--

592
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,630
So you decided to meddle in my love life?

593
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,620
Yes.

594
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,220
You know what, mom?

595
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,759
This might be about the nicest thing

596
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,320
You've ever done for me.

597
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,700
Come here.

598
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,810
I mean, not every boy can say that

599
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,599
His mother's willing to rent gay porn for them.

600
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,279
Yes. Which reminds me, that needs to be back by 3:00.

601
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,430
Could you? Absolutely. Uh, you gotta avoid those late fees.

602
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,589
Oh, you know, um, you know, I can have alex

603
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,489
Autograph this for you if you want.

604
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,140
Just take it back.

605
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,020
Oh, mrs. Solis, may I help you with something?

606
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,580
Get your boss.

607
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,970
There.

608
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,540
You got it back.

609
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,310
Why are you limping?

610
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,860
Fell off a table. Don't want to talk about it.

611
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,439
What took you so long? I just wanted to coach porter a little bit

612
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,599
Before the arraignment. What's he doing?

613
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,470
He needed some time to himself.

614
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,660
I'll meet you inside.

615
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,739
You might want to give him a moment.

616
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,340
I think he's pretty nervous.

617
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,659
That's because he's preston.

618
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,070
What?

619
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,650
Oh, crap!

620
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,359
Hey, mom, dad.

621
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,030
Hey, preston.

622
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,719
Aw, you know?

623
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,299
Of course we know. What the hell is going on? Where's porter?

624
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,449
He took off. What?!

625
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,709
Uh... He was scared out of his mind. He didn't know what to do,

626
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,119
So he left town and asked me if I'd help him

627
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,409
Give him a head start.

628
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,429
Do you have any idea how bad this is? We had to post bail

629
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,349
If the judge finds out porter skipped town,

630
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,979
We're gonna lose... A lot.

631
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,619
Guys. Guys, they're calling us. Well,

632
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,479
You know what? He's gonna find out right now

633
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,749
Because you are not going in there.

634
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,999
I'd rather forfeit the bail

635
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,279
Than risk having two of my kids go to jail. Tom--

636
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,519
No, bob will just tell the judge what happened.

637
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,199
We'll take the hit and we'll go forward. It's just money.

638
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,720
It's not just money.

639
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,439
What are you talking about?

640
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,830
Hey. Come on. We're up.

641
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,900
Okay, look...

642
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,559
You know how you're always saying

643
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,839
I know what to do in a crisis?

644
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,720
Yeah. Here's what we're gonna do. You--no questions.

645
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,270
You--you're porter now.

646
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,530
Let's go in.

647
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,760
Come on. Come on.

648
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,290
You like it?

649
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,619
It's beautiful. Where'd it come from?

650
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,839
I bought it today. It's yours.

651
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,179
What?

652
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,600
We can't afford this.

653
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,560
I sold the baseball.

654
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,980
You never told me things had gotten so bad.

655
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,020
You were blind and depressed.

656
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,030
I didn't wanna add to it.

657
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,780
Thank you for taking such good care of us.

658
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,480
I plan on spending the rest of my life making it up to you.

659
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,109
First thing tomorrow I'm selling my watch

660
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:36,360
So I can buy you some new shoes to go with that dress.

661
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,579
You should know that watch is a knockoff.

662
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,530
I sold the real one two years ago to get the roof fixed.

663
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,970
So how is katherine's foot?

664
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,529
Well, she's kinda got a psychedelic toenail,

665
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,750
But she'll be fine...

666
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,270
Which doesn'excuse what you did, mister.

667
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,069
What's going on?

668
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,889
Sweetie, if you're worried that I don't like

669
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,549
Your daddy spending time with katherine, don't be.

670
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,989
I think it's great.

671
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,160
But they can't be together.

672
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,510
Why not?

673
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,520
'cause you and mommy are getting back together.

674
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,789
What?

675
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,040
That's what mommy said.

676
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,639
Um... Hey, I've got an idea.

677
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,479
Why don't you go make a get well card for katherine's foot?

678
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,649
Okay.

679
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,930
Okay.

680
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,819
I can totally explain this. I swear.

681
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,349
I'm listening.

682
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,189
It was--i don't know, uh, about a month after you moved out.

683
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,179
It was bedtime.

684
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,150
I was trying to read to him, but he only wanted you.

685
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,939
And he was crying so hard,

686
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,469
And he kept asking me if you were ever coming back,

687
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,390
And so I finally...

688
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Said maybe you would.

689
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,449
I just didn't want him to be so sad.

690
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,759
Oh, susan. I didn't even think he'd remembered it.

691
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,860
Of course he remembers it. How could you say that to him?

692
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,400
Because we have never said it.

693
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,029
What?

694
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,119
We've never looked each other in the eye

695
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,709
And said that there is no chance

696
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,260
We are ever getting back together.

697
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,419
O-okay.

698
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,320
Maybe we haven't, but we moved on.

699
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,799
Did we?

700
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,079
Susan, what are you doing?

701
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,550
You're with jackson now. I'm with katherine.

702
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,710
What are you doing?

703
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,060
I don't know. I...

704
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,720
You don't ever think about it?

705
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,330
I've gotta go check on katherine.

706
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,680
It's an awful thing to live in darkness,

707
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,879
Unable to see what others take for granted.

708
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,170
But if we are lucky, the darkness lifts

709
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,999
And we can finally see

710
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,160
The secret sacrifices made by our wives...

711
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,050
The surprising progress made by our mothers...

712
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,859
Or the unintended consequences

713
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,370
Of our own actions.

714
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,699
But there are those who prefer the darkness,

715
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,760
Because there, they see only what they choose to see.

716
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,209
I know it must seem like

717
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,100
I've forgotten about you,

718
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,390
But you have to know, I think about you every day.

719
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,820
I live for you, just like always.

720
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,230
But I have a plan,

721
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,550
So I hope you can wait a little longer.

722
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,900
I'll be with you soon,

723
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,739
But first mike delfino has to pay

724
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,619
For taking you away from me,

725
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,290
And I need just the right moment to do it.

726
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,920
He destroyed what I loved the most,

727
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,010
And I want him to feel that hurt.

728
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,590
I want him to lose what I lost.

729
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,590
See ya in Jan, 2009
