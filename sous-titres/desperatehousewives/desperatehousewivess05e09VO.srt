1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,570
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,100
Porter's affair...

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,240
Your son loves me, and I love him.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,990
...Escalated into violence.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,410
Hey, warren. Yeah?

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,730
I don't care what it takes. You're dead.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,370
But the full extent of dave's rage was realized...

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,760
Fire!

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,320
...During the battle of the bands.

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,560
Mike!

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,930
And out of the tragedy came a hero.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,790
Hang in there. I'm not done with you yet.

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,930
Something awful happened to gabrielle solis...

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,910
And she was reminded of this

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,430
Every time she looked in a mirror...

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,630
Every time she glanced at an old photo...

17
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,940
And every time she walked past a man.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,510
Yes, gabrielle knew she had lost her looks.

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,210
But she tried her best to look on the bright side.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,900
After all, what woman needs to be beautiful...

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,990
When her husband is blind?

22
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,160
Hi, sweetie.

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,710
How's our patient?

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,970
Well, he took a pretty nasty fall in the fire last night.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
But, uh, the c.T. Scan shows no bleeding or swelling.

26
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,500
That's it? No concussion?

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,810
Actually, there is something.

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,460
Please tell me it's not my hearing.

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,100
I'm already down to four senses.

30
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,030
The scan revealed a tiny bone fragment

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,730
That may be putting pressure on the optic nerves.

32
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,880
And, what, you're afraid it's gonna impair his vision?

33
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,030
I'm sorry. You were saying?

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,060
The bone fragment might be a remnant

35
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,160
From your injury five years ago.

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,750
Due to its small size,

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,160
The original scan might have missed it.

38
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,250
Mm, five years. Can't we just leave it? Actually, there is a chance

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,380
If we remove that bone fragment, you could regain your sight.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,730
Are you serious?

41
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,810
That's fantastic!

42
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,250
I'm not promising a slam dunk here.

43
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm just saying it's possible.

44
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,430
Doc, two days ago, I spread moisturizer on a cracker.

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,610
I'd kill for "possible." I've spoken with ted daniels.

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,640
He's the best eye surgeon in the state.

47
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,350
He says he could fit you in for surgery in about a month.

48
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,110
Oh! Oh, my god.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,830
If this works, I'll finally be able

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,910
To see my little girls and my gorgeous wife. Oh.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,850
This is unbelievable! Thank you.

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,200
Doctor, thank you very much. Ah!

53
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,150
Yes, gabrielle solis knew she had lost her beauty.

54
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,980
She also knew

55
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,000
The time had come to get it back.

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,470
There was a fire in the town of fairview,

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,600
And those who had been injured

58
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,480
Came to recover at fairview memorial hospital.

59
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,240
By morning,

60
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,690
Their burns had been bandaged...

61
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,770
Their broken bones had been set..

62
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,900
And their wounds had begun healing.

63
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,170
Yes, everyone was well on their way to recovery...

64
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,660
Except for the man who had started the fire.

65
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,470
You see, his suffering

66
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,520
Was just beginning.

67
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,910
Sorry.

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,120
That's all right. Are you dave williams?

69
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,800
Yeah. I'm detective collins. This is detective lyons.

70
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,100
You have a moment?

71
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,500
Why?

72
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,030
We wanted to talk to you about the fire at the white horse bar.

73
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,910
We've been interviewing everyone who was there last night.

74
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,320
We were told by an... Orson hodge

75
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,850
That you were onstage with the band

76
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,120
When theire broke out.

77
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,400
Yeah. We had just started when...

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,950
Suddenly the curtains went up.

79
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,470
Everything happened really fast after that.

80
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,570
That's okay. We know how hard this has got to be.

81
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,360
So... Have they figured out how the fire started?

82
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,990
We know it was arson.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,330
Really? It's looking like the point of origin

84
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,460
Was the storage room off the back hallway.

85
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,870
And there was a body in there, too.

86
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,090
And you think that's the person who

87
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,830
Started the fire? No, we don't think so

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,460
But this guy was pretty badly burned,

89
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,530
So it'll take us a while to identify him.

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,900
Anyway, if you, uh,

91
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,650
Remember anything you think we should know,

92
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,530
Give a call at that number there. All right?

93
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,850
Dave williams...

94
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,480
Aren't you the one who went back in and saved that delfino guy?

95
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,140
You're an honest to god hero.

96
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,000
You should be real proud of yourself.

97
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,620
If you say so.

98
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,610
I would've come sooner, but I burnt the first batch,

99
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,840
And I wasn't sure you'd appreciate the irony.

100
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,030
I'm so hungry, I wouldn't have noticed.

101
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,050
Hey, can I get a kiss from my cookie?

102
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,570
Mike!

103
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,980
What if someone sees us? What if they do?

104
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,970
You haven't told susan we're dating yet.

105
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm waiting for the right time.

106
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,670
Her friendship's very important to me,

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,250
And I want to ease her into this.

108
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,340
Okay.

109
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,910
I get it.

110
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,070
See ya.

111
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,970
Just walk out slowly.

112
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,820
Give me something to live for.

113
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,310
Susan.

114
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,520
How's jackson?

115
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,290
Uh, he's fine, just getting some stitches. Oh.

116
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,540
How's...

117
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,890
Wait, who are you here to see?

118
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,050
You know...

119
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,740
Everybody.

120
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,680
So many people in the neighborhood

121
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,570
Were hurt in the fire.

122
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,390
I just thought it would be nice to bring them... Gifts.

123
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,410
Oh. Crap! I didn't get anyone gifts.

124
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,120
But I did give blood,

125
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,640
So I'll just remind everybody that I did that.

126
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,630
How you feeling? I just gave blood.

127
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,260
Uh, I'm fine, just a little smoke inhalation.

128
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,550
How's jackson doing?

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,230
Oh, fine. He just needs some stitches.

130
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,660
Ooh, those cookies look delicious.

131
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,880
Where'd you get 'em?

132
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,980
Um... A friend.

133
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,960
Have one.

134
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,610
Oh, I shouldn't. They're yours.

135
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,260
You know you want to.

136
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,420
Well, I did just give blood.

137
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,240
Attractive.

138
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,490
Mm, I hate macadamia nuts.

139
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,810
You think they're white chocolate chips

140
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,390
Until it's too late. Stupid hawaii.

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,460
Who made 'em?

142
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,400
Um... Like I said, a friend.

143
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,470
Yeah. But what friend?

144
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,320
Wait. Is this a woman friend?

145
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,600
Um, don't you wanna throw that macadamia nut away?

146
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,790
When I'm done. Don't change the subject.

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,430
Are you seeing someone?

148
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,980
Why do you care?

149
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,660
I care because you mean a lot to me,

150
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,680
And it makes me feel good

151
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,010
Knowing that two people have found love and happiness.

152
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,190
So what's her name? Who am I happy for?

153
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,980
Susan, I'm not telling you. Why not?

154
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,410
Because she wants to tell you herself.

155
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,770
So... I know her?

156
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,260
Whoa, I think my meds just kicked in.

157
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,650
I don't know what I'm saying. You're dating a friend of mine?

158
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,550
Don't be angry,

159
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,810
I'm not, but now you have to tell me who she is.

160
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,020
Fine.

161
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,980
Have it your way.

162
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,270
Oh, if he ever needs a transfusion,

163
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,120
You are not allowed to give him my blood.

164
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,910
Hello, dr. Cominis. How's my husband doing?

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,890
Well, the x-rays indicate there was no concussion,

166
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,790
So I think we're gonna release him today.

167
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,850
Wonderful.

168
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,150
The house was too quiet without him. Mm.

169
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,580
You'll have to wait to talk to him.

170
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,540
He's been in a lot of pain,

171
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,650
So we gave him something to help him sleep.

172
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,640
Oh, that's all right. I can wait.

173
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,440
Mmm, he looks so peaceful.

174
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,010
Goodness.

175
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,730
I'm sure if orson were awake, he'd apologize for that.

176
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,140
Has he always snored?

177
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,270
Occasionally, but never quite this--

178
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,590
Robustly.

179
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,150
Well, the injury to his septum might've made it worse.

180
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,210
But it can be corrected with a simple surgical procedure.

181
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,530
Well, if it's so simple, what are we waiting for?

182
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,860
It'll take a few weeks to schedule.

183
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,820
So... Soon as he wakes up, you can take him home.

184
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,740
Well...

185
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,210
At least the house won't be quiet anymore.

186
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,160
Hey. I ran into katherine.

187
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,650
She said you wanted to see me about something.

188
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,100
Right. What was it?

189
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,190
Oh, yeah. Thanks for saving my life.

190
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,870
Yeah, well...

191
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,690
We all did what we had to do, right?

192
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,680
And you went back in for jackson.

193
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,580
Yeah, but I ended up passed out on the floor,

194
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,520
Which, technically, makes me an idiot and you a hero.

195
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,360
Yeah, people keep saying that. I don't... Feel like one.

196
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,860
Well, I would've been dead without you.

197
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,750
So... How about free plumbing for the rest of your life?

198
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,260
That sounds fair.

199
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,790
Seriously, you've, uh,

200
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,920
You gotta let me do something to thank you.

201
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,110
Well, ever since my brother died, I haven't had a...

202
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,560
Really good friend.

203
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,680
Think you could handle that job?

204
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,660
I think I could.

205
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,170
The stitches are in. I'll need to see you again in a few days.

206
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,870
Would you like some pills for the pain?

207
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
Nah, stitches never bother me. I'll be fine.

208
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,750
Great. Then let me get another bandage, and we'll be done. Thank you.

209
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,870
Mr. And mrs. Scavo?

210
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,720
Can we ask you a few follow-up questions about the fire?

211
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,460
We already told you everything we can remember.

212
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,380
This will only take a moment.

213
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,720
It's come to our attention

214
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,770
That the owner of the club and your son

215
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,730
Got into a fight minutes before the fire broke out.

216
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,440
Now did you witness that? I saw a grown man beating up on my teenage boy.

217
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,000
What else do you want to know?

218
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,100
During the altercation,

219
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,990
Did your son threaten to kill mr. Schilling?

220
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,590
No.

221
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,430
Really?

222
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,620
Well...

223
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,200
I was right there, detective. My son said no such thing.

224
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,510
You sure?

225
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,230
Absolutely.

226
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,140
Thank you for your time.

227
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,940
Maybe I'm being a little paranoid here,

228
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,210
But I sort of got the feeling

229
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,250
That you were lying to the police.

230
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,940
Lynette, please,

231
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,550
Tell me that porter did not threaten to kill mr. Schilling.

232
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,770
Got the bandage.

233
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,700
You might wanna go ahead

234
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,460
And give him those pain pills, doc.

235
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,820
He's gonna need 'em.

236
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,130
I don't understand.

237
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,040
Carlos might get his sight back. You should be thrilled.

238
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,880
Oh, I know. It's just...

239
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,730
He's been through so much these past five years,

240
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,470
And he's never complained.

241
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,700
I just think he deserves to open his eyes

242
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,410
To a wife who doesn't tuck her boobs into her pants.

243
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,340
Oh, gaby, please. Most women would kill to look like you.

244
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,820
But I'm not most women.

245
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,900
I was an international fashion model,

246
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,630
And that's how carlos remembers me. You are still beautiful.

247
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
So you've gained a little weight. Who hasn't?

248
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,740
Don't go by me. I have a weird metabolism.

249
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,430
Hey there!

250
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,120
I just heard the good news about carlos!

251
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,420
Oh. What's wrong?

252
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,800
Gaby thinks that carlos isn't gonna find her attractive

253
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,710
After he gets his sight back.

254
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,350
Yeah, that was my first thought, too. Edie!

255
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,020
Well... Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Let her talk.

256
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,770
At least she's being honest.

257
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,790
It's the kind of support and friendship

258
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,040
I need right now.

259
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,220
Fine. You're a pig.

260
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,470
Thank you.

261
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,490
God, what am I gonna do?

262
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,870
Well... You're gonna stop whining, for one.

263
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,170
You got a month, right?

264
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,430
That's plenty of time to go on a diet and start exercising.

265
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,590
By the time carlos gets his eyesight back,

266
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,550
You are gonna be looking hot...

267
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,390
Or hot-ish.

268
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,260
Really? I mean, do you think I could pull this off?

269
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,930
Of course,

270
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,940
Even though I still think you're beautiful just the way you are.

271
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,370
You gonna start that crap again?

272
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,240
I don't believe it.

273
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,990
Tom, I was 6 feet away.

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,530
Porter looked warren schilling in the eye and said,

275
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,310
"you're dead. I don't care what it takes. You're dead."

276
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,760
That doesn't prove a thing.

277
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,160
And--and--and I'm sure he didn't mean it.

278
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,500
Maybe he didn't.

279
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,960
But ten minutes later, that nightclub was on fire.

280
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,830
No. No!

281
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,860
I know porter.

282
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,480
He wouldn't commit arson just to get back at someone.

283
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,090
What about rick's restaurant?

284
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,070
Porter and his brother burned that down.

285
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,530
That was five years ago.

286
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,850
I mean, they--they were trying to protect us.

287
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,950
They--they--nobody got hurt. The building was empty.

288
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,010
Yes, that time, the building was empty.

289
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,310
This is insane.

290
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,240
Lynette, are you actually telling me

291
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,930
That our son is a murderer?

292
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm lling you I heard him threaten warren schilling.

293
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,440
I don't know what happened next.

294
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,670
What if somebody saw him?

295
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,830
What if he left behind evidence?

296
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,840
What are we gonna do?

297
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,820
We're going to protect our son.

298
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,340
Even if he killed six people?

299
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,360
We're going to protect our son.

300
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,010
Okay.

301
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,460
Oh, boy!

302
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,230
Who knew healthy food could look so tasty?

303
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,650
Okay, dig in.

304
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,260
What's wrong?

305
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,940
It smells like the beach that time they wouldn't let us swim.

306
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,390
It's a recipe I got from a diet magazine.

307
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,720
It's--it's fish and broccoli. Fish?

308
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,590
Yes. Not all fish is shaped like a stick.

309
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,160
Now I know you're not used to it, but give it a try.

310
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,530
You're gonna love it.

311
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,410
Mmm. Yummy.

312
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,850
It's still in your mouth.

313
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,760
See? Delicious!

314
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,900
I want macaroni.

315
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,880
Hey, I'm not a short-order cook.

316
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,690
I don't have time to make different meals for everyone.

317
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,990
It comes in a box. It's not that hard.

318
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,510
Okay, look. Mommy needs to lose a few pounds,

319
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,500
And it's not easy eating healthy with you two in front of me,

320
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,390
Scarfing down all the good stuff.

321
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,160
So what do you say? You want to help mommy be beautiful again?

322
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
No.

323
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,550
You got a lot of nerve. Part of the reason I'm on this diet is

324
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,440
Because carrying you 2 brats for 18 months made mommy fat!

325
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,410
And you with the head-- you ruined me!

326
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,170
So this is how it's gonna go down.

327
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,490
You're gonna eat fish with mommy and you're gonna like it.

328
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,960
Got it?

329
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,500
Thank you.

330
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,490
A spokesman from fairview memorial hospital

331
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,360
Says this latest death raises the total to seven.

332
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,400
Oh, come on. You're watching that again?

333
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,340
Authorities estimate

334
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,070
There may have been as many as 100--

335
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,730
Are you okay?

336
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,810
I just...

337
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,370
This fire--i still can't believe it really happened.

338
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,790
I mean, they just said another person died this afternoon.

339
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,660
That makes... Seven.

340
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,170
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

341
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,870
They think they know who did it.

342
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,970
Who?

343
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,090
Well, it's just a rumor,

344
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,930
But I hear they're looking at porter scavo.

345
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,440
Porter?

346
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,540
Why would they think it's him?

347
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,610
I don't know. I guess there was a fight

348
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,860
Between him and the guy who owns the club.

349
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,190
You know, I've known that kid since he was 6 years old,

350
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,080
And I always thought he was trouble.

351
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,700
And trust me, I'm a really good judge of character.

352
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,370
You slept on the couch?

353
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,920
Why? It's so uncomfortable.

354
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,170
Yes, it is.

355
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,260
Sit down.

356
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,630
We need to talk.

357
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,860
What's wrong?

358
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,720
Orson, dear,

359
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,560
Because of the way your nose was broken during the fire,

360
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,100
You now snore.

361
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,920
Didn't I snore before?

362
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,750
Good point. Snoring is too mild a word for what you're doing.

363
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,200
Imagine a terrified elephant...

364
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,250
Summoning his herd.

365
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,960
You know, Bree,

366
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,350
I can't help but take issue with your sarcastic tone.

367
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,980
Snoring is not something that I can help.

368
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,010
Not exactly true.

369
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,070
The doctor said there's a very simple procedure--

370
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,130
Procedure?

371
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,090
Very routine and-- and practically outpatient.

372
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,020
You mean surgery? No way.

373
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,960
I had an uncle who died during an "outpatient procedure."

374
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,680
He went in for a broken wrist. They put him under.

375
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,000
He never woke up.

376
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,040
You don't have an uncle!

377
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,570
Fine. He was more of a family friend.

378
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,800
No, the point is, he's still dead,

379
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,910
And I am not having unnecessary surgery.

380
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,190
This is absolutely necessary.

381
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,300
I am going through a very stressful time.

382
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,750
I have interviews, that cooking demonstration at the mall.

383
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,090
If I don't get my rest, it could affect the launch of my book.

384
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,470
Oh! Well, that's very reasonable.

385
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,760
You get to be a best-selling author.

386
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,710
I get to be an organ donor.

387
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,210
Orson, if we can't share a bed,

388
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,480
It's going to hurt the intimacy of our marriage.

389
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,200
My death will have the same effect.

390
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
Oh, orson,

391
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,850
I can't help but take issue with yoursarcastic tone.

392
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,420
I hear you're getting discharged today.

393
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,660
Are you going back home?

394
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,150
Home?

395
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,690
Hmm, let's see...

396
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,060
Two cracked ribs, black eye...

397
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,800
Nope, got everything I need from there.

398
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm sure you heard about the nightclub burning down.

399
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,590
Yeah, I heard.

400
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,380
Your husband's blaming porter.

401
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,210
What?

402
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,470
Porter would never do anything like that.

403
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,630
What's this?

404
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,850
I'm helping you help me.

405
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,140
This way, you get to start a new life,

406
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,860
And I get to not have you around

407
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,800
While my son is going through all this.

408
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,580
What if I'm not ready to leave?

409
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,240
Well, then you can face statutory rape charges

410
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,340
Without the money. Your call.

411
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,470
I'll pick you up tonight.

412
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,640
I'll give you a ride to the bus station.

413
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,610
You can count it then.

414
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,800
Hey, do you wanna take a walk?

415
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,610
I need a little girlfriend time.

416
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,620
I've got something in the oven, but you can come in if you want.

417
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,910
So... What's on your mind?

418
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,030
It's about mike.

419
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,700
Mike?

420
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,860
Can you imagine how upset I was

421
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,730
When I discovered he's dating a friend of mine?

422
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,070
Oh, susan, I'm so--

423
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,950
It's gotta be lisa wallace.

424
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,400
So shocked at lisa!

425
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,690
How dare she?!

426
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,820
You know, she has wanted to get her hooks into mike for years.

427
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,110
Every time she would have us over for a barbecue,

428
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,610
She always wore something booby.

429
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,060
Well, in lisa's defense,

430
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,650
Maybe she thinks you're over mike,

431
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,290
Which is something I've heard you say more than once.

432
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,950
Well, it doesn't matter.

433
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,390
She's my friend.

434
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,120
She should've co to me and discussed it first.

435
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,800
Well, you're not always available.

436
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,720
And besides... Maybe lisa was waiting to see

437
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,410
If this thing had a future.

438
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,390
All things we can discuss

439
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,950
When I knock her teeth out with a pool cue.

440
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,000
You know, it's sad when you can't trust a friend.

441
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,400
Or maybe the lesson here

442
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,290
Is that she wasn't really a friend to begin with then.

443
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,680
What's wrong?

444
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,890
Susan, I swear I was gonna tell you.

445
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,360
It's fine. It's... Fine. I just didn't think it would be such a big deal.

446
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,250
I mean, you're seeing jackson now. Yes, I am. You're perfectly right.

447
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,600
And I've been so lonely lately. Well, now you're not.

448
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,460
I know you're mad at me.

449
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,350
Would you just please yell at me or something?

450
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,090
Oh, damn it. I should've listened to bree. Bree?

451
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,060
Yes. She told me weeks ago I should've told you.

452
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,630
So bree knew? Yes.

453
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,910
Okay. Well, have a nice day.

454
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,380
So... We're okay then?

455
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,420
You knew about katherine and mike?

456
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,740
Oh, god, susan. Can't this wait till after my nap? Why didn't you tell me?

457
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,790
I didn't think it was my place.

458
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,550
I thought katherine should tell you.

459
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,820
Well, she didn't. I'm sorry.

460
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,820
Uh, not good enough.

461
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,260
Y-you had a million chances to say something and you didn't.

462
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,570
That is just the same as lying to my face.

463
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,030
You know, I always thought

464
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,380
That the one thing I could depend on you for was honesty.

465
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,650
What happened to that?

466
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,410
You want honesty? Fine. You didn't want to divorce mike.

467
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,240
You hit a really bad patch after the accident,

468
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,760
But you never stopped loving him.

469
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,170
And why would you?

470
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,140
Your relationship didn't have a natural end.

471
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,860
So face it. You're not mad at me or mike or katherine.

472
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,740
You're mad at yourself

473
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,820
For letting your marriage fall apart.

474
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,100
What am I supposed to do?

475
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,500
Either tell mike how you feel or move on,

476
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,170
Because that's what he's trying to do,

477
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,260
And it's not fair to stop him.

478
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,680
You need to make a decision, susan.

479
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,320
And I need to get back to my nap.

480
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,690
I know the doctor told us not to get our hopes up...

481
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,080
But I can't help it. My hopes are up. I am gonna see again!

482
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,630
Uh-huh, uh-huh. I knew it.Ou're excited, too. I can hear it in your voice.

483
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,310
Hi, dr. Bach! How are you? Hi, mrs. Solis.

484
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,530
Hey, doc! We are still reeling over the good news.

485
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,470
Well, I have even better news.

486
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,880
Dr. Daniels just had a cancellation.

487
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,850
He can fit you in next friday.

488
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,750
Friday?! But you said it would be at least a month.

489
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,920
I mean, that's so soon.

490
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,000
So? Friday's great.

491
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,140
Okay, I didn't wanna have to say this,

492
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,900
But you should never have surgery on a friday.

493
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,810
The surgeons are thinking about the weekend.

494
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,240
They're all distracted.

495
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,680
Next thing you know, you come out of the o.R. Still blind

496
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,240
And missing your right leg.

497
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
Why are you talking like this?

498
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,960
Also, the surgery is very expensive.

499
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,030
We need time to figure out how we're gonna pay for it.

500
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,520
How about using our insurance?

501
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,460
That only covers 85%. And we are broke.

502
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,560
You know what? The hospital has a foundation

503
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,880
To help people in this exact situation.

504
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,230
No. We don't accept charity.

505
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,960
What? We always accept charity!

506
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,490
Well, I have turned over a new leaf.

507
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,390
I'm sorry about the timing, carlos, but it is what it is.

508
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,300
Gaby, we are doing this friday. Now drop it.

509
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,600
So you say this guy's good, huh, doc?

510
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,120
Dr. Daniels is one of the top guys in the country.

511
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,760
That's what I like to hear.

512
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,250
Bree... Please let me sleep in my bed.

513
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,520
No.

514
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,890
I promise not to snore.

515
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,320
And--and if I do,

516
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,420
I will go down to the sofa and stay as long as you say.

517
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,740
And how exactly are you gonna stop snoring?

518
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,120
Well, I read somewhere that chamomile tea

519
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,440
Helps prevent it. That doesn sound right

520
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,800
Well, it's worth a try, right?

521
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,510
Look, I'll-- I'll brew you a cup, too.

522
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,030
Whatever.

523
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,620
There you go. Drink that up.

524
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,850
All right, but I think I'll be too tired to finish it.

525
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,890
That pill I took really kicked in fast.

526
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,440
You took a pill? When did you do that?

527
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,680
When you were downstairs.

528
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,870
Uh, oh, well, then you shouldn't drink this,

529
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,230
Because the chamomile actually, uh,

530
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,570
Counteracts the effect of the sleeping pill.

531
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,600
Since when have you become such an expert on chamomile?

532
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,710
Well, the point is, we shouldn't risk it.

533
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,050
Fine. I just know I need my sleep tonight.

534
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,080
That's it.

535
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,150
We'll finish that thought tomorrow.

536
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,070
I, um, don't suppose

537
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,670
You'd tell porter something for me, would you?

538
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,170
I know this is probably the last thing you want to hear,

539
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,250
But... I do love your son.

540
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,150
He was very sweet to me.

541
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,740
Kindness has always...

542
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,220
Been a weakness of mine.

543
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,790
Good luck.

544
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,810
Anne?

545
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,050
When the baby comes, you don't contact porter.

546
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,280
You can contact tom or me,

547
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,680
And we'll do what we can for you from a distance.

548
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,290
Understood?

549
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,390
There's no baby.

550
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,810
Never was.

551
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,040
Hello?

552
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,010
I just got a call from the lady at the department store.

553
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,810
She said that mom's late. Late for what?

554
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,820
For the cooking demonstration.

555
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,280
That's today?

556
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,770
Yeah. It was supposed to start ten minutes ago.

557
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,520
Look, I'm in mt. Pleasant right now buying some end tables

558
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,060
So you're gonna have to get her there.

559
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,630
Orson?

560
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,370
Bree, honey? Wake up.

561
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,310
It's 9:15. 9:15?

562
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,230
Huh? 9:15. I'm supposed to be at the mall.

563
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,980
Did I forget to set the alarm?

564
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,520
We need to get dressed. I'll get you some clothes. I'm so thirsty.

565
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,730
Well, I'll bring you some juice.

566
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,700
That's all right. I'll just drink this tea.

567
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,790
Bree.

568
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,120
What?

569
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,280
On second thought, you need coffee.

570
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,990
Almost there. All right, coffee time.

571
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,880
Enough coffee. It's not working, anyway.

572
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,530
It must be decaf. No, it's a triple espresso.

573
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,500
I just don't understand why I feel so loopy. Hmm. Very mysterious.

574
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,150
Look, bree, all you gotta do is whip up a few pancakes,

575
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,140
Hand out some advance copies of your book,

576
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,500
And we're outta here. Do you think you can handle that?

577
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,790
Of course I can.

578
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,670
You are such a nervous nellie, rex.

579
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,190
Oh, and here's the lady who's gonna teach us

580
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,270
How to make her traditional buckwheat pancakes--

581
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,310
Bree van de kamp.

582
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,500
Thank you for joining us.

583
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,240
Thank you for having me to your lovely home.

584
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,850
Bree, um, your book is about

585
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,340
So much more than just recipes, isn't it?

586
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,040
Yes, my book is about food and families

587
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,070
And how food brings families together when they make food.

588
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,090
It's mothers teaching daughters how to cook.

589
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,020
So I'm gonna cook pancakes with my daughter,

590
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,650
Only she's not here 'cause she grew up and stole my baby.

591
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,770
So... Who wants to be my daughter?

592
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,740
Hello?

593
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,190
It's me. I just wanted to tell you...

594
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,490
I've been thinking about it, and, um,

595
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,430
I'm okay with you dating mike.

596
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,650
You are? You don't hate me?

597
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,580
No... And I think it's great.

598
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,040
Oh, susan, thank you. I was so worried.

599
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,200
I just...

600
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,590
I didn't know what I'd do if I lost you as a friend.

601
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,150
Oh. Well, you haven't.

602
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,300
Just... Treat him well, okay?

603
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,860
He's a really good guy.

604
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,410
I will. Hey, um, I was just about to make a cappuccino.

605
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,710
You wanna come over?

606
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,630
Uh... No, thanks.

607
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,090
I'm really busy. I have a lot of things to do today.

608
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,290
Another time though, okay?

609
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,680
Bye.

610
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,240
Just call me back, okay?

611
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,990
I really need to talk to you.

612
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,740
Who's that?

613
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,680
Nobody. Just a kid at school. I lent him my bus pass.

614
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,190
Listen, we need to talk.

615
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,330
What's up?

616
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,250
I have to ask you something,

617
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,980
And it is very important that you tell me the truth.

618
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,560
Okay.

619
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,450
Did you set that fire at the nightclub?

620
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,810
Before you answer, let me say

621
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,710
That if you did,

622
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,160
I promise, your father and I will stand behind you

623
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,270
And try and find some way out of this nightmare.

624
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,710
But if you lie to me,

625
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,000
D I find out later that you... Killed...

626
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,830
Those people...

627
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,240
Well, I will love you. That will never change,

628
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,830
But I won't believe in you anymore,

629
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,460
And if i... Don't believe in you...

630
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,210
I can't help you.

631
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,700
We have to tell each other the truth

632
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,980
From here on out.

633
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,980
Mom... I don't know who set the fire,

634
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,550
But it wasn't me.

635
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,410
Of course it wasn't. Of course.

636
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,940
Then we're gonna be okay,

637
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,340
As long as you keep telling the truth.

638
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,970
Everything's gonna be fine.

639
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,650
Mom? There is one thing I lied about.

640
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,450
What?

641
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,250
When you walked in,

642
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
I was leaving a message for anne.

643
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,270
She hasn't returned my calls,

644
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,600
And the hospital said she checked out.

645
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,880
Do you have any idea where she is?

646
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,010
No. Sweetie, I don't.

647
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,530
You know what I'm really excited about?

648
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,730
Christmas lights.

649
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,660
I might be able to see christmas lights again

650
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,700
And holiday derations.

651
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,470
Man, I really miss that stuff.

652
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,450
Yeah, well, let's keep our fingers crossed.

653
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,400
You okay?

654
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,770
Yeah. It's my hamstring. I've just been working out.

655
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,240
You want me to rub it?

656
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,920
No, no, you rest.

657
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,260
You're gonna have surgery in a couple days.

658
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,490
I know. I can't wait.

659
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,000
You know, carlos, I know you're really excited

660
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,420
To see christmas decorations again,

661
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,990
But... I just want you to be prepared because...

662
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,100
Well, some of those lights may have lost their luster.

663
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,510
So should we buy new decorations?

664
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,500
No, I'm talking about me. I may have lost my luster.

665
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,510
Come on.

666
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,380
I'm always gonna find you beautiful. I told you that.

667
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,160
Yeah, that's when you thought you were gonna be blind forever.

668
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,230
But if this operation works,

669
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,270
I just don't want you to be disappointed.

670
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,110
Oh, come here.

671
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,130
Did I ever tell you when I knew I was gonna marry you?

672
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,360
First time you saw me on the runway.

673
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,910
No, that's when I knew I was gonna sleep with you.

674
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,560
No, I knew I was gonna marry you

675
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,110
The night we went to that restaurant on third street.

676
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,500
Mmm, I remember that place.

677
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,400
Mm-hmm. You wore a white linen sundress.

678
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,990
And you ordered this giant plate of ribs.

679
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,090
And you ate them with such gusto,

680
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,900
Up to your elbows in barbecue sauce,

681
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,450
Meat hanging from your teeth

682
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,370
And grease in your hair.

683
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,890
And when it was all over,

684
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,380
I pointed out what a mess you were.

685
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,620
Well, you pulled out your mirror,

686
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,770
Took a look at yourself and just let out

687
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,960
This huge, happy, totally unrestrained laugh.

688
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,890
The room completely filled with it...

689
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,150
And I thought to myself, now that is a sound

690
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,870
I'd like to hear the rest of my life.

691
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,580
That's why I proposed to you,

692
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,800
And it had nothing to do with your looks.

693
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,350
You know when I decided I wanted to be with you forever?

694
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,220
No. When?

695
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,920
About two seconds ago.

696
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,600
Up until then, it was pretty touch-and-go.

697
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,210
So what can I do for you?

698
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,630
Well, my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested.

699
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,340
Oh, the one to alleviate his snoring? Yes, that's the one.

700
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,880
So anytime you wanna get in there

701
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,890
And start hacking away, he's ready for you.

702
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,330
Aren't you, love? Yes, dear.

703
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,010
Well, how is two weeks from friday?

704
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,380
Well, fridays are when orson plays golf.

705
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,770
So friday's perfect. Right, orson?

706
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,560
Right... Dear.

707
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,620
I'm sorry, mr. Hodge.

708
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,640
I'm sensing you're a bit apprehensive about the surgery.

709
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,290
Oh, he's not apprehensive. He's terrified.

710
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,010
And I don't care, because he owes me one--

711
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,450
A big one.

712
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,430
Don't you, darling?

713
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,410
I sure do.

714
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,220
I'm sorry. What's going on here?

715
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,460
Are you married, dr. Cominis?

716
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,040
No, but I just moved in with someone.

717
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,490
Well, over time, you'll learn

718
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,080
That there's a balance of power in relationships,

719
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,090
And if your beloved ever pulls a nasty trick on you,

720
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,520
Like say, drugging you into a stupor,

721
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,590
Then the balance of power shifts to you,

722
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,640
And then you can demand they prove their love

723
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,780
By, say, undergoing surgery.

724
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,810
Do you understand?

725
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,360
Not really.

726
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,600
You will. Come along, orson.

727
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,490
Hey, hon, listen, can you promise me something?

728
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,460
Tell me we'll never grow into one of those insane couples

729
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,380
That just lives to make each other crazy.

730
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,550
Well, no worries there. You already make me crazy.

731
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,340
Oh, hey, guess what?

732
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,240
I, uh, I picked up our new end tables today.

733
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,030
Yeah, hurry home. I want you to see 'em.

734
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,450
If you walk through fairview memorial hospital,

735
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,270
You will encounter all sorts of people

736
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,260
Doing their best to recover.

737
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,710
It might be a husband

738
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,230
Licking his wounds after a marital battle...

739
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,860
Or two parents rallying from an attack of doubt.

740
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,870
It might be a wife who's been cured of low self-esteem...

741
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,510
Or a pair of lovers who find honesty

742
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,200
To be the best medicine.

743
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,450
Sadly, you will also find some poor souls afflicted

744
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,370
With a condition they will never recover from.

745
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,870
Detectives, I heard you were still here,

746
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,170
Interviewing people, and I have...

747
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,360
Something to tell you.

748
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,180
Okay.

749
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,060
The night of the fire...

750
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,820
I was back by the storage room.

751
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,600
Yes?

752
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,940
And I saw somebody come out--

753
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,720
A kid who lives on my block. His name is porter scavo.

754
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:14,590
You asked me to tell you if I remembered anything,

755
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
756
