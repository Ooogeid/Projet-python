Previously on Desperate Housewives

4
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,800
Gabrielle got even.

5
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,110
So did I hurt you,or should I keep trying?

6
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,450
Tom got an idea...

7
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,280
I'm gonna open up a pizza parlor!

8
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,800
Bree got a warning...

9
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,720
he's a cold-blooded killer.

10
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,240
The police got a clue...

11
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,030
those blue marks-- I think it's a phone number.

12
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,410
you've reached mike delfino.

13
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,110
This should never have happened!

14
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,110
And the battle for mike's affection got ugly.

15
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,530
How do you sleep at night?

16
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,260
Soon,with mike on top of me.

17
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,460
it is often said that confession is good for e soul.

18
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,360
No one knew this better than a certain blonde

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,780
who had been confessing her sins to father o'malley

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,440
once a week since she was a child.

21
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,700
As the years had passed,

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,610
much to father o'malley's dismay,a theme began to emerge

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,870
I seduced the cable guy again.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,250
I'm having a affair with a folksinging duo.

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,680
Last week,I let rabbi lippman get to third base.

26
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,100
And once she had been forgiven,

27
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,410
father o'malley would tell edie britt

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,380
to go out into the world and sin no more.

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,220
Unfortunately for edie,temptation seemed to be...

30
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,710
hello there.

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,090
Everywhere.

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,930
Edie,what were we like together...

33
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,890
before the accident?

34
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,100
What do you mean?

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,000
You know,were we close?

36
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,650
Honestly?

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,530
We lived about 50 feet from each other,

38
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,200
and you barely knew that I existed.

39
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,010
Seriously?

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,720
It's true.

41
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,690
I mean,you weren't rude or anything.

42
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,120
We'd wave or exchange "hellos" as we went to get our mail

43
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,340
but you never really looked at me.

44
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,080
Not really.

45
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,060
I...I was just another neighbor to you.

46
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,720
But if we weren't friends,why are you here every day helping me?

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,440
Because from the first moment I laid eyes on you...

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,430
I sort of fell in love with you.

49
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,300
Yeah,and I'm not telling you this

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,560
because I expect anything,so you can just relax,okay?

51
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,180
Okay.

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,690
But when you do come back home,and we

53
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,810
do run into each other when we're getting our mail

54
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,790
I'd really appreciate it if you'D...

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,480
just look at me.

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,050
That's all.

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm looking at you now.

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,680
Yes,it's often said confession is good for the soul.

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,560
Mike delfino and i made out today,and it was great!

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,800
But some confessions are just bragging in disguise.

61
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,850
There was nothing bree hodge hated more than an unexpected...

62
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,280
knock at the door.

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,630
She was always certain it would lead to a dagreeable surprise

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,940
whether it be in the form of a cosmetics saleswoman

65
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,870
religious zealots or extended family.

66
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,930
But on this day,the surprise awaiting bree was

67
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,520
far more disagreeable than she ever could have imagined.

68
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,560
Hello,bree.

69
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,750
Carolyn.

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,050
This isn't a very good time.

71
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm baking.

72
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,310
Bree?

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,680
Uh,hi.

74
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,920
We haven't met.I'm harvey bigsby,
d I brought my wife here to apologize.

75
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,130
It's a souffl?

76
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,580
and timing is everything.

77
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,720
Oh,please,please,um...

78
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,700
she's been under a great deal of stress

79
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,240
since alma's disappearance,and she really hasn't been herself.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,770
Much of that was due to the mexican painkillers

81
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,620
that she was purchasing online,but I put a stop to that.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,650
well,orson tells me that the two of you were very close,

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,580
and out of respect for that friendship,I'm all ears.

84
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,490
After thinking it over,I realized that maybe i was out of line

85
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,190
I was definitely out of lin with
the terrible accusations that I made.

86
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,250
I'm deeply sorry for the pain that I caused.

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,340
I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

88
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,730
Well,I can appreciate how difficult that must have been for you.

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,380
Apology accepted.

90
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,220
I'm so relieved.

91
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,530
As am I.

92
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
Well,you don't know how rusty my golf game's

93
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,760
gotten without this one keeping me on my toes.

94
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,970
Well,perhaps we can all get together for dinner at the club sometime.

95
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,190
That sounds lovely.

96
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,280
Great.

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,890
Darling,you are amazing,you know that?

98
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,230
To rise above all that unpleasantness with such dignity.

99
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,780
Well,thank you,darling.

100
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,890
But if you think for one second that

101
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,220
I'm gonna break bread with that malicious,pill-popping shrew

102
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,370
you're out of your mind.

103
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,820
hey,susan!Whatcha doing?

104
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,680
I just dropped my trowel.Thanks.

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,210
All righty then,you have a nice day.

106
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,780
bye-bye.

107
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,590
susan?

108
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,090
Ian!

109
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,600
What a surprise.

110
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,350
Were you,um,were you hiding from me?

111
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,640
Uh,a little.

112
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,460
I...

113
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,530
just,the last time we saw each other,

114
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,590
it was so awkward and complicated.

115
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,310
Water under the bridge.

116
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,320
And besides,this is strictly business.

117
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm throwing a party for an editor friend in from london

118
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,740
and I thought you two should meet.

119
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,810
You could bring a date if you want.

120
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,180
Speaking of which,uh,how are things with mike?

121
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,390
Oh,uh,they're moving along.

122
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,800
It's a process.

123
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,070
And the,uh,blonde woman who's been visiting

124
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,850
him every day-- is she part of the process?

125
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,850
Uh,edie?Oh,she'S...

126
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,490
just a neighbor.

127
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,040
She visits mike after her hepatitis c treatments.

128
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,300
Well,I-I do hope you can come to the party...

129
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,700
so you can meet my editor friend.

130
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,930
I just--I just don't think that's a good idea.

131
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,450
Right.

132
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,330
Well,at least I,uh,I got to see you.

133
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,800
You have...

134
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,060
this is ludicrous-- the biedermeier armoire.

135
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,580
It's my understanding that your client doesn't even like antiques.

136
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,480
Totally immaterial.

137
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,550
It's a valuable asset.

138
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,090
Fine.

139
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,190
Let's discuss the kosta boda vase.

140
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,830
Nope,it's a premarital acquisition.

141
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,410
We can verify that with receipts.

142
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,770
It was a gift to mr.Solis.

143
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,910
Maybe you were sick that day at law school myron

144
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,910
but it's called community property.

145
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,330
Don't patronize me,kenny.

146
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,920
We're prepared to go to the matn this one.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,310
Oh,enough.Just give her what she wants.

148
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,330
Look,I'm sick of fighting.It's just stuff.

149
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,530
Uh,I'd like a moment alone with my client.

150
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,230
This has been going on for months.I'm done.

151
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,670
Draw up the papers.I'll sign whatever.

152
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,570
You're giving me everything I want?Just like that?

153
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,470
Just like that.

154
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,370
we expect to see the paperwork by the end of business.

155
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,000
How sweet is that?

156
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,360
we nailed their asses.

157
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,660
Mrs.Solis,they complely folded.

158
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,220
That's the thing-- carlos doesn't fold.

159
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,090
That son of a bitch is up to something.

160
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,200
Before you come in,cover your eyes.

161
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,820
Tom,I-- do it!

162
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay,now...

163
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,750
when I say "open," don't look with your eyes.

164
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,210
Look with your imagination.

165
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,470
Okay.

166
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,670
Okay.Open.

167
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,040
Oh,dear god.

168
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,840
Damn it,you looked with your eyes!

169
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,170
It's a dump!

170
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,390
What are you thinking?

171
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,560
Oh,I'll grant you it's a fixer-upper.

172
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,980
It's a burner-downer.

173
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,340
come on,honey,go with me.

174
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,680
We can put in booths with checkered tablecloths,

175
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,280
a jukebox,a big-screen to watch sports on.

176
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,140
How can you not see the potential in this place?

177
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,250
Well,I just don'T.

178
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,410
Tom,you know how I feel about this pizza thing.

179
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,030
Well,hopefully,it'll grow on you.

180
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,520
Don'T...

181
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,000
tell me you didn't sign a lease.

182
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,910
There's gonna be a dartboard!

183
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,290
Tom!

184
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,190
No.

185
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,610
There were multiple offers.I had to move fast.

186
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,950
You leased a building without telling me?

187
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,140
Well,maybe I didn't tell you because I knew

188
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,460
you'd try and talk me out of the best opportunity in my life.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,130
okay.

190
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
Okay,here's what we're going to do.

191
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,970
You said there were multiple offers,so we can sublease.

192
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,340
Now let's get the hell out of here.

193
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,510
You said you'd support my dream.

194
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,660
My mistake.I assumed you'd have a dream worth supporting.

195
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,270
I'm gonna stay here tonight.

196
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,000
Fine.

197
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,960
two lemonades for the victors.

198
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,090
You keep playing like this,bree,and we are a cinch for the finals.

199
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,850
Hello,tish.

200
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,430
Hello,rebecca.

201
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,340
Did you see that?She just deliberately snubbed me.

202
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,170
Maybe she didn'totice you.

203
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,940
Rebecca,I just spoke to her.

204
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,610
And call me paranoid,but amy griswold did

205
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,030
the same thing to me on the golf course last week.

206
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,950
What is going on?

207
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,950
You really don't know?

208
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,720
No!I have no idea.What?

209
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,540
Tish is very good friends with carolyn bigsby.

210
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,030
Carolyn knows tish?

211
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,470
She knows everyone.

212
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,900
Anyway,tish won't talk to you because you married orson

213
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,810
even after carolyn told you that he killed his wife.

214
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,800
That is ridiculous.Orson did not kill almA.

215
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,250
And besides,carolyn just apologized to me for that yesterday.

216
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,780
Well,maybe that hasn't gotten back to tish.

217
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,330
Oh,you don't believe any of that nonsense,do you?

218
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,850
Do you?

219
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,710
Bree,you're the best doubles partner I've ever had.

220
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,980
Can we talk about this after the tournament?

221
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,150
Hello.

222
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,280
I'd like to make a reservation for this evening

223
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,510
under the names hodge and bigsby,and,um,

224
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,930
we'll be needing a table in the center of the room.

225
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,350
How long will daddy be gone?

226
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,310
Well,that sort of depends on daddy.

227
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,730
Are you two mad at each other?

228
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,590
Yeah.

229
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,910
A little.

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,050
But that's okay.

231
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,910
That's okay.We still love each other very much.

232
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,110
But just like kids,sometimes grown-ups

233
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,400
throw tantrums and need a time-out.

234
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,540
Why can't he take a time-out in his room?

235
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,400
'Cause he decided to take it in his pizza place.

236
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,460
No fair.

237
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,940
That sounds fun.

238
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,110
Not this pizza place.It's a rat hole.

239
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,730
But once your dad comes to his senses

240
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,650
and stops being petulant,he'll come home.

241
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,910
What's "petulant"?

242
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:15,520
It means childish,stubborn,careless with my money and your futures.

243
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,750
Huh?

244
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,980
It's a grown-up word,and when daddy comes home,

245
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:24,610
you'll learn a new one-- grovel.

246
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,780
They got in a really big fight.

247
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,370
Daddy's sleeping at the restaurant.

248
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,190
No,no,it's good that you told me,sweet pea.

249
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,260
You keep those little ears open,okay?

250
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,610
Okay.Bye,mom.

251
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,840
Bye.

252
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,780
Oh,hey,that's for me.I'll take that.

253
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,570
Okay.

254
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,200
Well,I'm beat.

255
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm gonna take a nap.

256
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,570
Uh,hold it.

257
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,530
You're a sweaty mess.

258
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,310
So?I was working out.

259
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,770
So you're not laying on anything in
this house until you take a shower.

260
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,330
Fair enough.

261
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,340
It's all yours now,right?

262
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,160
I don't know,myron.

263
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,690
It's a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo.

264
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,420
Just read it and call me back.

265
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,100
Crap!

266
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,330
what?

267
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,130
why did you put those shorts back on?

268
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,200
Why do you care?

269
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,410
Uh,it's just that they're filthy,anI was gonna wash 'em for you.

270
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,890
You wanna wash my shorts?

271
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,620
I don't want to,but if you wear them
one more time they're gonna ask me themselves.

272
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,050
wait a minute.

273
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,710
I forgot something in the pocket.

274
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,490
No bleach.

275
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,040
Got it.

276
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,580
so it's a job contract?

277
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,900
yeah welch and simon are offering him
$2 million over 3 years,plus stock options.

278
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,370
Well,that's fantastic!

279
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,880
I get half,right?

280
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Well,no.

281
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,620
If you're legally divorced when he signs the contract,

282
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,920
then you don't see a dime.

283
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,800
That conniving,underhanded snake!

284
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,530
Thank god I broke into his desk.

285
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,500
At least now we know why he was so quick to fold on your settlement.

286
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,220
All right,well,let's just say something

287
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,940
happened to postpone the divorce.

288
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,300
I would still get my share of that $2 million,right?

289
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,380
Well,in theory,but...

290
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,190
how would you manage that?

291
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,530
I know how carlos thinks-- more importantly,what he thinks with.

292
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,470
was that susan mayer?

293
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,300
Yeah.Why?

294
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,890
Mr.Delfino asked not to be disturbed.

295
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,530
Mike?It's me.

296
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,700
Are you decent?

297
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,690
Hey,susan.

298
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,590
Hey,youou.

299
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,280
Whatcha doing?

300
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,220
I suckered mccluskey into taking the kids for a while

301
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,730
so I could kick back and catch up with my old friend...

302
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,470
margarita.

303
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,550
you care to join us?

304
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,970
Believe me,I would love to,but,um,I gotta--

305
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,790
I gotta get dinner started for julie.

306
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,230
Okay.

307
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,500
Oh,you know,what the hell?

308
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,760
She's 16.

309
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,150
If she hasn't figured out how to feed herself by now,I've failed.

310
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,690
That's nice.

311
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,630
So where were we?

312
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,310
You were trying to figure out how to kill edie without doing time.

313
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,570
Oh,right.

314
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,200
Oh,I wish paul young was still around.He'd know what to do.

315
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,410
Fine,gaby!Don't say hi!

316
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,690
hey!

317
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,870
Cocktails?Nobody called me?

318
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,280
It was spur-of-the-moment.

319
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,900
We're numbing the pain of our miserab lives.

320
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,890
Well,I was trying to do that with exercise
but why risk a heart attack?

321
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,700
Make mine a double!

322
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,400
I don't recognize her.

323
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,640
Who is she?

324
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,110
That's what we're trying to figure out.

325
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,550
Your phone number was written on her hand.

326
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,930
I'm sorry.I can't help you.

327
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
He's had a bit of memory loss.

328
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,460
After 2004,things are...

329
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
fuzzy.

330
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,220
No memory,huh?

331
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,350
That's convenient.

332
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,500
Well,thank you for your time,mr.Delfino.

333
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,640
You killed a cop once,didn't you?

334
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,010
That was self-defense.

335
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,400
Hope it wasn't just beginner's luck.

336
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
You wanna charge me with something,go ahead.

337
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,320
Otherwise,get the hell out of my room.

338
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,770
Were you always this angry,mr.Deino,or can't you remember?

339
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,560
So do you sell by the slice,or do I gotta buy a whole pie?

340
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,800
What are you doing here?

341
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,380
I knew how hard you were working,

342
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,550
so I figured I'd brinyou a little something to eat...

343
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,760
and drink.

344
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,900
You know,I can't pronounce this wine,

345
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,410
which means it's either really expensive or I have had too much.

346
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,270
I can't believe that lynette doesn't just love this place.

347
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,290
And if you ask me,she's just a negative nellie.

348
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,510
She's just being realistic.

349
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,790
I mean,the restaurant business is brutal.

350
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,010
It's--tom.

351
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,350
Listen to me,okay,'cause I'm a very intuitive person,

352
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,190
and you have a real aura of success about you.

353
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,290
Come on.

354
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,950
I'm serious.

355
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,670
I believe in you,

356
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,600
tom scavo.

357
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,930
Thank you.

358
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,750
Wait,wait,what,what--what just happened?

359
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,070
We kissed.

360
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,990
No,you kissed me.

361
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,650
No,no,no,you wanted me to.

362
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,860
No,no,no,no,no,I didn'T.

363
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,200
Really?

364
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,420
Cause this is you. My wife doesn't get me.

365
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,170
Hey,let's have some more wine alone,
in a deserted building.

366
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,990
I was just looking to vent.
I wasn't looking for anything more.

367
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,310
Okay,but when opportunity knocks...

368
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,050
nora,please!

369
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,930
I love my wife!

370
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,730
Really?

371
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,410
You mean,the one who thinks that you're a loser?

372
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,560
No,the one that loves me enough
to keep me from screwing up,

373
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,160
and I think it's about time I got back home to her.

374
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,320
You led me on.

375
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,490
You shouldn't have done that.

376
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,070
I'm just gonna say it.Tequila makes me happy.

377
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,670
Yeah,we're drinking on the porch.
You got a problem with that?

378
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,110
Oh,I know them. They live on cypress.

379
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,440
They just celebrated their 53rd wedding anniversary.

380
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,480
Show-offs.

381
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,160
Don't worry. It won't last.

382
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,420
You're just fooling yourselves!

383
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,920
Hey,I know them.

384
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,220
Oh,53 years.

385
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,030
What do you think their secret is?

386
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,500
I'll take a wild guess.

387
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,130
The man never opened a pizza place.

388
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,230
Oh,I just thought of something.

389
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm never gonna lebrate a 53rd wedding anniversary.

390
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,070
I'd have to live into my 90s.

391
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,530
Oh,my god. I'm gonna die.

392
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,030
Bite on this.

393
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,170
can I tell you guys something...
something I can only tell you guys?

394
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,960
Oh,god,here she goes again.
What grade is he in?

395
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,710
Not what I was gonna say.

396
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,820
What I was gonna say is with all his conniving
and trickery I still love carlos.

397
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,410
Yeah,he's hot.

398
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,680
Anyway,what if I never find
that passion with anybody else?

399
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,500
Well,maybe you should try to patch things up with him.

400
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,460
Nah,I already paid a lawyer. I'm taking him down.

401
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,730
I brought this on myself. I tell tom,
I want you to be your own man.

402
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,050
" But the truth is,I don'T.

403
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,600
I want him to have what he wants if it's what I want.

404
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,900
I'm a bitch with a capital "C.

405
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,460
No! No,you're not!

406
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,200
You're a great wife and a great mother.

407
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,420
Although... don't you have children?

408
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,340
I had passion with mike...

409
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,000
and drama.

410
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,900
Lots of drama.

411
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,800
Love isn't supposed to be that hard.

412
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,940
Oh,sweetie!

413
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,940
But,you know,with ian,everything was always easy.

414
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,560
You know,that's the kind of guy I could
see myself living into my 90s with.

415
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,620
So go to ian!

416
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,610
Tell him you made the wrong choice,
and he's the one you wanna be with.

417
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,450
What have you got to lose?

418
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,350
excuse me,ladies?

419
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,370
Look,susan,god called you a cab.

420
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,190
I'm looking for,uh,4347. Ida greenberg?

421
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,170
I'm ida greenberg!

422
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,420
Yeah,you are!

423
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,430
see you later!

424
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,800
go,ida!

425
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,330
Go,ida!

426
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,720
susan.

427
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,290
You came.

428
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,640
Of course I came.

429
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,070
Oh,I just love your house. It always smells like you.

430
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,040
Oh,my gosh!

431
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,190
What...is the thing... is that tonight?

432
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,250
Well,yes. Isn't that why you're here?

433
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,070
No! No,no!

434
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,610
Actually,I just...I just had something to tell you.

435
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,780
Well,of course.Ah,doug,see if you can find judith for me.

436
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,170
Thank you.

437
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,550
Well,as long as you're here,I want you to
meet that editor I was telling you about.

438
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,950
Oh,I don't think that's a good idea,
cause I-I didn't really bring my "a" game.

439
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,590
is it hot?

440
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,780
Are you sloshed?

441
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,090
susan!

442
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,700
Oh,is this the susan you've been telling us all about?

443
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,850
Yes,this is she.

444
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,760
Could you,um,give us a moment?

445
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,250
Oh,of course.

446
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,510
what's going on?

447
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,440
Nothing.I just had a few drinks with
my girlfriends,and thank god,

448
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:31,060
because it gave me the courage to come
over here and tell you what's really in my heart.

449
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,990
um,go on.

450
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,680
But first,I think I should use the powder room.

451
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,050
Uh,oh...oh,of course. It's,um,it's over there.

452
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,050
She seems nice,ian.

453
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,790
Oh,yes,she's,um,she's absolutely delightful.

454
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,320
oh,I'm so sorry that you had to see that.

455
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,510
I see you've met judith.

456
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,370
so with a hundred bucks riding on it,the pressure's on me now.

457
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,440
I reach into my bag,I grab my 4-iron
and bada bing...hole in one.

458
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,390
And there's been no living with him ever since.

459
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,500
did I not tell you how hilarious these two are together?

460
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,630
Oh,they are a regular barrel of...tish!

461
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,640
Why,hello,bree.

462
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,770
Carolyn.

463
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,400
Do you two know each other?

464
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,680
Well,that saves me an introduction.

465
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,620
Uh,tish,you know,I was wondering if
you need any help with the christmas gala.

466
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,380
Last year,I was on the decoratis committee...

467
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,260
oh,my god,I forgot to call you.What an idiot!

468
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,650
We'll talk first thing tomorrow.

469
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,270
That would be lovely.Thanks.

470
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,400
Nice to see you.

471
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,960
Nice to be seen.

472
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,980
Well,I need to powder my nose. Care to join me?

473
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,020
Oh,I'd love to.

474
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,660
I'm so happy we did this.

475
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,070
Yes,me,too. It's been a delightful evening.

476
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,260
So,so fun.

477
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,740
Could you get us some extra tissues? Thank you.

478
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,140
You know,I realized something just the other day.

479
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,800
You've never seen a picture of alma,have you?

480
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,750
No. Why?

481
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,860
Granted,it's not her best look.

482
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,420
What is all this?

483
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,260
That's the police report that alma filed after orson hit her.

484
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,670
It's all in there... the bruises,contusions,broken wrist.

485
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,670
This is not possible.

486
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,270
Photos don't lie,bree.

487
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,540
Is this why you apologized?

488
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,860
Yes.

489
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:05,840
I wanted you to spend time with me so
you can see I'm not some crazy nut out to get you.

490
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,020
I'm sorry,but if something like that
happened again, I could never forgive myself.

491
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,790
Thank you.

492
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,580
I had a feeling you might need these.

493
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,860
Bring me another one.

494
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,760
Hey,buddy...

495
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,600
you wanna slow down a little bit,huh?

496
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,310
harvey?

497
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,450
Look,I'm going through something,

498
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,330
and I don't have anyone else to talk to about it.

499
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,380
I had an affair.

500
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,580
Uh,does carolyn know?

501
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,070
No,she has no idea.

502
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,420
I met this girl on a flight from paris,and...and we just...mmm,connected.

503
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,850
No,I know it sounds crazy,but it was...

504
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,410
love at first sight.

505
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,160
Well,are you still seeing her?

506
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,860
No,that's the thing.

507
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,430
A few months ago,she stopped returning my calls,
and then I went by her place

508
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,910
and I've looked for her everywhere,
and she's just disappeared.

509
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,000
No,I...I'll tell ya,now I know what you went,
through with alma. It's brutal.

510
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,460
It gets better. Trust me.

511
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,290
I-I just can't get past it. I-I'M...

512
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
I can't get monique out of my mind.

513
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,240
Monique?

514
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,900
That's her name.

515
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,530
Monique...

516
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,050
polier.

517
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,380
Isn't she beautiful?

518
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,150
She'S... very pretty.

519
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,430
They're back.

520
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,420
You two girls were gone a long tim everything okay?

521
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,730
Mm-hmm,absolutely.

522
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,500
So... who wants dessert?

523
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,860
What have you been up to?

524
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,370
just a quiet night with the girls.

525
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,620
listen,something happened tonight,and it got me thinking,and...

526
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,360
you mean more to me than any restaurant ever could.

527
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:35,560
Oh,stop right there.I am the one who should
apologize.I have been a bad wife.

528
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,560
No,no,no,no,no!

529
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,550
You were just trying to keep me from
doing something reckless.

530
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,710
Yeah,well,any wife can support a husband who never takes risks,

531
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,750
and I don't want that kind of husband,
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna be that kind of wife.

532
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,640
So you open your pizza place,and
we will find a way to make it work.

533
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,010
You don't know how much it means to me to hear that.

534
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,110
God,I love U.

535
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,230
So what happened tonight?

536
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,460
Okay,but don't react until I've told you the whole story.

537
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,370
And remember,it's actually a good thing,
because it brought us back together.

538
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,340
Ding-dong.

539
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,780
I don't know what tom told you,but he came on to me.

540
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,100
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

541
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,680
Why don't you just come on over here and say that to me again?

542
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,750
Stay away from me.

543
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,530
I have been trying to stay away from you...

544
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,740
mom?

545
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,010
Everything's all right,so you can just go
back into your room and play.

546
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,730
kayla! Don't move.

547
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,810
Okay. Never mind.

548
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,380
I'm leaving.

549
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,020
First,I'm just gonna giveour mom a hug.

550
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,960
Your association with my family is over.

551
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,730
When kayla comes to visit,you will drop
her at the end of the block.

552
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,910
You will never again see my husband,and if you try to,

553
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:26,980
I will do to your spine what I just did to your front door.

554
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,610
Nod if you understand.

555
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,260
and you,I'm gonna see you on saturday,right?

556
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,100
Don't forget your swimsuit.

557
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,400
Good morning! You're looking bright-eyed and...

558
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,940
bushy.

559
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,720
did you stay here all night?

560
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,160
Well,I slept on the sofa.

561
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,720
When I brought you home,you were still...
as you americans say... tossing your tacos.

562
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,570
please,keep the food references to a minimum.

563
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,080
Bless you.

564
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,380
So what else happened?

565
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,090
You don't remember?

566
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,330
Well,I'll tell you what...
I'll repeat what you said last night,

567
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,880
and you say whether it was you or
the booze talking. Are you ready?

568
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,990
You said you missed me. Susan or booze?

569
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:37,890
Susan.

570
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,230
You said it was a mistake breaking up
with me and that you wanted to start again.

571
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,490
Susan or booze?

572
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,470
Susan.

573
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,730
Then you said that you wanted to dress
me up like a schoolboy and spank my naughty bottom.

574
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,990
Susan or booze?

575
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,610
Oh,I didn't say that.

576
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,700
yeah,all right then,but if you had,um...

577
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,470
susan or booze?

578
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,360
A little of both,so... boozan.

579
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,610
detective ridley.

580
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,230
your jane doe in the morgue is named monique polier.

581
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,630
Who's this?

582
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,760
Just before she died,she was having an affair
with a man named harvey bigsby.

583
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:49,300
You got that?

584
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,120
Yeah. Uh,can I get your name?

585
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,220
I'll need to bring you in for a statement.

586
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,080
carlos,could you come help me?

587
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,790
I'm watching the game.

588
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,710
It'll just take a second. Please?

589
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,010
what,gaby?

590
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,920
You look... nice.

591
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,080
Oh,thanks.I'm gonna go meet some new friends for dinner.

592
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,100
But my zipper's stuck. Can you help me?

593
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,620
man,this is really stuck.

594
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,090
It's like somebody put superglue on it or something.

595
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,330
Weird.

596
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,500
Well,you know what? I don't wanna be late,
so I should probably change.

597
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,930
Oh,carlos,this old thing?

598
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,620
You've seen it all before.

599
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,950
I'm just gonna wear the little blue number.

600
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,050
Will you hand me those stockings?

601
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,160
Oh,I've got a raggedy nail.

602
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,630
you're gonna have to help me put those on.

603
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,510
Are you sure about that?

604
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:21,840
Well,I'd do it myself,but I don't wanna get a snag.

605
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,770
It's been a long time.

606
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,730
Really? It seems like yesterday to me.

607
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,450
You want me to help you hook that?

608
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,540
Sure.

609
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,850
Why not?

610
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,020
For old time's sake.

611
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,510
What about your new friends?

612
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,710
I've decided I'd rather catch up with an old one.

613
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,820
mr.Bigsby,detective ridley,homicide.

614
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,480
I understand you know her.

615
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,460
Uh,all right,yes,we were sleeping together.

616
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,450
Can we do this somewhere else?

617
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,380
Sure.

618
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,100
carlos,do you think we're making a mistake?

619
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,150
What do you mean?

620
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,810
The whole divorce thing.

621
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,480
Maybe we shouldn't go through with it.

622
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,800
It's not like we're gonna find this kind of
passion with anyone else.

623
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,970
Are you saying you wanna stay together?

624
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah,I guess I am.

625
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,210
Why don't we just put all of this behind us and
stay together? What do you say?

626
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,720
Oh,baby...

627
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,630
if you knew how long I waited to hear you say that...

628
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,210
well,what? What's so funny?

629
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,620
Oh,man.

630
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,120
I thought I'd be able to get through this
without cracking up,but you are just too funny.

631
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,920
there's a little something that I need to own up to.

632
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,270
I know that the only reason you slept
with me was because I got a w job.

633
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,030
You got a new job? Honey,that's wonderful!

634
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,650
Gaby,please. You were a model,not a model actress.

635
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
There is no job.

636
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,360
The contracts in my desk were fake. I mailed them to myself.

637
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,530
What?

638
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,240
Why would you do that?

639
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,010
Well,let's see...

640
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,570
you did this just to get me in bed?

641
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:39,090
no,I did it because I knew you'd smell
money and come crawling back.

642
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,210
Then I could turn you down and walk out on my own terms.

643
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,380
Your terms?

644
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,940
You don't get to screw around on me,take
my money and then walk away without a scratch.

645
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:55,650
I want you hurtin',baby,and judging by the look on your face
when you saw 2 million imaginary dollars disappear,

646
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,290
I succeeded.

647
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,910
You are a bastard!

648
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,310
Better a bastard than a whore.

649
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,170
oh,god!

650
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:18,340
Hello?Uh,there's been an
accident. My husband...he...

651
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,680
I'm gonna have to call you back.

652
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,470
carlos?

653
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,130
Honey?

654
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,000
Carlos?

655
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,770
Oh,yeah.

656
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,060
It's on.

657
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:59,550
there is a place in st.Timothy's church
where sinners go to confess their sins.

658
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,440
And once they're done,they expect absolution.

659
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:09,460
But the truth is,not all confessions are
worthy of such forgiveness.

660
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,580
Most who unveil hidden agendas deserve
the condemnation they receive.

661
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:22,630
Most who disclose vengeful motives merit
the punishment that follows.

662
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:29,710
Only the truly repentant have any right
at all to expect a second chance...

663
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,250
come on. What's my surprise?

664
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,260
I thought you'd never get here.

665
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:55,980
which is why it's best to think twice before you confess...

666
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,270
mike?

667
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,960
What's wrong?

668
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,320
That...that girl who died...

669
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,460
especially if you don't know what it is you're confessing to.

670
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,150
I think I knew her.
