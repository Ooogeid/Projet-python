1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,969
Previously on Desperate Housewives

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,319
Can we start over?

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,050
It was a surprising day for
the women of wisteria lane.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,049
Well, I was wondering

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,530
If you might want to
have dinner with me. Okay.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,309
He's giving her orgasms?!
Ah! Not deliberately.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,179
I can see we're going
to be great friends.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,889
You are a vibrant,
attractive woman, you--

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,649
Who hasn't had sex in two years.
That spells "grandma" to me.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,059
Let me come stay with
you when I get outta here.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,229
This guy thinks I'm
out of commission,

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,359
And I want to keep it that
way. What's wrong with you?

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,729
You've been antsy all night.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,089
I think I left the freezer
door at scavo's open

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,599
But it was an even
more surprising night...

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,169
Crap! It's my dad! For the scavos.

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,209
Where is she? Don't. She isn't
wearing anything, all right?

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,909
Who is she? Just some
girl from english class.

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,639
I'm gonna go in the bathroom.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,770
You got 60 seconds to
get her out of here.

21
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,850
That same night

22
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,400
Five minutes later

23
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,009
There was a slight misunderstanding

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,240
In the scavo house that night.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,129
You see, someone in the family

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,450
Was having an affair
with a married wom,

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,000
And lynette scavo
suspected her husband.

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,679
False alarm. The
freezer was shut tight.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,079
Unfortunately for
lynette, she was wrong.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,210
Liar.

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,749
What? I always knew things
could change between us, tom,

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,819
But no matter what,

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,459
The one thing I always thought
I'd get is your respect.

34
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,249
Lynette, what's going on?

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,530
I followed you to the
warehouse. I know everything.

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,840
Oh, boy.

37
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,329
Yeah, at this point,

38
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,169
I think I'm gonna need a
little bit more than that.

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,800
You're right. I shouldn't
have kept this from you.

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,269
And...

41
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,169
You know, for what it's worth, I
wanted to bring you in on it. Huh?

42
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,130
But I was afraid you'd overreact.

43
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,929
That's what you were afraid of?

44
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,289
Hey, I'm upset, too.

45
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,960
But let's face it. Boys will be boys.

46
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,790
I think... I have to sit down now.

47
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,380
Lynette, are you really surprised?

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,240
It's not the first
time this has happened.

49
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,720
And it definitely won't be the last.

50
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,329
You know what? I have to kill
you now. Well, he's your son, too.

51
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,789
Who? Porter!

52
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,789
What are you talking
about? I found out

53
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,789
Porter's been hooking up with
some girl at our warehouse.

54
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,410
What are you talking about?

55
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,989
And just like that,

56
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,070
The slight misunderstanding
in the scavo house had ended...

57
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,380
Hey. What's up?

58
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,510
You're having sex with
your best friend's mother?!

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,309
And a huge family crisis

60
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,980
Had begun.

61
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,180
Desire...It's an emotion
designed to lead us astray,

62
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,650
Causing us to buy
things we can't afford...

63
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,570
Encouraging us to sample desserts

64
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,710
We don't need...

65
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,279
And pushing us into love affairs

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,790
We're clearly not ready for.

67
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,999
I want you to call that woman

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,599
And tell her you are
never seeing her again.

69
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,989
Her name is anne.

70
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,559
Her name is mrs. Schilling.

71
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,859
She was your t-ball
coach when you were 6.

72
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,489
By the way, does
your best friend know

73
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,850
You're sleeping with his mother?

74
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,709
We're keeping our relationship
from kirby for now.

75
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,469
This isn't a relationship.

76
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,589
You are being used by this woman.

77
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,899
No, I'm not. I love her.

78
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,829
Okay, that's it. I'm calling her.

79
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,439
No.

80
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,249
Hey! What if her husband answers?

81
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,269
Gee, porter.

82
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,360
That's just one of the pitfalls
of dating a married woman.

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,749
Listen to me! Mr.
Schilling can't find out.

84
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,359
He--he's totally violent.
He--he would kill her.

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,559
Well, then you have put her
in a very dangerous position,

86
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,820
Haven't you?

87
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,349
Okay. I'll call her.
I'll tell her it's over.

88
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,799
I'm not going to say that you know.

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,809
That'll just freak her out.
But you have to promise me

90
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,399
That you won't say anything
to her psycho husband.

91
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,779
I am not promising anything.
So help me, if I find out

92
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,319
That you do something,
and she gets hurt,

93
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,189
I will leave this
house and I will never

94
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,439
Come back! Oh, please!
You would never do that

95
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,239
Yeah? Well, i-i've
done a lot of things

96
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,940
You never thought I would do.

97
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,860
Wait.

98
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,480
We won't say anything.

99
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,210
But if you don't end this,
you won't have to leave.

100
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,890
We will throw you out.

101
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,600
So... You wanted to see me?

102
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,220
Sit.

103
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,940
Tell us, charlie...

104
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,249
Have you enjoyed working
here at mrs. Van de kamp's?

105
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,869
Yeah. It's great.

106
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,309
You don't feel you've
been underpaid? No.

107
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,539
Well, then perhaps you can explain

108
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,849
Why you stole $200 from the
petty cash box yesterday.

109
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,679
What? I didn't steal anything.

110
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,579
Charlie, we wouldn't accuse you
unless we had concrete evidence,

111
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,620
And thanks to my diligent
partner here, we do.

112
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,790
So am i, like... Fired?

113
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,179
You're more than "like" fired.

114
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,240
You're fired. And, of course,
we want our money back.

115
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,289
Uh, I don't have have it. I spent it.

116
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,769
Well, then I suggest
you return your purchase.

117
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,199
Do you have a receipt?

118
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,950
Yeah. Yeah, like pot
dealers give receipts.

119
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,709
Well, you've just covered
yourself in glory on this one.

120
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,529
Just... Please,
don't tell my parents.

121
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,640
I'll get you the money. I promise.

122
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,339
Can you believe it?
A thief and a pothead!

123
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,499
Well, at least we know now

124
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,760
Where the 2 pounds
of cookie dough went.

125
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,870
Too many?

126
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,170
Yeah. I gotta have one more. Ah!

127
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,649
Thank you for doing this.

128
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,929
Ah, well... We needed to
wipe the slate clean, right?

129
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,850
Mm. And honestly?

130
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,479
This is the best second
first date I've ever had.

131
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,610
Isn't it?

132
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,090
And knowing we're not gonna have sex

133
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,970
Takes all the pressure off.

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,790
That's... Something we know?

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,959
Yes.

136
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,279
We're starting completely over,

137
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,730
So this time, we're
gonna do things right.

138
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,370
W-which means what?

139
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,230
Well, it means...

140
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,189
No sex until at least date four.

141
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,819
Ah. I want us to spend this time

142
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,789
Really getting to know each other.

143
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,389
I-i do know you. What's
my least favorite word?

144
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,660
"phlegm."

145
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,439
You're just guessing.

146
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,879
It's "panties."

147
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,449
Ohh. Although some days
it's "larva" or "chunks."

148
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,049
Well, I will try to remember that.

149
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,710
Mm. Now you tell me something
I don't know about you.

150
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,280
Okay.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm a painter.

152
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,660
I sort of guessed that
when you painted my house.

153
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,980
I mean, I paint... Art.

154
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,930
Like... On a canvas, in a frame.

155
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,549
Seriously?

156
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,370
I went to art school in paris.

157
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,590
And my professor had a beret,
so you know he was good.

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,129
So now you're
painting... My bathroom?

159
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,310
Yeah.

160
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,500
It sucks.

161
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,260
But I've been blocked
for the past year.

162
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,729
Blocked? Yeah.

163
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,670
I mean, I keep trying to
start new pieces, but...

164
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,870
Nothing comes. It's...
Driving me crazy.

165
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,860
Well, I'm sorry things
aren't going well.

166
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,860
But I'm glad you told me.

167
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,470
See? We're getting
to know each other.

168
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,850
And we wouldn't have if we'd
spent the whole night in bed.

169
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,040
And now I'm creatively
and sexually frustrated.

170
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,460
First dates are awesome.

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,509
Jeez, roberta, I know you
hate to throw anything away,

172
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,029
But do you have the garbagemen
bringing you stuff now?

173
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,810
Pardon my french, but what's
french for "kiss my ass"?

174
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,569
So you said dave has a secret.

175
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,340
Now how you gettin' that from this?

176
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,389
It's just a bunch of
phone numbers. Yeah,

177
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,959
It may be just a
bunch of numbers to you

178
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,519
But to a savvy sleuth with a keen eye

179
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,079
And the nose of a
bloodhound-- yeah,

180
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,129
Yeah, you're miss
marple with a bum liver

181
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,090
So what's he hiding?

182
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,859
Let me walk you through it.
Around the 1st of every month,

183
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,089
Dave gets a string of
calls-- five or six--

184
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,389
From this number in boston.

185
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,359
They're all short--
10, 15 seconds.

186
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,679
My guess is he's not picking up.

187
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,350
Somebody's leaving him messages. You
know, buggin' him. Once a month, huh?

188
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,099
My guess is it's an ex-wife
looking for her alimony.

189
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,389
Except it's not. You see this?

190
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,199
After a few days,
he always calls back.

191
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,910
And who, you ask, is he calling?

192
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,639
A hospital in boston.

193
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
It's the office of
dr. Samuel heller...

194
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,590
Psychiatrist.

195
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,780
So... Once a month,

196
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,799
Dave whines about his life

197
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,440
To a beantown headshrinker, huh?

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,350
Big whoop.

199
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,199
I looked up your
davey's doc on the web.

200
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,149
He's not your garden-variety shrink.

201
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,259
He's a renowned psychiatrist
and published author

202
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,780
With a very specialized
field of expertise.

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,270
And that, my dear watson,

204
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,300
Is your neighbor's little secret.

205
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,000
Treating the criminally insane

206
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,869
Oh, lap of luxury,

207
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,640
Hoi've missed sitting in you.

208
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,270
Celia! Juanita!

209
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,110
Chef is taking fresh-baked
cookies out of the oven.

210
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,099
You're not gonna catch me!

211
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,979
Oh, I can't tell you how nice it is

212
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,650
To hear the sound of children's
laughter in this house.

213
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,020
You know what I was thinking?

214
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,089
Why don't you all stay the weekend?

215
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,090
Ooh, we'd love to. Jeez, we can't.

216
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,489
Why not? Celia's
birthday party is sunday.

217
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,139
We've gotta get ready
for it, remember?

218
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,419
What's to get ready?
You buy a $9 sheet cake

219
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,990
And fling a piata over a
tree and bam! Party time.

220
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,670
But I don't have a change of clothes.

221
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,939
My nephew left a whole
closet full of old clothes.

222
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,629
I'm sure something will fit you.

223
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,959
Well... Carlos, just nod your head,

224
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,379
'cause I ain't leaving this
pool. Oh, good. It's settled.

225
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,099
Oh, gaby. Your
margarita's getting low.

226
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,280
I'll send brandon
out with a fresh one.

227
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,720
Thank you.

228
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,719
What are you doing?

229
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,099
What? You heard the woman.
She wants children's laughter.

230
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,419
And I want the lobster the
chef is serving for dinner.

231
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,709
It's a win-win. I just don't
feel comfortable with this.

232
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,629
Why not?

233
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,030
I mean, look at this
place. It's like shangri-la.

234
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,669
Wow, you're right. The
pitch black I see here

235
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,750
Is much more dazzling
than the one at home.

236
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,379
What is your problem?

237
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,479
My problem is that it's a bad idea

238
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,029
To mix business and pleasure.

239
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,679
Says the man who massaged
her into an orgasm.

240
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,799
Even more reason to keep
some professional distance.

241
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,599
Carlos, she is just
a lonely old woman

242
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,929
Yearning for some
friendship and human contact.

243
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,690
And i, for one, am
happy to be that human.

244
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,400
Mrs. Solis? Your margarita.

245
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,130
Oh, shoot. I can't reach it.

246
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,789
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

247
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,179
Hey. You bring beer?

248
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,779
Was I supposed to? No.
Tom was supposed to.

249
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,399
Gosh. Sorry. I thought the
two cases I bought monday

250
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,429
Would've lasted more
than one rehearsal.

251
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,279
Boys, we're better
off not drinking today.

252
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,740
We've got a lot of work to
do and only one week to do it.

253
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,200
What are you talking about?

254
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,529
We are playing

255
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,060
Battle of the bands
at the white horse!

256
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,559
Uh, dave? Battle of the
bands isn't for amateurs.

257
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,180
You gotta audition.

258
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,910
Uh, we don't.

259
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,119
Edie's got a real estate buddy
whose husband owns the club.

260
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,279
You're kidding. We're
playing an actual gig?

261
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,449
In front of people
who aren't listening

262
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,919
Just because I pay their
allowance? Well, this is fantastic!

263
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,669
Yes! But that means
the pressure's on.

264
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,389
We gotta really
rehearse our cover stuff

265
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,290
And... We need an original song.

266
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,339
I don't know anything
about songwriting.

267
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,570
I-i know a little
bit. No, you don't.

268
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,559
It's fine. Mike and I
will write something.

269
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,990
You got a little time later?
Not tonight. I got plans.

270
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,410
"plans

271
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,220
What's her name?

272
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,380
Can we just rehearse, please?

273
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,839
You know, I heard
that susan and jackson

274
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,479
Broke up. I heard
they got back together

275
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,790
It's not susan. Stop guessing.

276
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,640
Also, get lives.

277
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,300
Whatever, mike,

278
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,260
Just so long as you're having fun.

279
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,209
Hey! Who said you--
turn the board around.

280
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,880
Get back here. No! Come out
here and show me some moves!

281
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,529
Sorry to bother you.

282
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,770
Just wanted to see if you needed
anything before I go off to bed.

283
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,459
No, we're good. Sure you don't
want to order margarita number 12?

284
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,349
You sure you don't want
to shut your piehole?

285
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,640
It's so cute, how you two bicker.

286
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,259
Carlos, how do those pajamas fit you?

287
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,159
They're perfect.

288
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,509
I-i hope your nephew doesn't
mind that I was wearing 'em.

289
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,860
He'll never know. We're estranged.

290
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,020
Oh. Okay.

291
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,530
Anyway, we're good.
So have a nice night.

292
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,460
Oh! What's that?

293
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,329
Some animated thing.

294
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,160
I love animated movies.

295
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,499
The girls wanted to watch it,

296
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,769
So we're kind of having
a family movie night.

297
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,200
Ooh, that sounds like fun!

298
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,240
My heavens, is that penguin surfing?

299
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,340
Gee, I don't know. I can't
really see the screen anymore.

300
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,049
Oh, dear. I'm being rude.

301
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,600
Oh, that's okay.

302
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,010
There. That's better.

303
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,150
Did she just crawl under... Oh, yeah.

304
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,169
And so there I was in ninth grade,

305
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,939
And my boobs had not
made an appearance.

306
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,340
I was desperate.

307
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,639
Here. Let me refill that for you.

308
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,690
And so that's when
I got caught stuffing

309
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,110
At the pep rally.

310
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,469
And six months later... Kaboom.

311
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,940
I was voted prom
queen. Nice work, girls.

312
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,179
Stop that right now.

313
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,129
What?

314
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,180
The sex music. Turn it off.

315
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,150
That--that's
not sex music.

316
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,109
We are not having sex
until date number four,

317
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,779
And this is date number two.

318
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,440
I know what it is.

319
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,079
It--it's just that you
look so hot in these pants,

320
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,440
And your hair smells so good.

321
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,010
And your eyes...

322
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,120
Look, I made you dinner. Come on.

323
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,189
Jackson-- I braised
beef for you.

324
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,829
Do you know what a pain in
the ass it is to braise meat?

325
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,699
Okay, do you know how sad it makes me

326
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,120
To know that you only
braised it to boink me?

327
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,609
You're supposed to be
asking me questions.

328
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,350
The point of all this was to
get to know each other better.

329
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,439
How is it gonna make
our relationship stronger

330
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,959
For me to know that
in the fifth grade,

331
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,109
They sent you to the therapist

332
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,970
'cause you wouldn't
stop chewing your hair?

333
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,009
You know, that was
hard for me to share,

334
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,070
And the fact that you
just make light of it...

335
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,430
No, I'm am calling the
second date officially over.

336
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,910
And you know what?

337
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,779
I was going to let you
feel me up over my blouse.

338
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,760
But now? Nada.

339
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,479
So before we wrap up here,

340
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,159
We still need some chaperones
for the junior prom.

341
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,169
Anne schilling is
coordinating the volunteers,

342
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,050
And she could really use some help.

343
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,510
Nobody?

344
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,420
I know we're all busy,

345
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,590
But this is important.

346
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,930
We want our kids to have
fun, but let's face it.

347
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,400
If we don't keep an eye on them,

348
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,310
God only knows what kind
of trouble they'll get into.

349
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,070
Helen?

350
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,820
Marjorie? You'll help?

351
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,800
Fantastic. Thanks, guys.

352
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,070
Hey, lynette.

353
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,659
Do these meetings
keep getting longer,

354
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,360
Or do they just seem that way?

355
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,760
I don't know.

356
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,830
So...

357
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,730
How's the family?

358
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,839
I haven't seen penny in so long,

359
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,480
And all the kids are
getting so big now.

360
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,970
I guess the boys will be
going off to clege soon.

361
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,509
Aah! Lynette!

362
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,680
I know everything, okay?

363
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,760
Ok...

364
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,080
I'm sorry, but...

365
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,050
It's important for
you to understand...

366
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,870
I love porter.

367
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,599
So do i.

368
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,599
And if you ever lay
a hand on him again,

369
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,900
You will find out just how much.

370
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,129
Oh, bree. I've got good news.

371
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,590
Me, too. You go first.

372
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,929
I hired a girl to replace
that thief charlie.

373
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,779
Oh. Well, are you
sure she's trustworthy?

374
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,279
Well, she comes with
a strong recommendation

375
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,209
From the head of the
local f.B.I. Office--

376
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,029
Her father, who's mormon.

377
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,139
Well done, orson!

378
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,220
Thank you. Your turn.

379
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,989
"the new christian
reader" just published

380
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,319
An advance review of
my cookbook. Listen!

381
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,029
"mrs. Van de kamp's colorful
stories of her upbringing

382
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,759
"show her upstanding values,

383
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,819
But her recipes are
sinfully delicious."

384
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,760
They gave me four halos!

385
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,319
Then I think this
is appropriate--

386
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,740
Holy cow!

387
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,479
I have to admit,

388
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,889
I had some reservations
about us working together,

389
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,389
But this has succeeded
beyond my wildest dreams.

390
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,229
Mmm. We're quite a team, aren't we?

391
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,049
Yeah, and the best part is

392
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,099
We get to see each
other all the time.

393
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,909
Mm-hmm, I know, which
makes the hardest part

394
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,800
Keeping my hands
off you all the time.

395
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,450
Orson!

396
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,470
You can't be serious! Here?

397
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,719
This kitchen is the
birthplace of our triumphs.

398
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,470
What better place to
celebrate them, hmm?

399
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,639
Ooh! Oh, this counter's
hard on my head.

400
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,549
Do you want me to stop?

401
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,929
No. Get me an oven mitt.

402
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,250
Right.

403
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,600
Oh, much better.

404
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,009
Rise and shine, girls.

405
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,460
Rise
and shi--

406
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,819
Oh, my god!

407
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,239
What are you doing?!

408
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,860
Gaby, it's fine. We're just
doing a little art project.

409
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,179
I told the the girls

410
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,120
They could decorate the
room any way they wanted.

411
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,939
I'm making a castle.

412
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,099
It's stupid.

413
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,890
No, you're stupid!

414
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,249
You're both stupid. Stop it!

415
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,989
Um, mrs. Hildebrand, this
is really nice of you.

416
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,479
But why would you want to
ruin your beautiful room?

417
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,860
Oh, it's not my room
anymore. It's their room.

418
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,619
What?

419
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,129
Yes. It's the room
they'll be staying in

420
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,780
Whenever you come to visit.

421
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,320
They're getting a new tv, bunk beds.

422
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,370
I'll have it ready by the
time you get here next weekend.

423
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,509
Uh... Next weekend, uh,

424
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,470
Carlos and I have plans.

425
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,090
Well, I bet the girls don't.
I'll send a car for them.

426
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,189
I... Don't think

427
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,640
That's such a good idea.

428
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,339
How about it, girls? Wanna
spend next weekend here? Yay!

429
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,440
Yay! Thank you. Mrs. Hildebrand.

430
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,669
Oh! Oh! What did I tell you?

431
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,200
Sorry. Thank you, grandma.

432
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,470
Oh, come!

433
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,799
"grandma"? She told them
to call her "grandma"?

434
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,560
Yeah, and that's why we're leaving.

435
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,879
After you told her
you'd stay all weekend?

436
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,899
How we gonna do that? I
don't know. Make an excuse.

437
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,460
Say you ha some blind
thing you have to go to.

438
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,699
We have to be very careful here.

439
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,950
This woman has a lot of
pull at the country club.

440
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,599
Plus, we've got that europe
trip coming up. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

441
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,069
We're not going to
europe with grandma

442
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,049
Nutjob. I'm not walking
away from $100,000

443
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,339
We need that money.
Carlos, it's not worth it.

444
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,700
She's really starting to
freak me out. Damn it, gaby.

445
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,319
I told you it was dangerous
getting chummy with the clients.

446
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,569
You wouldn't listen. You
had to stay for the lobster.

447
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,339
Hey, I seem to remember some
melted butter on your bib, too.

448
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,830
Now how we getting out of here?

449
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,550
Look, she knows we've got
celia's party tomorrow.

450
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,009
I'll tell her we have
to go shopping for that.

451
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,690
Everything will be fine.

452
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,000
Sorry.

453
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,759
I had to wait for my
folks to go to the store

454
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,400
Before I could sneak
out. What's wrong?

455
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,100
Are you okay?

456
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,790
I don't know what to do.

457
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,820
About what? Let me help you.

458
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,399
It's just all such a mess.

459
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,829
Wait. Is this about my mom?

460
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,550
Did she do something else to you?

461
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,459
Did she call your husband? No.

462
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,860
Well, then what? Tell me.

463
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,420
I'm pregnant.

464
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,989
Hey,o you mind if I
cut out early today?

465
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,099
I don't see why not.

466
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,739
I mean, everything's,
uh, pretty much done here.

467
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,640
You can go now if you like. Thanks.

468
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,949
Andrew. Don't you look handsome?

469
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,620
Do i? Great.

470
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,170
Something wrong?

471
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,909
You remember charlie, the kid
you guys fired for stealing?

472
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,939
Well, he called and asked
how you could prove it,

473
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,780
And I said, "we've got a
surveillance tape, scuzzball."

474
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,729
Well, uh, guess who stole

475
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,500
The surveillance tape last night.

476
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,990
That does it. We're pressing charges.

477
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,499
Uh, you--you might want
to hold off on that,

478
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,220
Because according to charlie,

479
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,310
The surveillance tape
is also a sex tape.

480
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,410
What?

481
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,649
Yeah, he said it shows a
couple really going at it.

482
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,790
So...

483
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,740
Any idea who those
crazy kids might be?

484
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,490
Oh, dear god.

485
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,920
Yep. Kinda thought so.

486
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,310
How could this be happening?

487
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,879
Before anything got serious,

488
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,550
I made a point of
turning the camera off.

489
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,699
Wait, I turned it off, too.
I didn't see you do that.

490
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,460
No, you were looking
for the olive oil.

491
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,740
Obviously, you turned it back on.

492
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,549
We need to, um, get that tape back.

493
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,099
Yeah, well, break out your checkbook,

494
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,169
'cause he wants 2
grand for it. $2,000?!

495
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,400
Yeah, or he's gonna
post it on youtube.

496
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,559
What are we gonna do? Well,
first you need to decide

497
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,109
What your porn names are gonna be.

498
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,179
Okay, this is not a joke. My
book comes out next month--

499
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,710
My old-fashioned,
traditional cookbook!

500
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,430
This could ruin me!

501
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,209
All right, bree. We'll just pay him.

502
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,339
No! I-i refuse to pay
blackmail to some hooligan

503
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,220
Who's stolen from us twice!

504
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,690
Andrew...

505
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,439
All my life, I have
done my best to teach you

506
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,919
To respect god and the law

507
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,520
And never to harm
another living thing.

508
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,259
I want you to forget
every one of those lessons

509
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,480
If it'll help you get that tape back.

510
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,039
So... Carte blanche?

511
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,089
Uh... Within reason.

512
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,410
We are not condoning
arson or violence or--

513
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,120
Orson, don't cramp the boy's style.

514
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,210
Hey, sweetie. Now don't
forget to make a wish.

515
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,640
Happy birthday!

516
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,230
Happy birthday.

517
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,739
Virginia! What, uh,
are you doing here?

518
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,440
I came to give celia
her birthday gift.

519
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,939
Well, she's a little busy
with her friends right now,

520
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,730
So just give it to me, and
I'll make sure she gets it.

521
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,399
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

522
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,979
You see, for my present,
I'm gonna take her to a shop

523
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,649
That sells the most
exquisite antique dolls

524
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,970
And let her pick
whichever one she likes.

525
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,119
Well, she's not gonna leave
her party to go buy a doll.

526
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,159
Well, of course not. I'll wait
on the porch till it's over.

527
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,179
Uh, look, I'm sorry,

528
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,920
But I don't want you
driving off with my daughter.

529
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,700
Well, you know she'll
be safe with me.

530
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,240
But if you'd feel
better joining us...

531
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,200
You sure are making this hard.

532
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,599
I have tried to be nice, but I
am running out of polite here,

533
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,270
So I'm just gonna say knock it off.

534
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,329
I'm sorry. Knock off what?

535
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,549
This whole creepy, clingy
"i'm your grandma" routine.

536
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,959
But I've come to feel like
a grandmother to the girls.

537
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,930
In three days. That's
the creepy part.

538
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,970
What a hurtful thing to say,

539
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,579
Especially given how generous
I've been to your family.

540
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,009
Yeah, too generous.

541
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,889
It's like you're trying
to buy us or something.

542
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,230
Well, we're not for
sale, so just back off!

543
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,450
Who do you think you're talking to?

544
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,300
You wicked, ungrateful girl!

545
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,119
You're not the first greedy bitch

546
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,669
Who's tried to bleed me dry
and then wash her hands of me.

547
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,790
Okay, we're done here. Good-bye.

548
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,009
Am I not making myself
clear? Get off my property!

549
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,080
Gaby.

550
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,400
What's going on?

551
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,020
I came to buy celia a doll.

552
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,690
I believe you've
heard gaby's response.

553
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,560
Virginia, please.

554
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,499
Allow me to apologize.

555
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,160
I think it's a little late for that.

556
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,310
Thank you...

557
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,300
For a wonderful third date.

558
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,169
And I'm glad that you're
back on board with our plan.

559
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,089
Yeah, I really think

560
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,839
I'm starting to get
something out of it.

561
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,170
Mmm. Oh, pop quiz!

562
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,000
Why did kim beale stop
talking to me in eighth grade?

563
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,390
Well, you told erin connors
about her nose job. Right!

564
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,099
What time is it?

565
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,979
Uh, 10:48?

566
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,320
No. It's sex time!

567
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,259
Hey. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, susan.

568
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,599
What?! Stop.

569
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,819
We're not having sex till
the fourth date, remember?

570
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,880
Jackson, look at me.

571
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,659
I'm tipsy. I'm horny.

572
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,930
I'm easier than a
5-year-old's homework.

573
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,070
I'll call you tomorrow.

574
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,850
The forehead?

575
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,719
I hate to say anything, stan,

576
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,020
But you are president
of the country club.

577
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,009
You need to know

578
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,070
That the way carlos touched
me during my last massage...

579
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,990
Well, let's just say it
was highly inappropriate.

580
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,429
And that kind of behavior

581
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,030
Is a liability the club can't afford.

582
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,880
Good.

583
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,670
I appreciate your taking care of it.

584
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,099
Hello? Uh, hello. Is this dr. Heller?

585
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,729
Speaking. Who's calling? I'm
maggie carr at hilltop insurance.

586
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,769
We have an applicant

587
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,979
For a new term life insurance policy,

588
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,590
And he lists you as a
previous care provider.

589
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,039
I was hoping to verify
his medical history.

590
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,759
The name's dave williams.

591
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,849
Dave williams? I don't
know a dave williams.

592
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,270
Well, sure you do. You
call him every month.

593
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,250
How would maggie know
that?! Uh, I'm guessing.

594
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,270
Who is this?

595
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,429
Uh, hi, dr. Heller.

596
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,579
I'm, uh, lindsay thorne.
I'm maggie's supervisor.

597
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,820
And she's confused
and about to get fired.

598
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,389
And, uh, we just need you
to confirm for our records

599
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,950
That you're treating a
man named david williams.

600
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,220
What is your medicare i.D. Number?

601
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,499
Um... I'm not sure.

602
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,780
We're in the process of
converting to the metric system.

603
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,270
I don't know who this is,

604
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,700
But are you aware that what
you are doing is illegal?

605
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,449
Okay, look. We're just trying
to get some info on this guy.

606
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,379
He just moved to fairview,

607
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,260
And he's really creeping people out.

608
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,229
You're in fairview?

609
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,840
Yeah. Why? Does that
mean something to ya?

610
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,729
No, I'm just trying to
get all the info I need

611
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,549
When I contact the
federal authorities

612
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,920
To let them
know that--

613
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,610
Well, we really screwed
the pooch on that one.

614
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,659
Yeah, back to the drawing board.

615
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,560
Can I irish that up for ya?

616
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,120
It's noon somewhere.

617
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,689
You got the tape! How
did you manage that?

618
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,349
Orson, we don't need to know.

619
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,999
No, you don't, but
it's kind of amazing

620
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,659
What you can get a bunch of
bikers to do for a case of beer.

621
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,049
Oh, my. Well, I better destroy this.

622
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,600
Actually, you may
want to watch it first.

623
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,320
Why? I'm embarrassed enough as it is.

624
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,309
Humor me. I'll cue it up.

625
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,070
You watched it?! Well, I had to
make sure it was the right disk.

626
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,880
Here, just watch a little bit.

627
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,999
Oh, dear god. I can't look.

628
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,470
Really, andrew.

629
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,819
Wait. Bree, that's not us.

630
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,319
What? Well, who is it then?

631
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,399
Wait, wait. He flips
her in just a sec.

632
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,800
This is where it gets good.

633
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,639
Katherine!

634
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,900
And mike.

635
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,529
Just so you know, I'm--i'm
never eating anything

636
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,170
That comesut of that kitchen again.

637
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,000
Jackson?

638
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,629
I am declari this

639
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,840
Our official fourth date, okay?

640
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,609
The rules have been followed,

641
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,240
And you may begin disrobing...

642
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,079
Now.

643
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,130
Uh, I'm--i'm--i'm--i'm kind
of doing something right now.

644
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,699
Okay, I just ran into
your house half-naked.

645
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,010
The only thing you
should be doing is me.

646
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,200
What is on your face?

647
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,700
Is that paint?

648
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,789
Are you painting again?

649
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,580
Uh, y-yeah.

650
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,380
I thought you were blocked.

651
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,009
I was, but, uh...

652
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,519
Not having sex for a few days

653
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,519
Kinda got my juices flowing
in a different direction.

654
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,459
So now i-i really
need to finish, so--

655
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,220
So you've broken through
your creative logjam?

656
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,779
Congratulations!

657
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,829
Ooh, why not celebrate

658
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,649
By ripping off my
clothes with your teeth?

659
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,819
I... Can't. I'm not finished yet.

660
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,289
How close are you? 'cause I can wait.

661
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,420
Wait, wait, no. No, don't--
don't look at that... Yet.

662
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,620
That's me.

663
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,740
Yeah. Uh, it's...

664
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,260
Supposed to be.

665
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,170
That look on my face...

666
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,820
I've seen  before...

667
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,630
In the mirror, when I'm feeling...

668
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,530
How do you know about that look?

669
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,280
I-i know a lot about you.

670
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,010
I know your cheeks get red
when people say you're pretty.

671
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,099
I know that your
eyes start to tear up

672
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,380
Whenever you talk
about your grandfather.

673
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,800
And I know that when
you're really sad,

674
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,190
You get that beautiful, haunted look

675
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,650
That you try to shake off
before anybody can see it.

676
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,820
I can't believe I ever
thought you didn't know me.

677
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,880
Well, I guess I should
let you finish this.

678
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm sort of missing hands.

679
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,550
Actually, that is one detail
I could use some help with.

680
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,159
Really?

681
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,859
Unless you have a
problem posing naked.

682
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,200
Oh. Come on.

683
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,660
I think you know the answer to that.

684
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,039
Hello, katherine.

685
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,370
Um, I thought you might
want this videota...

686
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,780
From our surveillance camera.

687
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,950
We have a surveillance camera?

688
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,860
Yes, in the, uh, test kitchen.

689
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,890
Oh, my god.

690
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,349
So that means you saw me and...

691
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,249
Mike. Yes, indeedy.

692
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,290
Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

693
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,539
Oh, what you must think of me!

694
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,659
Let's not dwell on it. Oh! I
mean, having sex in the kitchen,

695
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,909
Where food's prepared...

696
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,629
What kind of a demented
slut would do that?

697
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,450
I said... Let's not dwell on it.

698
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,030
Thanks for bringing it by.

699
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,389
Katherine, I'm sorry,
but I just have to ask--

700
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,880
Are you sure you know what
you're doing? Meaning what?

701
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,300
Meaning susan is your
oldest friend on this street.

702
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,689
She divorced him, bree, and
she's seeing someone else.

703
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,500
Why can't mike do that?

704
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,630
Because she's your
friend, and we're women.

705
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,870
We don't do that to each other.

706
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,120
Look...

707
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,339
I've been alone for five years.

708
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,899
I'm finally in a relationship,

709
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,790
And you're trying to
make me feel guilty?

710
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,550
Is that what I saw on
the tape-- a relationship?

711
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,980
I don't know what it is.

712
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,570
All I know is...

713
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,510
I'm having the time of my life.

714
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,589
Fair enough. But just be careful,

715
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,540
I mean, this is very complicated.

716
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,750
I'd hate to see it end badly.

717
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,620
Hey, breakfast's on the table.

718
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,909
Porter, this whole hating me thing

719
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,529
That you've got
going on right now--

720
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,810
Believe it or not, I get
where you're coming from.

721
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,829
I don't hate you.

722
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,739
But one day,

723
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,000
You are gonna meet someone more...

724
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,910
Appropriate.

725
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,839
Someone who want the same
things that you do out of life.

726
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,800
Then you are gonna
know what real love is.

727
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,619
And when you do, I hope
you will finally see

728
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,800
Where I am coming from.

729
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,060
It's me. Can you talk?

730
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,820
Hey, gary. I'm running kind
of late. Can I call you later?

731
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,620
Just listen.

732
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,940
I can leave town saturday.

733
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,829
You have the money, right?

734
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,740
Yeah. No problem.

735
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,980
I love you.

736
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,020
I know where you're coming from, mom.

737
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,550
And...

738
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,929
I-i want you and dad to know

739
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,600
That I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

740
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,800
Good.

741
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,480
I'll see you downstairs.

742
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,100

Desire--

743
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,860
It's an emotion designed
to lead us astray,

744
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,710
Persuading those who crave
love to make foolish choices...

745
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,150
Causing those who yearn for family

746
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,320
To act out in anger...

747
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,570
Allowing those who are lonely...

748
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,060
To behave in reckless ways.

749
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,739
And when the pursuit
of our heart's desire

750
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,680
Becomes an obsession,

751
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,459
The best we can hope for

752
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,170
Is a caring friend
willing to come along...

753
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,560
Hi. I'd like to book the
next flight to fairview.

754
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,810
And stop us.
