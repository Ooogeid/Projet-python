1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Previously on Desperate Housewives

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,795
A call was made.

3
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:04,970
sweetie, where are you?

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,195
I don't wanna tell you.

5
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:07,370
and if porter doesn't show up for cot,

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,270
We're gonna lose our restaurant!

7
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,540
A guy threatens to kill your son,

8
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,810
And that's what you're worried about?

9
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,570
And as one love affair blossomed, another...

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,590
-You were married before? -she's dead.

11
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,045
I want you out of my house.

12
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:21,470
withered on the vine.

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,610
Mike delfino has to pay for taking you away from me.

14
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,130
I want him to lose what I lost.

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,780
 it had been a long journey

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
For david williams,

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,310
And though it began years ago,

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,670
He remembered every step of it...

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,070
Walking outside his front door

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,240
To find a policeman with news of a car crash...

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,250
Running into the hospital

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,680
Only to be told

23
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,380
His wife and daughter had died...

24
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,880
No! let go of me!

25
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,810
Being dragged into a psychiatric facility

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,520
After his mental breakdown...

27
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,790
Strolling into a hotel weeks after being released

28
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,380
And bumping into a beautiful blonde...

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,680
Marching down the aisle with a woman who

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,100
as it turned out,once lived on the same street

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,370
With the man who had killed his family.

32
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,610
But his bride was now unhappy,

33
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,760
And dave williams was worried

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,390
That his dream of revenge had been destroyed.

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,150
Luckily for dave,

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,410
Fate was about to take some steps of its own.

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,060
Hey, dave!

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,490
What's going on?

39
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,290
Edie and I had a fight.

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,380
I take it you're giving her time to calm down?

41
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,410
No, I think I'm looking for a place to stay

42
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,070
While she's looking for a lawyer.

43
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,540
Oh, man, i...

44
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,360
Wanna say something helpful, but all I got is "that sucks."

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,630
That it does.

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,730
So where are you headed?

47
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,510
Oh, it's such a nice night,

48
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,410
I thought I'd walk to at motel on the interstate.

49
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,150
Might as well enjoy the stars while my life falls apart.

50
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,410
It's getting late, and so, uh...

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,900
Hey, why don't you stay with me?

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,990
Really?

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,800
I wouldn't want to impose.

54
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,470
Dave, you saved my life.

55
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,710
I owe ya.

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,320
Well, now that you mention it, I guess you do.

57
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,670
Come on in.

58
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,610
And just like that,

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,900
Dave's dream of revenge was salvaged...

60
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,550
Lead the way, roomie.

61
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,430
And he started to feel

62
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,800
His long journey would soon be over.

63
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,990
At 9:02 the next morning...

64
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,860
Edie williams began calling her friends

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,750
To let them know

66
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,810
Something humiliating had happened to her.

67
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,420
By 9:06, her friends had begun to arrive,

68
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,340
Just so they could hear the juicy details.

69
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,960
So he was married before.

70
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,000
You don't kick a man out for that.

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,230
No.

72
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,790
But you do for never mentioning it.

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,800
And especially when I laid out my entire past.

74
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,210
Emphasis on the word "laid."

75
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,670
Oh. exactly. gaby gets it.

76
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,490
Well, maybe they were only together a short time,

77
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,950
she didn't mean anything to him.

78
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,385
I doubt it,

79
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:51,790
since he walks around muttering to her ghost.

80
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,260
You know what would lift your spirits?

81
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,650
-We should all do a spa weekend. -yeah! let's do that.

82
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,260
Oh, I appreciate the offer,

83
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,730
But I think I'm better off getting lost in my work.

84
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,020
Maybe I can help you. think you can rent my house out?

85
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,130
What?

86
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,670
Jackson got a teaching job at the college in riverton,

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,230
And...I'm going with him.

88
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,290
Uh, wait, you're moving?

89
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,620
I know it's sudden, but I feel really good about this.

90
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,120
And it's only two hours away,

91
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,570
So it'll still be like we're practically next door.

92
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,790
I am so happy for you, but we're gonna miss you.

93
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,310
Oh, don't worry about us. jackson is so great.

94
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,910
You are making the right choice.

95
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,820
Absolutely. come here, you! aw!

96
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,380
When you're done here, you wanna come do my lawn?

97
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,680
Well, I figure since mike's letting me crash here,

98
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,285
It's the least I could do.

99
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:04,150
well, that's very nice and brave

100
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,210
Mike takes a lot of pride in his yard.

101
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,130
-Yeah. -look at his roses.

102
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,490
Every time I walk by here, I just want to steal one.

103
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,500
-Here, let me cut you one. -oh, no. couldn't.

104
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,990
He wouldn't like that.

105
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,130
Hey, you. what's up?

106
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,410
Not much.

107
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,490
Got a call from dylan.

108
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,700
Her husband's traveling more for his business,

109
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,340
And she doesn't have anybody to help her with the baby.

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,130
She's trying to push me to move out to baltimore.

111
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,020
So, uh, what'd you say?

112
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,210
Oh, just that I'd think about it.

113
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,190
What do you think I should do?

114
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,080
Well, she really needs your help.

115
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,600
I guess you should help her.

116
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,800
Well, I don't know that she need it.

117
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,130
Honestly? I think she's just lonely.

118
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,220
Of course... it would be nice to be closer.

119
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,380
But is that a good enough reason

120
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,770
To uproot my whole life here?

121
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,890
What do you think?

122
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,490
I'm not sure. it's up to you.

123
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,860
I know. I just...

124
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,620
Thought you might have an opinion.

125
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,780
Oh, shoot. I'm, uh, expecting a call from a supplier.

126
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,540
I'll, uh, I'll talk to you later.

127
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,780
On second thought,

128
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,670
I'm sure he won't even notice it's gone.

129
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,100
Of course, this new landscaping

130
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,140
Will require an updated irrigation system,

131
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,645
Which I'm happy to take care of.

132
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,100
bree, you bought us a house.

133
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,640
We can't let you do all this, too.

134
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,140
nonsense! it's a small price to pay

135
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,350
-to make your home more beautiful. I insist. -yes!

136
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,150
Yes, It's gonna be here tomorrow. 

137
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,220
Orson, take it easy!

138
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,220
Impossible. soon, i, the grillmaster,

139
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,400
Will christen a brand-new barbecue.

140
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,400
You're pretty excited about a grill.

141
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,890
Oh, it's so much more than that, young man.

142
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,900
This is the very fire turbo.

143
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,630
It's 122,000 btus of charbroiling power.

144
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,140
Look out, cattle!

144
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,590
you think you're excited?

145
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,530
Just imagine the salesman who overcharged you.

146
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,050
Well, bree, I got a very good deal.

147
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,330
He only thinks he got a good deal because the salesman

148
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,890
Threw in one of those "kiss the cook" hats.

149
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,880
And the temperature-sensing barbecue fork.

150
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,900
Well, that sounds good. yeah.

151
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,480
Don't encourage him!

152
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,210
Orson is a horrible negotiator.

153
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,430
He's never met a sticker price he didn't like.

154
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,960
-Oh, no, bree, that's  -it's true.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,700
There's a reason the local car dealers

156
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,710
Send you a fruit basket every christmas.

157
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,080
Now hush. mm.

158
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,420
Bree, could you please not do that?

159
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,260
Do... do what?

160
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,310
It's just... when you talk to your husband that way,

161
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,510
It really pushes a button for me.

162
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,680
My mom used to do that, and it, uh...

163
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,160
Drove my dad away.

164
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,050
I think he was tired of being emasculated.

165
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,580
Did I mention it has a rear-mounted rotisserie rack?

166
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,610
What exactly are you saying, alex?

167
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,370
I'm saying, if you're gonna be rude to your husband,

168
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,130
Could you just not do it in front of me?

169
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,930
So rotisserie, huh?

170
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,260
Yeah. good for chicken, uh...

171
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,560
Rolled roasts, legs of lamb.

172
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,270
This thing is so advanced,

173
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,410
I could probably use it to make soup.

174
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,210
I'm sorry. daddy has to work.

175
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,840
Carlos, what is going on? you're gonna miss your plane.

176
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,540
They're upset. they're not used to me being away.

177
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,570
Oh, for god sakes, girls. it's not like

178
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,030
He's going off to war. he's gonna be back tomorrow.

179
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,600
Why can't daddy work here?

180
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,310
Because daddy has a new job

181
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,290
That's gonna make us lots of money.

182
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,250
we don't need lots of money.

183
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,670
Hey, what did I say about that kind of language?

184
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,970
Look, girls...

185
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,100
Daddy's gonna be home tomorrow in time for dinner.

186
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,610
You can call me whenever you want. okay?

187
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,670
And the best part is

188
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,690
You get to spend a whole day with just mommy!

189
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,220
Oh, hello, mr. fishmanan.

190
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,280
I'm coming in. watch the wheels.

191
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,910
Boy, you just had to put a rug here, huh?

192
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,940
Uh, is everything okay?

193
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,000
It's about your damn son.

194
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,180
-Porter? -how the hell do I know?

195
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,990
He's got red hair and he's got a face you just wanna slap,

196
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,540
And he's driving my sister crazy!

197
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,420
-What are you talking about? -the retirement home.

198
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,840
Your kid has been staying in your mom's room.

199
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,060
What?! muriel thought he was just visiting,

200
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,560
But he's been there for a week.

201
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,000
Now the rules clearly state...

202
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,270
No visiting after dark.

203
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,200
Tom, I know where porter is. he's hiding at my mother's.

204
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,050
Oh, hiding, my ass. he's not hiding. he's living there.

205
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,400
He even stole my sister's orange juice.

206
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,900
I'll take re of it. thank you.

207
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,320
Call bob. tell him we can make the hearing tomorrow.

1
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,860
Nobody can sleep there

2
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,460
Because he's got that tv blaring all night long.

3
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,300
Look, tom, I can't talk now. just call bob.

4
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,930
I'm going over there now. okay. bye.

5
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,610
Parker, I'm gonna be back in an hour.

6
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,080
Mr. fishman, thank you so much.

7
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,540
Well, don't just stand there. make me a sandwich!

8
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,600
Uh, one more thing.

9
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,690
Could you see about having the basement cleared out?

10
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,010
Yeah, the last time we went down there,

11
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,570
It was filled with mildewed boxes. oh, I'll take care of that.

12
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,290
There's nothing worse than having old junk around.

13
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,300
Edie!

14
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,670
Case in point.

15
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,340
Edie?

16
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,410
Edie!

17
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,910
Do you not hear me?

18
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,410
Yeah, I heard you. why do you think I kept walking?

19
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,010
Looks like the mailman switched our mail again.

20
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,360
Do you have mine?

21
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,760
Yep. it's in my garbag

22
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,930
Come by and grab it at your convenience.

23
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,190
What is wrong with you?

24
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,010
I asked everyone over this morning

25
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,640
Because I had is huge thing to share

26
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,660
About kicking my husband out, and you prance in

27
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,570
With your, "me and jackson are moving to a fairy castle."

28
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,370
I'm sorry. I thought we gave your latest breakup

29
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,320
The three seconds of shock it deserved.

30
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,170
Get the hell out of here. gladly.

31
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,330
What have you done?

32
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,280
Nothing. it's locked.

33
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
Do you have a key?

34
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,370
In my purse.

35
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,320
Which I left in the kitchen.

36
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,990
Does anyone know you're here?

37
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,660
No.

38
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,930
Oh! hey! help!

39
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,490
Somebody help me!

40
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,670
Get me out of here!

41
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,280
Juanita, it's time for your bath.

42
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,290
I'm watching my movie. you've seen it a hundred times.

43
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,380
She loses her shoe, the prince finds it--end of story.

44
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,250
Let's go. I'll go when I'm ready.

45
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,870
Hey, it's not finished! it is for you. now move!

46
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,980
Juanita solis, I am not kidding.

47
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,077
Okay. that does it.

48
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,490
Juanita.

49
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,410
If you think I'm not gonna drag you to the the bathroom,

50
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,190
You are sadly mistaken!

51
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,220
You're never gonna make it. oh, yes, I will.

52
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,330
My rage is fueling me in ways you can't imagine.

53
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,770
What's wrong?

54
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,450
My rage just needs to catch its breath.

55
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,480
I am willing to forget this entire incident

56
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,800
If you just go jump in that bathtub right now.

57
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,600
What do you say?

58
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,320
I am gonna scrub that smug look right off your face.

59
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,920
Aah! oh, my back! aah! aah!

60
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,360
where is he?

61
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,860
I'm sorry. have we met?

62
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,960
Wait...

63
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,540
You're the girl who stuck me here three years ago.

64
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,600
You come by every christmas and look at yo watch

65
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,900
While I unwrap the you bought me on the drag over.

66
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,510
do you know what's going on wi porter? the fire? the rest?

67
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,910
Yes. I read the newspapers.

68
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,310
Everybody's crying for that poor kid's blood.

69
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,260
No, no. we have this great lawyer.

70
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,300
He thinks he can get the case thrown out.

71
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,380
Oh, really? I didn't realize that.

72
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,760
Oh... porter! come out from under the bed!

73
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,900
Mommy is here to take care of you!

74
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,630
Just like she took care of me.

75
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,460
Okay. I know you're mad.

76
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,760
I know we have a lot to hash out between us.

77
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,110
But don't take your hate for me out on your grandson.

78
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,840
Now where is he?

79
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,910
He's safe.

80
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,720
I heard muriel fishman rat me out to her brother,

81
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,060
So i-i made sure that porter cleared out.

82
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,000
Mom...this is wrong.

83
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,900
Please.

84
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,610
Sucks to feel powerless, doesn't it, lynette?

85
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,510
Please, help!

86
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,140
Please!

87
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,880
Wow. I'm getting a really unpleasant picture

88
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,470
Of what you're like in the ol' sackarooni.

89
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,880
Face it, mayer. we're stuck.

90
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,100
Gotta get out.

91
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm supposed to be meeting the moving company.

92
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,890
What?

93
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,650
Keep talking about how

94
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,290
You're going to move away and be with jackson.

95
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,640
I hear stupidity makes time go faster.

96
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,570
So now me wanting to be with the man I love is stupid?

97
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,080
And needy and pathetic and...

98
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,010
Kinda hilarious.

99
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,170
But there's one thing it's not, mayer.

100
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,640
That's "unexpected."

101
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,050
What are you getting at?

102
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,560
Have you ever in your life been without a man?

103
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,500
Of course I have.

104
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,090
When? I don't know. I'm not sure.

105
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,270
What are you doing?

106
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,820
Making a calendar.

107
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,250
Edie...

108
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,420
Oh, come on. we've got nothing but time,

109
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,910
And I assume you don't wanna make out, so...

110
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,030
First boyfriend?

111
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,560
Todd shaffer. I was 14.

112
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,590
And why did you and hot toddy break up?

113
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,530
He dumped me during math class.

114
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,210
And how long did it take you to start dating somebody else?

115
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,430
This is a stupid exercise. I refuse to--

116
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,230
When was it?

117
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,000
Lunch. it was lunch.

118
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,810
You know, I'm feeling a bit randy tonight.

119
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,740
What do you say we make a little love?

120
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,770
Well, we've got 15 minutes till the news is on. why not?

121
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,260
I still can't get over the way alex behaved this morning.

122
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,020
"emasculating." I' never heard such nonsense.

123
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,990
Don't you think so?

124
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,220
Well, I thought the matter in which alex made his point

125
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,060
Was inappropriate.

126
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,680
But?

127
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,690
We, I wouldn't say it was nonsense.

128
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,970
You can be a little tough sometimes.

129
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,680
"tough"?

130
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,950
That's not a word I would use to describe myself.

131
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,420
Nobody blames you, bree.

132
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,150
You run a business. you have to be formidable.

133
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,640
Sometimes, if that frame of mind carries over

134
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,720
Into your personal life, it's only to be expected.

135
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,310
I don't think I do that.

136
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,540
I know you don't. it's not worth getting upset about.

137
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,190
Andrew and I are used to it,

138
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,090
And I'm sure in time, alex will get used to it, too.

139
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,100
Now... on to more pleasant things.

140
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,310
Even though it's my turn, I don't mind if you're on top.

141
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,570
I think we forgot one.

142
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,070
Didn't you date somebody after you stole karl away from me?

143
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,920
Ron. dr. ron.

144
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,920
Are we done?

145
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,790
Yep. here it is--the history of your love life.

146
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,440
Proof that you can't be happy without a man.

147
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,920
This is not proof of anything.

148
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,380
Seven boyfriends through high school and college--

149
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,920
Only... 41 days single.

150
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,820
What does that tell you? my grades sucked?

151
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,260
It's a cry for help, mayer.

152
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,980
And it doesn't get much better

153
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,430
Into the many decades of your adulthood.

154
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,020
Hey, I was single for several months after karl

155
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,830
And after mike.

156
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,550
But that wasn't of your choosing.

157
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,180
They dumped you.

158
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,370
I know. it's hard to look in the mirror.

159
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,390
Have you ever looked in your mirror, edie?

160
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,900
You're famous for the number of men you've conquered.

161
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,020
Thank you.

162
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,420
It's not a compliment, you tramp!

163
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,270
Okay, I am not gonna take relationship tips

164
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,820
From a woman who has hooked up with...

165
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,020
What is it? over a thousand men?

166
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,960
Okay, that's true. I enjoyed the '80s

167
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,870
But the difference is,

168
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,800
I go after men because I want them.

169
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,190
You go after them because you need them.

170
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,990
That is not much of a distinction.

171
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,530
Yes, it is. you have holes in your heart

172
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,120
That can only be filled by a pair of trousers.

173
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,710
Face it, mayer. you're weak

174
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,950
Porter wasn't there,

175
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,800
And she won't tell me where he is.

176
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,090
Did you tell her that he could end up in jail? of course I did.

177
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,750
Lynette, you're really upset. just hang up and come home.

178
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,960
She's so angry at me.

179
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,190
She's never gonna tell us where he is.

180
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,700
Lynette?

181
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,250
Uh, we need  find lynette scavo.

182
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,850
Let me check. this is all my fault.

183
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,810
She was so worked up when she left my room.

184
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,160
I'm not finding a lynette scavo.

185
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,570
Oh, my god. does that mean she's dead?

186
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,210
No.

187
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,620
No.

188
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,130
It means she outsmarted her mom.

189
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,120
Oh, my god, porter, we missed you so much.

190
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,760
I-i don't understand. I thought you were in an accident.

191
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,780
No, sweetie. I was driving home last night,

192
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,190
Talking with your dad on the phone,

193
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,210
And two cars in front of me had an accident.

194
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,590
And I thought, damn, that could be me.

195
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,820
And then I thought, that could be me.

196
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,534
You scared the hell out of me. 

197
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:57,099
we are sorry, but we had to get you back.

198
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,720
You've gotta be in court by 5. no! I don't want to go to jail.

199
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,010
Porter, listen to me. bob talked to the judge.

1
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,470
He thinks he can get them to drop the charges.

2
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,770
I don't know if I should believe you.

3
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,270
You are gonna have to.

4
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,750
Okay.

5
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,630
Great. come on. let's go.

6
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,340
That was a rotten thing you did, lynette.

7
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,430
I thought you were dead.

8
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,170
Yeah, well, what can I tell ya?

9
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,800
I learned from the best.

10
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,980
Celia! juanita!

11
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,040
I am n gonna ask you again to pick up these clothes!

12
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,160
You've got till the count of three!

13
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,860
One...

14
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,760
Two...

15
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,030
Three!

16
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,030
You can hear me, right?

17
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,720
Yeah!

18
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,190
All right, that's it! I'm calling your father!

19
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,820
You are gonna get it now!

20
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,100
He is gonna tear into you! it is gonna be a bloodbath!

21
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,930
Hey, babe. what's up?

22
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,010
It's your children. they've run amok.

23
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,520
What? now that you've gone back to work,

24
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,940
They won't listen to me.

25
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,980
They know you're not in the next room, ready to drop the hammer.

26
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,230
Help me! how? I'm in a meeting.

27
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,630
O-okay. I'm gonna put you on speaker,

28
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,460
And I want you to rip 'em a new one. I'm with clients.

29
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,740
I don't have time for this.

30
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,200
But-- I gotta go!

31
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,530
Carlos? carlos!

32
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,170
I think he hung up, mommy.

33
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,210
Can you bring us a lemonade?

34
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,380
Hi, mike.

35
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,640
Hey, sorry I'm late. where's katherine?

36
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,180
Ah, headache. she sends her regrets. oh

37
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,360
You mind if I grab a beer? uh, yeah. in the test kitchen.

38
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,300
Uh, beer sounds good. I think I'll grab one,oo. excuse me.

39
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,050
So... katherine not feeling well, huh?

40
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,720
Yeah.

41
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,600
Yeah, I think she also might be a little miffed with me.

42
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,110
This about baltimore?

43
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,210
It's not that I want her to go, 'cause I don't.

44
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,020
Then why don't you tell her?

45
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,960
I don't wanna be the guy

46
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,540
That comes between her and her daughter,

47
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,800
Not to mention a grandchild.

48
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,540
I thought this was because...

49
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,070
I don't know.

50
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,520
Maybe you're still hung up on your ex-wife.

51
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,580
Susan?

52
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,710
No. no, that's over.

53
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,360
You sure?

54
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,480
And most guys I talk to,

55
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,380
They say they only really fall in love once.

56
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,470
And even if it doesn't work,

57
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,640
They spend the rest of their lives

58
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,740
Thinking about the one that they lost.

59
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,760
I always wondered if that's how you felt about susan.

60
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,770
Why would you wonder about something like that?

61
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,270
Oh, I don't know.

62
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,580
You're my friend. I care about you.

63
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,060
Well, no.

64
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,620
In fact, dave,

65
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,190
I think I might be falling in love with katherine.

66
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,520
Did you just use the "l" word? oh.

67
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:24,030
Wow! see, i-i didn't realize it was that serious.

68
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,850
Well, to be honest,

69
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,210
It didn't really hit me until she said she might leave.

70
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,540
Where are our guests?

71
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,320
The food's gonna get cold.

72
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,490
Oh, I'll go find them.

73
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,390
And bring some steak sauce.

74
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,080
Oh, you're not gonna need any sauce with these babies.

75
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,960
They are seasoned to perfection.

76
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,900
Bring it.

77
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,860
Well, there's no sense in waiting. dig in.

78
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,960
Oh, dear. are they overcooked?

79
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,120
No, they're well-done. that's the way I like them.

80
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,130
Bree, what do you think?

81
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,220
Oh, I really couldn't say.

82
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,530
You couldn't say if your meat is overcooked?

83
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,200
No. I wouldn't want to upset anyone.

84
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,980
Well, don't worry. you won't upset me.

85
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,720
I don't think she was referring to you.

86
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,050
Well, it's just that grilling is such a manly pastime.

87
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,590
If I suggested that orson somehow failed

88
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,350
To produce the perfect steak,

89
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,960
You might see it as another example  emasculation.

90
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,220
I see. you're not gonna let that go, are you?

91
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,720
Well, for all I know,

92
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,560
Telling orson his steak tastes like charcoal

93
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,220
Might be deballing him.

94
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,890
You know, bree, you can make your point and still be nice.

95
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,290
You know what else would be nice, alex?

96
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,360
Showing gratitude when people have been generous with you.

97
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,050
Don't listen to her, alex.

98
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,120
She's not mad at you. she's mad at me... and the meat.

99
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,630
Gratitude? what do you mean by that?

100
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,090
I mean I bought you a house

101
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,450
You'd think you'd show me a little respect.

102
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,470
Seriously? you're bringing up the house?

103
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,790
Well, why not? it was a fairly grand gesture on my part.

104
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,590
Yes, and one that apparently comes with strings.

105
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,690
If by "strings," you mean

106
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,200
I won't let you be rude to me in my own house, then yes.

107
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,050
You know what?

108
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,900
I think I'm going to have to decline your grand gesture.

109
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,140
Keep the house.

110
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,080
What's wrong?

111
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,690
Orson burnt the steaks.

112
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,140
Susan, how can you tell if pickles have botulism?

113
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,210
Ah, what the hell?I shoot this stuff into my forehead.

114
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,420
Forget it.

115
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,640
I'd rather starv for a day or two.

116
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,330
By then, you'll be dead,

117
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,470
And I can use your remains as a source of protein.

118
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,930
Oh, come on. that was funny.

119
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,020
You know...

120
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,510
Maybe I do feel incomplete without a man.

121
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,770
But i... wouldn't trade places with you for anything.

122
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,940
You wanna know why?

123
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,390
No, but I'm trapped, so knock yourself out.

124
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,350
It's the way you are with men--

125
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,110
They're like tissues.

126
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,960
You use one and then toss it away,

127
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,590
And then you're on to the next one.

128
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,330
At least I'm looking for something real.

129
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,140
So you think this happy ending crap

130
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,640
That you believe in is real?

131
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,170
Please. I know what men are really like.

132
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,370
Really?

133
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,520
Well, when I was 16, my dad had an affair

134
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,080
With this woman who had a 10-year-old daughter.

135
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,320
And one day, he told my mom and me

136
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,170
That he was leaving us for them.

137
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,090
Oh, my god.

138
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,300
No talking.

139
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,020
A week later, he comes to the house to get his stuff,

1
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,710
And my mom didn't want to see him,

2
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,010
So we went to the movies.

3
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,540
Now I had this, uh, horse figurine collection.

4
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,460
Plastic, glass, ceramic--

5
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,300
Hundreds of them.

6
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,680
Anyway, we come back from the movies,

7
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,750
And my dad had taken all his stuff. so...

8
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,580
I go into my bedroom, and something seems different.

9
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,010
And then I realize all of my horses were gone.

10
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,190
My mom called my dad and screamed,

11
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,620
And all he said was, I was too old for them

12
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,690
And that his girlfriend's daughter

13
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,040
Would appreciate them more.

14
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,620
Can you believe that? what a fungus.

15
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,500
Oh, god. are you crying?

16
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,750
It's just...

17
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,630
Now I get it.

18
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,940
Get what?

19
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,630
All these years, I have judged you,

20
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,850
And... it is not your fault.

21
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,250
Oh, come here.

22
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,000
You are the way you are because of your father.

23
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,100
Edie, what the hell?!

24
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,490
Don't psychoanalyze me, you simp!

25
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,370
I was just trying to tell you how selfish men are.

26
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,060
And I was just trying to be nice

27
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,870
And give you a free pass for being such a big slut!

28
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,550
Edie!

29
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,000
Okay, girls.

30
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,010
Pick up your toys and put 'em in the basket before dinner.

31
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,560
Dinner's not for two hours.

32
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,110
I've had enough of your crap. now pick up these toys!

33
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,600
No!

34
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,850
Okay, juanita. what is going on here?

35
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,450
Why are you being so difficult?

36
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,040
When daddy asks you to do something, you just do it.

37
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,890
That's because I love daddy mo.

38
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,460
Fine.

39
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,700
Everything okay, mrs. solis?

40
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,600
Yeah. just my kids.

41
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,140
They really know how to push my buttons.

42
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,320
Oh, yeah. I got a couple monsters at home, too.

43
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,380
The key is, you gotta be the bigger monster.

44
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,180
Well, unfortunately,

45
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,120
They're not afraid of me.

46
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,690
Ooh, that's bad.

47
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,760
Fear is the foundation of all good parenting.

48
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,740
You gotta practice your big voice.

49
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,980
Finish that broccoli now!

50
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,220
You see how that works?

51
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,370
Yeah. it's very effective. 

52
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,900
Hey, you got an extra 15 minutes?

53
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,000
Do it! faster! faster!

54
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,280
I wanna see this place sparkle!

55
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,370
Mommy...

56
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,230
It's out of my hands, girls.

57
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,630
Word got out that you were disobeying,

58
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,060
-And they sent reggie over. -who sent reggie over?

59
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,680
Well, I know how much you love him, but...

60
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,700
It was your daddy.

61
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,860
Enough chatter. ke moving!

62
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,930
When they're done,

63
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,020
You want me to make them vacuum?

64
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,220
-If you wouldn't mind. -nah.

65
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,080
Guess.

66
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,520
Aw, come on, edie. I said I was sorry.

67
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,700
Guess!

68
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,600
July?

69
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,160
Wrong. march!

70
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,220
Man,you're bad at this.

71
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,710
Guess.

72
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,290
Oh, hey, mrs. williams. I didn't know you were down here.

73
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,740
Oh, thank god! we've been locked in here all night.

74
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,590
Really? good thing I came by to check the rat traps then.

75
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,570
Ugh! I'm glad I forgot about those until now.

76
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,800
Uh, mayer?

77
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,630
I, uh, would appreciate it

78
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,310
If you wouldn't talk about what we talked about.

79
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,860
I wasn't planning to.

80
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,090
Good, because I'll deny it if you do.

81
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,220
I won't.

82
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,730
And... I'll kill you.

83
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,140
Good-bye, edie.

84
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,220
Oh, I'll bring your mail over when I get home.

85
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,010
Thanks.

1
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,133
Hey, mom.

2
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,248
I just came by to tell you

3
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:50,773
That the judge threw out porter's case

4
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:52,712
For lack of evidence. isn't that great?

5
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,366
Mom...

6
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,800
I did not put you in here to punish you.

7
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:04,033
I didn't have a choice.

8
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,293
-You had a choice. -No, I didn't.

9
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:11,633
From the moment glen died, you were out of control.

10
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:14,333
It's true you lost all that money in vegas.

11
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:15,476
You started drinking again.

12
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:18,192
How many times did I go to your condo, only to find you

13
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:21,834
Asleep on the sofa with a cigarette in your mouth?

14
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,366
No, I won't apologize for bringing you here.

15
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,867
I did it because I love you.

16
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,867
Then why don't you come visit me?

17
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,400
It's not a very pleasant experience.

18
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:36,433
So I yell a little. so I toss a few curse words your way.

19
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:37,934
Big deal!

20
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:40,567
Last time I came, you threw pudding at me.

21
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,100
I'm an angry old woman,

22
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,600
lynette! what do you expect?

23
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:45,834
Here's a thought-- stop being angry.

24
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:47,166
How?

25
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,387
I can't make a friend in this place without

26
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:52,700
having them drop dead of a stroke five minutes later.

27
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,366
I-i feel like hell.

28
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,567
Every time I look in the mirror, I wanna scream.

29
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,733
My anger is all I've got left, baby.

30
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:06,087
If I let go of that, it's over. I know it.

31
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,554
The ball game will be over.

32
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:11,887
The ball game is going to end

33
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,154
Whether you like it or not.

34
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:20,686
I'd like to be here with you for whatever time you have left.

35
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:26,387
But for that to happen, things have to change.

36
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:33,920
Would you come visit me more often?

37
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:35,920
At least twice a week,

38
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:38,454
And sometimes I'd bring the kids.

39
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:46,587
I'd like that.

40
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:49,621
You know, they turned out really good.

41
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,720
How'd you learn how to be such a good mom?

42
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,053
I have no idea.

43
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,387
Well, now that you're here,

44
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,387
Why don't you stay, and we can talk a while?

45
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,187
I--and get my flask out of the drawer.

46
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,387
Hey, I can't be nice,

47
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:16,554
forgiving and sober all at the same time.

49
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:25,820
Daddy!

50
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:27,154
Daddy!

51
00:35:27,187 --> 00:35:29,753
Mmm! mwah! missed you guys.

52
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:32,621
Wow! you're really helping mommy, huh? that's great.

53
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:35,521
The scary man told us we had to.

54
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:40,653
We don't even know the guy.

55
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:42,169
He left a flier in our mailbox.

56
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:43,653
you left him do your parenting?

57
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:45,753
Hey, you're the one who told me to get creative.

58
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:47,820
this wasn't what I meant!

59
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,087
Easy for you to say.

59
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:52,087
They told me they Love you more than me.

60
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,653
When I was running things, they said they loved you more.

61
00:35:58,154 --> 00:36:00,254
Really?

62
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:03,587
So don't get your feelings hurt,

63
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:05,720
And stop asking strangers to discipline our kids.

64
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:08,920
Well, I wouldn't have to if you would do it.

65
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:12,953
So you want me to go to work all day, 

65
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:14,953
go out on business trips,

66
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:16,953
And what little time I have here with the girls,

67
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:18,355
You want me to spend screaming at them?

68
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:20,878
Just for the first 15 minutes after you walk in the door.

69
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,945
Then it's carlos time.

70
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:25,011
forget it! this was the arrangement you wanted.

71
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:26,923
You made me take this job.

72
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:28,834
I just wanted us to have a normal life.

73
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,133
Well, guess what, sweetie? dad's unhappy at work.

74
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,733
Mom's home with the screaming kids.

75
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,300
you got one.

76
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,800
Oh, good. you're back.

77
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,367
Can we talk?

78
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,133
If it's about work, yes.

79
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,500
If it's about what happened at the barbecue, no.

80
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:56,500
Fine. then as my employee, I authorize a 5-minute break

81
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:59,001
So we can talk about my son's boyfriend

82
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:01,433
And his absurd overreaction this afternoon.

83
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,367
That's it. I'm out of here.

84
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,883
Andrew, please. you were there.

85
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:06,367
alex started the whole thing.

86
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,900
You need to tell him to stop critizing me.

87
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,900
I'm--i'm not getting in the middle of this.

88
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:13,500
If you have a problem with ale you tell him.

89
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:16,034
I tried. he won't listen to me.

90
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,700
Don't you mean obey?

91
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:21,166
He's not your son. he's not your husband.

92
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,834
He's not your employee.

93
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,467
Not everyone has to listen to you.

94
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:30,067
I'll--i'll do this tomorrow.

95
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:54,300
I got the flowers.

96
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,834
They re from you, right?

97
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,867
Oh, yeah.

98
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:22,826
I just have a minute,

99
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:24,707
And I don't want to get into a whole thing with you.

100
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:26,485
This won't take long.

101
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:30,354
I don't want to fight anymore. please, just take the house.

102
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:37,887
I don't know how else to say this.

103
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:40,387
What happened yesterday is gonna happen again.

104
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,821
It's not gonna be the last time we fight,

105
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,253
'cause that's who we are.

106
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:49,253
Let's not make it worse by living on top of each other.

107
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,320
Alex...

108
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:58,220
I'm gonna tell you something I haven't told anybody--

109
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,854
Not orso not andrew, just you.

110
00:39:07,988 --> 00:39:11,887
I know that I've changed since my business took off,

111
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:14,821
But I didn't want to admit it.

112
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:19,921
I've watched myself become selfish, impatient, rude.

113
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:23,554
I was never the type to suffer fools gladly,

114
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:26,687
But now I seem to find fools everywhere.

115
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:29,220
And I don't want to be that way.

116
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:33,454
I need someone who isn't afraid to speak out,

117
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:38,220
To call me out when I cross those lines,

118
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,721
And I would love it if you would be that person.

119
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:46,854
Did my mother-in-law

120
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:50,554
-Just give me permission to criticize her? -yes, I did.

121
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:56,687
I'm a lucky guy.

122
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,587
Edie.

123
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,687
Listen, um...

124
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:12,988
I'm not happy about you lying to me,

125
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:15,921
But I think what we have is real, and...

126
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:19,354
I'm not ready to throw it away.

127
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:21,954
Really?

128
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,088
And don't tell anyone,

129
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,088
But I'm at the point in my life

130
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,687
Where I could use a happy ending.

131
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:34,954
I'll get my stuff.

132
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:51,054
Hello?

133
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:53,054
Jackson, hi. do you have a sec?

134
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:55,054
Sure. is something wrong?

135
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:58,685
Uh, no, nothing's wrong. just...

136
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:02,887
We need to talk about this move.

137
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:07,788
At 5:15 that afternoon,

138
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:10,253
Edie williams began calling her friends

139
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:14,654
To inform them that her husband had come home.

140
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:18,520
Sadly, she never got through to any of them.

141
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:21,887
Gabrielle never picked up.

142
00:41:21,921 --> 00:41:24,387
She was too busy watching her children

143
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,921
Being told they had to obey their mother...

144
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:30,721
And trying not to smile.

145
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,387
Lynette wasn't home when edie called.

146
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,487
She was with her mother,

147
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,887
Laughing and sharing stories about the old days...

148
00:41:40,888 --> 00:41:43,900
And enjoy every minute of it.

149
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:47,401
Bree was outside 

150
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:50,579
showing her future son in law color samples.

151
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,602
for the home she had bought him.

152
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,273
and smiling politely when they disagreed.

153
00:41:58,205 --> 00:42:02,059
and susan, well, she didn't answered,

154
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,441
because she was sitting in her favourite chair

155
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,733
with a cup of tea

156
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:09,314
Learning to enjoy for the first time in her life

157
00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:14,644
what it was like to be alone
