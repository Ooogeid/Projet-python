39
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,547
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

40

AN ACCIDENT.

164
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,382
UM...

165
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,120
YEAH, HE'S--
HE'S AT THE HOSPITAL,

166
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,939
BUT HE'S
NOT EXACTLY VISITING.

167
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,861
SUICIDE?

168
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:50,276
NO. ORSON WOULD NEVER
TRY TO KILL HIMSELF.

169
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:52,609
THE POLICE ARE WRONG.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT.

170
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,184
BUT THEY FOUND HIS FOOTPRINTS
ON THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR.

171
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:58,578
THE ONLY REASON
HE'D BE UP THERE IS TO JUMP.
BUT WHY?

172
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,718
MAYBE HE WAS FEELING GUILTY.

173
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,816
FOR WHAT?

174
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:07,366
MOM,
I-I LOOKED AT THAT LADDER.

175
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,990
SOMEONE
SAWED THROUGH THE RUNG.

176
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,544
AND YOU THINK...

177
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:13,524
I HEARD YOU TWO
IN YOUR ROOM THE OTHER DAY.

178
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:18,456
THE NEXT DAY,
YOU FALL AND NEARLY DIE.

179
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:20,103
YOU-OU THINK
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE?

180
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,043
AND YOU SAY
HE'S JUST DOWN THE HALL?

181
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,300
YEAH, BUT DON'T WORRY.

182
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,115
I-I TOLD THEM
NOT TO LET HIM NEAR YOU,

183
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,844
AND WE'RE GONNA GET YOU HOME
AS SOON AS WCAN.

184
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,630
CAN I HELP YOU?

185
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:41,606
I'M HERE TO PICK UP
MY WIFE'S BELONGINGS.

186
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:42,845
UH, JANE HAINSWORTH?

187
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,112
OH, YES.

188
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:46,019
I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

189
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,963
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

190
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,343
YOU DOING OKAY?

191
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,473
NOT REALLY,
BUT HAVING YOU HERE HELPS.

192
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:58,019
OH, HEY, MRS. MAYER.

193
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,981
ANDREW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT THE HOSPITAL?

194
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,445
YOU--YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?

195
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,153
HEY.

196
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,903
SUSAN.

197
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:15,363
I JUST HEARD FROM ANDREW
WHAT HAPPENED.

198
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,667
I HAD TO COME SEE YOU.

199
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,096
IF YOU WANT ME
TO GO, UH...

200
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,656
NO, NO. COME IN.

201
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:24,341
I KNOW WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING.

202
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,960
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS,

203
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,857
IT JUST PUTS EVERYTHING
INTO PERSPECTIVE.

204
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,024
I AM SO SORRY.
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

205
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:33,461
IF I HADN'T GOT SO CAUGHT UP
IN PROTECTING MIKE--

206
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:34,776
SUSAN, STOP.

207
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,209
MIKE IS INNOCENT.

208
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,325
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH MONIQUE POLIER'S MURDER.

209
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:42,699
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

210
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:46,954
YES, AND I INTEND
TO GO TO THE POLICE.

211
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:49,894
OH, MY GOD.

212
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,635
DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH ORSON'S ACCIDENT?

213
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:55,919
I CAN'T TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW.

214
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,923
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

215
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,310
CAN YOU DO THAT?

216
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,991
OF COURSE.

217
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:10,993
I SHOULD LET YOU REST.

218
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,755
SO WE'RE BACK
TO BEING FRIENDS?

219
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,745
WE NEVER REALLY STOPPED.

220
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:30,776
UM, EXCUSE ME. THESE--THESE
THINGS DON'T BELONG TO JANE.

221
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:31,952
ARE YOU SURE?

222
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,946
OH, EVERY COUPLE
HAS THEIR SECRETS,

223
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:36,075
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE WASN'T A CLOSET WHITTLER.

224
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,365
"MIKE DELFINO."

225
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:44,382
OH, THESE ARE MIKE'S THINGS?

226
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,960
YEP. SOMEONE MADE
A BIG MISTAKE.

227
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,375
HELEN, YOU SCREWED UP
THE LABELS AGAIN!

228
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,668
OH! HE HAD AN ENGAGEMENT RING
WITH HIM.

229
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:57,823
OOH, THAT'S PRETTY.

230
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,515
YOU KNOW,
MIKE AND I ARE GOOD FRIENDS.

231
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:05,011
I-I COULD RETURN THESE THINGS
TO HIM, IF--IF YOU LIKE.

232
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,734
SORRY. HE'LL HAVE
TO PICK 'EM UP HIMSELF.

233
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:09,361
IT'S HOSPITAL POLICY.

234
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:13,795
IT'S ALSO HOSPITAL POLICY

235
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:14,718
TO PUT THE RIGHT LABELS
ON THE RIGHT BOXES!

236
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,545
IAN! IAN, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.

237
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:19,360
BREE JUST TOLD ME
SHE CAN PROVE MIKE'S INNOCENT.

238
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:20,508
WHAT?

239
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,284
IT'S TRUE.

240
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,290
HE'S GONNA BE A FREE MAN.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

241
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:26,658
YES,
IT'S BLOODY FANTASTIC.

242
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:28,133
OH! WHOOPS.

243
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,561
HERE. I'M GONNA GO GET BREE
SOME FLOWERS.

244
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,404
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

245
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,952
NO, NO, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

246
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,757
(telephone beeps)
SO ORSON'S
GONNA PULL THROUGH?

247
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,297
YOU'D RATHER HE DIDN'T?

248
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:48,162
NO.

249
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,194
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S GONNA TELL THE POLICE

250
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,324
WHEN HE WAKES UP.

251
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:52,569
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

252
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,532
ORSON FALLING OFF THAT ROOF
WAS AN ACCIDENT, RIGHT?

253
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:57,884
WELL, SORT OF.
SORT OF?

254
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:00,991
DEPENDING ON WHAT
ORSON TELLS THEM,

255
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,709
I COULD GET CHARGED
WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER.

256
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:15,601
WELL, SO I'M SO GLAD SHE HAS YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF HER,

257
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:18,151
AND OF COURSE
YOUR MOM COMES FIRST, ANDREW.

258
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,600
AND I WOULDN'T EVEN ASK EXCEPT,
YOU KNOW,

259
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,352
WE'RE OPENING TONIGHT--
CHAIRS ARE HERE.

260
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,450
UH, UH-HUH.

261
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,172
OH, GOD. SERIOUSLY?

262
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:28,756
FANTASTIC. THANK YOU.
IT'S JUST TWO QUICK HOURS,

263
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,503
AND THEN WE'LL GET YOU
RIGHT BACK HOME WITH YOUR MOM.

264
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,900
THANK YOU, ANDREW.
OKAY. BYE-BYE.
(telephone beeps)

1
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:37,447
DID YOU FINISH FOLDING
THE TAKEOUT MENUS?

2
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,299
YOU NEVER ASKED ME
TO DO THAT.

3
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:42,128
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
EVERY LITTLE THING, YOU KNOW.

4
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,949
SHOW SOME INITIATIVE.

5
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:46,375
WAIT. WHERARE <i>MY</i> CHAIRS?
I DIDN'T ORDER THESE.

6
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,007
YOU LYNETTE SCAVO?
YES.

7
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:53,802
WELL, THEN YOU ORDERED THESE.
NO. WHY WOULD I ORDER
50 HIGH CHAIRS

8
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,540
FOR THE OPENING
OF A PIZZERIA?
I DON'T KNOW.

9
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,253
I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE,
UH, KIDDIE PIZZA PLACES

10
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,850
WITH THE GAMES
AND THE ANIMATRONIC RATS.
GIVE ME THAT.

11
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,970
EASY THERE, SALLY.

12
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,001
"ANIMATRONIC RATS."
WHERE DO THEY FIND YOU PEOPLE?

13
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:04,959
OKAY, OKAY, HERE IT IS.

14
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:07,604
SEE? I ORDERED 50
OF ITEM NUMBER 7-3...

15
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,309
OH, HUH.

16
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,123
DID WE FIND THE MISTAKE?

17
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:13,629
I, UM, I SWITCHED
THE 7 AND THE 1.

18
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:14,923
MM-HMM.

19
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,411
SO... WE'RE BOTH WRONG.

20
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:19,653
NOW THIS PLACE OPENS
IN FIVE HOURS.

21
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:21,065
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
TO FIX THIS?

22
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:27,710
HI. I NEED TO RENT 50 CHAIRS
BY TONIGHT AT 5:00.

23
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:29,037
(blows air) WHAT?

24
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,463
WHY NOT?

25
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:33,110
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT'S BAR MITZVAH SEASON?

26
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,972
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

27
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:38,014
OH! YOU STILL HAVE FIVE.
I WILL TAKE THOSE. SCAVO.

28
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:41,053
OKAY, THAT BRINGS US TO 22.

29
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,728
JAVI, RICO,
WE GOT CHAIRS TO FIND. MOVE IT.

30
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:52,003
WOW.

31
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:54,457
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE CRAWLED INTO
A BOTTLE OF MERLOT LAST NIGHT.

32
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,428
I SORT OF THREW MYSELF
A LITTLE BIRTHDAY PARTY.

33
00:15:58,145 --> 00:16:00,533
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE
TO GET BACK TO MY DRY HEAVING.

34
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:03,443
QUICK QUESTION--
WAS THAT ZACH YOUNG

35
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:05,022
I SAW LEAVINYOUR HOUSE
 8:00 THIS MORNING?

36
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:09,043
UH, OH, YEAH. UM...

37
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,098
HE JUST CAME BY TO, UH...

38
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:13,563
DROP OFF A BIRTHDAY RD.

39
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,060
REALLY CUTE LITTLE CAT
WITH BALLOONS. (chuckles)

40
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,755
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

41
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,305
FOLLOW-UP.

42
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:25,093
WHY WAS ZACH IN YOUR DRIVEWAY
AT 7:00 THIS MORNING...

43
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:26,974
IN HIS UNDERWEAR?

44
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:37,257
WE HAD SEX LAST NIGHT!

45
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:40,455
WHAT?!
I MEAN, I THINK WE DID.
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.

46
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,734
WEREN'T YOU THERE?
NO, I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING!

47
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:46,162
I JUST WOKE UP,
AND HE WAS IN BED NEXT TO ME.

48
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:48,375
THANKS AGAIN, GABY.
HEY, CARLOS.

49
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:53,945
IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER,

50
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,866
THEN HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
THAT YOU AND ZACH HAD SEX?

51
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,817
WELL,
WE WERE BOTH HALF-NAKED,

52
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,268
AND--AND THERE WAS
A CONDOM WRAPPER.

53
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,001
AND HE SAID I WAS AMAZING,
WHICH TOTALLY SOUNDS LIKE ME.

54
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,720
HE THINKS WE'RE A COUPLE NOW.
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

55
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,230
(laughs)
I AM NOT GETTING INVOLVED.

56
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,884
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BAGGED
ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD KID.

57
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:15,261
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

58
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:18,215
TO WARN THE SCAVO BOYS.

59
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,981
I WANNA SPEAK TO MY WIFE.

60
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,566
SHE'S RESTING. IF WE CAN
GET BACK TO THESE QUESTIONS...

61
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:38,376
I FELL OFF A ROOF. I NEED
A PHYSICIAN, NOT A PSYCHIATRIST.

62
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,089
WELL, I'M AFRAID
IT'S HOSPITAL POLICY

63
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,839
WHEN THERE'S
A SUSPECTED SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

64
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:43,840
I DIDN'T TRY TO KILL MYSELF.

65
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:45,886
BUT YOU DO HAVE A CERTAIN...

66
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:47,233
HISTORY?

67
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:51,826
YOU SPENT MOST OF 1976
IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.

68
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,148
I DON'T CARE
TO DISCUSS THAT.

69
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,516
YOU WON'T BE LEAVING HERE
UNTIL WE DO.

70
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,910
MY PARENTS
WERE VERY REGIOUS.

71
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,598
WHEN I WAS 16,
MY FHER HAD AN AFFAIR,

72
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:13,932
CAUSED QUITE A SCANDAL
AT OUR CHURCH.

73
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,805
 <i>(Orson) HE BECAME DEPRESSED.</i>
 <i>HE STARTED DRINKING HEAVILY.</i>

74
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:20,011
 <i>MY MOTHER GREW CONCERNED.</i>

75
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:21,826
 <i>SHE DIDN'T LIKE</i>
 <i>LEAVING HIM ALONE.</i>

76
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,538
ONE NIGHT,
SHE HAD TO VISIT A SICK FRIEND,

77
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,131
AND SHE ASKED ME
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

78
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:29,822
BUT I HAD MADE PLANS
WITH FRIENDS.

79
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:30,198
 <i>I THOUGHT I COULD</i>
 <i>DUCK OUT FOR A WHILE.</i>

80
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:33,319
 <i>WHEN I GOT HOME,</i>
 <i>I FOUND HIM IN THE BATHROOM.</i>

81
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,068
YOU BLAMED YOURSELF?

82
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,222
AH, I DIDN'T NEED TO.

83
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:46,334
MOTHER BLAMED ME ENOUGH
FOR BO OF US.

84
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,443
THAT MUST HAVE
CAUSED QUITE A STRAIN

85
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,161
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

86
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:50,897
YES.

87
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:56,825
BUT NOW AND THEN,

88
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:58,065
SHE SUGGESTS LITTLE WAYS
I MIGHT MAKE IT UP TO HER.

89
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:01,259
YES, I'M CALLING TO CHECK
ON THE STATUS OF A PATIENT.

90
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:03,236
LAST NAME HODGE.

91
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:07,088
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WHICH HODGE"?

92
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,239
GLORIA! THANK GOD. I THOUGHT
YOU'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME.

93
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,070
WHEN ARE YOU
LETTING ME OUT OF HERE?

94
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,580
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

95
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:22,173
IN FACT, SOMETHING INTERESTING
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

96
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:24,329
ORSON
TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF.

97
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:26,324
OH, MY GOODNESS.
IS HE OKAY?

98
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,536
HE'LL BE FINE.

99
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:29,004
MY POINT IS,

100
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:32,710
SUICIDE IS HARDLY THE ACT
OF A HAPPILY MARRIED MAN.

101
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:37,168
GLORIA, FOR GOD SAKE,
GIVE IT UP.

102
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:39,529
HE DOESN'T LOVE ME.

103
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:40,666
HE WILL, DEAR.

104
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:42,923
BREE WILL BE GONE SOON,

105
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,634
AND HE'LL NEED A GOOD WOMAN
LIKE YOU TO CONSOLE HIM.

106
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,001
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO BREE?

107
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:52,798
(Alma) GLORIA?

108
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:54,821
GLORIA?

109
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,060
OH, HEY, HON.

110
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,323
HEY.
DID YOU GET SOME SLEEP?

111
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:19,516
YES. I'M STILL KIND OF GROGGY
FROM THOSE PILLS, BUT...

112
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:25,733
AND NOW I'M AWAKE.

113
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,535
OKAY, LITTLE MIX-UP
WITH THE NEW CHAIRS.

114
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:31,082
WHICH <i>YOU</i> WERE IN CHARGE OF.

115
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,082
OKAY, OKAY,
WE COULD POINT FINGERS,

116
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,136
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT

117
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:35,907
IS FORGETTING ABOUT
WHAT WE EXPECTED

118
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:39,819
AND FOCUSING ON WHAT WE HAVE,
WHICH ISN'T SO BAD.

119
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,160
I MEAN, ALL THE DIFFERENT
KINDS OF CHAIRS

120
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,475
GIVE THE PLACE
A KIND OF BOHEMIAN VIBE.

121
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,357
PLUS, IF WE GET
A LOT OF BABIES--

122
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:49,761
LOOK,
WE'RE JUST TOTALLY SET.

123
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:54,386
TOM, I'M SORRY.

124
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:55,685
I AM. I'M SORRY.

125
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:59,573
I JUST--I REALIZE
IT'S NOT... PERFECT.

126
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,601
BUT...

127
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:05,856
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.

128
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,161
WHAT CAN I SAY, LYNETTE?

129
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,193
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

130
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,202
WHY DO <i>I</i>
HAVE TO BABYSIT MOM?

131
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,211
ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE GONNA BE AT THE OPENING.

132
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,352
AUSTIN WAS GONNA
SNEAK US BEER!

133
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:27,186
DAMN IT, DANIELLE,
I HAVE TO WORK!

134
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,691
OUR MOTHER'S
LYING HELPLESS UPSTAIRS

135
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:30,267
'CAUSE HER HUSBAND
TRIED TO KILL HER.

136
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:33,112
NOW FOR JUST ONE NIGHT,
COULD YOU TRY TOE RESPONSIBLE?

137
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:39,815
I LIKED YOU BETTER
WHEN YOU WERE A PSYCHOPATH!

138
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:03,775
HERE YOU GO.

139
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:05,075
AH.

140
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,350
WOW, YOU'RE... HERE.
I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT.

141
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,448
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT LYNETTE AND TOM.

142
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:12,402
UH, LOOK, ZACH,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

143
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:14,439
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK
ABOUT US.

144
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:17,081
ME, TOO. YOU, UH,
BEING IN MY LIFE NOW,

145
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:19,853
HAVING THE CONNECTION
THAT WE DO,

146
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:24,396
THIS IS REALLY THE--THE FIRST
TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HAPPY

147
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:25,211
SINCE MY MOTHER
KILLED HERSELF.

148
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:28,551
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME A SEND?
huckles)

149
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,651
OF COURSE, BABY.
HURRY BACK.

150
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:31,636
YEAH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

151
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:35,983
I AM IN <i>HELL.</i>

152
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:39,346
I JUST TRIED
TO BREAK UP WITH ZACH,

153
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,023
AND THE LITTLE TWERP
PLAYED THE DEAD MOMMY CARD.

154
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,876
WELL, U CAN'T LET HIM
MAKE YOU FELL GUILTY.
BUT I <i>AM</i> GUILTY.

155
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,212
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW
WE ENDED UP IN BED TOGETHER.

156
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,931
MAYBE--MAYBE I LED HIM ON.

157
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:48,543
I GOTTA BE SENSITIVE HERE.

158
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,481
COD YOU
THREATEN HIM FOR ME?

159
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:52,660
WHAT?

160
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,154
YOU KNOW, INTIMIDATE HIM.

161
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:56,791
DO THE WHOLE JEALOUS,
LATIN EX-HUSBAND THING YOU DO.

162
00:22:56,891 --> 00:23:00,949
TELL HIM IF YOU CAN'T HAVE ME,
NOBODY CAN.
FORGET IT. I'M NOT GONNA

163
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,021
HEY, I AM LOOKING T
FOR ZACH, TOO.

164
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,504
IF I DUMP HIM,
IT'LL DESTROY HIM EMOTIONALLY.

165
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,031
BETTER TO SCARE HIM OFF.

166
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:11,215
(sighs) PLEASE?

167
00:23:14,097 --> 00:23:15,113
FINE.

168
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:16,253
THANK YOU!

169
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:17,606
OKAY, LOOK, THERE HE GOES.

170
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,150
GO! GO GET ALL CHOLO
ON HIS ASS.


1
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,230
HEY, MR. SOLIS.

2
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,528
HEY.

3
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:43,370
LOOK, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

4
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:45,256
IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD,
BUT...

5
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:53,001
MR. SOLIS?

6
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,684
WHAT?

7
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:58,180
YOU WERE JUST SAYING
THAT SOMETHING WAS AWKWARD?

8
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,115
NEVER MIND.

9
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:02,982
FORGET
THAT I SAID ANYTHING.
(urinal flushes)

10
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,345
HEY. SO HOW'D IT GO?

11
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:10,981
YOU DID NOT HAVE SEX
WITH ZACH YOUNG.

12
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:14,234
REALLY?
DID HE TELL YOU THAT?

13
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:15,292
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

14
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:16,824
WHAT?

15
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,194
I WAS STANDING NEXT TO HIM
AT THE URINAL.

16
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,446
I DON'T CARE
HOW DRUNK YOU WERE.

17
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:24,028
IF YOU HAD SEX WITH HIM,
YOU'D REMEMBER.

18
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,930
(gasps) LITTLE ZACH YOUNG?

19
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,474
WELL, JUST HOW MUCH
WOULD I HAVE REMEMBERED?

20
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,082
UH, HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,761
I THOUGHT BREE
MIGHT LIKE SOME SOUP.

22
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:56,280
IT'S MY OWN SPECIAL RECIPE.

23
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,984
I'M SURPRISED
TO FIND YOU HOME.

24
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:04,958
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE STREET
WAS GOING TO SCAVO'S TONIGHT.

25
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,929
WELL, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO,

26
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:10,104
BUT, UH, ANDREW SAID I HAD
TO STAY HOME AND BABYSIT MOM.

27
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:12,914
WELL, THAT'S JUST SILLY.

28
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:16,616
A VIBRANT YOUNG LADY LIKE YOU
SHOULD BE AT THE PARTY,

29
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,499
TURNING BOYS' HEADS.

30
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:20,540
YOU GO.

31
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:23,031
I'LL LOOK AFTER
YOUR MOTHER.

32
00:25:23,384 --> 00:25:24,398
YOU MEAN IT?

33
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,306
JUST TAKE
HER DINNER UP FIRST.

34
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:31,045
I DON'T THINK I CAN
MANAGE THE TRAY WITH MY CANE.

35
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:33,196
THANKS, GRANDMA.
YOU'RE T BEST!

36
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:34,884
MM.

37
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,808
THIS SOUP SMELLS SO GOOD.

38
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:40,654
YOU WANNA SCORE SOME POINTS?
DON'T SAY I BROUGHT IT.

39
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,247
TELL HER
YOU MADE IT YOURSELF.

40
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,037
HEY!

41
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:24,145
HELLO?

42
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,134
OVER HERE!

43
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,489
AAH!

44
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:45,526
HONEY, THERE IS A LINE
OUT THE DOOR.

45
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,501
WE ARE GONNA
MAKE A KILLING TONIGHT.

46
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:48,447
I'M HAPPY FOR YA.
FOR US.

47
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,989
NOW IT'S "US"?

48
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,695
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I WAS THE ONE

49
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,039
WHO WAS TRYING
TO RUIN EVERYTHING.

50
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,144
HEY, LOOK,
I KNOW I OVERREACTED--

51
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:59,100
YES, YOU DID.
BUT I HAVE CUSTOMERS.

52
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,394
OH!

53
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,182
THE PLACE
CAME OUT GREAT, HUH?

54
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:08,163
SURE DID.

55
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,206
LOOKS LIKE, UH,
THE WHOLE STREET'S HERE.

56
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:13,102
YEAH.

57
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,878
EXCEPT FOR ORSON,
WHO FELL OFF A ROOF.

58
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,011
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUTHAT?

59
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:22,470
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

60
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:26,476
I HEARD YOU TALKING TO CARLOS.
NOW ANSWER THE QUESTION.

61
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:29,823
I-I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT IT HERE.

62
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,791
IT'S COMPLICATED.

63
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,811
IT ALWAYS IS WITH YOU.

64
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:39,208
HEY. I JUST HAD A SLICE
OF PIZZA. IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

65
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:43,333
IS IT REALLY GOOD,

66
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:44,194
OR ARE YOU JUST PRETENDING
YOU HAD A SLICE?

67
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,310
YOU AND I DID NOT HAVE SEX.
ADMIT IT!

68
00:27:47,728 --> 00:27:48,482
OF COURSE WE DID.

69
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:52,548
ZACH! HOW CAN YOU CLAIM TO CARE
ABOUT ME AND LIE TO MY FACE?

70
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:56,493
I'M SORRY.

71
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,010
I'M TIRED
OF JUST BEING YOUR FRIEND.

72
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,433
I THOUGHT IF YOU SAW ME
AS A LOVER,

73
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:06,159
YOU CAN THINK OF ME AS A MAN,
NOT--NOT A BOY.
ZACH, A REAL MAN IS HONEST.

74
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,702
ALL YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO DO

75
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,159
IS BRIBE AND TRICK ME
INTO FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.

76
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,470
A LITTLE ADVICE NEXT TIME?
DON'T PLAY GAMES.

77
00:28:12,697 --> 00:28:14,998
JUST STAND UP
AND BE THE KIND OF MAN

78
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:17,334
A WOMAN WOULD BE PROUD
TO SHARE HER LIFE WITH.

79
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,409
(singsong voice) HELLO!

80
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:28,019
I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME
TO MAKE A TOAST.

81
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:28,806
(woman) ALL RIGHT!
(man) SURE!

82
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:34,188
UM, TOM, WHERE ARE YOU?
WHERE--AH. TOM, YOU DID IT.

83
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,074
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM

84
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:39,799
THAT DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD PULL IT OFF.

85
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,031
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE JUST ME.

86
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:44,657
ANYWAY, CONGRATULATIONS.

87
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:50,117
THE PIZZA IS EXCELLENT,
AND THE SERVICE IS SUBLIME.

88
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:51,865
CHEERS.
CHEERS.

89
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:52,654
(Carlos) SPEECH!

90
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:57,287
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

91
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,953
IT MEANS
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO ME.

92
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:03,883
I-I GOTTA TELL YOU, WHEN I
ARRIVED HERE THIS AFTERNOON,

93
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:04,953
I SAW ALL THESE WEIRD CHAIRS,

94
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,756
UM, I THOUGHT THE EVENING
WAS GONNA BE A TOTAL DISASTER.

95
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:11,785
BUT NOW WHEN I LOOK OUT,
I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE CHAIRS.

96
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:15,663
I JUST SEE PEOPLE EATING,

97
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:17,660
LAUGHING
AND HAVING A GREAT TIME.

98
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:20,480
IT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

99
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,085
AND NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED

100
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,540
WITHOUT
MY AMAZING PARTNER LYNETTE.

101
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,023
WHO, UH...

102
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,287

103
00:29:40,391 --> 00:29:42,301
I'M SORRY.laughs)
I'M--I'M A LITTLE, UH...

104
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,787
(laughs) I THINK WHAT
MY HUSBAND IS TRYING TO SAY IS,

105
00:29:47,944 --> 00:29:50,733
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO TEST A MARRIAGE,

106
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:51,644
OPEN A RESTAURANT TOGETHER.

107
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,433
ANYWAY, UM,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

108
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:57,820
EAT A LOT AND COME BACK,
'CAUSE OUR KIDS NEED BRACES.

109
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:05,108
ACTUALLY, AS LONG AS EVERYONE
HAS THEIR GLASSES RAISED,

110
00:30:05,158 --> 00:30:07,493
I HAVE SOMETHING THAT--
THAT I WLD LIKE TO SAY.

111
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:13,226
I, UM, WELL,
I-I THOUGHT OF WAITING

112
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:13,393
FOR THE PERFECT ROMANTIC SPOT
IN WHICH TO ASK THIS QUESTION,

113
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:14,298
BUT BEING HERE TONIGHT,

114
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:18,144
ENVELOPED BY SO MUCH LOVE
AND WARMTH, I REALIZE THAT, UM,

115
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:21,367
THIS <i>IS</i>
THE PERFECT ROMANTIC SPOT.

116
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:25,573
SUSAN MAYER...

117
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:27,267
DROP THE PIZZA.

118
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:32,410

ABSOLUTELY, YES!

122
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:42,136
WHOO!
(cheering)

123
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:51,223
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

124
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:54,503
PLEASE, I-I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I'D LIKE TO SAY ALSO.

125
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:58,658
GABRIELLE SOLIS...

126
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:00,970
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

127
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:02,983
(man) OH. SHOULD I CLAP?

128
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:05,717
NO, THERE WILL BE
NO CLAPPING!

129
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:09,343
YOU, MORON, COME WITH ME!

130
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,664

MR. HODGE.

131
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:21,175
HMM? OH.

00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,010
OH, IT'S AFTER 6:00?
MM-HMM.

133
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:25,645
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH MY WIFE.
WHAT ROOM IS SHE IN?

134
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:27,778
OH, UH,
YOUR WIFE CHECKED OUT.

135
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,774
ALREADY?

136
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:33,304
SHE WAS VERY EAGER TO GET HOME.
DON'T WORRY. SHE'LL BE FINE.

137
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:35,214
I-I HAVE TO TALK TO HER.

138
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:37,760
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.
YOUR MOTHER CALLED.

139
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,445
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE YOU UP,

140
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:41,516
AND SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
WE'D BE KEEPING YOU OVERNIGHT.

141
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:44,402
MS ARE LIKE THAT--
SO PROTECTIVE.

142
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,845
(Orson) Bree, it's me.
Are you there?

143
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:56,943
Please, pick up.

144
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:58,810
Bree?

145
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,649
Please, somebody,
pickp the phone.

146
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:06,382
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE MAD--
I'M NOT MAD, ZACH.
I'M DONE!

147
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:09,493
BUT YOU SAID TO BE HONEST.
I DID NOT SAY
TO HUMILIATE ME!

148
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,588
I'M SORRY. ALL RIGHT?
I-I WAS JUST TRYING--

149
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:13,500
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

150
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,297
I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME ALONE!

151
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:18,600
THIS FRIENDS THING
ISN'T GONNA WORK

152
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:19,637
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
GONNA WANT MORE,

153
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,434
AND I'M NEVER
GONNA LOVE YOU... <i>EVER.</i>

154
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:24,762
20 YEARS FROM NOW WHEN YOU'RE
ALL MIDDLE-AGED AND ALONE,

155
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,233
YOU'LL REGRET THIS.

156
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:28,087
OKAY, I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

157
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,939
THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT NEED THIS.

158
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:41,629
BLESS YOU.

159
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:48,514
SO HOW DID IT GO
WITH SEABISCUIT?

160
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:50,172
HE'S DEVASTATED.

161
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:51,408
OF COURSE.

162
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:53,209
IT'S MY FAULT.

163
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:57,028
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN

164
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:58,811
HE COULDN'T HANDLE THE WHOLE
"LET'S BE FRIENDS" THING.

165
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,186
I DON'T BLAME HIM.

166
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:04,151
I'M HAVING KIND OF A HARD TIME
MYSELF BEING JUST YOUR FRIEND,

167
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,735
WATCHING YOU WITH OTHER GUYS,
BEING YOUR CONFIDANT.

168
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:09,560
REALLY?

169
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,241
I THINK IT'S BEEN NICE.

170
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,413
FOR YOU, MAYBE.

171
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:19,160
LOOK, SERIOUSLY,
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER

172
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:20,574
I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO KEEP THIS UP.

173
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,847
WOW.

174
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,736
WELL, HANG IN THERE
AS LONG AS YOU CAN,

175
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,720
'CAUSE I STILL NEED YOU.

176
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:34,305
I'LL DO MY BEST.

177
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:47,811
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

178
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,174
I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO
THAN BABYSIT MOM.

179
00:33:50,274 --> 00:33:52,243
SHE'S FINE.
GLORIA'S WATCHING HER.

180
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:55,586
WHAT? I TOLD YOU MOM'S READY
TO GO TO THE COPS ABOUT ORSON.

181
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:57,407
HOW COULD YOU LEAVE HER AT HOME
WITH HIS CRAZY MOTHER?

182
00:33:58,543 --> 00:33:59,728
SHE BROUGHT SOUP!

183
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:13,636
GLORIA?

184
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,507
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

185
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,489
I CAME
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

186
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,901
I'M SO SLEEPY.

187
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,745
GOOD. EN THE PILLS
ARE WORKING.

188
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,181
ANDREW? DANIELLE?

189
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,504
THEY'RE GONE.

190
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:36,603
IT'S JUST US.

191
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:38,899
NOW...

192
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:41,286
YOU REST, HON.

193
00:34:43,113 --> 00:34:48,129
I'M GONNA DRAW YOU
A NICE, WARM BATH.

194
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:28,101
OH, BREE...

195
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:33,931
I WISH I COULD
MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND

196
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:36,255
HOW DEEPLY I REGRET
HAVING TO DO THIS.

197
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:38,729
MONIQUE... THAT WAS EASY.
SHE WAS A SLUT.

198
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:41,416
YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN.

199
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:44,740
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ORSON ALREADY HAD A WIFE.

200
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,721
BUT HE DID,

201
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:51,568
AND HE MADE A VOW TO HER
BEFORE GOD.

202
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:57,205
WHAT SORT OF MOTHER WOULD I BE
IF I LET HIM BREAK IT?

203
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:04,178
I'M SORRY.

204
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:10,682
BUT I WILL NOT LET HIM BE
HIS FATHER'S SON.

205
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:37,398
WAKE UP, MR. HODGE.
I'VE GOT DINNER.

206
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:50,885
THAT WATER'S NOT TOO HOT,
IS IT?

207
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:55,313
NO. IT'S JUST RIGHT.

208
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:09,085
MOM? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

209
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:16,181
ANDREW?

210
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,411
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE,
HAVEN'T YOU?

211
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,690
OW! OH! AAH!

212
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,690
UHH!
ane drops to floor)

213
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,690
NO!

214
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,190
AAH!

215
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:20,470
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

216
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,585
SHE WILL BE.

217
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:24,536
GET HER SOME BLANKETS
AND SOME DRY CLOTHES.

218
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,239
(Gloria) ORSON?

219
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:30,447
ORSON!

220
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:38,252
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

221
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:43,049
(weakly) I THINK
I'M... HAVING A STROKE.

222
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:45,216
YOU NEED AN AMBULANCE,
MOTHER.

223
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:50,437
IT'S TOO BAD
THERE'S NO ONE HERE

224
00:39:48,793 --> 00:39:51,093
WHO'D DREAM
OF CALLING YOU ONE.

225
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:02,762
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

226
00:40:03,198 --> 00:40:05,599
I DON'T WANT HER DYING
IN OUR HOUSE.

227
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:33,146
HEY THERE.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

228
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,202
(weakly) YOUR MOTHER...

229
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:37,688
SHE TRIED TO KILL ME.

230
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:39,457
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.

231
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:41,837
SHE'S NEVER GONNA
HURT YOU AGAIN,

232
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:44,652
AND NEITHER WILL ALMA.

233
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:46,415
ALMA?

234
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:49,341
SHE'S DEAD.
WHAT?

235
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:51,885
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,
BUT SHE'S GONE...

236
00:40:51,885 --> 00:40:52,494
OH.

237
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:54,359
AND SHE'S TAKING OUR TROUBLES
WITH HER.

238
00:40:56,807 --> 00:41:01,432
 <i>(Orson) TOMORROW MORNING,</i>
 <i>ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS</i>

239
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:03,107
 <i>WILL STUMBLE</i>
 <i>ON A GRUESOME SURPRISE--</i>

240
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,088
 <i>TWO BODIES SIDE BY SIDE.</i>

241
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,756
 <i>THE POLICE WILL CONCLUDE</i>
 <i>THAT ALMA FELL FROM THE ROOF,</i>

242
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:18,690
 <i>AND WHEN MY MOTHER FOUND HER,</i>
 <i>SHE SUFFERED A STROKE.</i>
