1
00:00:00,922 --> 00:00:02,640
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:05,495
All right. I love you.
There, I said it.

3
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:07,852
<i>Feelings were stated boldly.</i>

4
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:11,590
- It's time for me to give up on man.
- You can always just do what I did.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,593
- <i>A romantic suggestion was made.</i>
- Date chicks?

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,699
- <i>And a plan was hatched...</i>
- He wants to represent you.

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:21,701
They want you in New York
immediately.

8
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,139
- <i>To break up a romance...</i>
- This is a huge opportunity.

9
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,772
The best part is she is miles away
from the nearest Bolen.

10
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:30,876
<i>But young love couldn't be stopped.</i>

11
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:38,987
<i>Since she'd become a mother,</i>

12
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:42,195
<i>Gabrielle Solis had
learned many things...</i>

13
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:46,172
<i>How to get gum
off a remote control...</i>

14
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:50,642
<i>How to rescue a doll
from the disposal...</i>

15
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:55,432
<i>And where to find
disappointing report cards.</i>

16
00:00:56,664 --> 00:01:00,576
Gabrielle had also learned
that no matter how hard she tried...

17
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:02,058
Cereal again?

18
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,328
<i>She couldn't please everyone.</i>

19
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,790
Another free meal
you didn't have to work for.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,756
It's tough being 7.
Celia, get down here!

21
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:12,108
Ana used to make us bacon.

22
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:13,717
I miss her.

23
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:17,751
She also used to do the laundry
and the windows, so I miss her more.

24
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:19,824
Celia, the milk is poured!

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,624
I need cupcakes for school today.

26
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:24,726
Today? How many?

27
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:25,705
Mom!

28
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:26,873
Three dozen.

29
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:29,751
Why didn't you tell me this
last night?

30
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,213
I forgot. We got any ham?
I need meat.

31
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,969
Are you gonna pick up
my suit from the dry cleaners?

32
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,573
Yes, after I fold the laundry,
fry up some ham

33
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:40,720
and pull three dozen
cupcakes out of my ass!

34
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,682
- Mom!
- What?!

35
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:46,115
My face itches.

36
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:49,145
What are those, mosquito bites?

37
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,815
That looks like chicken pox.

38
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,193
I don't have time for sick kids!

39
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,701
Forget the dry cleaning.
You gotta take her to the doctor.

40
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,829
What do you do for chicken pox?
I've never had 'em.

41
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:02,460
What? Stop!

42
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,830
- Why?
- You can't go near her.

43
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:07,369
You're not immune.
In fact, you gotta get out of here.

44
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,923
- Celia is sick.
- Chicken pox is dangerous for adults.

45
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:11,663
- Go!
- I have to do the laundry,

46
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,650
- I've got dishes.
- I will take care of the house.

47
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,801
<i>Yes, Gabrielle had learned
many things as a mother.</i>

48
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,678
<i>The most important...</i>

49
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,555
See ya.

50
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:27,513
<i>Was to get while the
getting was good.</i>

00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:39,566
<i>Seduction...</i>

54
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:43,568
<i>Any soap opera fan will tell you,</i>

55
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:46,490
<i>it's an art best practiced...</i>

56
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:47,846
Stop.

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,635
<i>... On those who are vulnerable.</i>

58
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,502
Hey there.
You hungry?

59
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:56,410
I am now.

60
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,506
What's that amazing smell?

61
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,762
Cinnamon brioche french toast.

62
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,001
But I probably shouldn't.
You're such an amazing cook.

63
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:09,392
I'm already having trouble
fitting into my clothes.

64
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:15,273
You need some maple syrup.

65
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:19,068
Seriously, you heated the syrup?

66
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,781
You're unbelievable.

67
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:28,970
You should eat it
while it's still...

68
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,960
Hot.

69
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:46,087
Look.

70
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:48,515
I just got syrup all over me.

71
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:54,050
I don't know what it is with me.
I just... have to get dirty.

72
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:55,869
You...

73
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,566
Got some on your bra, too.

74
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:20,088
I'll get it.

75
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:25,456
<i>Please. It's wrong.</i>

76
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,679
<i>Then why does it feel so right?</i>

77
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:32,100
Katherine? You up yet?

78
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:35,747
Good. I was calling,
but you didn't hear me.

79
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:38,273
I think you feel
asleep with the tv on.

80
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,652
What would you like for breakfast?

81
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:46,186
Anything but french toast.

82
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,128
I don't think you'll
be here that long.

83
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,450
I got it.

84
00:04:55,748 --> 00:04:58,349
I got the perfect name for the baby.

85
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,337
Patricia.

86
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:03,433
Let me think about it.

87
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:08,803
Why not? It's a great name.

88
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:12,540
I told you, I want to honor my aunt.
We're naming her Polly.

89
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,821
Polly?

90
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:16,712
You get a peg leg,
I'll get an eye patch,

91
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:19,400
and we'll carry her
around on our shoulders.

92
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,116
- Morning, Penny.
- Hey, baby.

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,036
Where are my pancakes?

94
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,618
Sweetie, I've got a lot going on today.
I'll make you pancakes this weekend.

95
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:34,162
But I always get
pancakes on my birthday.

96
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,307
That's... Right.

97
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:39,709
You do.

98
00:05:42,494 --> 00:05:44,491
- But...
- We... Have...

99
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:48,474
an even bigger treat
planned for you this year.

100
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:50,053
What?

101
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:55,037
Like I'm gonna tell ya
and ruin the big surprise!

102
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:58,283
- How could you forget her birthday?
- Me? I'm pregnant.

103
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,855
I forget pants sometimes.
What's your excuse?

104
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:02,482
What's my surprise?

105
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,469
What are we gonna do?

106
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:08,821
Cover me. I'm going in.

107
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,739
Birthday breakfasts...

108
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:17,629
are for kids.

109
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:20,500
Now that you're 11,

110
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,320
I was planning to make you...

111
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,702
the best...

112
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:29,936
birthday... dinner ever,

113
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:32,836
with decorations...

114
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:36,516
Tons of presents...

115
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,436
Pin the tail on the...

116
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:43,080
You forgot my birthday.

117
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:50,905
There was no covering that, babe.

118
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,637
You're twice the man he is.

119
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,833
What's Raymundo gonna say when he finds
out Tiffany's sleeping with his brother?

120
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:05,294
Alas, you'll never know.

121
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:09,432
- We were just taking a break.
- So I gathered.

122
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,968
If you don't mind,
Tad, I'd like to my son.

123
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:13,720
Sure, go ahead.

124
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:16,139
In private, Tad.

125
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:20,765
- So you want me to...
- Be anyplace else but here, right.

126
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:26,065
So what's up?

127
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:30,166
There's a truck outside with the flower
arrangements for the Adams party.

128
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:32,266
All 100 of them.

129
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,542
- Wait. But we only ordered ten.
- That's what I said.

130
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,036
Then the delivery man
showed me this invoice.

131
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,585
At first I wasn't sure
if that was Tad's signature

132
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,267
but when I saw that his
name was misspelled...

133
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:45,168
I knew it was him.

134
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,111
Would you like me to talk to him?

135
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,339
I'd like you to hold him down while
I strike him with a large wooden spoon.

136
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:54,177
- Whatever. I'll take care of it.
- What are you going to say to him?

137
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:59,181
When Orson had his accident,
did you or did you not put me in charge?

138
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:02,351
Yes, but I am starting
to think that you're not ready.

139
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,499
I'm never gonna figure this
job out unless you let me make mistakes

140
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,146
- and learn from them.
- I realize that, but you're...

141
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:11,638
I know you have your control issues,

142
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:14,167
but when stuff happens,
you'll have to learn to relax

143
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:16,538
and let me clean up my own messes.

144
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,413
Where do you want all
these flower arrangements?

145
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,599
No problem, Tad.
As luck would have it,

146
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:29,112
we've got extra.

147
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:37,595
Roy, we've got guests.
You can watch your soap later.

148
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:39,400
Come on, Roy.

149
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,893
Again, thank you for inviting us over
to brunch. Everything looks delicious.

150
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,886
It does, doesn't it?

151
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:49,107
Right, Karen?
You know what I want.

152
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,736
When company comes over,
I get to use salt.

153
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:55,947
Roy's on a low-sodium diet.

154
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:59,826
"No sodium" is code for "
tastes like socks."

155
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,704
So sue me 'cause I don't
want you dropping dead.

156
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:07,166
Listen to you two. You sound
like a sweet, old married couple.

157
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:15,675
Have you ever thought of
making an honest woman out of Karen?

158
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,179
What are you doing?

159
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,099
I just want them to
be as happy as we are.

160
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,839
We're happy.

161
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,728
Living in sin suits us just fine.

162
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,523
Is that how Karen feels?

163
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:33,446
Susan,
why don't you try this frittata?

164
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:37,176
Karen don't care about marriage.

165
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:39,115
Do you, pumpkin?

166
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,185
Here.

167
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,049
Have some more salt.

168
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:45,580
I always figured you'd say no.

169
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,915
So why don't you grow
a pair and find out?

170
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:50,918
Are you serious?

171
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:54,755
Of course she's serious.

172
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:58,924
Fine.

173
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,979
Mike, give me a hand, will you?

174
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:05,104
Oh, my god! This is so romantic.

175
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:09,227
Karen, will you...

176
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:12,069
Son of a bee.
There's the battery to my hearing aid.

177
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,615
Do you wanna marry me?

178
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:25,203
Golly, I don't know what to say.
This is all so sudden.

179
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,080
Answer. My knee hurts.

180
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,210
I would love to marry you, Roy.

181
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,556
If Gaby's staying just a couple of days,
why'd she bring three suitcases?

182
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:49,227
She said most of her dresses
haven't had chicken pox either.

183
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,488
That... was amazing.

184
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,650
I just took a nap in
the middle of the day.

185
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:59,846
- Guess it's different without kids.
- You kidding me?

186
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,822
I haven't taken a nap
since Juanita crowned.

187
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,160
You created a visual that is forbidden
inside these walls. Try to watch that.

188
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,920
Here. You're just in time
for pre-dinner cosmos.

189
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,679
In a crystal glass?

190
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,465
Celia broke our
last one six months ago.

191
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:18,359
I've been drinking my cocktails
out of a scooby-doo sippy cup.

192
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:21,634
I'm in heaven.

193
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,053
So it's movie night.
Have you seen this?

194
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,764
Does it have a talking penguin
or a dog that plays basketball?

195
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,017
- Gratuitous sex and lots of violence.
- Yay, art!

196
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:40,711
Somebody's glass is empty.

197
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,947
That's also forbidden
inside these walls.

198
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,918
I know I don't know you
guys that well, but...

199
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:49,259
I love you.

200
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:57,433
Are you okay?

201
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,662
All right, it's time for cake.

202
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:03,926
- I got your favorite.
- Chocolate?

203
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,595
I got your second favorite.

204
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:08,686
- Mom?
- Yes?

205
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,420
I have a date in half
an hour. Can I go now?

206
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,024
You cannot go.

207
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:15,681
Preston's in Europe.
Parker's at band practice.

208
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,773
You are representing all siblings.

209
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,811
Don't you feel bad we
forgot her birthday?

210
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:22,005
I didn't. I gave her
a present this morning.

211
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,044
So don't take it out on me that
you and dad failed as parents.

212
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:29,622
We used up all our good parenting
on you. That's why you're so delightful.

213
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:33,488
Here we go!

214
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:37,524
One, two, three...

215
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:38,794
Who's Polly?

216
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,136
Oh, my god!

217
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:49,096
Erase, erase, erase.

218
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,683
Sweetie, I am so sorry.

219
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:57,335
I don't know if you know this, but
pregnant women get a little scattered.

220
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,921
And then your dad and I were
talking about baby names,

221
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,902
and I got on the phone
with the bakery, and...

222
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,339
Which is clearly a terrible excuse,
and again, I am so sorry.

223
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:08,324
Let me fix this.

224
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:14,337
That just made it worse,

225
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:16,749
and how would you like a puppy?

226
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:18,424
Forget it.

227
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,831
But you haven't opened
your presents yet.

228
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,384
Come back...

229
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:27,079
- Penny.
- I know her name.

230
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:34,750
What's going on?

231
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,020
Danny took off. Listen to this...

232
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,668
"Didn't want to wake you.
Went camping with Eddie.

233
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:42,696
"Had to clear my head
about the Ana thing.

234
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:45,694
P.S. Took my cell,
but doubt we'll have reception."

235
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:47,988
Good for him.

236
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,825
Are you crazy?
He's never been by himself.

237
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,747
He knows how to drink out of
a canteen and pee on a tree.

238
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,871
- I think he'll be fine.
- This isn't funny.

239
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:57,808
Should he have asked us?
Yeah.

240
00:13:57,978 --> 00:13:59,291
But I think it's healthy.

241
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,006
HeBetter hiking with Eddie than alone
in his room with a bottle of pills.

242
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:08,843
I don't know.

243
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,513
He's 19. Eventually,
we gotta let him live a normal life.

244
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:16,297
He's never gonna have a normal life.

245
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:18,001
None of us will.

246
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:24,748
I realize the mistake
was ours, mr. Tanble,

247
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:28,362
but what am I supposed to do
with 90 extra floral arrangements?

248
00:14:28,912 --> 00:14:32,186
It will be your problem
if I stop doing business with you.

249
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:36,871
Yes. What can I do for you?

250
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:39,206
Actually, the question
is what can I do for you?

251
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:41,167
Sorry. Did we have an appointment?

252
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:43,927
No, but I've been wanting to
meet you for such a long time,

253
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:46,702
and when I woke up this morning,
I told myself today is the day.

254
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,766
- May I sit?
- Not just yet.

255
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:51,604
- What is it you want, mister...
- Allen. Sam Allen.

256
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,841
I've been following
your career for a while.

257
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:56,386
Been to some parties you've catered,
got your cookbook,

258
00:14:56,556 --> 00:15:00,041
read every interview you've done,
and you're quite amazing.

259
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,335
How nice. Let's skip to
the part where you assure

260
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:03,903
you're not a deranged stalker.

261
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,237
Hardly. I want to work for you.

262
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:08,819
Doing what?

263
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:11,118
Anything. Everything.

264
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,513
I'm very busy, mr. Allen. You could
leave your resume with my assistant...

265
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,227
I worked as a sous-chef to put
myself through business school,

266
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:21,128
where I graduated first.

267
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,422
I know my way around a
kitchen and a calculator.

268
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:26,962
And I'm not asking you to pay me
a lot of money, not yet anyway.

269
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,518
I want to learn your
business from the ground up,

270
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:32,051
and then I want to
help you expand it.

271
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:33,594
Really?

272
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,184
You're a woman who has something
to say about traditional values,

273
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,351
and I think our country's
ready to listen.

274
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:42,877
I am flattered...

275
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:45,067
But I'm also fully staffed,

276
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,613
and I honestly wouldn't know
how to use you.

277
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:48,817
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,904
So am I.

279
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:58,458
In regard to the extra arrangements,
you could donate them to a hospital

280
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:00,871
and record the loss as a
charitable contribution.

281
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,332
And if you split the
arrangements in half,

282
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,785
you could double the
amount you claim.

283
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:07,169
Just a thought.

284
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:10,548
Mr. Allen?

285
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,801
Now you can sit.

286
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:21,350
Where's your blushing bride?

287
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:24,228
Upstairs in the can.
What do you want?

288
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:26,460
I thought I would drop this off.

289
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,483
It's a bouquet I found. Don't
you think it'll be perfect for Karen?

290
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,694
Haven't you done enough already?

291
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:35,948
We had a good thing going-
me and Karen.

292
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,076
Now 'cause of you, we're gonna
get married and ruin it.

293
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:42,871
Getting married isn't gonna ruin it.
It's gonna make it better.

294
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:45,624
No, it isn't. It's like salt.

295
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:46,917
What?

296
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,659
All my life,
I never cared about salt,

297
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:57,432
but when my doctor said I
couldn't have it anymore,

298
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,346
I started craving it.

299
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,722
Wait...

300
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:04,300
You telling me that...

301
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,186
You're gonna cheat on Karen?

302
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:09,404
I go to a stretching
class at the center.

303
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,481
There's a lady with blue hair,
always sits in front of me.

304
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,154
Six months she's been there.
I never gave a crap about her.

305
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:16,530
But this morning,

306
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:20,583
48 hours after you told me
I had to propose to Karen,

307
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:24,768
I'm looking at ol'blue hair,
and I'm smacking my lips.

308
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,305
Salt.

309
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:29,240
You're 80 years old, Roy.

310
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,715
Infidelity is...

311
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:31,962
Dangerous.

312
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:33,557
My body's 80,

313
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,276
but inside,

314
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:37,676
I'm still a randy teenage boy.

315
00:17:38,362 --> 00:17:40,000
Susan, I'm telling ya,

316
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,473
I have to kiss some other
women before I die.

317
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:44,892
You can't, so forget it!

318
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:48,407
Just think about Karen and
how much she loves you,

319
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:51,914
And if you do that,
I'm sure you'll be able to resist

320
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,193
any inappropriate urges.

321
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:03,035
Yeah, that's the stuff.

322
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:15,589
How is your wife
being molested funny?

323
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:18,190
It was just a kiss from
an 80-year-old man.

324
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,387
Too bad he didn't grab my ass.
You'd be rolling on the floor.

325
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,798
What do you want me to do, beat him up?
Take the tennis balls off his walker?

326
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:27,821
Forget about me.
What about what he's doing to Karen?

327
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:31,730
They're about to get married, and
he has no intention of being faithful.

328
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:34,692
Because he feels trapped.
And whose fault is that?

329
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,944
Don't point the mustard at me.

330
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,989
I was there.
You practically forced him into this.

331
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:47,115
I made a mistake. I didn't know that
he was some sort of jurassic gigolo.

332
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,957
I have to tell Karen
about this right now.

333
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:51,792
No. You've meddled enough.

334
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:55,254
I can't let her marry him,
knowing what I know.

335
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,575
He's having second thoughts.

336
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,760
There's not a married man on earth who
didn't have that before he got married.

337
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:03,971
Oh, really?

338
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:10,853
I didn't mean...

339
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,207
Okay, I'm done.

340
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:18,299
See ya, boys! Thanks for driving!

341
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:22,216
- Don't forget to friend us!
- I won't, Fernando.

342
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:24,283
And good luck with
your pec implants.

343
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:33,834
All right, time for a nightcap.

344
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:36,783
Nightcaps! I'd forgotten
all about nightcaps.

345
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:39,255
- I miss the gay single life.
- You know what?

346
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:42,028
She deserves the full experience.
We're gonna throw you a party.

347
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,594
Brilliant! I have mini
quiches in the freezer

348
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:46,729
and ten homos on speed dial.
It's done.

349
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:49,681
I'm so excited!
Invite those guys from tonight...

350
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:51,685
Except Fernando.
He's prettier than me.

351
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:56,353
<i>Hi. It's Bob. * and Lee.
Leave a message.</i>

352
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,957
<i>Hey, guys. It's Carlos.
I'm looking for Gaby.</i>

353
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,518
<i>Doctor says the girls aren't contagious
anymore, so she can come home.</i>

354
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:04,505
<i>Thanks.</i>

355
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:05,741
That's good news.

356
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:07,590
What?!

357
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,412
That is horrible news.
My children are healthy. Damn it!

358
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:11,997
But you can go home now.

359
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,168
I'm not ready.

360
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,090
I'm just starting to remember
what it's like to be human again...

361
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,974
Sleeping in, not stepping on toys,

362
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:22,248
eating at restaurants
that don't have a slide.

363
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,760
I have tasted freedom,
and I am not ready to give it up!

364
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,678
But what are you gonna tell Carlos?

365
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,574
A stomach virus?

366
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:34,765
<i>When you called earlier,
I was throwing up.</i>

367
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,217
We don't want the girls to catch it.

368
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:39,107
What's that noise?

369
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,019
My teeth are chattering.

370
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:45,392
Anyhow, I'll be home
as soon as I can.

371
00:20:45,562 --> 00:20:48,166
- Doctor says it's a 24-hour thing.
- Don't forget the hangover.

372
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:50,414
Or 36-hour thing. Gotta go.

373
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,310
Start pourin'.

374
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,259
I said I was throwing up.
Don't want to be a liar.

375
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:05,256
I can hire whomever I want.
It's my company.

376
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:07,476
And I run it for you.
I should've been consulted.

377
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:11,132
Why are you being so unpleasant
about this? I hired Sam to help you.

378
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:13,642
I don't need his help.
I've got it under control.

379
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,333
All I've seen lately
is evidence to the contrary,

380
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:21,453
And if you think I'm gonna stand by
while everything I've built falls apart.

381
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:27,364
- I thought you'd gone home.
- I stayed late to finish the inventory.

382
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:30,367
Aren't you industrious?

383
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,120
I also wanted to talk about Tad.

384
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:34,955
What about him?

385
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:39,166
Every task I've given him he's
either botched or failed to finish.

386
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:41,044
I think it's time to cut our losses.

387
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:43,088
We're not firing Tad.

388
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:45,793
- Why not? He's a moron.
- He's a good guy,

389
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:48,635
and I don't want you talking
that way about my employees.

390
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:52,139
Andrew, you have to admit,
he's more than a little incompetent.

391
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,809
Give him a chance. He's just a kid.

392
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,105
You're having an affair with him,
aren't you?

393
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:04,526
How could you say such a thing?

394
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,940
I think the more
pertinent question is

395
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:10,616
why isn't Andrew denying it?

396
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,957
Have you had sex with Tad?

397
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:21,668
Just once.

398
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,799
He came on to me.
It was late, and I'd been drinking.

399
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,329
That's your excuse?

400
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:32,429
Honestly,
I am so disappointed in you.

401
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,431
Really? You want to play that card?

402
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:37,684
- You're living with Alex.
- And you're married to Orson.

403
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:41,772
I know about Karl Mayer.

404
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:44,066
Hello, pot. I'm kettle.
It's nice to meet you.

405
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:46,740
I can't believe you'd bring
this up in front of a stranger.

406
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:50,072
You know me. Hypocrisy
just makes me forget my manners.

407
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:51,740
Perhaps I should go.

408
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:52,990
Yes.

409
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:57,329
But I want you back here bright
and early tomorrow to help me fire Tad.

410
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:00,290
You can't fire him.

411
00:23:00,783 --> 00:23:01,851
Yes, I can.

412
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:05,020
In fact, I can fire anyone I want.

413
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:21,482
And then right as I was
taking off her bra,

414
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,193
I woke up.

415
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,979
What do you think that means?

416
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,448
Seems pretty straightforward.

417
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,368
But I'm not a lesbian.

418
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:35,079
You're getting ahead of yourself.

419
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,373
Maybe this dream
isn't even about Robin.

420
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,209
Maybe it's about how
I've been so hurt by men

421
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,921
that women
are the only safe option left.

422
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:47,618
Why are you even thinking about
relationships at all, with men or women?

423
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:48,968
You're still fragile.

424
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,470
Now when you're stronger,

425
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,056
then we can talk about who
you might be attracted to.

426
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,977
But I'm not attracted to her.
That's what I'm saying.

427
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,226
Women my age
don't just wake up one day

428
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:03,543
with a whole new sexual identity.

429
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:06,110
This dream has got
to mean something else.

430
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,241
Well, what it tells me, clearly,

431
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:11,490
is that you are being
distracted from your recovery.

432
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,285
So what am I supposed
to do, stop dreaming?

433
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:20,374
But you might want to consider asking
Robin to find another place to stay.

434
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,551
This lettering is so small.
I can hardly read the label.

435
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,687
While you're deciding which one is
dolphin-safe, I'm gonna get some beer.

436
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,083
- Do you shop here?
- Where's Danny?

437
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,550
He said you guys were going camping.

438
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:59,527
I... It turned out
I couldn't go, so...

439
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:01,415
he just went... by himself.

440
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,097
You wanna get in line?

441
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,505
You wanna make me?

442
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,508
Spill it.

443
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:14,345
I'm sorry. He said he'd
call you when he got there.

444
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:16,389
You guys back already?

445
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:18,474
So where is he really?

446
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,587
Danny went to find Ana.

447
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:32,768
Don't freak out. It's a big city.

448
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,387
What if he goes
to the old neighborhood?

449
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:37,493
Patrick is not going to find him.

450
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,411
He found us the last time.

451
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,623
Come on. I gotta go pack.

452
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,638
You're in early.

453
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,317
I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd

454
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:02,935
review our liability
insurance, but...

455
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:05,343
I'm having
a little trouble focusing.

456
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,760
Maybe some coffee will perk you up.

457
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:12,953
About what happened
yesterday, Sam, that...

458
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,947
ugliness with Andrew...

459
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:18,564
Driven, successful people like
you have complicated lives,

460
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:21,203
but the specifics
are none of my business.

461
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:23,452
My...

462
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,359
relationship with Andrew is,
to say the least,

463
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,712
complicated.

464
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:34,293
I'm sure Andrew respects
and loves you very much. I...

465
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:36,487
just worry that...

466
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,721
- What?
- Well,

467
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:42,411
it's not unusual for children
in a family business

468
00:26:42,578 --> 00:26:46,270
to have a sense of entitlement.
I hope you don't mind me saying that.

469
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:49,356
No. Go ahead.

470
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,408
This must be so hard.
What do you do in this situation?

471
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:56,155
Keep coddling him,
hoping he'll change,

472
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:59,533
or do you cut the apron strings
and trust that all the hard work

473
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,161
you've done
will allow him to thrive?

474
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,288
It's a good question.

475
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,448
You know what?
I've got everything under control here.

476
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:11,175
Why don't you go back to the house
and catch up on your sleep?

477
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,005
But there's so much work to be done.

478
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,759
Sure, but that's why you hired me,
isn't it, to help you out?

479
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:19,034
Thank you, Sam.

480
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,597
You're very kind.

481
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:26,533
And, Sam?

482
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:30,607
I'm very glad you're here.

483
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:06,558
Hey, Bert. I'm looking for Penny.
She didn't get off the bus.

484
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,645
That's 'cause she didn't get on.
I figured she went home sick.

485
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,230
What?

486
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,880
She didn't come home sick.
Where is she? Penny?

487
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,345
Penny said to give you this.

488
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:23,492
She's running away.

489
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,181
Any ideas why she ran away?
Problems at home?

490
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,661
No, everything's fine.

491
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:42,594
We did kind of forget her birthday.

492
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,475
And... she put the wrong
name on her birthday cake.

493
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:51,478
Honey, could we please stick to
the facts that pertain to the case?

494
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,398
How could you get
your daughter's name wrong?

495
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:58,831
Are you people
involved in narcotics?

496
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:02,780
No, I'm pregnant,
and it makes me very forgetful.

497
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:05,160
Surely you can understand that.

498
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,828
I'm not pregnant.

499
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:12,042
You're not gonna look
for our daughter, are you?

500
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:18,063
Aguilar.

501
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:20,692
Yeah, they're still here.

502
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:24,073
Your daughter's fine.

503
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,015
She tried to use your credit card
to check into a hotel.

504
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:36,447
You mind if I come in?

505
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:46,014
Marble bath,

506
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,244
flat screen,

507
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:50,997
$8 can of peanuts.

508
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,247
Nice.

509
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,132
Sweetie, I am so sorry
about the cake

510
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:02,258
and about forgetting your birthday.

511
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:10,565
I know you hate me right
now, and I don't blame you.

512
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:13,395
I don't hate you. I hate that.

513
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,073
Because you're not
gonna be the baby anymore.

514
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:33,706
Sweetie.

515
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:39,295
You're missing the big picture here.

516
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,549
Preston's gone. Porter's next.

517
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,972
When this girl comes along,
we are poised

518
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:48,805
to take control of the
house with a 3-2 majority.

519
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:51,182
Do you know what that means?

520
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:54,060
Women get veto power

521
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,062
over what tv shows to watch,

522
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,731
what takeout to get. Just think.

523
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:02,313
Think of a world
where the toilet seat is never up.

524
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,031
This is our time to take them down.

525
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,010
We're both gonna take them down!

526
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,024
I'm sorry I ran away.

527
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:24,591
We can go home now.

528
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:27,189
I have a better idea.

529
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:29,918
Since you already paid for the room,

530
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:32,350
how about we order
hot fudge sundaes...

531
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:34,017
and spend the night?

532
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,563
Just... just us girls.

533
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,280
You know, mom... If you have
two more girls, we'll take the lead.

534
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,701
Let's just... order our sundaes.

535
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:56,222
So there I was at this huge party,

536
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:58,260
flirting with this
middle eastern sheikh,

537
00:31:58,427 --> 00:32:02,070
and out of nowhere... He offers me
a million dollars to sleep with him.

538
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:03,656
So what did you do?

539
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:05,023
I slapped him.

540
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:10,540
Apparently in the right place, cause
I walked out of there with 20 grand.

541
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:13,052
It's Juanita.

542
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:16,725
Excuse me, guys.
Gotta do the "mommie dearest" thing.

543
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,728
Hi, sweetie. How was school?

544
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:20,676
What?

545
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:23,431
You scored a goal in soccer?

546
00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:25,513
What?

547
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:30,351
Hang on, sweetie, while I find
a quiet place so mommy can hear you.

548
00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:36,618
Hang on, sweetie.

549
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:41,033
Okay, honey, mommy can...

550
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:51,248
Hold on, sweetie.

551
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,223
Do the words "wet paint"
mean nothing to you?

552
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,604
Juanita? Honey, I have
to call you back. I love you.

553
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,976
Sorry.
I didn't mean to. I...

554
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,886
- Is this a...
- A nursery? Yes.

555
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:14,839
We haven't told
very many people yet, but...

556
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,703
Lee and I are trying
to adopt a baby.

557
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:20,311
I had no idea.

558
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,543
It's something
we've wanted for years.

559
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,504
Why?

560
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,550
I mean, you guys have this
amazing life.

561
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,670
Parties every night, cosmos at 5:00.

562
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:36,389
You know all that goes away
when the baby comes.

563
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,849
And we can't wait.

564
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:41,791
Last month there was
this baby in Ohio.

565
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,905
We got the call
in the middle of the night.

566
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:45,865
We were on a plane in the morning.

567
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:48,493
We got to the hospital,
and there she was...

568
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,736
a little girl.

569
00:33:58,624 --> 00:34:00,724
We held that baby in our arms...

570
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:03,737
for two days.

571
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:08,942
And then we went out to buy
a car seat to bring her home,

572
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:11,124
and when we got back
to the hospital, the...

573
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:14,217
social worker was waiting for us
outside the nursery.

574
00:34:17,212 --> 00:34:19,139
The mother had changed her mind.

575
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:24,654
I know how that feels.

576
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,300
I am so sorry, Bob.

577
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,032
You may envy our life, Gaby, but...

578
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:40,699
it's nothing compared
to how we envy yours.

579
00:34:51,478 --> 00:34:54,342
Hey, what are you doing?
The party's just getting started.

580
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,586
I know. It's just...

581
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,265
Juanita scored
her first goal in soccer,

582
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,041
and she wants to tell
me all about it, so...

583
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,208
Go.

584
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:07,418
- Give them a kiss for me.
- I will.

585
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:32,129
Knock, knock. Karen, are you home?

586
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:34,173
I'm in here.

587
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:39,556
Listen.

588
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:42,663
I've been thinking
about your wedding, and,

589
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,476
well, I just want
to talk to you about...

590
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,680
What's wrong?

591
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:49,689
Nothing.

592
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:55,653
The doctor found a spot on my lung.

593
00:35:58,049 --> 00:35:59,049
A spot?

594
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:04,014
He thinks it might be cancer.

595
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:18,760
She told you, huh?

596
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:24,724
It's gonna be okay.
She's getting a biopsy next week.

597
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,893
She's gonna lick this thing.

598
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,437
Cancer picked a fight
with the wrong broad.

599
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,173
So given the diagnosis,

600
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:38,279
maybe it's not a good time
to get married.

601
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:45,642
We're getting married,

602
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,371
soon as we can.

603
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:50,708
- But you said...
- I know what I said.

604
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:54,437
All I could think about
was losing my independence,

605
00:36:54,604 --> 00:36:56,354
losing my freedom, but...

606
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,464
after this happened,

607
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,929
now I realize the worst
thing I could lose is her.

608
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:05,701
So...

609
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:07,319
you're willing...

610
00:37:07,953 --> 00:37:09,253
to give up salt?

611
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,508
I'm willing to give up anything.

612
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,208
Watch it, doll.
I told you I'm giving it up.

613
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,321
One kiss is all you get.

614
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,602
- You're still up.
- Yeah, I...

615
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,257
sort of needed to talk to you
about something.

616
00:37:39,985 --> 00:37:43,177
Well, if it's me helping
with the bills... I've got great news.

617
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:44,971
You got the job?

618
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,223
You're looking
at the Downtown Grill's new hostess.

619
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,852
I start tomorrow.

620
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:56,023
Thank you for loaning me your top.
The manager said I looked very classy.

621
00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:00,573
I can't tell you
how happy this makes me.

622
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:04,407
So...
you wanna tell me your thing?

623
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:07,076
No, it's... it can wait.

624
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:08,803
Are you sure?

625
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:11,609
Yeah. Absolutely.

626
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,215
I'll get you a glass.

627
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,879
- Your blouse. I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

628
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,181
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm just gonna rinse it out.

629
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,685
- No... Stop. It's okay.
- No, but it's gonna stain.

630
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,632
- I'll send it to the dry cleaners.
- But that is so expensive.

631
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,149
- Here we go...
- You have to leave.

632
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:41,589
What?

633
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:43,779
I need you to move out of my house.

634
00:38:48,397 --> 00:38:49,397
Why?

635
00:38:52,906 --> 00:38:54,582
It's... it's complicated.

636
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:01,697
Is this...

637
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:04,342
this what you wanted
to talk to me about?

638
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,599
Sorry if I did something wrong.

639
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,280
I have a friend I can go stay with,
so I'm just gonna go pack.

640
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:23,856
You haven't done anything wrong.

641
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,413
I like you very much.

642
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,411
In fact...

643
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:32,954
too much.

644
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:39,033
Lately, I've...
started to have feelings for you...

645
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,658
that I don't understand,

646
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,399
and it's confusing me.

647
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,517
You know what I'm saying?

648
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
I do...

649
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,149
I'm having those feelings
for you, too.

650
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,719
You're right.

651
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:08,466
I should go.

652
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:05,803
<i>Seduction is an art.</i>

653
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:11,099
<i>Subtle methods of coercion are used</i>

654
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,856
<i>to sway the susceptible.</i>

655
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:19,999
<i>And those who are determined</i>

656
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:24,848
<i>will take their time
to get what they want.</i>

657
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:30,696
<i>And when the seduction
is successful,</i>

658
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,513
<i>those who succumbed
ask themselves...</i>

659
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,342
<i>was I seduced...</i>

660
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,038
<i>or was this what I wanted</i>
