<i>Lynette was afraid</i>  <i>for her children...</i>

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,370
It feels like I've ruined their childhood.

<i>Katherine's past...</i> we know all about chicago.

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,430
they could make me testify against you.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,750
<i>But evasive action was taken.</i>

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,520
I want us to be together, too,

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,670
but I also wanna feel good

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,500
<i>and gaby and carlos</i>  <i>ended their affair...</i>

<i>Too late.</i>

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,560
Could you make it out to "cash"?

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,240
<i>(Mary alice)</i>  <i>as a little girl,</i>

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,160
ritt  <i>was afraid of many things,</i>

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,630
????

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,270
<i>So they would wait for her</i>  <i>with rubber snakes</i>

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,370
<i>and croaking frogs...</i> (ribbit)

21
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,650

<i>But once she was a big girl,</i>

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,010
<i>edie britt was afraid</i>  <i>of only one thing--</i>

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,460
<i>that her lover might leave her</i>

26
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,520

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,120

28
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,370
<i>So when he decided to go,</i>  <i>he tried to do it quickly...</i>

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,210
What the hell is this?

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,190
<i>Mostly to avoid her screaming.</i>

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,260
It just hasn't been working for a long,longime.

32
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,530
(sighs) that's a lie. We were ppy.

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,740
Come on. L's not argue.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,370
I want us to end this as friends.

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,400
I t you do,given all I know about your finances.

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,160
That's true. You know some of my secrets,

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,170
but I'm betting you still care enough about me to keep them.

38
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,630
All right.

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,930
I won't say anything to anyone

40
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,850
about your money in the grand caymans

41
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,410
on one condition--

42
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,540
You have to tell me the truth about why you're leaving.

43
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,960
The truth?

44
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,570
Is there someone else?

45
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,730
no.

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,850
Thank you,carlos.

47
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,480
You made this a lot easier.

hi.

in a offshore bank account.

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,290

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,370
<i>yes,it was that time of year.</i>

59
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,950
<i>Halloween had come once again</i>  <i>to wisteria lane,</i>

60
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,310
<i>and no one was more determined</i>  <i>to celebrate its arrival</i>

61
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,730
<i>than the gay couple</i>  <i>who had just moved in.</i>

62
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,460
So which of the neighbors should we invite first?

63
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,830
What does it matter? They all hate us? Oh,lee,that's not true. They hate you.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,480
I'm the butch one they can feel comfortable around.

65
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,890
You keep telling yourself that. Let's start with bree.

66
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,780
She's got a gay son. I bet she's homo-friendly.

67
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,640
Why? My mother has one, and she's not.

68
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,480
hi.

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,780
Oh,hello.

70
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,110
We're just dropping by to let you know

71

we're having a halloween party. We'd!love for you to come.

72
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,120
Oh,well,thank you. Orson and I would be delighted.

73
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,030
Well,you can bring your whole family if you like.

74
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Is that your daughter?

75
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,240
Uh,no,my daughter is in switzerland,

76
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,760
at boarding school.

77
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,530
Who was that?

78
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,340
My son...

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,080
Trying on his costume.

80
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,390
He's going to be cher this year.

81
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,940
Okay, he's definitely invited.

82
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,520
How many times have I told you to stay away from the windows?

83
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,460
I'm bored. You won't let me go outside.

84
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,310
Can't I at least look? At's that?

85
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,240
Oh,we've been invited to bob and lee's for halloween.

86
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,540
A costume party. Cool. Can I go?

87
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,900
Are you insane?

88
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,280
It's halloween. I'll go as a pumpkin.

89
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,360
You are due in three weeks.

90
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,390
Until then,no windows and no parties. (sighs)

91
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,840
so... This is gonna be fun.

92
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,600
Will you help me with a costume?

93
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,080
(chuckles) sure!

94
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,130
How familiar are you withop icons from the '70s?

95
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,900
Victor,it's me. I got your message.

96
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,910
I've gotta be honest, I'm very annoyed

97
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,650
that you're not coming home today like you promised.

98
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,240
I told you I have something very important to tell you,

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,630
and I want to do it in person,

100
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,920
but now you're gonna be home for another week,

101
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,950
and I can't wait.

102
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,610
Victor,i'm leaving you.

103
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,550
I... Can't believe I'm ending my marriage

104
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,410
on a hotel voice mai

105
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,090
this is very tacky.

106
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,770
You're forcing me to be tacky, victor.

107
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,090
I am not a tacky person. I am very,very classy.

108
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,690
(line clicks) oh! Hang on one second.

109
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,370
Hello? Hey,carlos. Yeah,i can't talk right now.

110
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,410
I'm breaking up with victor.

111
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,770
No,he's not here. He's in washington.

112
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,210
Yeah,okay,i'll explain later.

113
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
Sorry about that,victor.

114
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,670
Uh,anyway,it's over.

115
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,370
Uh,we both know it wasn't working.

116
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,910
Uh,good luck on everything,

117
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,450
and you don't have to call me back.

118
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,240
Okay,bye-bye.

119
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,200
ah.

120
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,770
I was surprised that my doctor suggested genetic counseling.

121
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,300
I didn't have to do that with my last baby.

122
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,450
Well,you were 26

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,910
????

124
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,750
Now you're--

125
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,320
Careful.

126
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,250
Old enough to benefit

127
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,340
from this particunar branch of medicine.

128
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,650
Nice save.

129
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,930
Now can we just skip to the part

130
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,850
where you tell me what's wrong with my baby?

131
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,190
Well,we don't know if anything's wrong.

132
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,310
See,we're just going over your family medical history

133
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,800
just--just to be on the safe side.

134
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,770
Okay. My aunt ella has arthritis.

135
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,860
I have two cousins with webbed feet,

136
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,410
and there's a whole

137
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,910
apparently,i married into carny folk.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,340
(chuckles) okay,mike, what about your family?

139
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,570
Everybody's pretty healthy.

140
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,520
Uh,my grandther has epilepsy.

141
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,480
My father had high blood pressure,

142
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,930
on medication, so it's fine now.

143
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,060
What do you mean

144
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,810
????

145
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,720
'cause that's what you told me when we first started dating.

146
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,620
Oh. Well,i'm sorry if I gave you that impression.

147
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,440
It wasn't an impression.

148
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,790
You sa

149
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,290
(chuckles nervously) it's... Complicated.

150
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,600
How can it be complicated? He's either dead or alive.

151
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,240
Does it sound complicated to you,michelle? (cell phone buzzing)

152
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,260
oh,um...

153
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,300
Wow,i'm sorry. I-I've got an emergency plumbing call.

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
I'm gonna have to do this later. Uh,don't wait up.

155
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,230
Okay,so,um, mike's grandmother is epileptic?

156
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,630
Yeah.

157
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,570
But apparently,his dad can rise from the dead.

158
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,260
So let's hope the baby gets that gene.

159
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Hey. How'd the p.e.t. Scan go?

160
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,420
She was a real trouper.

161
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,410
20 minutes inside that tube, she didn't complain once.

162
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,570
In a couple of days,we'll know if you beat this son of a bitch.

163
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,900
Hey,dr. Rushton is very optimistic.

164
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,870
(stella) fantastic. He's the best.

165
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,870
Hey,what do you say I ditch work,

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,650
and I take you to that... Thai place for lunch? Lynette?

167
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,610
Is that a hole? What?

168
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,610
In the garden there. Has something been digging in there?

169
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,900
Oh,it might be a possum. Ahem.

170
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,790
I-I saw one the other day.

171
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,650
????

172
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,900
Didn't know it was front-page news.

173
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,360
Well,we gotta do something about this.

174
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,680
And we will,so do you want to bring the kids,

175
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,630
or would you prefer

176
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,060
a,uh,gloriously romantic lunch with just me? I can't eat right now,tom.

177
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,250
I've got to go to the garden center

178
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,650
and get some fencing. God,this is annoying!

179
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,920
Can't believe you didn't tell me we have a possum!

180
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,070
Oh,you're,um, you're up.

181
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,840
I was just gonna try not to wake you.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,290
Did you really think I was gonnalet you

183
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,540
without an mxplanation for your bizarre behavior?

184
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,690
Well,what good's a dream

185
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,270
????

186
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,100
I don't care what the issues are.

187
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,720
You don't deny your own dad's existence.

188
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,090
My father's in prison for murder.

189
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,900
So can you see why I might have wanted to lie about him

190
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,870
on a first date?

191
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,700
Oh,my god.

192
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,250
He's in jail for m

193
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,930
yeah.

194
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,200
He's doing life without parole.

195
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,620
Do you see him? I mean,do you have a relationship with him?

196
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,660
Uh,i visit a few times a year.

197
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,910
Well, I've got to meet him.

198
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,420
(chuckles) no,i don't think that's such a good idea. Well,he's your father.

199
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,990
I should know him,and besides, that genetic counselor

200
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,210
said we should gher data about your family's history.

201
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,470
Maybe you dad knows something you don't.

202
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,740
I mean,i should meet him r the sake of our baby.

203
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,270
Well,yeah. Fine. We'll go see him.

204
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,640
Thank you.

205
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,940
Mom! We're gonna bake you a cake

206
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,770
when the doctor says your cancer's gone.

207
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,090
Great. Here. Grab this.

208
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,090
What's this stuff for?

209
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,550
You know that possum that's been ruining our garden?

210
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,450
Yeah,me and preston named him scruffles.

211
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,620
Don't give him a name. He's not gonna be around much longer.

212
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,050
You're not gonna hurt him, are you?

213
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,290
Honey,i put up a fence, and he burrowed right under it.

214
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,010
The man at the garden center said these are crafty creatures,

215
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,450
and there's only one way to stop 'em.

216
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,620
So you're gonna kill h?

217
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,870
Sweetie, let me ask you something.

218
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,910
If you had to choose between mommy's beautiful garden

219
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,930
and a gross, mean,dirty possum,

220
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,550
what

221
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,250
scruffles.

222
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,880
Okay, we're done talking here.

223
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,760
You're sending me back to the convent?

224
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,830
Well,you certainly don't seem happy here,and I thought

225
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,720
maybe you were missing the nuns and the other girls.

226
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,350
Oh,whoopee. Knocked-up sluts and celibate freaks.

227
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,210
Start the party. (sighs)

228
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,520
whatever. I don't care. I just want this thing out of me.

229
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,110
You know,danielle, I just want you to be aware

230
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,270
that giving up this baby might be harder than you think.

231
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,300
It won't be a problem. Trust me.

232
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,930
Well,you say that now, but once you've held your child

233
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,790
and felt that rush of love, well...

234
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,040
It can change you.

235
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,160
Please. I hate this baby.

236
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,610
What has it done but make me fat

237
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,540
and ruin an enre year of my life?

238
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,060
I'm just saying,if I were you, I might be feeling--

239
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,890
Stop. Who says I have to feel the same things you'd feel?

240
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,900
I'm nothing like you.

241
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,610
You always s that like it's something to be p

242
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,570
but the day I see even a glimmer of myself in you

243
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,220
is the day that I realize

244
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,100
you've finally started... (whispers) to grow up.

245
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,040
Well, don't hold your breath.

246
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,450
No,on second thought,

247
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,660
<i>do.</i>

248
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,120
Hello,gabrielle.

249
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,760
oh!

250
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,610
(panting) milton... You scared me.

251
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,930
I thought you were in washington with victor.

252
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,720
I was. I got to the messages first.

253
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,080
Oh. You can't leave him, gabrielle.

254
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Well,if he really wanted me to stay,

255
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,280
he would've come here himself, instead of siccing daddy on me.

256
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,530
Oh,victor hasn't heard the message.

257
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,460
I erased it. Oh,great.

258
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,930
Now I have to break up with him all over again.

259
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,910
You know, there's a lot of talk

260
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,920
about victor running for governor.

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,030
A divorce on the eve of a campaign could be...

262
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,190
ite

263
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,480
And you flew all the way here to twist my arm?

264
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,450
No,i had something a little more subtle in mind.

265
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,390
Milton,there is no amount of money that is--wow!

266
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,090
Yeah. You start tacking on those zeros,

267
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,090
it gets hard to stop.

268
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,570
Hold on.

269
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,530
This check is dated for next year.

270
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,590
Exactly.

271
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,420
If you want this money, you're gonna have

272
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,540
to stay married to my son for the next 13 months.

273
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,870
Huh.

274
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,070
And isn't there an election around that time?

275
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,580
My son is destined for greatness.

276
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,940
He will be governor.

277
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,010
He could be president.

278
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,780
And you're going to make sure

279
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,780
he goes straight to the top, aren't you?

280
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,920
Sometimes greatness needs a little nudge.

281
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,650
What do you mean, there's nothing there?

282
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,630
I'm sorry,ms. Britt.

283
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,800
I checked the number you gave me three times.

284
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,930
That offshore account simply doesn't exist.

285
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,830
<i>Where</i> is that $10 million?

286
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,850
What $10 million?

287
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,690
Gi????

288
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,520
(loudly) first of all, I deny having any illegal money,

289
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,430
let alone moving it.

290
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,740
Why are you talking like that?

291
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,290
I don't know. I thought you might be wearing a wire.

292
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,160
(slaps hand) you're paranoid. You know that?

293
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,050
Well, don't I have reason to be?

294
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,140
And why would you care where the money is,

295
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,200
unless you were planning on using it against me?

296
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,150
Oh,god. You think you are so clever. Well,you're no

297
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,180
in fact,you--you are the stupidest man I've ever met.

298
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,700
You have no clue who you're dealing with,

299
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,720
but believe me, you're gonna pay

300
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,610
for what you've done to me,carlos.

301
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,630
This game is not over.

302
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,970
Actually,it kinda is,

303
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,710
and if you hadn't noticed...

304
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,210
I won.

305
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,830
Bree.

306
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,270
Lynette, I was just thinking about you.

307
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,990
Did you get your test results yet?

308
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,170
Huh? O the p.e. Scan. No,not till tomorrow.

309
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,320
Listen,i need your help. There's a possum in my garden.

310
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,100
Ugh! I hate possums.

311
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,460
Not as much as me. I put out poison,but it ate around it.

312
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,590
I got one ofse hs, but all I trapped was penny.

313
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,570
How can I help?

314
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,460
I want a gun.

315
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,560
Really?

316
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,040
I thought you were one of those liberal gun haters.

317
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,960
That was the old lynette. The new lynette

318
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,730
kills the possums and lets god sort 'em out.

319
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,630
Well,unfortunately, our bleeding-heart town council

320
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,880
forbids us fm using live ammo in our own backyards.

321
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,550
Wusses!

322
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,160
I suggest you get an air rifle.

323
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,150
It won't kill it,

324
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,950
but it'll sting it enough to keep it away for good.

325
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,440
Perfect. Where can I get one?

326
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,450
Try,u gun city on route 6 by the baptist church.

327
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,450
Tell them I sent ya,

328
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,640
and they'll give youa nice discount.

329
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,390
Great.

330
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,730
What's so urgent?

331
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,830
Can't say hello to a girl?

332
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,670
Gaby,we had a deal.

333
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,730
We weren't gonna see each other for six months.

334
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,540
Oh,uh,yeah,about that

335
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,420
what if we make it 13?

336
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,280
Okay,no, just go with me on this.

337
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,930
What I'm about to propose will give us total financial freedom

338
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,470
and... Help a conniving billionaire's dream come true.

339
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,970
Whoa. What's this for?

340
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,780
Milton lang doesn't want me to leaveictor

341
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,620
until <i>after</i> he runs for governor.

342
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,220
Once the election's over, ka-ching!

343
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,630
So basically, you're taking money

344
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,550
to sleep with a man you don't love.

345
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,490
Gee,f that were a job, what w

346
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,910
I don't have to sleep with him,

347
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,010
just stay with him for fofofocal reasons.

348
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,980
It's basically a modeling fee for a 13-month photo op.

349
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,270
Absolutely not.

350
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,410
Carlos,you're not working right now,

351
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,240
and you know we'll never be happy if we're broke.

352
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,330
We need this.

353
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,880
What if we didn't?

354
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,050
Huh?

355
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,630
What if I had some money stashed away?

356
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,740
Okay, remember a few years ago

357
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,710
when I was in business with tanaka?

358
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,130
I was always afraid that he was gonna double-cross me.

359
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,770
Which he did.

360
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,120
But before he did,

361
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,240
I skimmed a little off the top.

362
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,000
How much is "a littl

363
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,130
$10 million.

364
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,210
You embezzled $10 million?

365
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,020
(kissing loudly) mmm.

366
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,050
Actually,now it's only about $9.5. It cost me half a mil

367
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,560
to hide it from the government and certain other people. Mm.

368
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,670
Oh,wait,wait,wait.

369
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,600
If this is tanaka money,then you had it when we were married?

370
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,080
Okay,i can sense where you're going with this.

371
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,090
Which also means you had it when we got divorced.

372
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,130
Look,if I had told you about it,

373
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,090
you'd have taken me to the cleaners. Carlos,we were married.

374
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,910
I was entitled to half of everything you embezzmed.

375
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,630
Look,we're back together now. What does it matter?

376
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
Well,it matters that you lied to me.

377
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
I can't trust you.

378
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,420
Gaby! If I can't trust you,i don't think I can be with you.

379
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,810
Oh,come on!

380
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,570
No,i'm serious. After everything I have been through?

381
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,310
No! No,get out!

382
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,070
Gaby,you should be happy right now.

383
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,060
I have millions of dollars, and I want you to be with me.

384
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,140
Oh,so you want me to sleep with you and take your money.

385
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,590
Gee,if thatere a job, what would they call it?

386
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,770
Thanks,kid.

387
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,900
Bear claw?

388
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,170
Uh,no. Thank you,

389
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,480
so,uh,mike said you had some medical questions for me?

390
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,350
Um,yes,the,uh,

391
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,690
genetic counselor,um,wanted to know a couple of things.

392
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,890
Uh...

393
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,900
Um,i-is there any cancer in your family?

394
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,790
no.

395
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,270
Great.

396
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,710
Uh,diabetes?

397
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,050
Mnh-mnh.

398
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,500
Wonderful.

399
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,060
Who did you kill?

400
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,150
Couldn't have covered this in the car?

401
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,430
I thought she ould hear it from you.

402
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,610
I killed my boss.

403
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,160
Uh-huh. Okay.

404
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,610
He wasn't my boss when I met him.

405
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,950
He was just another guy on the loading dock,like me.

406
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,070
A supervisor's job came up,

407
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,470
and,uh,we were both angling for it.

408
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,090
And then arnie-- that was his name--

409
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,450
He went to the head of the company

410
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,660
and told him some lies about me,

411
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,720
and <i>he</i> got the job.

412
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,340
So you killed him?

413
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,250
No. I stewed about it for a few weeks.

414
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,900
I'd see arnie walking around with that smirk,

415
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,360
and,uh,and that tie, and I thought to myself,

416
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,070
"you k

417
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,990
"you don't deserve that tie,

418
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,610
and you don't deserve to live."

419
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,870
So you killed him?

420
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,240
No. I confronted him.

421
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,790
I said,"arnie, what you did wasn't right."

422
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,000
He just laughed in my face and said,uh,

423
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,580
"what are you gonna do about it?"

424
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
<i>then</i> I killed him.

425
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,860
Uh-huh.

426
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,560
Uh,and how did you...

427
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,140
With the tie. I thought it was a nice touch.

428
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,280
Well,now you know.

429
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,040
Hey,adam,katheri.

430
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,250
Or should I say frankenstein and... Marie antoinette?

431
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,590
Nice

432
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,560
you came as a self-important queen who lost all h

433
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,590
isn't that a bit on the nose?

434
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,660
Lee making jokes about a queen.

435
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,810
Isn't that a bit ironic?

436
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,840
????

437
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,870
(both chuckle) and who are you supposed to be?

438
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,770
Cher, the belove

439
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,100
(chuckles) it was my mom's idea.

440
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,950
You know,the woman who freaked when she found out I was gay?

441
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,850
oh.

442
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,160
Oh,my god. Is that danielle?

443
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,320
I expressly forbade her from coming tonight.

444
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,260
Who does she think she is?

445
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,830
Apparently,you.

446
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,220
Danielle,you're back!

447
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,640
(imitating bree) I'???

448
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,450
I am bree van de kamp hodge.

449
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,360
(chuckles) oh,no,no,no. No hugs,please.

450
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,800
I'm uncomfortable with needless displays of emotion.

451
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,140
Your costume looks great. It's so real.

452
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,970
Ooh! I could swear I felt a kick. (chuckles)

453
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,470
you stop that,baby hodge. We do not kick people,

454
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,070
unless???

455
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,140
(chuckles nervously) why didn't you tell me she was home?

456
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,390
Oh,it's just a quick visit. She's driving back tomorrow.

457
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,660
To switzernd?

458
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,220
Let's go get some cake, dear.

459
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,990
What do you think you're doing? Exactly what my moth wants.

460
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,760
You did say to be more like you,right?

461
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,760
That's not what I meant, and you know it,

462
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,860
and as for your little imitation of me,

463
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,990
I don't sound anything like that.

464
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,840
Danielle? Who are you supposed to be?

465
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,210
Really,karen, I don't think our lord is amused

466
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,180
when we make light of witchcraft,

467
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,930
and you might use a coaster.

468
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,590
Oh,i get it. She's you.

469
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,440
I just don't see how he could not feel bad about it.

470
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,080
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

471
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,030
You know, I expected to meet

472
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,030
a guy that was racked with rmmorse,

473
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,260
and instead,

474
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,310
i'm looking across the table at this...

475
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,870
Person. He's a person.

476
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,450
Yeah,an evil person.

477
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,350
No,he's a good guy who did an evil thing.

478
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,660
There's a difference.

479
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,530
Well,i don't see one.

480
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,910
Look,he snapped. It happens. People snap. I did.

481
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,190
I killed a guy.

482
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,740
You killed a cro

483
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,800
????

484
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,810
That's self-defense,

485
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,060
and even so, you regret it,right? Yes,of course.

486
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,960
Well,that's my t.d people snap,

487
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,490
they feel bad about it. Your dad doesn.

488
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,720
Sun,why are you getting so worked up over this?

489
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,850
I don't know. It just bothers me.

490
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,020
I mean... My god,mike.

491
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,920
He's yr dad.

492
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,090
I know.

493
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,580
And this conversation is exactly why I told you he was dead.

494
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,780
Lynette!

495
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,330
Honey,are you out here?

496
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,900
Shh!

497
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,080
Is that for the possum?

498
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,990
Yeah.

499
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,920
Now he's playing mind games with me,

500
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,240
but I laid out some halloween candy.

501
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,540
Pretty soon he'll get hungry, and when

502
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,590
trick or treat.

503
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:40,790
Lynette--

504
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,210
Shh!

505
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,450
Shh! Do you hear that?

506
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,160
He's making his move.

507
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,250
Lynette, I think you should come inside

508
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,890
and lie down for a little while.

509
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,230
No way. He's here,tom. I can tell.

510
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,570
Okay, now--now you're scaring me.

511
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Why?

512
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,780
Look at yourself.

513
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,910
You've--you've declared jihad on a possum.

514
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,430
This is not a joke,tom. Something has attacked our home,

515
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,620
and when that happens,you don't just stand by--you fight it.

516
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,020
Sc???

517
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,700
And is trying to destroy us.

518
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,720
It will not defeat me.

519
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,600
Okay.

520
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,070
You do what you need to do.

521
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,480
Thank you.

522
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,780
So,bree,have you,uh,picked a name for the baby yet?

523
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,720
Not yet,but I'm thinking

524
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,480
"you're not good enough" if it's a boy,

525
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,030
and "you'll always disappoint me" if it's a girl.

526
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,240
Okay,you made your point. Now go home.

527
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:17,950
Are you kidding me?

528
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,790
This is the most fun I've had in eight months. Do not test me,young lady,

529
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,560
or I will drag you out of here myself.

530
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,340
You make a scene? Ha! That's a laugh.

531
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,350
What's wrong?

532
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,760
I think my wer just broke.

533
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,220
Oh,dear heavenly lord.

534
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,350
(bob) hey!

535
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,030
What happened to my rug?

536
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,880
Danielle!

537
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,540
We agreed to save that till the end of the night.

538
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,870
The best part of the costume,

539
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,440
and she pops the water balloon when people aren't even looking.

540
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,910
Orson! Andrew!

541
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,430
Think we can make it to the hospital?

542
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,850
I don't think so! It's coming.

543
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,910
Okay,everybody, in the house now.

544
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,620
Not on the couch. I just had it reupholstered.

545
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,350
Andrew,take your sister into the kitchen.

546
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,960
Get some towels. Boil some water.

547
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,660
Everything is gonna be fine. I'm a doctor.

548
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,070
You're a dentist! What if there are complications?

549
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,510
Should an emergency arise, we will simply call an amulet.

550
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,600
A what?

551
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,150
????

552
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,580
How many rum punches did you have?

553
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,130
There was punch in that rum?

554
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,550
I am going back to get adam.

555
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,300
Bree. Bree,what's wrong?

556
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,080
I need your services as a doctor,

557
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,470
but before I tell you what's going on,

558
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,640
I need you to promise that what you're about to learn

559
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,320
will be kept in strictest confidence. Does this have anything to do

560
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,600
with the pregnancy you've been faking?

561
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,340
Okay, you're almost there.

562
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,860
Aah!

563
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,850
????

564
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,730
(parker) are they home? (preston) the lights are on.

565
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,270
Here it comes!

566
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,600
If they're not home, then what's that?

567
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,560
Probably just a tapethey put on

568
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,630
well,you know the rule.

569
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,840
If we don't get our treat, they get a trick. Yeah.

570
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,480
(porter) come on. (giggles)

571
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,950
(baby wailing) and... Thank you.

572
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,240
Oh. (pants)

573
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,030
okay.

574
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,290
It's a beautiful baby boy.

575
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,380
How are you feeling?

576
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,110
Tired.

577
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,780
Did adam leave?

578
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,810
Uh,yeah,and he promised

579
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,530
that no one would ever know what happened here tonight.

580
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,210
That's good,i guess.

581
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,480
Is he okay?

582
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,760
????

583
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,170
He's,um, he's all cleaned up now,

584
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,980
if... If you want to hold him.

585
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,910
Yeah.

586
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,880
He's so tiny.

587
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,400
He looks just like you did.

588
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,280
Do you want to be alone???

589
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,790
Do you want me to...

590
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,720
To go?

591
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,590
What should I do?

592
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,100
Yoshould take him.

593
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,480
Are you sure?

594
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,270
Sweethea???

595
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,090
No,it's...

596
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,060
The right thing to do for everyone...

597
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,910
Especially him

598
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,430
but you're right.

599
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,490
It's awful.

600
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,490
I'm gonna sleep w.

601
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,780
Okay,baby.

602
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,620
It's okay,little on

603
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,010
here we are. Here we go.

604
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,600
Yes,here we go.

605
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,360
Susan,hey,it's me.

606
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,950
Um,sorry to leave this message on your machine,

607
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,110
but can you tell the other girls

608
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,780
i'm,uh,going to be by myself for a while?

609
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,690
I... Just...

610
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,330
Going through some stuff and need to think.

611
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,610
Um--oh,god,that's my car ready to take me to the airport,

612
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,890
so I'll tell you everything when I get back.

613
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,770
Okay? Love you. Bye.

614
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,450
This is nice.

615
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,380
I didn't order a stretch, but I'll take it.

616
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,450
Victor.

617
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,490
I tried reaching you at the house,

618
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,570
but the maid said you'd moved out.

619
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,480
I took the next flight home. What's going on?

620
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,670
Well, I'm... Sort of leaving you.

621
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,020
Well,i guess "sort of" is better than "definitely."

622
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,310
What do I have to do to make it "absolutely not"?

623
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,300
I'll do anything. Just tell me.

624
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,180
Victor,it's not that simple. We have major problems,

625
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,340
and you nevehave time to talk about them,let alone fix 'em.

626
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,900
Well,i guess better make some time.

627
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,070
Let's see.

628
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,480
Here's this weekend.

629
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,880
Here's next week.

630
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,770
The week after. Look at that. I've got a whole month.

631
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:40,910
You busy?

632
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,490
Victor,i know you're only doing this

633
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,980
because a divorce would hurt your run for governor.

634
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,450
What if I don't run?

635
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,900
You mean that?

636
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,160
The governor's mansion is my father's dream.

637
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,970
You know what my dream I'

638
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,440
you.

639
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,770
Don't run away,gaby...

640
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,460
And if you do,please, take me with you

641
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,420
so... Where's mike?

642
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,010
At the motel. I slipped out without waking him.

643
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,680
I've been up all night thinking,

644
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,730
and I have something to say to you.

645
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,240
oh?

646
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,290
I don't believe you.

647
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:43,410
I don't believe that you could kill a man and not regret it.

648
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,460
Why do you care?

649
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,980
Because I am carrying a baby that has your genes.

650
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,390
If my doctor told me that there was

651
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,920
something wrong with this baby-- something physical,

652
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,490
I could handle that.

653
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,390
I would pr

654
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,160
but if my baby was born without a conscience,without a soul,

655
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,830
I don't know what I would do.

656
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,900
You think I don't have a soul?

657
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,680
If you can't feel the tiniest bit of remse

658
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,870
over taking a human life...

659
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,740
No,i don't think you do.

660
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,990
If I were to think about what I did,

661
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,610
really think about it,

662
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,630
lay awake nights

663
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,460
trying to remember the look on that guy's face

664
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,780
when I strangled the life out of him...

665
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,290
Pretty soon,i'd go crazy.

666
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,880
I should go.

667
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,030
You know what I <i>do</i> regret?

668
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,500
What I did to mike.

669
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,150
What did youo?

670
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,360
He was a real popular kid. Everybody liked mikey.

671
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,370
(clicks tongue) then when I got sent away,

672
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,230
suddenly the whole town

673
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,720
just thinks of him as the son of a murderer.

674
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:11,920
????

675
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,640
I'm not re that kind of darkness

676
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,090
ever truly goes away.

677
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,940
Well,you're wrong.

678
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,400
He's happy.

679
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,510
He's got a good job and a wife who loves him

680
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,450
and a baby on the way.

681
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:31,440
I had a lot going for me,too, before I t

682
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,570
just...

683
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,210
Keep on eye on him.

684
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,500
Edie,if you're looking for gaby,

685
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,730
she just left for her yoga class.

686
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:04,250
Yoga... Is that what she told you?

687
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,880
I'm sorry.

688
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,150
I know how angry and humiliated you must feel.

689
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,980
But don't take it all out on gaby.

690
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,810
Carlos seduced her.

691
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,410
He hated you for taking his wife,

692
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,650
so he decided to make a fool out of you.

693
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:41,450
I think he deserves whatever's coming to him,don'v you?

694
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,200
Hey! Hey! Hey,quiet. She's napping.

695
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,870
Finally. How'd you get her to do that?

696
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,540
oh,

697
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,290
????

698
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,440
????

699
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,330
Hmm,it's Dr. Rushton.

700
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,710
Her oncologist?

701
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,080
Hey.

702
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,840
Hey,dr. Rushton.

703
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,780
What--what are you doing here?

704
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,250
Well... (sighs) so much of my job is delivering bad news,

705
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,230
that I really wanted to tell you this in person.

706
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,670
Lynette,i got the test results back. You're clean.

707
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,770
Are you sure? Yeah.

708
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,670
(stglla) oh! Lymph nodes are completely clear. Congratulations.

709
