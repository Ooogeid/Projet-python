1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,470
My condition
is unprecedented.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,837
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,632
Don't! Just stop, just stop now!

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,793
Why? Tell me, Daddy,
what's the big deal about Claire?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,951
Oh, Daddy!

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,631
- I'm not married to you!
- Yes, you are. Get used to it!

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,118
Klein & Utterson exist to follow you.
You are its sole purpose.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,159
No, for God's sake, no! Please! No!

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,114
- You have some questions?
- A few, yes.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,919
You have my husband in a box!

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,958
- It's Hyde we want.
- So, who is he now?

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,839
How do you know which one
he's stabilised as?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,275
We open the box.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,035
Sorry, Poole. Mislaid my keys.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,555
Good morning, Dr Jekyll.

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,996
We weren't sure when you'd be returning.

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,673
Will you be requiring breakfast?

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,274
No, I think I've eaten.

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,399
I have... I've eaten

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,839
- Any messages?
- The same gentleman as before.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,879
He said he would call back,
after ten o'clock this evening.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,713
Gentlemen do not call after ten o'clock.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,112
I could contact the police.
Alice said his manner was odd.

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,989
I have business with this man.
We are...

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,754
connected.

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,480
- He spoke to Alice?
- The maid, yes, sir.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,790
He came to the kitchen door this time.

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,235
I'll talk to her.
Is she still in the kitchen?

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,833
I could send for her.

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Alice?

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,557
You had a caller today.

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,349
He's coming back tonight.
Ten o'clock tonight.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,548
Mr Hyde scares me.
Mr Hyde scares me very much.

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,872
But not half as much as that
man today and his questions.

35
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,995
"The Strange Case
of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde."

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,311
My wife thinks I should
throw it in the fire.

37
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,191
But my publisher is interested.

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,352
You called at the house
while I was out today.

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,999
You spoke with the maid.

40
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,311
Yes. I'm sorry, background details,
you know.

41
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,870
I have provided you
with sufficient details.

42
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,237
You have kept within the limits
of what we agreed?

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,790
I have elaborated for colour,
altered for economy.

44
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,078
It has the appearance of a fiction, but the
substance of the facts, just as you wished.

45
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,196
It lacks only an ending.

46
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,989
- An ending will present itself shortly.
- How?

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,396
I will die.

48
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,678
I can no longer control the changes.

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,434
I thought you said
the potion controlled the changes.

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,639
At the beginning, yes.
Hyde comes when he chooses now.

51
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,475
Each time he weakens me, reduces me.
I can feel it.

52
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,310
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not. If I die, he dies too.

53
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,958
People are not stupid,
this tale is not in my normal style.

54
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,432
There are those, a few,
who might suspect its origins in truth.

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,797
In a tale of a potion that
can transform its hero into a demon...

56
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,030
I am not a hero. And it is not a tale.

57
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,352
Such an account might set some
thinking about this potion.

58
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,230
There are those who would wish
to possess such a thing.

59
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I know.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,434
Then why should this tale be told?

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,319
It is not a tale.

62
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,199
It is a trap.

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,389
The secret of this potion, you are
certain it is known to you alone?

64
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,471
Oh, yes.

65
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,676
You are wrong.

66
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,558
It is known to one other.

67
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Who?

68
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Me.

69
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,040
I only want to know if I'm right.

70
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,233
One never quite knows who's listening.

71
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,154
The secret of Doctor Jekyll's potion.

72
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,157
Nothing will appear in my account.
You can trust me.

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,633
You will tell no one?

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,950
You have my word.

75
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,875
It dies with you.
Doctor Jekyll's last secret.

76
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,029
Oh, Tom...

77
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,752
Oh, my God.

78
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,832
You've chained him.

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Claire?

80
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,153
- Tom...
- Claire, be careful.

81
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,039
Help me, Claire.

82
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,478
- I can't see your face.
- I can't move.

83
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,713
I need to see your face.

84
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,873
I can't move my head.

85
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,396
- Paralysis?
- No, it can't be.

86
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Tom?

87
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,836
Why have you chained him?

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,144
Thing is...

89
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,312
- If he stabilised as Hyde, well...
- What?

90
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,710
- He'd be more extreme.
- Worse.

91
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,838
- Stronger.
- He doesn't look stronger to me.

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,754
Claire. It's me.

93
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,196
Please, it's me.

94
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,759
I can't move.

95
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,793
Our honeymoon... where did we go?

96
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,313
What?

97
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,789
You heard me. Our honeymoon.

98
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,155
Name of the hotel.

99
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,669
The Appleyard.

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,994
The Appleyard... room 702.

101
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,070
We could see the church

102
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,754
from the window,

103
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,797
the spire.

104
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,315
Do you know what?

105
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,994
I'd forgotten the room number.

106
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,957
- Oh...
- Claire...

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,838
You know what?

108
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,831
Not too close.

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,195
He hasn't.

110
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,789
The doctor...

111
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
...is out!

112
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,389
Security! Get security in here, now!

113
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,030
He's out of my head! Hallelujah!

114
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,350
Home alone!

115
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,550
Oh, this feels good. Roomy.
Look at all this space.

116
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,358
I could put up shelves.

117
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,715
Where is he? Where's my husband?

118
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,313
He was in here a minute ago.

119
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,598
Turn my back and whoosh!
Not even a tip on the dresser. Men!

120
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,433
Oh, this feels so peaceful, love it.

121
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,114
No more boring doctor
yapping away in the corner.

122
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,345
You've got no idea.

123
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:57,637
"Don't do this, don't do that,
don't kill her, your turn to shave..."

124
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,191
And if I'd had one more argument about
who was biting the fingernails... oh!

125
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,069
Did that bug you, the fingernails?
Did he do that when he was with you?

126
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,391
We should talk, you and me,
we're fellow sufferers.

127
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,030
We should have a cup of coffee
and a good old chinwag about him.

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,671
The wife and the ex. Girls together.

129
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,277
All friends now the bastard's dead.

130
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,353
How can he be dead?
You're still here. How can he be dead?

131
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,670
Hello again, Mr Hyde.

132
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,752
Appreciate it if you kept
right where you are.

133
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,310
The thing about consuming
your alter ego, bit like a Chinese,

134
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,871
minute later you're hungry again.
Hello, boys.

135
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,158
Mr Hyde, no one here means you any
harm, but we do need to examine you.

136
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,108
The thing is... basically,
you may not be stabilised yet.

137
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,954
It's for your own good.

138
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,195
Basically.

139
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,477
Ok, Mr Basically, talk to me like you
know me again, in public,

140
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,351
where people can see, and the next sound
you hear will be your own neck snapping.

141
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,398
Do we now have a basis
for communication?

142
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,357
Mr Hyde.

143
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,080
- Step away from Dr Gilligan.
- Yeah...

144
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,073
Ah-ah... necketty neck-neck!

145
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,310
- Sorry.
- Mr Hyde.

146
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,429
Please, step away from Dr Gilligan.
We don't want to hurt you.

147
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,750
I can smell your sweat.

148
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,352
Vegetarian.

149
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,750
Woof! You've got a dog.

150
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,070
Woof-woof. Two dogs. Big dogs.

151
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,073
I want to say Alsatian.

152
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,594
Is he correct, Colonel Hart?

153
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,832
Yes, sir. He's correct.

154
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,758
Hmm, tasty. 57 years old, ex-smoker,
gave up two years ago?

155
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,388
Yeah. Two years ago.

156
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,790
Two years...

157
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,714
...and too late.

158
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,839
It's started already, hasn't it?
Rustling away down there,

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,390
growing in the dark.

160
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,393
Hello, Mr Tumour.

161
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,199
Goodbye, daylight.

162
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,074
Am I right?

163
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,196
Is he right, Colonel Hart?

164
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,716
Yes, sir. He's right.

165
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,371
Course I'm right.

166
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:44,034
Two years, and then it's,
"Night-night, Colonel Cancer, sir!"

167
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,670
Stop it! Stop that!
Don't you dare do that!

168
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,558
Uh-oh, it's the missus.

169
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,517
- Leave him alone.
- Why?

170
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,274
Because my husband is better than that.

171
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,639
Your husband is gone, Mrs Jackman.

172
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,837
Erased, boiled away and
never ever coming back.

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,389
Do you get it, Mrs Jackman?
He's dead, Mrs Jackman.

174
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,073
Any questions Mrs Jackman?

175
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,878
Yes, one.

176
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,110
The Appleyard?

177
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
OK.

178
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
OK.

179
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,232
Good question.

180
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,312
The Appleyard, room 702.

181
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,157
Now, you see, she's smart.

182
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,311
She's the one.

183
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,675
You girls...

184
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,638
you big Marys with your guns,
you haven't got a clue.

185
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,396
- She's the one who's dangerous.
- Well? The Appleyard?

186
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,593
The answer is, I don't know.

187
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,596
You weren't there. That was our wedding
night, you didn't even exist then.

188
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,877
- I don't know.
- You don't have Tom's memories.

189
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,679
So how can you know about
the Appleyard?

190
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,434
I don't know!

191
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,478
Excuse me.

192
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:07,472
<i>I'm getting it.</i>

193
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,372
You throw the bread in the water

194
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,156
and the ducks - dah, dah -
eat the bread.

195
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,552
- That's the basics, yes.
- Mr Hyde?

196
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,311
- Mr Hyde, are you all right?
- I like feeding ducks.

197
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,316
Is this your usual second date?

198
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:25,439
I just thought it'd be nice to talk.

199
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,636
This time.

200
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,320
You don't have to actually
throw the bread at the ducks.

201
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,950
I'm getting their attention.
It's quicker.

202
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,831
Erm...

203
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,030
Mr Hyde? Mr Hyde...

204
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,715
Mr Hyde?

205
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,595
You were in a park.
You were feeding ducks.

206
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,988
What?

207
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,112
Excuse me,
could we have the bill, please?

208
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,512
Just getting it ready. Don't want
the date part crowding out the sex.

209
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,319
Stop! Stop!

210
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,710
- Where are you now?
- In a restaurant.

211
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,996
You ordered the bill. You said...

212
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,916
Too fast, too much,
too fast, stop it, stop it!

213
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:43,199
Good boy. Shh.

214
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,639
Good boy. Good boy.

215
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,395
- How's yours doing?
- Almost gone.

216
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,199
- Can we swap?
- I put the work in.

217
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,271
Stop! Stop!

218
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,908
- What's wrong, what's happening?
- Stop!!

219
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,508
They did.

220
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,194
They stopped.

221
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,070
What are you seeing right now?
We can't help you unless you tell us.

222
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,834
In a kitchen. Their kitchen.

223
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,796
I've got rewind.

224
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,956
Look at that!

225
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,477
I've got digital rewind.
It's like Sky Plus in here!

226
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,714
Can you explain to us what it is you're
experiencing? What's happening to you?

227
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,273
It's his memories. It's like I'm
downloading his memories. Big chunks.

228
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,115
- Like it's happening.
- Tom's memories.

229
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,111
Hence the Appleyard.

230
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,032
Does that mean he's still in there?

231
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,510
Tom's still in there somewhere.
He's alive.

232
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,390
No. That means he's dead. The brain
is reallocating the memory space.

233
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,078
You've killed him, Peter.

234
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,596
No, not killed technically.
More like deleted.

235
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,951
Deleted?

236
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,749
Be careful if I were you.

237
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
OK.

238
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,910
Careful, careful. You OK?

239
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,753
Three months married
and I'm competing with the TV.

240
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,150
I like this film.

241
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,117
Is there nudity?

242
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,397
- No.
- OK, then.

243
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,115
I'm back in the game.

244
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,874
- Now we're talking.
- What are you seeing now?

245
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,396
- I've finally found the adult channels.
- What does that mean?

246
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,236
You know the way you sometimes
think men are mentally undressing you?

247
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,955
Peanuts!

248
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,393
She switched channels.

249
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,516
It is not a tale, it is a trap.

250
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,396
Typical woman, it's a costume drama.

251
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,996
The secret of this potion, you are
certain it is known to you alone?

252
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,596
- Yes.
- You are wrong.

253
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,432
It is known to one other.

254
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Who?

255
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Me.

256
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,710
What are you seeing?
What are you seeing now?

257
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,030
Tell us what you see.

258
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,714
It's like Victorian times.

259
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,959
And Daddy's here.

260
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,235
No, not Daddy.

261
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,277
Granddad.

262
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,194
No, Great-Granddad.
Great-Great... whatever.

263
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,918
Dr Jekyll. The original.

264
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,712
Doesn't look like Spencer Tracy.

265
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
How can he remember
Dr Jekyll? He was never there.

266
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,032
- Race memory?
- Race memory doesn't work like that.

267
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,397
Well, for us it doesn't.
Maybe he's got something better.

268
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,314
I only want to know that I'm right.

269
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,191
One never quite knows who's listening.

270
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,236
The secret of Dr Jekyll's potion.

271
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,717
"Jeekle"?

272
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,872
- "Dr Jeekle"?
- What's he saying?

273
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,349
It's the original pronunciation.

274
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,991
Dear God, he can't actually be there,
can he?

275
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,154
Nothing will appear in my account.
You can trust me.

276
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,382
You will tell no one?

277
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:43,154
It dies with you,
Dr Jekyll's last secret.

278
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,833
It is not a tale, it is a trap.

279
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,513
What? Tell us, what?

280
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,995
How long have you been
looking for Dr Jekyll's potion?

281
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,355
Cost you a bit has it?

282
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,080
- Burnt a hole in the pocket?
- At the beginning.

283
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,198
- And you used Jekyll's notes?
- His notes, yes.

284
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,749
And what happened
when anyone drank it?

285
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,309
They died.

286
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,756
He sent you on a wild goose chase.

287
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,673
With a bit of murder on the side.

288
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,951
Alice?

289
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,389
- Were you listening?
- What do you hope to achieve?

290
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,437
Your protection.

291
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,158
With a tale of a magic potion?

292
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,232
Do you think anyone will think
that's the truth?

293
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,358
The truth is just
a tale told often enough.

294
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,954
The truth is me, sir.
And we both know it.

295
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,554
I raise the devil in you,
not any potion.

296
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,393
My touch, my love.

297
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Me.

298
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
What?

299
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,430
- What?!
- It's you.

300
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,718
You then and you now.

301
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,873
You are here and you are there.

302
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,713
What do you mean?

303
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,996
Where am I?

304
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,230
With him.

305
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,631
Back then with Dr Jekyll.

306
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,236
You're with Dr Jekyll.

307
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
You.

308
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,149
It's all about...

309
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
you.

310
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Alice.

311
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,915
Oh, Alice.

312
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,317
You're the one thing that keeps me here.

313
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,630
Without you, I'm just...

314
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,070
...him.

315
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,675
Well, do you see?

316
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,877
The one thing that keeps him here,

317
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,510
keeps him here and keeps
you weak.

318
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,638
Look at her.

319
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,315
You will always be weak with
her in the world.

320
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,839
She's still alive!

321
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,911
But what if she wasn't?

322
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,993
Imagine. Oh, imagine.

323
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,549
You could be free.

324
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,430
She keeps you weak.

325
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,556
Only her.

326
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,439
You know what you need.

327
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,895
Claire!

328
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,911
You all right, Mrs Jackman?

329
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,719
- What time is it?
- Half past three.

330
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,110
- In the morning.
- We know.

331
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,158
I've already had
15 separate food cravings.

332
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,472
- She drew pictures of the last three.
- Well, it passed the time, didn't it?

333
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,518
Four women locked in a room without
a single magazine.

334
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,831
It's like some kind of vile experiment.

335
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,956
Can I see that?

336
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,997
Oh, anything in particular?

337
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,357
You've got photographs of Dr Jekyll.

338
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,956
What about the people around him?
His friends, you know, people he knew?

339
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,069
No, not really. Um...
members of his household, his servants.

340
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,635
Who's she?

341
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,234
- What's happened to her face?
- Oh, the maid.

342
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,473
That's interesting, isn't it?
It's the same thing on this one.

343
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,553
The damage is on the original
photograph, done at the time, I think.

344
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,510
Like someone was trying to
conceal her identity.

345
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,829
Why?

346
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,513
Dr Gilligan, get you anything
from the canteen?

347
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,592
No. Oh, yeah, yeah,
something chocolatey.

348
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
OK.

349
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Oh...

350
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,391
Dr Gilligan...

351
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,949
Necketty neck-neck.

352
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Syme.

353
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,751
Hello, this is Syme, who is this?

354
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,434
<i> The next stage</i>
<i>of human evolution.</i>

355
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,353
How much do you get for that these days?

356
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,589
Mr Hyde?

357
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,274
<i> Where's Dr Gilligan?</i>

358
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,514
Dunno. Probably down the boozer
with his mates, having a laugh.

359
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,118
Mr Hyde, that lab is secure.
You are in the centre of a secure area.

360
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,713
There's no way you can leave...

361
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,429
<i></i>
<i>If I want to leave, you can't stop me.</i>

362
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,229
But you know what?
That's not what I want.

363
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,198
<i> Then tell us what you want,</i>
<i>Mr Hyde.</i>

364
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,429
Who are you?

365
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,838
What do you want?

366
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,510
I want her.

367
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,910
I want Claire.

368
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,798
Do you know what I'm thinking?

369
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,554
God forbid you should ever have
an unexpressed thought.

370
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,314
I'm thinking about the wastepaper bin.

371
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,358
- Sorry?
- You'd all need to turn your backs.

372
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,988
- Oh, for God's sake!
- I'm a pregnant woman!

373
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,469
And you're getting
nowhere with that lock.

374
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,713
Thumb print-activated.
I'm sure this is a print scanner.

375
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,348
You used to be so good with locks,
didn't you, dear?

376
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,469
Technology's running away with me.
Just no fun being locked up any more.

377
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,313
Like you ever listen when I say that.

378
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,396
So why you?

379
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,838
- I'm sorry?
- My husband gave you a job. Why you?

380
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,709
I'm qualified. I'm a fully-qualified
psychiatric nurse.

381
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,269
Does that come with a uniform?

382
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,750
He's never had any interest in me
other than professional.

383
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,764
And I certainly have
no interest in him.

384
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:34,884
Really?

385
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:38,395
Not my type.
Very much not my type.

386
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,677
Oh, come on. Is that actually likely?

387
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,671
I mean, just between you and me,

388
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,197
just us girls together,
all good taste and decency aside.

389
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,590
He spends half his time
as a world-class hottie.

390
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,070
Yeah, well he spends the other half
as Mr Hyde!

391
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,592
Oh, you meant the other...
the other way round.

392
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,913
See what I did there?

393
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,949
You have good taste.

394
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,035
Mrs Jackman.

395
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,839
- Your husband wants to see you.
- He's up? What's he wanting?

396
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,468
- Bacon and eggs?
- I'll take you to him.

397
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,108
- What does he want?
- I'll take you.

398
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,192
Are my children here?
I need to see them.

399
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,477
They're being looked after.
We should go.

400
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,278
What's going to happen to her?

401
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,637
Mrs Jackman, when you're talking to
Mr Hyde, keep watching the lights.

402
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,234
If Dr Jackman's there
then the lights will flicker.

403
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,597
It happens when he fights to get out.
Like he needs to draw on the energy.

404
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,070
If he's in there and he's fighting,
the lights will flicker.

405
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,593
You're very observant.

406
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,911
He's strong, and if there's
any way for him to come back,

407
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,833
he'll come back for you.

408
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,468
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

409
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,915
OK, let's go.

410
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,039
So what about us?

411
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,909
Yes, because quite honestly...
desperate for a pee.

412
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,554
We're taking you home.

413
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,315
Oh, there's no need, we brought the car.
Just point us towards the door.

414
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,789
- We're taking you home.
- No need.

415
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,110
No problem.

416
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,469
Oh, my God.

417
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,315
Mrs Jackman.

418
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,550
Hi, honey, I'm home.

419
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,998
Ooh, you're scared. Love that.

420
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,837
And just a little bit excited.
A teensy-weensy bit.

421
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,429
Or is that me?

422
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Well?

423
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,351
On their way.

424
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,512
Moment alone with the wife, boys.

425
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,393
Oh, nice and private.
What, am I getting lucky or something?

426
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,869
No, you're not getting lucky.

427
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,515
Messing with my head now,
Mr Big Scary Man?

428
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,877
- I'm so afraid.
- Know how they killed your husband?

429
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,875
- They put him in a box.
- Yeah. They put him in a box.

430
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,879
Couldn't figure it out at first.

431
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,349
Didn't make any sense.

432
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,114
They didn't give him any drugs,
I'd have felt that.

433
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,556
Just one big shot of adrenalin,
that's all.

434
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,113
But you know what? They didn't have to
give him drugs. He was claustrophobic.

435
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,316
All they needed.

436
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,268
His biggest nightmare come true.

437
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,389
Buried alive in a big steel box.

438
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,438
Wired up to keep him fully alert.

439
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,752
Completely aware
of every passing second.

440
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,229
Can you imagine?

441
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,520
Afraid of the dark,
with your eyes pinned open.

442
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,639
Wouldn't you just die?

443
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,109
That's how they killed him.

444
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,355
They drove him mad, Mrs Jackman.
They drove him out of my head.

445
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,751
They put him in a box.

446
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,797
How do you know he went mad?

447
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,758
Because I'm here and he's not.

448
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,277
No, no, no, no, no, no, the lights won't
flicker this time.

449
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,830
There's not enough power in this place
to put Humpty together again.

450
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,594
He's down a deep dark hole
and he's never coming out.

451
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,079
Tom.

452
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,559
Tom, if you're in there, I need you.
I need you now.

453
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,837
Can't hear you, love.
But you know, you're right.

454
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,595
There's always a chance. Let's be sure.

455
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,115
Let's give him a memory
he could never live with.

456
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,238
Tom, I know you're still in there.

457
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,756
You're my husband
and you would never hurt me.

458
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,347
And I know you're still in there.

459
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:37,072
All gone, love.
Hubby's all gone to dust.

460
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,231
Tom, you wouldn't do this.
You'd stop it!

461
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,638
You're going to fight!
I was worried you wouldn't.

462
00:35:41,758 --> 00:35:46,389
- I'm going to scratch your eyes out!
- Ooh, goodie, try. I'd like that.

463
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,632
He's not coming back. Any minute now,
he won't even want to.

464
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,707
He'll come back, you hear me?

465
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:55,158
Knock yourself out.
Killing me will not be enough.

466
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,791
Oh, sweetheart. Not nearly enough.

467
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,393
Mummy?

468
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,393
- Mummy?
- Hello boys, it's Uncle Billy.

469
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,835
- What are you doing?
- We're playing.

470
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,195
It's play time!

471
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,998
You will not touch my children!

472
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,470
I swear I will kill you
if you touch my children!

473
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,919
<i>Syme! I want ten minutes.</i>
<i>Ten minutes'play time.</i>

474
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,117
- You will not touch my children!
- Make it 20.

475
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,078
I swear you will not get
out of here alive! I swear it!

476
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,276
Oh, what the hell. Give me half an hour.

477
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,113
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

478
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,872
You have half an hour.

479
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,272
<i>Gee, thanks, Mom, you're the best.</i>

480
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,718
He's a child. Give him what he wants
and he'll be ours.

481
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,155
<i> Peter? Are you there?</i>

482
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,995
Peter, if you can hear this, you
can't let this happen. Peter, please.

483
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,833
They're your godchildren.

484
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,195
- Turn it off.
<i>- Peter!</i>

485
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,558
- For Christ's sake, turn it off!
- You can't let this happen!

486
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,437
Peter!

487
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,548
They've turned off the cameras.
All of them.

488
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,996
No one can see or hear us.

489
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,430
Suckers.

490
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,479
We've got half an hour to get out.
Come on, let's get those kiddies home.

491
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,154
We can get out through the floor,
into the next room,

492
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,279
which gets us into the corridor.
Hang on...

493
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,069
Yes, next room, corridor, no worries.

494
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,559
He's got a good memory, your husband.
Comes in very handy.

495
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,075
You're not going to hurt us, then?

496
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,869
- Oh, take a joke, can't you?
- A joke? You said you'd kill us.

497
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,113
And they turned off the cameras.
Let's go home, honey.

498
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,430
- I'm to trust you?
- You're safe with me.

499
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,511
You're a psychopath and I am not safe!

500
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,911
I'm a psychopath with super powers
and you're my girl.

501
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,240
- You're not my husband.
- It's you keeps saying it.

502
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,157
- Changed my mind.
- Know the feeling.

503
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,108
- You are not Tom.
- Tell you what I am. I'm strong.

504
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,840
I don't care how strong you are.

505
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,013
I'm so strong,

506
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:15,278
I walk through this funny little
world of yours and I don't notice it.

507
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,998
It bores me.

508
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,912
But you...

509
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,877
you, Mrs Jackman...

510
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,272
You make me weak.

511
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,829
I notice you.

512
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,272
You've never been safer in your life.

513
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,872
Let's go.

514
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
Boys.

515
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,070
Am I your father?

516
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,470
Give me your hands.

517
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,837
It's all right, give me your hands.

518
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,958
Look closer. You know me.

519
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,429
You always know me.

520
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,434
Am I your father?

521
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,634
- Okey-dokey, you first.
- Why me?

522
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,631
Fantastic arse.

523
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,598
Er... as you're going
to be taking us home,

524
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,355
wouldn't asking our
addresses be an idea?

525
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,590
Hang on.

526
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,472
Mr Syme? No one's in
the life support casket now, are they?

527
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,835
I'm getting readings.

528
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,354
Jesus Christ!

529
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,112
Get out the way!

530
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,150
Get those cameras back on!

531
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,553
Inspection hatch.
They've got out through the power room.

532
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,111
There'll be a lock-down
on the ground floor.

533
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,952
- So where are we going?
- The roof.

534
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,588
- Then what?
- One thing at a time?

535
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,228
- Do you share Tom's finger prints?
- No.

536
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,719
That's a thumb print scanner.

537
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,555
- No one gets in unless they're allowed.
- Trust me.

538
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,390
Get the bloody thing open!

539
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,438
Oh! Oh, my God!

540
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,079
What did he do to you?

541
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,091
He cut off my thumb!

542
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,348
Ah...

543
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,034
Let's get out. Send the lift down,
they'll be tracking us.

544
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,317
We'll take the stairs the rest
of the way. It's only two floors.

545
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,836
The wife's making a bit of a fuss,
so put this in a fridge somewhere.

546
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,116
It's for Dr Gilligan.

547
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,872
- What is it?
- He'll recognise it.

548
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,634
- Who are you?
- Oh, that's a point. Better kill you.

549
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,918
- You're killing him!
- Trust me, I'm a psychopath!

550
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,718
- Don't!
- But I've started.

551
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,316
You're not going to kill anyone.
No more killing people, got it?

552
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,278
Every day without killing someone?
What kind of life is that?

553
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,510
It's called marriage, honey.

554
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,470
- Well, what are we gonna do with him?
- Tie him up.

555
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,995
That takes ages.

556
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:50,038
There. He'll be out for 20 minutes.

557
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,317
No, sod it, we'll take the full hour.

558
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,397
It's OK. Don't look. Ssh.

559
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,232
- There's a helipad on the roof.
- And?

560
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,791
Helipad, yeah. OK. Question.
Quite a big question, if I'm honest.

561
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,076
- Can I fly a helicopter?
- That's the plan?

562
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,994
"Can I fly a helicopter?"
That's the plan?!

563
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,232
Wait. He had a lesson. Yeah, he did.
He had a lesson.

564
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,595
I've got him sitting in a helicopter.

565
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,070
- No, it's a moped. No, a helicopter.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

566
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,912
Actually, it could have been a horse.

567
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,231
Hm, his attention really wandered,
didn't it?

568
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,470
Mr Hyde...

569
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,639
...these weapons are aimed at
your wife and your children.

570
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,792
If you hesitate in any way
to comply with my instructions,

571
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,032
we will first kill the child on
your left.

572
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,512
Signal your understanding,
but do not speak.

573
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,558
You have a gun in your left hand.
You will drop it.

574
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,675
No play-acting, Mr Hyde,
I know how much they mean to you.

575
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,435
My camera was never switched off.

576
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,636
She makes you weak.

577
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,472
Not that weak.

578
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,671
This organisation has waited
over 100 years for you.

579
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:23,437
There is nothing you can accomplish
with that gun that will change a thing.

580
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,836
I will count to five
and you will drop it.

581
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,198
- One, two...
- Never gonna make it to five.

582
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,033
Then neither will your children.

583
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,350
Three...

584
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,671
Let my family go,
or I'll blow my brains out.

585
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,914
You've waited over 100 years.
Don't miss out now, let them go.

586
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
No.

587
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,876
Kill yourself.

588
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,350
It's a good plan,
I never thought of that.

589
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,514
Kill yourself. If you're dead,
we have no further use for your family.

590
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,788
You can save them now.
Just kill yourself.

591
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,758
Blow your brains out.

592
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,872
Can you do it?

593
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,919
Tom Jackman could do it,
he loves them enough.

594
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,638
Do you?

595
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,393
- Four...
- No. Don't!

596
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
Five.

597
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,315
Course not. Too afraid of dying,
like all children.

598
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,994
You are just a child, Mr Hyde.

599
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,833
We took the man in you away.

600
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,239
As we're up here,
I'll take the helicopter now.

601
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,119
And I'll take the Jackmans with me.

602
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,910
Where are you taking them?

603
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,559
Where you will follow.

604
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,918
We have your family
and you have no choice.

605
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,710
You will come to us.
Welcome to the company, Mr Hyde.

606
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,957
Ah. I was hoping for a longer journey.

607
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,601
All three of you,

608
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:51,237
go and stand in the beam of
the headlights, right in the middle.

609
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,879
- This is murder.
- No.

610
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,190
No, we're just taking a break.

611
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,229
You must have been a soldier once.
What could possibly be worth all this?

612
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,960
The cure for cancer?

613
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,955
Oh, I see. You wanna live?
I know the feeling.

614
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,673
I'm supposed to be a superman.

615
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,037
Why am I not a superman?

616
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,158
Daddy! Daddy!

617
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,834
Why am I not a superman?!

618
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,798
Why am I not a superman?!

619
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,872
Why am I not a superman?!!

620
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,363
Daddy!!

621
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,035
I'm supposed to be dangerous.

622
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,431
Why am I not a superman?

623
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,355
Are you listening to me, Daddy?
I'm supposed to be Superman!!

624
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,230
Half a man.

625
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,630
For her.

626
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,836
Yes, Mr Hyde, we all know about
your little power-draining trick.

627
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,150
But it won't work this time.

628
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,390
Tom Jackman's gone.

629
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,031
There isn't enough power in
this entire building to bring him back.

630
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,756
Oh, my God!

631
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,396
My God!

632
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,430
Jesus, look at that!
What's happening?

633
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,429
Sorry, ladies, not my decision.

634
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,558
Oh, God! What are we going to do?

635
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:31,369
Run!

636
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,196
After them!

637
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,550
This way.

638
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,351
Mr Hyde?

639
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,317
Sorry.
You're not dealing with Junior anymore.

640
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,839
Daddy's home.

641
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,073
I want you to send a message,
to your boss.

642
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,435
To those people who took my family.

643
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,352
Three words:

644
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,592
- We are coming.
- "We"?

645
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,719
There is no "we", Tom. You're alone.

646
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,352
- Alone against everyone.
- Three words: We are coming. Send it.

647
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,556
Sign it...

648
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,314
Jekyll...

649
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,516
and Hyde.
