1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,155
Doctor Jackman, where are you?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,436
Gone away.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,354
The most powerful creature
on the planet is what I'm looking at.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,717
He's capable of anything,
if he can get away with it.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,231
Mr Hyde, don't play these games with me!

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,836
He's got a knife. Minimum necessary
force. You understand me?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,436
My neck on the line. My personal neck.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,875
- Mrs Jackman?
- Good morning.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,519
It's complicated.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,238
Either you're my mother or you're not.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,109
Rules of estrangement.
Do we kiss now? I've forgotten.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,191
Bad news.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,118
I'm not in love with Dr Jackman.

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,998
Good work, Mr Syme.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,513
You're welcome.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,753
You are a direct descendant of
Dr Henry Jekyll of Edinburgh, correct?

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,992
- Yes.
- And yet he had no family, correct?

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,957
Yes.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,758
Then how can anything be simple?

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,354
How's Mom this morning?

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,472
Nobody in or out!
One door! Where is she?

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,235
There's a woman called Katherine
and she'll contact you. Help her.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,676
<i>- I won't stop fighting him.
- Then he will kill you.</i>

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,833
Then I won't die.
I have a wife and children, I won't die.

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,992
<i> I didn't get any sleep, Daddy.</i>

26
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,395
<i>That means you didn't get any sleep,</i>
<i>either. That's body-share for you.</i>

27
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,032
<i>Tired, Daddy? Oh, bet you are.</i>
<i>Bet you're tired as anything.</i>

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,320
<i>Close your eyes, Daddy. Let me drive.</i>

29
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,433
Trash one more hotel room and...

30
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,710
...I can chain both your feet.

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,912
<i> When you sleep...</i>

32
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,430
<i>... I will eat your children.</i>

33
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,030
First we lose Tom Jackman,
then Mom just vanishes.

34
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,078
We checked the video footage
to see how she got out.

35
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,630
It had erased itself. All gone.

36
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,712
We checked the security log to see
who opened the door.

37
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,235
What do you know? Erased.

38
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,631
"But that's impossible! It's magic!"

39
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,795
And so I'm asking...

40
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,158
how did she get out of the cell?

41
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,470
I don't know.

42
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,233
Did she walk through the wall?
That how she did it?

43
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,994
Did she walk through the wall, Pete?

44
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,549
I don't know.

45
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,871
You... Well, let me explain
about walls, Pete.

46
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,792
Come over here, let me show you.

47
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,916
It's OK, don't be scared.

48
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,516
You see this wall?
Let me explain about walls!

49
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,717
Oh, for Heaven's sake,
that's enough now!

50
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,278
Walls stop people!

51
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,795
And you stop now.

52
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,910
My daddy once said to me
a long time ago,

53
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,198
"Son, stop hitting me." I said,
"Daddy, stop getting up."

54
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,318
It's OK, it's OK.

55
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,677
He's finished now.
Come on, up you come. That's good.

56
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,637
OK. Now...

57
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,552
you get yourself down to the nurse,

58
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,393
get yourself cleaned up,
and find someone to fire you.

59
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,462
Don't talk to anybody about this,

60
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,759
otherwise we'll do
whatever it is we do to people.

61
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,239
Probably a bit unpleasant.

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,870
I mean, er... you know, I mean,
I'd try not to find out.

63
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,837
Sorry to be a bit vague,
but, er...

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,879
do take that in the general area
of a threat.

65
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,070
OK, well...

66
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,630
off you pop. Quickly now.

67
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,637
What the hell's the matter with you?

68
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,189
Bad day break ahead. You know how it is.

69
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,510
No, I don't know "how it is".

70
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,396
Well, then, I'll tell you.

71
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,238
She's coming.

72
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,391
We fucked up at the zoo,

73
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,198
we lost Mom, and guess what?

74
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,115
Hmm... we can't find Dr Jackman,
and she is coming.

75
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,593
If you want to keep your balls
where you can reach them,

76
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,342
start praying we find that
son-of-a-bitch before she gets here.

77
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,597
Mr Syme.

78
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,632
<i> Sleep, Tom. Sleep, darling.</i>

79
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,917
<i>It's OK. Close your eyes.</i>

80
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,196
<i>Sleep.</i>

81
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,835
<i> Sleep.</i>

82
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,353
<i>Come on now, love.</i>

83
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,954
<i>Close those eyes.</i>

84
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,395
<i>Hang that head.</i>

85
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,955
I assume she looks a bit older now.

86
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,238
Older? No, not at all.
She looked like that.

87
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,992
Exactly like that?

88
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,913
Yeah, like that.

89
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,629
That photograph is 15 years old.

90
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,360
Well, she doesn't look a day older now.

91
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,875
Well, that's not really possible,
is it? Sadly.

92
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,112
Well, you could
put a little more work in, dear.

93
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,952
So, she's lasting well. It happens.

94
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,873
Oh, she's lasting amazingly.

95
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,828
She's dead. Died 15 years ago.

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,992
That's one way
to halt the ageing process.

97
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,230
She's not dead, though. I met her.

98
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,631
I checked it out.
All the records agree. Dead.

99
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,950
Well, then she faked it.
Or somebody did.

100
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,237
- It's very difficult to fake a death.
- Yes, I tried it once.

101
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,834
But that was more of a boyfriend thing.

102
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,752
Oh, I had boyfriends once, dear.

103
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,151
No idea I was a lesbian till
Miranda explained it to me.

104
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,676
Could have knocked me over with
a feather. Which, oddly enough...

105
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,115
Moving on...

106
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,953
To fake a death properly
you need limitless funds,

107
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,588
friends in high places,
and a spare corpse.

108
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,591
It's a virtual impossibility.

109
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,389
Now, add to that fact that Sophia
Jackman apparently hasn't aged at all

110
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,232
in fifteen years. Well...

111
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,868
Well, obviously
she's not a ghost, is she?

112
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,669
Now, why are we eliminating
that possibility?

113
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,512
Because there's no such thing.

114
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,831
Katherine! Your current
professional engagement

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,549
is working as a PA
to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

116
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,236
From now on, there's no such thing
as "no such thing".

117
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,279
Wait there,
I'm just going to get the tickets.

118
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,072
The machine's outside, can you see it?
I will be outside. Don't pick your nose.

119
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,915
Mister?

120
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,710
- He's fine.
- What did you do to him?

121
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,632
- Nothing.
- What did he do?

122
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,155
- I didn't do anything.
- Get away from him.

123
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,073
- Sweetie, what did he do?
- Where did the other man go?

124
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,549
What other man?
Darling, there was no other man.

125
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,199
Where did he go?

126
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,477
Sweetie, there wasn't another man.
I was just there, I'd have seen.

127
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,517
I won't let him hurt you.

128
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,956
I won't let him hurt anyone, I promise.

129
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,473
- Hello?
<i>- It's me.</i>

130
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,438
- It's him.
- It's him.

131
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,828
Don't say where you are.

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,878
<i> Are you on a train?</i>

133
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,036
Yes.

134
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,996
- They know we're listening, then?
- They guess.

135
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,075
<i> So, how are you?</i>
<i>Any visits from our friend?</i>

136
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,037
<i> I try to avoid him.</i>

137
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,953
<i>- How?</i>
- Staying awake.

138
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,192
- A train?
- You've been awake for a whole week?

139
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,157
Jesus, a train.

140
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,073
- So what, a train?
- He's on a cell phone...

141
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,470
Tell him to hang up
and switch off the phone now.

142
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,629
- Ssh...
- Katherine!

143
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,233
Just a minute.

144
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,994
The longer he's constrained,
the worse he gets.

145
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,151
<i>- Yes.</i>
- He's like a dog, you need to run him.

146
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,675
If I let him run, he will run
to my children.

147
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,638
<i>You don't know that. Who told you that?</i>

148
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,519
- I did.
- Will you please tell him to hang up?

149
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,638
He's just making threats.
He saved Eddie's life.

150
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,439
He'd have killed him too, for a laugh.
You don't understand.

151
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,749
Maybe you don't.

152
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,549
Katherine, I can't let him free,
he's trying to take over!

153
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,474
Dr Jackman, hang up
and switch off the phone now.

154
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,108
Tell Katherine I'm sorry I shouted,
I'll be fine.

155
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,759
Tell her not to worry.

156
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,310
Dr Jackman... Oh, damn it!

157
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,675
You could phone him back,
if it's important.

158
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,992
He'll have withheld his number,
he's not that stupid.

159
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,355
He's exactly that stupid.

160
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,996
Come on.

161
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,276
- Come on.
- But he's hung up.

162
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,069
Doesn't matter.
Phone's still switched on.

163
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,515
If you can be texted...

164
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,193
you can be tracked.

165
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,079
How long have they been able
to do this for?

166
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,233
Well, I know where
that blonde on reception lives.

167
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,755
And I know you know too.

168
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,480
Track Jackman and you're rehired.

169
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,589
- I was fired?
- Mentally.

170
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,269
Where are you?

171
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,874
You're on the wrong end
of that question.

172
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,998
Probably, yes.

173
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,718
You're not at home, I tried.

174
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,351
I'm in a friend's house, OK?
Staying over.

175
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,550
For Christ's sake! Are you all right,
Tom? What's happening?

176
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,674
- What are you doing?
- What does it matter?

177
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,270
It doesn't.

178
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,994
- Are the boys there?
<i>- No.

179
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,195
Where are they?

180
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,079
Why do you assume it's not a man friend
I'm staying with?

181
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,673
I don't.

182
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,751
Would it matter if it were?

183
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,454
How's Eddie?

184
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:54,149
Still drawing his daddy fighting lions.

185
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,992
He thinks you're a superhero now.

186
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,913
<i>What happened in there?</i>

187
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,230
So where are they staying tonight?

188
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,312
<i>They've got their school trip</i>
<i>tomorrow, I couldn't bring them.</i>

189
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,630
<i>- They're staying with...</i>
- Don't tell me!

190
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,512
- Tom...
- Don't tell me where they are.

191
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,399
Don't tell me where you are, either.

192
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,709
I love you.

193
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,115
Close those eyes.
Hang that head.

194
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,710
Drift away with me.

195
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,032
Claire?

196
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,589
Look at you.

197
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,878
Look at my poor baby. Sleep.

198
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,349
Just sleep.

199
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,229
I can't. He'll go to our boys.

200
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,516
He'll take our boys.

201
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,399
The boys are safe with me, love.

202
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,595
Leave the boys to me.

203
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,072
You're him. Get away from me,
you're him!

204
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,515
Of course
it's me, Daddy!

205
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,477
Who else lives inside your head?

206
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,359
But don't I scrub up nice?

207
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,476
Just let go.

208
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,030
Let me dream for you.

209
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,478
I know what
you want. I know what you like.

210
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,790
I've peeped.

211
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,192
- Sleep, Daddy! Sleep with me.
- Get away from me!

212
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,591
My, my, Daddy!
Where did that come from?

213
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,320
I do declare,
I'm all a-flutter.

214
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,552
Don't speak to me out of her mouth!
Don't you ever do that!

215
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,508
What's so special
about her? Whiny little Claire.

216
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,319
Oh, Tom!
Why have you left me, Tom?

217
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,277
Oh, Tom, come back to me.

218
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,513
Oh, Tom, I'm so sad, and so wronged,
and so Ionely.

219
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,830
Don't I always dress nice?

220
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,389
Love me, Tom.

221
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,152
Don't you get sick of that shit?

222
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,311
Don't talk about her!
Anything else,

223
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,072
don't talk to me about her!

224
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,071
She met me, you know.

225
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,756
Looked right at me. Didn't see you.

226
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,273
How thick is that?

227
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,032
Lois Lane with half a brain.

228
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,112
Don't, don't. Just stop,
just stop now.

229
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,192
Why?
I'm asking. I'm serious.

230
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,478
Tell me, Daddy.
What's the big deal about Claire?

231
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,911
The big deal? What?
You want to know how I feel about her?

232
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,355
How it feels to miss her?

233
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,354
You're inside my head, take a look!

234
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,716
What is that?

235
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,122
What is all that?

236
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:54,590
Nothing you're ready for,
stupid child.

237
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,236
Go... away!

238
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,030
Got him.

239
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,202
He's moving.

240
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,596
Of course he's moving.
He's on a train.

241
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,593
You really don't have
the hang of England yet, do you?

242
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,070
Find out about that train,
I want to know every place it stops.

243
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,835
- I didn't think he had a mobile.
- He must have picked it up somewhere.

244
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,632
We're going to have a location fix
on him any second. Are you ready to go?

245
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,030
- Are we ready?
- Final checks, five minutes.

246
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,919
Two... minutes.

247
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,758
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

248
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,390
- I was about to say a few words.
- The facts are not unconnected.

249
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,186
I was just going to inspire the troops.

250
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:28,839
Well, make up your mind.

251
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,277
See, you're being funny there. That's...

252
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,432
that's you being funny,
but I don't mind, you know? I...

253
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,114
I enjoy people with a sense of humour.

254
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,111
Well, we enjoy you, too.

255
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,469
I see, er... the blonde in reception
isn't working tonight.

256
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,392
So perceptive.

257
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,510
Safe home.

258
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,638
Don't bump it. Don't bump the corners!

259
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,476
OK, people. Listen up, English people.

260
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,628
You know what tonight is?

261
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,358
Tonight...

262
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,909
is the orgasm.

263
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,988
Tonight is everything this organisation
has worked towards ever since it began.

264
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,116
Since it was a desk.

265
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,434
Tonight is the culmination of
over one hundred years of planning.

266
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,352
We have in our hands

267
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,229
one hundred years
of the dreams of brilliant men.

268
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,278
We have at our disposal
some of the most advanced,

269
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,591
some of the most expensive technology
the world has ever seen.

270
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,514
What we do not have are any excuses.

271
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,909
This is going to be bigger than America.

272
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,153
Dr Jackman is coming home.

273
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,072
Now...

274
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,071
Iook at me.

275
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,471
Look at my face.

276
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,631
Tonight...

277
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,791
nobody...

278
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,599
no... body...

279
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,398
screws up.

280
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,757
And in this organisation,
when we say nobody,

281
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,990
that means you.

282
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,438
Over a hundred years.

283
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,750
Millions of dollars

284
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,151
and no screw-ups.

285
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,589
Go!

286
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,035
- Thanks for that.
- No problem.

287
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,112
I'm, erm... always forgetting mine too.

288
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,916
Enjoyed our chat.

289
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,753
Me too.

290
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,078
Get your men ready. We got him.

291
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,709
She isn't worth it, by the way.

292
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,997
- Who isn't?
- Whoever put that look on your face.

293
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,038
Dump her,
you'll feel like a different man.

294
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,910
Now me...
I always feel like a different man.

295
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,151
Yeah, that's my problem too.

296
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,356
Claire?

297
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,070
I'm home.

298
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,150
You all right?

299
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,230
<i> It's me. I'm coming over</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

300
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,358
<i>By the time you hear this message,</i>
<i>I'll be there.</i>

301
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,829
<i>I have questions, old friend.</i>

302
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,156
Tom?

303
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,549
Expecting someone else?

304
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,669
The question is, are you?

305
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,116
Drink?

306
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,158
- No.
- Do you mind if I do?

307
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,516
Are your daughters here?

308
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,070
No, I think they're in Bulgaria,
or one of those countries.

309
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,719
You have company, though?

310
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,314
Yes. I hope you didn't disturb her.
Scotch?

311
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,756
- I said I didn't want a drink.
- You might change your mind.

312
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,319
Oh, you've got no idea.

313
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,199
Oh, I'm afraid I do.

314
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,151
Still that girl from reception?

315
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,556
My guilty secret. Which, apparently,
everyone knows about.

316
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,678
Know the feeling.

317
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,593
Yes, I imagine you do.

318
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,034
I'm surprised to see you here.

319
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,953
Bit risky, isn't it?
You know they're looking for you.

320
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,031
Oh, I've...

321
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,918
taken precautions.

322
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,032
Of course I'll be there.

323
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,654
Just a bit late,
that's all I'm saying.

324
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,550
There's a lot of helicopters about
this evening.

325
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,196
I thought we were friends.

326
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,635
Yes, that was the idea.

327
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,994
So...

328
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,152
- What've you discovered so far?
- I'm not in your classroom now.

329
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,470
Then how will you ever learn?

330
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,236
There really was a Dr Jekyll.
In Edinburgh, in the 1860s.

331
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,073
- A genius and a visionary.
- Who experimented on himself.

332
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,913
- Courageous too.
- And turned himself into a monster.

333
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,593
A monster? Be objective.

334
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,479
Turned himself into...

335
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,878
someone else.

336
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:38,297
Well, more than
just "someone", surely?

337
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,994
- A demon?
- A superman.

338
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,628
- Ha! That's you being objective?
- No, no, no.

339
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,553
The human species
no longer evolves, remember?

340
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,792
We change the world,
it no longer changes us.

341
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,393
But at what cost?

342
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,233
The millennia pass and Homo sapiens
remains unchanged,

343
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,072
century after century.

344
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,597
And then one day,
Dr Jekyll drinks from a flask

345
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,992
and what do you know,
there's life in the old girl yet.

346
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,357
- I never drank anything.
- You don't have to.

347
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,115
It's part of your inheritance,
your birthright.

348
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,350
- Because I'm his descendant?
- Clearly.

349
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,909
- But Henry Jekyll had no children.
- Correct.

350
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,832
I can't be his descendant.

351
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,911
- Correct again.
- Then how come I...

352
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,191
Did you do that? Was that you?

353
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,510
Happens when...

354
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,271
...when I'm holding him in.

355
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,712
Interesting.

356
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,016
There was some contention
the change might generate

357
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,998
a low-level electrical field.

358
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,516
I'm afraid I was sceptical.
Do you mind if I make a few notes?

359
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,193
I'm not a bloody experiment!

360
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,874
What on earth gives you that idea?

361
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,078
Who's following me?

362
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,993
- We are.
- Who's WE?

363
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,718
Who do you think?

364
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,555
The Institute? Klein & Utterson,
the people I worked for?

365
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,439
Klein & Utterson exist to follow you.

366
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,353
You are its sole purpose.

367
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,708
Is anything in my life not a lie?

368
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,873
Not much, Tom.
I wasn't even really making a note.

369
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,600
- What are you doing?
- A very powerful sedative.

370
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,832
- Count backwards from ten.
- You idiot! You bloody idiot!

371
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,673
Sit down and let it happen.
There's nothing you can do.

372
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,752
Tom, for God's sake,
this is pointless...

373
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:31,912
Listen to me!

374
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,311
What sends me to sleep wakes him up!
You just committed suicide.

375
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,869
- How long have I got?
- You should be under by now.

376
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,519
I've got good at hanging on.

377
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,999
- Sit!
- What?

378
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,720
- Sit on it! Sit!
- What... what are you doing?

379
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,359
Rope. I need to find rope.

380
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,397
- Tom, this is pointless.
- On the chair!

381
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,358
I won't let you tie me up.
I know how dangerous he is.

382
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,795
- He's an animal. I'm dangerous!
- What are you doing?

383
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,396
- Sit on the chair!
- A knife? You'd never use it, Tom.

384
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,835
If Hyde wakes up now,
a knife to your throat,

385
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,752
he'll think it's Christmas,
sit on the chair!

386
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,677
Tom, this is crazy. What are you?

387
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,478
- The wine cellar.
- What?

388
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,914
- It locks?
- Yes.

389
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,911
It's secure, it could contain him.

390
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,958
What, you're going to lock yourself in?

391
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,839
If I let Hyde go free now,
he'll run to my children.

392
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,310
He's already been to see them.
He didn't do them any harm.

393
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,920
He tried to save Eddie's life.

394
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,161
That was before
I locked him up for weeks.

395
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:25,997
Why would you do that?

396
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,153
Because they're my children, my family,
my life, and he's not taking any of it!

397
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,118
- Key!
- Er... desk, top drawer.

398
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,192
Come on.

399
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,590
- What are you doing?
- You're coming with me.

400
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,479
- You don't need me.
- I don't trust you anymore.

401
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,756
You're locking me in with Hyde?

402
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,753
- Yes, I know.
- I'm tied up! This is inhuman!

403
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,990
- Any minute now.
- No, listen to me, Tom.

404
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,391
- They're tracking your phone.
- I don't have one.

405
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,869
They're tracking somebody else's.

406
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,150
- Hello, help! I'm here...
- Hello. It's me. Naughty old me.

407
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,151
Who is this?
Who would be following you?

408
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,710
From the train, remember?
I'm the guy lent you the phone.

409
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,593
Hello, Mr l-Have-That-Problem-Too.

410
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,190
It's Mr I Can-Take-A-Hint.

411
00:31:17,972 --> 00:31:19,351
Help me!

412
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,590
Help me!

413
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,876
Help me!

414
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,151
You could have killed me!

415
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,311
Yes, and this is my good side.

416
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,163
Hello? What's happening?

417
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,998
Is everything all right?

418
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,395
Run! Run for your life, run!
Get away from here.

419
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,312
Oh, God!

420
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,712
Help me, please!
Can anybody hear me?

421
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,916
No!

422
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,389
- No!
- Eat your children.

423
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,630
- No!
- Eat your children!

424
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,069
4-7-4-8.

425
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,549
- Who's that?
- Him. He got the combination.

426
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,039
Tom, listen, I...

427
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,270
I need to hide this
where he can't find it.

428
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,590
- Tom, Tom... I need you to...
- Open!

429
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,352
- What?
- Open! Open it!

430
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,875
Open! Open.

431
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,350
Swallow. Swallow. Swallow it. Swallow.

432
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,590
Gone?

433
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,358
- How will we get out of here now?
- I hope you're regular.

434
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:21,364
You...

435
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,956
You were on the floor. How did you?

436
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,873
I was calling for help.
She heard me and?

437
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,874
I'm really sorry about this.
I never meant for this to happen. But...

438
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,316
- she was worried, I asked her over...
- Who?

439
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,878
Tom.

440
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,429
What's wrong?

441
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,160
- What are you doing?
- Claire.

442
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,912
Don't look.

443
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,913
Please. Don't look.

444
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,916
Tom?

445
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,990
Tom, are you all right?

446
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,276
Hi, honey. I'm home.

447
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,717
Hello?

448
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,553
Hello? Hello, can you hear me?

449
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,838
Stay still, I'm going to get help.
Don't move! Don't move.

450
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,468
- You're hurt.
- What?

451
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,710
You're bleeding.

452
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,599
I don't think it's my blood.

453
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,593
What happened to you?

454
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,990
I don't know.

455
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,273
Now, Daddy, this is so much better.

456
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,796
Wine, a woman, a tied-up old guy!

457
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,109
OK, not sure about that last one.

458
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,633
Tom?

459
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,076
"Tom?"

460
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,958
Tom's gone, honey.

461
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,635
Dr Jackman has left the building.
It's the night shift.

462
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,430
Mrs Jackman?

463
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,435
Oh, Daddy.

464
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,068
You are spoiling me!

465
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,791
Haven't fucked anything in days.

466
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,235
Seriously, a gust of wind
and I'd go off. So...

467
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,551
I hope you don't have any plans
that involve walking straight.

468
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,597
You either.

469
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,035
Where's... where's Tom?

470
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,350
You just missed him.

471
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,633
Peter? Peter, what is this?
What's happening?

472
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,678
You wanted to know
where your husband goes.

473
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,876
This is where he goes.

474
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,748
I've met you.

475
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,831
You're Billy. You're Tom's cousin Billy.

476
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,117
Lovely to see you again.
How are the kids?

477
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,831
Wh... Where's my husband?

478
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,436
Your husband's standing
right in front of you.

479
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,751
My husband is Tom Jackman.

480
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,912
- Tom Jackman is also Billy.
- No...

481
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,958
He's both of them.

482
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,758
How can he be two people?

483
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,911
You saw it happen.

484
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,949
How can you be two people?

485
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,398
What are you? I thought I married a man.

486
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,835
You miscounted.

487
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,910
Claire, be careful.

488
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,553
Never try to hit me, Mrs Jackman,
when I haven't eaten. It's just a tip.

489
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,515
Keep away from me.

490
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,060
Keep away from me!

491
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,033
You are going to be fun.

492
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,919
Let's find somewhere more comfortable.

493
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,952
- Did somebody lock us in?
- You did.

494
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,473
Oh, Daddy!

495
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,996
No!

496
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,594
OK. Where's the key?

497
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,149
Come on, come on.
You must have seen him.

498
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,834
Where'd he put it? You got the key?

499
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,513
Where is it?

500
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,631
Thank you.

501
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,075
Where's the key?

502
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,516
You've been dribbling.

503
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,558
Now, why have you been dribbling?

504
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,237
Did my daddy make you dribble?

505
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,360
Clever Daddy.

506
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,955
You know what?

507
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,071
I think I've found the key.

508
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,630
Arrest you?
What would I be arresting you for?

509
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,551
There's been a murder hasn't there?

510
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,156
- That's why you're here.
- Yeah.

511
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,073
Then, arrest me.

512
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,593
It's Jackman.

513
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,832
That's a recorded feed from
a security camera inside Syme's house.

514
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,468
- And the phone we're tracking?
- In the woods somewhere.

515
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,631
Doesn't matter, that's him.

516
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,559
Awesome.

517
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,792
Tell them no one goes in
till I get there.

518
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,950
Fantastiche!

519
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,634
Tom, no. For God's sake, Tom!

520
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,472
Tom's gone, love. Tom's asleep.

521
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,835
Strange as it may seem,
I am on your side.

522
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,560
Oh, that's nice. Thanks for that.

523
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,832
Listen to me. You've never killed
before. Jackman wouldn't let you.

524
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,719
Are you sure you want to start?
You think you can do it?

525
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,952
- You've never killed before.
- Stop me if I'm doing it wrong.

526
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,395
- Listen to me!
- Oops! Nearly forgot.

527
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,074
Anaesthetic.
Count backwards from ten.

528
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,869
Oh, dear, Mrs Jackman. It's going
to take a bit more than that with me.

529
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,598
Fine!

530
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,515
I'm your wife. Don't ever ask me
to hit you. Just a tip.

531
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,393
- It's the wrong key.
- What?

532
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,154
It's too small, it's the wrong key.

533
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,552
You fucking bitch! You...

534
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,196
Husband, I have questions.

535
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,591
- I'm not your husband.
- What, because you've changed?

536
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,479
I don't know what you are.
I don't know if you're schizoid

537
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,473
or a werewolf
or the first man to discover PMT,

538
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,395
but, honey, yes,
you are my husband. So...

539
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,711
What the hell do you mean,
you haven't fucked anything in days?

540
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,632
- You're not serious?
- Look at me.

541
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,917
- I'm not your husband.
- You're Tom Jackman.

542
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,676
- No. We just share a dick.
- Yeah, and it's mine.

543
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,637
- How many?
- How many what?

544
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,155
Girls, women, little boys? How many?

545
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,117
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

546
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,955
- I'm not married to you!
- Yes, you are. Get used to it.

547
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,469
How many?

548
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,032
I fuck. I go out, I fuck. I don't count.

549
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,589
Jesus!

550
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,557
What kind of animal are you?

551
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,947
Maybe if Dr Jackman was getting any,

552
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,350
I wouldn't always
wake up with a hard-on.

553
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,080
I try.

554
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,982
He won't let me anywhere near him.

555
00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:26,995
He can't.
He's afraid he'll turn into me.

556
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,833
- Would he?
- What if he did?

557
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,910
Why would I turn him into you?

558
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,993
Oh, Mrs Jackman.
You'd turn any man into me.

559
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,197
Are you flirting with me?
Don't flirt with me.

560
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,115
- I was your husband a minute ago.
- That's the problem!

561
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,192
Why'd you have to go out
fucking everything in sight?

562
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,316
Why didn't you tell me about this?

563
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,516
I am telling you.

564
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,796
The other you, the real you.

565
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,110
I AM the real me.

566
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,799
OK.

567
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,396
Tell me this. Are you using protection?

568
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,798
I need to know. I have children.

569
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,395
- Are you using protection?
- Yes, yes. He makes me.

570
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,154
Great.

571
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,515
Very considerate.

572
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,910
Just lovely.

573
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,117
- Ever consider using restraint?
- Too close, Mrs Jackman.

574
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,033
Don't put your hands in the cage.

575
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,515
You threatening me?

576
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,474
Warning you.

577
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,797
I spent an entire evening with you.

578
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,474
You played with my children.

579
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,758
Our children.
Why should I be afraid of you?

580
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,869
Because I'm not your husband,
and I don't know when to stop.

581
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,270
Then why did you warn me?

582
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,670
- Your clothes don't fit.
- They're not mine.

583
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,637
Turn around for me.

584
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,631
- What?
- On the spot.

585
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,634
Twirl, husband.

586
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,273
You're taller than him. Bit slimmer.

587
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,192
Younger.

588
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,271
Maybe five years, maybe more.

589
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,715
I remember that arse.

590
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,270
- What else is different?
- Check here...

591
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,238
Dream on.

592
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,517
What about... memories?

593
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,069
Do you have his memories?

594
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,996
No.

595
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,279
Bits and pieces, sometimes.

596
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,873
Places

597
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,190
and faces.

598
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,237
I look at you and know exactly
what you look like naked.

599
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,154
- No, you don't.
- How can you be so sure?

600
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,276
You went elsewhere.

601
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,113
You flirting with me, Mrs Jackman?

602
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,191
Torturing you.

603
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,791
I think his name is Syme,
and this is his house.

604
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,916
That's right.

605
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,389
- You're in his house.
- Yes, I'm in his house.

606
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,950
- In that dress!
- He doesn't think of me that way.

607
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,111
- And what were you thinking?!
- What?

608
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,636
- While you fucked half of London?
- I'm not your husband!

609
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,441
Then, why are you jealous?

610
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,588
So how do you two work it?

611
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,794
How do you live?

612
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,033
Usually we have an arrangement.
Recently he's been chaining me up.

613
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,919
- What changed?
- I found about you.

614
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,516
- And the kids. Where you live.
- And that worried him?

615
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,750
- I make threats.
- Why?

616
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,878
- I don't like being chained up.
- Not threats you'd carry out.

617
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,034
Don't come any closer, Mrs Jackman.
I don't know what I'd do.

618
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,158
When the light flickers,
you look at it like it means something.

619
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,675
- You're quick!
- Why? What does it mean?

620
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,831
I think he can hear your voice.

621
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,309
I want to talk to him.

622
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:23,790
He's not strong enough
to come through.

623
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,358
What does that mean?

624
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,670
- Tom!
- Listen, no time.

625
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,310
Syme's one of them,
you can't trust them. You've got to...

626
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,040
Got to what? What do you mean?

627
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,958
- Stupid Mrs Jackman.
- Don't call me stupid.

628
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,437
Thank you.

629
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,477
Gonna need the key.

630
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,428
- I can take it.
- You won't hurt me. You're Tom Jackman,

631
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,354
- I know you won't.
- I'm not your husband.

632
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,272
No!

633
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,476
- What have you done?
- It was your idea.

634
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,232
- His idea.
- You, him, same thing.

635
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,595
- Stupid bitch!
- You threatened my children.

636
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,512
- You're not leaving.
- I need the key.

637
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,070
- You're not going to hurt me.
- I'll get that key back any way I can.

638
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,073
You've never killed anyone before.
You won't start with me.

639
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,357
If I've never killed before,
how do I know I wouldn't enjoy it?

640
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,796
You are Tom Jackman.
You would never hurt me.

641
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,502
Oh, Mrs Jackman, I'd hurt you.

642
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,274
So, Dr Jackman, you killed your wife.

643
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,112
Yes.

644
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,432
But you don't have any memory
of the incident? You just know?

645
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,795
I have...

646
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,757
episodes.

647
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,718
Violent episodes.

648
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,429
Keep me here long enough
and you'll see.

649
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,273
You should put me in restraints.

650
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,352
So you keep saying.
We don't deem it necessary.

651
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,238
Please. For your own sake.

652
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,390
Excuse me.

653
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,069
Can I see my wife?

654
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,196
Please.

655
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,954
I just need to see what he...

656
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,997
What I did.

657
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,355
Please.

658
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,638
- What's wrong?
- Apparently you're being transferred.

659
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,955
Got to give me credit,
I'm one hell of a kisser.

660
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,592
Didn't really think you'd swallow it.

661
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,594
- What if I had?
- I had a back-up plan.

662
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,594
- I don't believe you.
- You should.

663
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,990
Tom.

664
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,436
- Tom, what are we going to do?
- I'm not Tom.

665
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,194
Oh, you're Tom, all right.

666
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,558
You're just... I don't know... sick.

667
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,358
Some weird new kind of sick.

668
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,637
I don't think they're gonna find a cure
for it soon. Do you?

669
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,075
We don't have to.

670
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,356
There's been a cure for over 50 years.

671
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,389
Mrs Jackman, would you please
step away from Mr Hyde?

672
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,791
Gentlemen, could you lower
your weapons?

673
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,714
I'd hate to be taking back a corpse
because one of y'all sneezed.

674
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,438
Thank you.

675
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,397
Good to see you again.

676
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,994
How are you going to take me anywhere
when I know you can't shoot me?

677
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,720
You see that's a funny thing.

678
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:15,512
We really didn't expect you to become
so attached to Dr Jackman's family.

679
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,319
Now there's... there's a weakness,
Mr Hyde.

680
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,675
Are you threatening my family?

681
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,912
Hello, it's me, Benjamin.
The word is, "go".

682
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,390
I said, are you threatening my family?

683
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,835
Excuse me for a moment.

684
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,831
Yeah.

685
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,991
I am.

686
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,278
Explicitly and directly

687
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,398
and emphatically threatening the lives

688
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,154
of Dr Jackman's family.

689
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,474
That's all I wanted to know.

690
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,519
There now, Benjamin.
It'll be over in a moment.

691
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,831
It's all right. Hush, now.

692
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,356
Count backwards from ten.

693
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,750
I'm sorry, Benjamin can't come
to the phone, right now.

694
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,909
- Aah...
- Mr Hyde.

695
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,117
Don't want you to move. Please.

696
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,114
- You have orders not to kill me, right?
- First casualty of conflict, orders.

697
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,354
As far as this conflict goes,
I'd say Benjamin might beg to differ.

698
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,597
Can't tell you how fast I am.
But I'll tell you this.

699
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,038
First one of you starts getting nervous,
starts pulling that trigger... dead.

700
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,351
Then I'll have a gun.
That's the next two... dead.

701
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,830
Third one kills me,
then dies of his injuries.

702
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,437
So what you guys
have got to ask yourselves...

703
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,477
is this...

704
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,996
How much did I like my boss?

705
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,300
I don't think
you're faster than a bullet,

706
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:51,883
but then I'm not supposed to kill you.

707
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,308
And personally...

708
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,358
I couldn't stand the guy.

709
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,757
Mmm...

710
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,511
Mrs Jackman?

711
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,116
- Yes?
- I'm sorry...

712
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,999
but I did like it.

713
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,075
Ssh...

714
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,389
Can I call you?

715
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,315
Gentlemen! If any harm should come
to Mrs Jackman,

716
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,519
I will kill all of you one by one.

717
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,389
And I shall take my time!

718
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,118
Hope you find a nicer boss.

719
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,675
- No problem, we'll pull him in.
- Don't bother.

720
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,149
He's got blood on his hands.

721
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,756
Hyde'll run, but Jackman will return.

722
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,870
Well, Benjamin seems to be dead.

723
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,598
I think we should probably...

724
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,115
tidy up a bit and, er...

725
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,838
I don't know...

726
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,230
phone the police.

727
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,915
Anyone got an aspirin?

728
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,993
Can I see my wife?

729
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,116
Please.

730
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,794
I just need to see what he...

731
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,837
What I did.

732
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,754
- Please.
- Apparently you're being transferred.

733
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,517
Tonight is everything this organisation
has worked towards ever since it began.

734
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,070
- Have we met?
- Friend of a friend.

735
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,028
Tonight is the culmination of over
100 years of planning.

736
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,553
Claire?

737
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,188
- Get it open.
- What is it?

738
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:47,310
We have in our hands 100 years
of the dreams of brilliant men.

739
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,074
- Get him in.
- What is it? No! No!

740
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,516
No, what are you doing?
What's happening?

741
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,513
Dr Jackman is coming home.

742
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,513
No, for God's sake, no! Please!

743
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,638
For God's sake, no! Please! Claire! No!

744
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,999
You have some questions.

745
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,752
A few, yes.

746
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,115
You have my husband in a box!

747
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,872
Off you go.
Might as well get started.

748
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,157
I'm going to say this again.
You know there's no guarantee.

749
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,471
I want to speak to Winston Churchill.

750
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,676
What if your friend
has the cure for cancer?

751
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,354
- What then?
- Shut up! Shut up!

752
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,749
I married Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?

753
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,354
- Yes, you did.
- I'm Mrs Jekyll and Hyde?

754
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,191
What are you?
