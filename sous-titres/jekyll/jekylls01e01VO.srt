1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,755
He's due at midnight.
He's usually punctual.

2
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,672
You really need all these?

3
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,871
- I'm not sure how strong he is?
- He's stronger than you?

4
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,271
- Yes.
- Strength isn't usually a variable.

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,192
- I'm sorry?
- In cases like this,

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,397
you don't get extra muscles
or anything.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,518
There aren't any cases like this.

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,236
Please.

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,190
The woman sitting opposite you
is Katherine Reimer.

10
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,750
She's a psychiatric nurse,
with experience in...

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,559
related areas.

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,793
She is fully apprised of the situation,
and yes, she can be trusted.

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,794
If you approve, she's coming
to work for us, for both of us.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,315
She won't take sides.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,678
Please consider it. We can't
go on the way we've been going.

16
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,112
In the event she decides to release you
from the chair, the cameras are on.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,878
You know the rules.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,156
You don't keep him
in that chair all the time?

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,312
- Of course not.
- So what's it for?

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,472
He has violent episodes
and he doesn't like surprises.

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,517
Am I the surprise?

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,353
- I want you to feel safe.
- Great job you're doing.

23
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,718
If released, there are three things
he never leaves without.

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,079
What's the chair for normally,
when you're not making girls feel safe?

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,437
Sometimes I punish him.

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,551
OK.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,430
Three things?

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,273
Digital recorder, runs for 24 hours,

29
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,355
kept on at all times
unless by prior agreement.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,317
GPS, keeps a track of his movements.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,914
Afterwards, download everything
onto the computer.

32
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,981
There's timecode
on both for correlation.

33
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:42,868
You wear those things too?

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,917
- Yes.
- Mutual surveillance.

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,389
- Exactly.
- And the third thing?

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,519
The dictaphone.
It's how we communicate.

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,399
"We're running low on milk,"
that kind of thing?

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,510
Sometimes.

39
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:05,932
What's wrong?

40
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,156
He's coming.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,712
You said violent episodes.

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,633
- Yes.
- What if he has one?

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,360
There's not a lot you can do.
Under the circumstances.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,069
Please, could you just sit over there?

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,674
What if he hurts someone?
If he's as bad as you say...

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,910
- He is.
- What if he kills someone?

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,548
- He won't.
- Why not?

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,075
Because I'd turn myself in.

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,074
Are there rules for you too?

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,756
He says if I ever attempt to look for
a cure, he'll put a bullet in his brain.

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,388
I see.

52
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,994
He doesn't know the code.
You'll need to memorise it.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,789
- I just did.
- Anything else I should tell you?

54
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,236
Do you ever smile?

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,396
Let me know.

56
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,236
Good luck, Miss Reimer.

57
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,516
Good night, Dr Jackman.

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,509
6pm. I'll be offline for three hours.
I will not be changing location.

59
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,910
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

60
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,675
Daddy! Daddy!

61
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,559
Hi. Hello. All right?

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,439
- What have you been up to?
- Pick us up!

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,233
Lifting you two is like lifting
two huge, enormous, fat men.

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,930
What are you eating?

65
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,134
Right, you two. Out to the garden.

66
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:23,717
I have to talk to Mummy.
See you in a minute.

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,356
You might at least have had the decency
to be having an affair.

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,952
It's one thing coming second best
to another woman.

69
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,112
But coming second best
to no woman at all...

70
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,159
- You're being positively thoughtless.
- How long has this been going on?

71
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,788
That was so going to be my question.

72
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,190
You put a private detective on me!

73
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,480
I can't believe you left your wife
and kids without a word of explanation.

74
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,074
I win!

75
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,473
So, this explains the black van
that's following me everywhere.

76
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,471
We never discussed
the colour of the van.

77
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,359
- Daddy!
- In a minute.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,036
I don't...

79
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,877
I don't have a secret lover
or anything.

80
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,670
- Secret lover!
- Well, I don't!

81
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,389
Darling, you're too repressed
to have a secret lover.

82
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,835
Was I always repressed?

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,353
Even at the beginning?

84
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,991
When I had the twins, do you know
what my first thought was?

85
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,515
What?

86
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,716
I think he likes me.

87
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,313
Hmm.

88
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,237
Stop it!

89
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,878
Eddie...

90
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,837
Eddie, I thought I told you to...

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,558
Eddie!

92
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,870
Eddie, I mean it!

93
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,996
Night-night, Eddie.

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,350
Night, Harry.

95
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,310
<i>- I should</i> go.
<i>- Oh? Is that what you should do?</i>

96
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,715
- Tom...
- Claire, I can't...

97
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,871
Whatever the problem is...

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,554
whatever it is that's
keeping you from us,

99
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,358
whatever's happened that's so bad

100
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,877
you think you can't even
talk to me about it...

101
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,554
Fancy a fuck?

102
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,597
Claire...

103
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,992
Sorry!

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,434
- What's wrong?
- Got to go.

105
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,477
Tom...

106
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,463
Not here!

107
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,194
Come on! No!

108
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,310
No!

109
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,433
- Dr Jackman?
- Unscheduled change. He's coming.

110
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,989
What brought it on this time?
It's happening more...

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,594
No time!

112
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,195
- You look... different.
- How much do I owe you?

113
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,518
Just once. Seriously, just bloody once,
could you tell me where you parked?

114
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,512
Good evening.

115
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,836
- I don't drink whisky.
- It's not for you.

116
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,312
- I wasn't sure who to expect.
- He didn't stay long, couple of hours.

117
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,756
- Between 8 and 10.
- I'll tell him he owes you.

118
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,878
- Unless you want the time now.
- No.

119
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,270
Thursday evening.
I've got a meeting out of town.

120
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,797
- Fine. Where did you come round?
- The usual.

121
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,951
- Did you pay her?
- Yes.

122
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,998
Prostitutes take their money up front.
You paid her twice.

123
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,835
No reason to pay double when
you've only got the one, you know...

124
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,973
Thank you, Katherine.

125
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,073
If you changed in the car,
you hid it in the glove box.

126
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,710
Want me to go and look?

127
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,077
Isn't he entitled to know he's married?

128
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
I should give you
the safe combination.

129
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,145
No need.

130
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,916
- Sometimes you're quite frightening.
- Which coming from you...

131
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,390
What triggered it this time?
It's happening more and more.

132
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,394
- Do you think it's stress-related?
- I don't know.

133
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,199
- We should start making notes.
- If you like.

134
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,033
- Any messages?
- No. Anything from him?

135
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,714
- He wants a name.
- Where did that come from?

136
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,075
Not having a name, I imagine.

137
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,834
- Tell him to choose one.
- He wasn't asking permission.

138
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,036
Tell him he has it.

139
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,794
Your books arrived.
Only two titles they couldn't find.

140
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,633
I've tracked them down,
they'll be here tomorrow.

141
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,358
Thank you.

142
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,397
That's a lot of reading.

143
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,233
Must be a very long article
you're writing.

144
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,197
It is, yes.

145
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,874
Are you looking for a cure, Dr Jackman?

146
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,430
Which obviously I'd completely
understand, but I work for both you

147
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,319
and that's not in the terms
of your agreement.

148
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,155
You're entitled to
research your condition,

149
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,756
but then he's entitled to know
he's married, isn't he?

150
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,797
He's not married.

151
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,951
I'm married.

152
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,633
Good night, Katherine.

153
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,192
Good night, Dr Jackman.

154
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,270
- Where do you want access to?
- Just the library.

155
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,396
Not the coffee shop?

156
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,710
That would be nice.

157
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,952
Thanks.

158
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,750
We miss you round here, Dr Jackman.
Writing another article?

159
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,638
Well, you know...

160
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,791
Keeping the wolf from the door?

161
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,951
Always.

162
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,360
You don't do crosswords.

163
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,956
- How do you know?
- They're for fun.

164
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,839
Good Lord, really?

165
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,825
If you want to talk, you don't have to
lurk about in my vicinity.

166
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,621
Just try phoning.

167
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,435
Well, there'd be all that...
You know...

168
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,553
- Chatting.
- Yeah.

169
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,477
Is it worth mentioning
I still haven't changed my mind?

170
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,428
Is it worth mentioning
I still haven't advertised your job?

171
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,556
You should.

172
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,635
Oh, for God's sake! Six months.
Your wife and your job!

173
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,075
If you're having a breakdown
about some waitress,

174
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,800
you must've got it out
of your system by now!

175
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,279
Peter, advertise my job.

176
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,230
How can you bear it? Writing about what
you used to do. How can that be enough?

177
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,358
I'm fairly certain you used to have
some sort of an ego.

178
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,195
- I did. It got so big it left me.
- Actually, that's quite funny.

179
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,635
Oh, you've got no idea.

180
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,468
Well, hang on, hang on.
Couldn't we at least go for a drink?

181
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,871
Sorry, I've got someone coming.
Advertise my job.

182
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,474
What's that expression
about Satan skating to work?

183
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,155
Something to do with hell freezing over.

184
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,993
- It's a sort of a quip.
- Not anymore.

185
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,711
- OK, OK, a quick half, then.
- I've got to go home and change.

186
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,876
- Yeah?
- Have you seen the time?

187
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,315
<i>- I'm heading back now.</i>
- He's due at 7.

188
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,630
He's never late for a scheduled change.

189
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,519
- I know.
<i>- I found that detective agency for you.</i>

190
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,796
They've got an office at 19 Bowman Road.

191
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,428
- Bowman Road?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

192
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,797
- That's just ten minutes away.
- You don't have time.

193
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,474
No. No, of course not.

194
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,274
Come on, come on.

195
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,674
- Excuse me? I'm looking for...
- Through there.

196
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,515
- You OK?
- What do you think, sweetie?

197
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,151
No, no, they're all cancelled.
No, I'm serious, love, all of them.

198
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,549
Breaks my heart, too. Itsy bitsy pieces.
Listen, I've got to go.

199
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,759
No, really, I'm going.
Kiss your dogs for me. Bye-bye.

200
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,150
Obviously you know who I am.

201
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,672
Good evening, Dr Jackman.

202
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,950
The black van is a little hard to miss.

203
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,190
Probably the tinted windows.

204
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,113
- I'm not coming through to take notes.
- You never did.

205
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,157
Well, that goes double now!

206
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,675
How?

207
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,239
Exactly!

208
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,433
Why didn't you show my wife
all of the photographs?

209
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,511
I know there must be others.

210
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,749
There's someone missing.

211
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,912
A friend of mine.

212
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,757
If you've been following me, you'll have
seen him. There must be photographs.

213
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,151
- Well?
- He's a pretty boy.

214
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,552
All the more reason to have shown
the photographs to my wife.

215
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,678
Dr Jackman.

216
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,077
At this moment, do you know

217
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:49,230
what the single most important
fact of your life is?

218
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,710
- I thought I did.
- Have you got five minutes?

219
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,919
- Yes.
- Don't go anywhere.

220
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,355
- Hello?
<i>- Apparently I smoke.</i>

221
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,909
- When did he start?
- Where are you?

222
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,595
- I can change in the car.
- Are you in the car now?

223
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,196
Stick a patch on his arm. Remind him
we don't have a lung each!

224
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,512
<i>- Dr Jackman, are you in the car now?</i>
- I'll call you back.

225
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,114
- Where did she go?
- Home.

226
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,078
- For the night?
- For good. We're closing down.

227
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,071
- I'm sorry?
- You're sorry?!

228
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,438
- What?
- A rich relative upped and died.

229
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,434
You know what's funny about that?
I don't have any rich relatives.

230
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,797
Know what else is funny?
Neither did she.

231
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,078
- You're Dr Jackman, aren't you?
- Yes.

232
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,993
So, what's so special about you?

233
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,276
- Special?
- Someone paid her that money,

234
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,557
and you're the only one
she was following.

235
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,510
- Got any rich relatives?
- What's her mobile number?

236
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,558
- I can't give it out.
- She just sacked you.

237
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,272
- You said you were coming back.
<i>- I told you to stay where you were.</i>

238
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,317
What the hell are you doing?

239
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,155
<i>Getting away from you</i>
<i>as far as I possibly can.</i>

240
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,878
So I see.

241
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,272
<i>Dr Jackman, the single</i>
<i>most important fact in your life...</i>

242
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,149
- Is what?
- I don't own a black van.

243
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:20,829
What the fuck?

244
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,389
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

245
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,755
Are you listening to me?

246
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,798
- I'm sorry...
- Get up! Get up!

247
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,070
- I have to go.
- Yeah?

248
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,276
- Maybe not, eh?
- Billy, leave him!

249
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,668
Shut up!

250
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,752
What I am reaching for is not a weapon.

251
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,119
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You see, just a tape recorder.

252
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:46,077
He's got a knife.

253
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,152
Minimum necessary force.
You understand me? I will check.

254
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,869
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life, I hope.

255
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,712
Turn around. Face the wall!

256
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,030
- Why?
- Because I told you to.

257
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,919
- Was he attacking you?
- What's it to you?

258
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,390
Just trying to salve my conscience.

259
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,028
While I still have one.

260
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,668
You stay there, don't move.

261
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,999
<i> He's got a knife.</i>
<i>Minimum necessary force.</i>

262
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,752
<i>You understand me? I will check.</i>

263
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,911
What was that about?

264
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,755
You look... Well, you don't...

265
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,593
First fag of the day...
always hits the spot.

266
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,149
You stay away from me. I'll hurt you.

267
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,232
Yeah? You think?

268
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,630
Mmm...

269
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,358
Don't worry. I have a good doctor.

270
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,556
Jesus!

271
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,076
It'll hurt more tomorrow,
which works for me.

272
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,269
Now... you know what I call this,
children?

273
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:12,795
I call this the perfect
start to an evening.

274
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,872
The night is young,
there's a beautiful girl,

275
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,554
and somebody's going to die.

276
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,075
It's you, by the way.

277
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,754
- What?
- OK.

278
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,071
"Minimum necessary force." Let's see.

279
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,594
What do you say,
I'll give you three goes?

280
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,273
- Goes?
- With the knife.

281
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,874
You can give it your
best shot three times.

282
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,032
Then afterwards, once you're done,
I'll break your neck.

283
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
- What?
- The neck's quick for you, easy for me.

284
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,797
- Everybody's happy.
- Billy, just go!

285
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,599
That's an option. I'd consider that.

286
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,716
Because quite honestly...

287
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,678
I'm only in this
to fuck your girlfriend.

288
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,356
- That was one.
- Billy, just leave!

289
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,956
Ooh... I think she wants
to be alone with me.

290
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,115
OK. One more go.

291
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,032
- Make it a good one.
- Billy, please...

292
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,397
Billy? That's a good name.

293
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,279
I might use that name
when you're finished with it.

294
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,748
Which is going to be any second now.

295
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,629
OK. Let's make it easy.

296
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,751
Mmm...

297
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,718
Pick a spot. Relax.

298
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,394
Take your time.

299
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,994
You've got the rest of your life.

300
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,914
Oh, well. Thanks for competing,
you've been great.

301
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,675
But it's time to say good night
to the folks at home.

302
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,070
Are you ready Billy?

303
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,470
Here comes God!

304
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,822
Don't kill him!

305
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,316
The truth is...

306
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,277
Are you listening Billy?

307
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,910
The truth is, if I'm being honest,
if I'm not winding you up,

308
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,312
I don't get a lot of pleasure
out of killing children.

309
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,429
But I get enough.

310
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,558
- OK. Do you know anything about lions?
- Lions?

311
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,678
What happens when the head lion gets
killed by a young one?

312
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,798
Do you know what the lionesses do?

313
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,794
They go straight into heat
for the new head of the family.

314
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,155
Hubby's dead,
the cubs have been slaughtered,

315
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,029
and suddenly everybody's singing
"Can You Feel The Love Tonight"

316
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,237
- Do you want to play lions?
- Please, let me go.

317
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,437
No! Come on! Let's play lions!

318
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,365
Don't run.
Not when you're playing lions.

319
00:27:05,485 --> 00:27:08,919
You know what runs? Food runs.

320
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,150
Let me go!

321
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,595
Mmm...

322
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,673
C-c-c-c-c-catch you later.

323
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,708
Fact is Billy, I have a nice side.

324
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,274
But you just missed him.

325
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,316
Billy. What do you think?
Could I be a Billy?

326
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,630
Go on. You were here before,
weren't you?

327
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,750
Yes.

328
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:10,076
Well, I'm surprised
you can remember it.

329
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,754
My liver applied for a transplant.

330
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,514
This time,
let's not give him the chance.

331
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,514
- What do you want?
- What's really bad for hangovers?

332
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,197
Hello.

333
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,470
Your friend left.

334
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,273
Oh, hang on, hang on.

335
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,795
Oh, look at you, Mr Safe Sex.
I'm impressed!

336
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,996
Oh... Shit!

337
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,792
- You've numbered them.
- Yeah.

338
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,315
- Why?
- It's an arrangement.

339
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,789
- Who with?
- Doesn't matter.

340
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,352
I don't even know your name.

341
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,033
Funny you should say that.

342
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,510
Mr Hyde? Mr Hyde, are you in there?

343
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,591
- Is that you?
- No.

344
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,990
Mr Hyde, I saw you go in there.

345
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,152
- Who the fuck is Mr Hyde?
- You are.

346
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,548
Says who?

347
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,434
I hope I didn't catch you
in the middle of someone.

348
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,719
I got you a drink.

349
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,513
I'm Benjamin. Benjamin Lennox. Call
me Ben. Call me whatever you like.

350
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,474
Mr Hyde.

351
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,598
You don't know that's your name?
Oh, come on.

352
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,069
"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde". You read that.

353
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,071
Do I look like a big reader?

354
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,075
Movies then, all those movies.
You're a movie star, you know that?

355
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,509
You've been Spencer Tracy,
Michael Caine, Jack Palance even.

356
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,750
Who else?

357
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,558
John Barrymore.

358
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,836
Barrymore? Was that a silent?

359
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,514
- Yes, sir.
- Who cares about silents?

360
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,189
You're wondering what the hell
I'm talking about.

361
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,574
I'm wondering
about that wee window up there

362
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:58,171
and if you'd fit through it at speed.

363
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,311
This is Christopher.

364
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,437
And in the event of, er...

365
00:31:06,557 --> 00:31:09,554
you attempting any violence
on my person, Mr Hyde,

366
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,915
Christopher is going
to take an attitude.

367
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,799
Believe me when I tell you,
you don't want to be there

368
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,793
when Christopher takes an attitude.

369
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,353
You know what? Don't throw me
out the window, Mr Hyde.

370
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,433
What do you want?

371
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,192
To tell you who you are.

372
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,157
- Who says I want to know?
- I do.

373
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,309
Who are you?

374
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,031
Well, forgive me, Mr Hyde,
and I mean this in a corporate

375
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,239
rather than an individual sense,
but in point of fact,

376
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,436
I'm your owner.

377
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,069
Now, there's two things we can do here.

378
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,629
I can tell you what the hell
I'm talking about,

379
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,872
or you can try and throw Christopher
out that little window.

380
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,270
I don't think Christopher'll fit.

381
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,390
Cheers.

382
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,913
Cheers.

383
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,550
- Don't be an idiot!
- What the hell's going on?!

384
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,471
What time of night do you call this?

385
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,354
Dr Jackman keeps apologising
for his bad temper.

386
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,957
Doesn't realise he's permanently
on four hours sleep and a hangover.

387
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,634
- You should give up on him.
- I'm sorry?

388
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,998
He'd never have hired you
if he'd wanted you. Know why?

389
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,435
Never had a reason to think about it.

390
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,909
If Jackman gets a hard-on,

391
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,355
I'm it.

392
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,156
That's interesting. Because I've always
thought of you as a bit like a hard-on.

393
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,038
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

394
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,953
- Usually disappointing.
- Mm.

395
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,190
Drink all of it.

396
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,836
Katherine?

397
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,475
Katherine?

398
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,590
Katherine?

399
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,157
- Who's there?
- Katherine?

400
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,153
- Dr Jackman?
- Yes.

401
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,197
Sorry, I just... I thought...

402
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,112
Are you all right?

403
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,316
I'm fine, I just...

404
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,596
Dr Jackman?

405
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,797
I woke up during one of his dreams.

406
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,511
Do you want anything?
Can I do anything?

407
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,275
No, no. I should just go back to bed.

408
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,635
Good night, Dr Jackman.

409
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,517
Good night, Dr Jackman.

410
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,068
If you wouldn't mind, thanks.

411
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,879
I've still got that headache.
Should I see a doctor?

412
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,395
- No.
- Damn it! Oh, great.

413
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,798
Yes.

414
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,679
Uh-huh. Thank you.

415
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,399
That detective agency, Callendars,
closed down.

416
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,632
Forwarding address
is just a mail box.

417
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,995
"The Lion King
and other Disney favourites".

418
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,754
That's his, I should put it away.

419
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,708
- He has Disney favourites?
- He likes the songs.

420
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,714
My dark side likes Mary Poppins?
No wonder I was bullied at school.

421
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,838
You said yourself, he's a child.

422
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,629
- Find out where that mail box is.
- Bedfordshire.

423
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,314
Exactly, physically, where.

424
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,189
Hello, sweetie. This is the part
where you're supposed to follow ME.

425
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,432
It would be ever so helpful
if you were awake.

426
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,752
I'm the one without any rich relatives.
Which is a bit of a lie, actually.

427
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,297
I've got an uncle
with a half-exploded liver,

428
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,993
but it's tactless to make plans.

429
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,072
Anyway, I'm in that tangerine car
over there.

430
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,435
Pop your engine on, try to keep up.

431
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,956
If you're careful,
I bet I shan't suspect a thing.

432
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,679
Found him!

433
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,673
Right. Although technically,
he was supposed to find us.

434
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,991
Sorry, Miranda. But he fell asleep
while he was waiting.

435
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,957
He wouldn't make
a very good detective.

436
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,396
No, I don't suppose you would,
would you, Dr Jackman?

437
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,676
Either of you.

438
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,324
At first I thought
it was a kind of make-up job.

439
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:18,118
But the hairline is clearly different.

440
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,833
And also he's at least
two inches taller,

441
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,559
and a little narrower
across the shoulders.

442
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,518
- You missed out "sexier".
- He's a sexy boy, yep.

443
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,797
And if we notice he's sexy,
he must be pushing the envelope.

444
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,793
Isn't that so, dear?

445
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,512
Oh, look. I think Dr Jackman's making
a clever old deduction about us.

446
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,515
- So. Tell us about... yourselves.
- Why?

447
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,468
Because I was paid a very large
amount of money to stop following you.

448
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,756
Which we took, of course.

449
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,674
I didn't care to see what came next
in their repertoire of persuasion.

450
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,558
And also, we need a new kitchen.

451
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,995
And there's the baby, of course.

452
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,071
Oh, and the baby, yeah, of course.

453
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,676
We're pregnant. Well, mostly me.

454
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,719
So, any idea who might be bribing us,
Dr Jackman?

455
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,918
- No.
- Or following you in a black van?

456
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,832
- No.
- Don't you want to find out?

457
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,479
- Of course.
- Then let us help.

458
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,198
- I don't need help.
- You do.

459
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,679
I can handle this on my own.

460
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,709
Oh, I entirely believe you.
But then again, you never are, are you?

461
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,155
On your own.

462
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,197
It started about six months ago.

463
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,715
I'd had symptoms before,
but nothlng really major.

464
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,952
Hair on my forearms out of nowhere,
things like that.

465
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,672
Then I started having blackouts. Except,
of course, they weren't blackouts.

466
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,066
I thought it was a
split personality thing,

467
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:49,153
but there was
an actual physical change.

468
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,393
For a while I thought I was cursed,
or a werewolf, or God knows what.

469
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,199
And what do you think now?

470
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,034
I don't know what to think.

471
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,478
I know how often you go to the library.
I even know what books you get out.

472
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,110
Does your other half know
you're looking for a cure?

473
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,191
I'd rather you didn't tell him.

474
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,033
I won't. What have you found?

475
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,159
There's nothing to find.
My condition is unprecedented.

476
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,550
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

477
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,599
Yes, it has. You've been looking
in the wrong place.

478
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,438
Ah. "Jekyll and Hyde". The comparison
has occurred to me, but this is fiction.

479
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,158
Step into my office!

480
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,916
Dr Henry Jekyll, 1883, Edinburgh.

481
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,437
Amongst his close friends,
one Robert Louis Stevenson.

482
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,798
Jekyll died a few months
before Stevenson's story was published.

483
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,157
- It was a true story?
- At least based on truth.

484
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,791
- He looks like me.
- Exactly like you, yeah.

485
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,438
You said he died.

486
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,674
At the age of 43, not long after
this photograph was taken.

487
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,990
About my age, then.

488
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,958
I think time is becoming a factor.

489
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,219
What did he die of?

490
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:29,919
It's unclear,
even in the story, but he...

491
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,036
died as Hyde.

492
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,636
But my case is different, isn't it?
He drank a potion or something.

493
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,076
He was drugged, that's how he
changed. I never took anything.

494
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,557
Well, maybe you just inherited it.
Like it's in your blood now.

495
00:42:47,677 --> 00:42:49,439
Runs in the family.

496
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,879
Well, that would make sense. Just one
problem. They aren't related.

497
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,634
- But look at them. They must be.
- But they can't be.

498
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,791
Why not?

499
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,793
It's interesting that you have twins.

500
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,112
Do they have similar personalities?
Or are they opposites?

501
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,113
They're very sweet, Dr Jackman.

502
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,035
Don't you worry about them? What,
with your, you know, funny turns?

503
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,510
Dr Jackman has given a great deal
of thought to their protection.

504
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,874
Of course.

505
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,554
Though one wonders how
much protection would be enough.

506
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,474
So why can't Dr Jackman
and Dr Jekyll be related?

507
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,315
Because Dr Jekyll is the last
of the Jekyll line.

508
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,234
There are no brothers and sisters,
no surviving cousins. Nobody.

509
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,837
- Well, that's impossible.
- You're a foundling, aren't you?

510
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,037
Left in a railway station in Belfast,
raised by foster parents.

511
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,158
Nobody really knows
how you got here.

512
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,657
I know you've tried to find out,
so have I.

513
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,393
But there's nothing out there.

514
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,189
Not a footprint, not a kiss.

515
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,716
You arrived in this world
without a trace.

516
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,989
Dr Jekyll, 1883.

517
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,594
Dr Jackman, today.

518
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,277
I think we need to find
out how you got here.

519
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,155
- Where do my children live?
- I'm sorry?

520
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,630
My family, my children.
Where do they live?

521
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,553
- Tell me the address.
- Well, you know the address.

522
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,190
- I'd like to visit them.
- You visit them all the time.

523
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,476
I'd like to visit them now.

524
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,471
Min, could you pop to the house
and get the other file on Dr Jackman?

525
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,632
- The one with the address in it.
- There isn't another file.

526
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,190
Yeah, yeah there is. It's the top shelf
of the sitting room.

527
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,036
- No, I'm sure there isn't.
- Min, please, just do as you're told.

528
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,909
Honestly, it's like I'm your secretary
or something.

529
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,310
Dr Jackman...

530
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:11,237
I think you assume that your other half
is a manifestation of your dark side,

531
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,190
I don't think you're right.
I think he's a child.

532
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,992
Albeit a child with the body
and drives of a fully grown adult.

533
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,199
He has extraordinary
strength and speed.

534
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,797
He has stamina far beyond the norm.

535
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,997
And he's also brand new.

536
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,631
How often in this world does the sun
rise on something completely new?

537
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,119
And how often do we mistake
a miracle for a monster?

538
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,358
I don't think he's a monster.

539
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,318
Or at least, he doesn't have to be.

540
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,069
Do you understand me?

541
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,513
Do you understand me?

542
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,352
You can be anything you want to be...

543
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,115
...Mr Hyde.

544
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,269
Mr Hyde.

545
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,629
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

546
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,995
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

547
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,469
Daddy! Da...

548
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,354
You might have told me
you were just going to...

549
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,751
Bloody hell! What happened to you?

550
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,557
Have you done something?
Have you dyed your hair? You look...

551
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,551
You look...

552
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,035
Oh, my God.

553
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,433
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I thought you were Tom.

554
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,640
You... you look just like him.

555
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,030
Well.

556
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,918
I'm guessing your second name
is Jackman.

557
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,876
I didn't think Tom had any family.

558
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,270
Neither did I.

559
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,833
It's so typical.

560
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,753
Tom never even mentioned
he had a cousin.

561
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,511
- But you know what he's like.
- What's he like?

562
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,671
Well, you know.

563
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,230
Well, he keeps it all inside,
doesn't he?

564
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,236
At times it's like talking to someone
who's lying at the bottom of a pond.

565
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,311
Hmm...

566
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,600
Someone ought to drain that pond,
see what's lurking at the bottom.

567
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,876
Shall we go through?

568
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,316
There's cake. Bring a knife.

569
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,993
What a perfect start to the evening.

570
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,589
Oh, God!

571
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,392
- Hello?
<i>- Well?</i>

572
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,279
I spoke to Hyde, but didn't get
anywhere much.

573
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,115
<i>Hyde is an animal. You wouldn't.</i>
<i>What next?</i>

574
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,430
I've got a few thoughts,
kicking them around.

575
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,034
<i> When can we bring him in?</i>
<i>How soon?</i>

576
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,158
We can't just pull him off the streets.
This is England.

577
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,912
It's the third world with rights.

578
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,799
<i> Tom Jackman</i>
<i>won't have rights for long.</i>

579
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,745
It's a nice thought,
Ms Utterson, but I don't see...

580
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:01,910
<i>He can't control Hyde. Not forever.</i>

581
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,833
<i>Eventually, Hyde will do something.</i>
<i>Something that Jackman cannot forgive.</i>

582
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,833
<i>Eventually he will know</i>
<i>that he cannot contain him.</i>

583
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,076
<i>And then WE begin.</i>

584
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,190
- Daddy!
- Harry!

585
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,477
- Daddy!
- Eddie! Hello, boys!

586
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,590
Hi.

587
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,306
How are you? I'm the surprise, eh?
Me coming?

588
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,399
Nice to see you.

589
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,473
Nice to see you. Oh, boys, boys.

590
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,432
Tom?

591
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,875
I didn't hear the car.

592
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,031
Are you all right?

593
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,475
I, um...

594
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,392
Is Billy still here?

595
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,790
Billy?

596
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,032
- Your cousin Billy.
- My cousin?

597
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,512
He said you knew he was coming round.
Is he still here?

598
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,717
- No, no, he's gone.
- Oh.

599
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,842
He had the kids up
playing half the night.

600
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,532
This whole house
looks like a bomb hit it.

601
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,548
- I'll put some coffee on.
- Come on.

602
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,110
You can help. And you.

603
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,518
Serious charmer, by the way.
You ought to watch it. He's...

604
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,671
Well, he's like you.

605
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,035
Only alive.

606
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,240
<i>Wish I could see your face, Daddy.</i>

607
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,755
<i>Got you that time, didn't I?</i>

608
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,472
<i>Be sensible. What makes you think</i>
<i>I would ever harm my family?</i>

609
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,760
<i>Ooh, and here's something interesting.</i>
<i>I found out my name!</i>

610
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,995
<i>Someone told me my name. Isn't that</i>
<i>good, Daddy? My name is Jackman.</i>

611
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,673
<i>Your name's Jackman</i> too.

612
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,957
<i>But I think you're not going
to be around much longer.</i>

613
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,982
<i>Time's up, old man.</i>

614
00:53:34,102 --> 00:53:37,114
<i>It's time to move over</i>
<i>and let the next guy have a go.

615
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,636
<i>World's changing,
got to change with it.</i>

616
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,271
<i>Love your wife, by the way.</i>
<i>Do you know about lions, Daddy?</i>

617
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,752
<i>Do you know what lionesses do</i>
<i>when there's a new head of the family?</i>

618
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,911
<i>Good night...</i>

619
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,275
<i>Dr Jackman.</i>

620
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,995
Hello?

621
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,989
Dr Jackman? Dr Jackman, is that you?

622
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,154
<i>- Dr Jackman, please say that's you.</i>
- It's me.

623
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,349
Are your family OK? Listen, we couldn't
stop him, he locked us in the cellar.

624
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,229
He said he wanted to see his family.
Are they OK?

625
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,597
- They're not his family.
- Dr Jackman?

626
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,112
They're not... his... family!

627
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,714
Dr Jackman, are you all right?

628
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,035
They're not your family!

629
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,478
They're not your family!

630
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,189
- They're not your family!
- Tom!

631
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,316
Are you all right?

632
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,950
Yeah. I'll be down in a minute.
It's all right.

633
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,758
What's wrong?

634
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,833
Nothing, I'm all right.
I'll be down in a minute.

635
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,236
Mum! Mum!

636
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,554
Listen to me.

637
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,188
We have had an agreement.

638
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,476
A truce.

639
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,916
And it has worked.
We have survived.

640
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,437
But understand me. There is a line
I will not allow you to cross.

641
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,238
If you...

642
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,189
...ever come here again...

643
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,271
...if you set foot
near my family again...

644
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,589
...no agreement, no truce, it's war.

645
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,354
Do you understand me?

646
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,799
Come to my family again,
and you and I are at war!

647
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,276
As long as the lights and cameras
are on, you're safe.

648
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,510
Lights out...

649
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,079
you're dinner.

650
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,959
Hyde. I can't believe
he's calling himself Hyde now.

651
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,352
For God's sake, wipe your nose!

652
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,193
He's capable of anything,
if he can get away with it.

653
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,749
I know what he's like, Dr Jackman,
I've met him.

654
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,959
<i>- Alone at last.</i>
- Don't play these games. Not with me!

655
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,997
All respect, we're running out of time.

656
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,558
I'm not in love with Dr Jackman.

657
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,955
You've heard of good cop, bad cop?
This is the movie!

658
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,350
Ever killed anyone Benjamin?

659
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,478
- Not personally.
- You're missing out.

660
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,630
Welcome to the company, Mary Poppins.
