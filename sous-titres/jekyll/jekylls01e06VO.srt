1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,076
Mr Carver.

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,356
The word is now.

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,315
The word is now.

4
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,155
- Yes?
- Got a job for you. Big one.

5
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,550
You available?

6
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
<i>Yes.</i>

7
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,313
He's a mercenary?

8
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,994
More like THE mercenary.

9
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,395
Nice ringtone.

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,753
It saved
a friend of mine's life once.

11
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
How?

12
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,836
It made me laugh.

13
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,038
Drink?

14
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,589
- What's this?
- It's a cheque.

15
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,274
There's no figure.

16
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,516
Use your imagination.

17
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,359
- It goes down seven floors.
- Six.

18
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,159
- There are seven on the plans.
- Six that concern you.

19
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,880
Six floors
you can do what you like with.

20
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,712
We've got more money than God.

21
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,599
We've got weapons tech
that would give a nun a hard-on.

22
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,433
Welcome to the world
of you want, you got.

23
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,033
What's on the seventh floor?

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,668
This place was built
to hide a secret.

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,799
- Now we need a fortress.
- More than a fortress. A trap.

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,314
Dr Tom Jackman.

27
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,913
What about him?

28
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,353
- I think his neck's broken.
- Tell him thanks.

29
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,431
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, it's me, Benjamin.</i>

30
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,830
The word is... go.

31
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,197
The word is go. Get the men ready.
We're going to London.

32
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,397
- We're bringing him in.
- Sir!

33
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,558
Mr Lennox?

34
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,599
I'm sorry, Benjamin can't
come to the phone right now.

35
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,108
The word is now, Mr Carver.

36
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,918
Dr Jackman?

37
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,548
Mr Hyde?

38
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,358
Mr Hyde,
I've waited a long time to do this.

39
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,073
Best you got?

40
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,549
'Cause if that's the best
you've got, Mr Syme,

41
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,792
I'll tell you what the word is.

42
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,513
The word...

43
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,632
...is hide!

44
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,791
Your children must be starving.
I know what boys are like.

45
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,599
Are you hungry, boys?
Would you like some breakfast?

46
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,911
There's brekkie inside,
bacon and everything. Come.

47
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,640
You really think I'd trust you
to feed my children?

48
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,669
You have a point.
What you don't have is a choice.

49
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,873
You have beautiful boys, Mrs Jackman,
and they're perfectly safe with us.

50
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,553
Mrs Jackman...

51
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,029
Mrs Hyde, for now.

52
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,351
Just so you remember. Just so you
keep in mind what's coming.

53
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,158
I'm Mrs Hyde.

54
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,993
And, honey...

55
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,355
just you wait
till my husband gets home.

56
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,910
In the meantime, I'd offer you
breakfast, but the truth is...

57
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,275
we don't have any.

58
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,594
- No!
- They're fine, Mrs Jackman.

59
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,318
Completely safe in these things.

60
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,189
Get them out of there,
for God's sake! They're children!

61
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,952
Get them out of there!

62
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,556
Mrs Jackman, we don't want
the equipment damaged.

63
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,790
Mummy, I can't see!
I can't see!

64
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,155
- Eddie! No!
- Mummy, I can't see!

65
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,995
Harry! No! No...

66
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,755
There you go, dear.
Give that a minute.

67
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,753
- Please...
- Sit her down.

68
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,789
There. That's better, isn't it?

69
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:03,995
Claire.

70
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,989
It's all right, it's me.

71
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,958
Don't be afraid. He's gone.

72
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,078
Do you hear me, Alice?

73
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,595
Do you hear me, Alice?

74
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,115
Do you hear me?

75
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,599
Claire?

76
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Oh...

77
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,396
Don't look so scared.

78
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,074
I'm not one of them.

79
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,516
They don't even know
I'm here, so shhh.

80
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,911
Then what are you doing here?
How did you get in?

81
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,229
Who are you?

82
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,269
You're every bit as beautiful as your
pictures. He's a lucky boy, my son.

83
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,237
Tom's mother is dead.

84
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,312
Then I must be a ghost.

85
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Where am I?

86
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,269
At the beginning.
This is Klein & Utterson, mark one.

87
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,591
There are a lot of secrets here
and they keep them underground.

88
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,149
Buried deep below this building.

89
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,992
What secrets?

90
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,559
Do you want to know the truth?

91
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,190
About Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
and how they came back from the dead?

92
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,271
I just want my boys.

93
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,034
- That's all I want.
- It's the same thing.

94
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,316
Then of course I want to know.

95
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Good.

96
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,036
Claire?

97
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,072
Just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

98
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,038
They've unpacked everything. Er...

99
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,079
For anything else, there's a phone.
Strictly internal, I'm afraid.

100
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,719
I want my children.

101
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,519
- They're perfectly safe.
- In boxes?

102
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,639
Safest place in the world,
those boxes.

103
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,119
You should get back to sleep.

104
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,875
They gave you a bit of a hefty dose.
Be in your bloodstream for a while.

105
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,112
He's coming, Peter. My husband.

106
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,113
And do you know what?

107
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,350
He'll be coming for you first.

108
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,397
Goodnight, Mrs Jackman.

109
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,749
She has a point.
I've seen what he can do.

110
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,310
He's remarkable, yes, but he's alone.

111
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,675
No one to turn to,
no one he can trust.

112
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,630
<i>Everything he knew has betrayed him.</i>
<i>No friends, no home, no hope. No one.</i>

113
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,439
<i>Not even Tom Jackman,</i>
<i>not even Hyde himself's a threat</i>

114
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,273
<i>when they're completely alone.</i>

115
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

116
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,354
It's the next stage
of human evolution.

117
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,671
- Hello, Dr Jackman.
- Cup of tea?

118
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,552
What are you doing here?
Those people can track you anywhere.

119
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,598
Oh, I know. Right now they're
tracking us all over Dartmoor.

120
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,514
They just called in another team,
sent us straight into a bog.

121
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,240
This is Gavin Hardcastle.

122
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,393
One of the men who tried to shoot us
last night and bury us in a ditch.

123
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,155
- I hit him with a bit of wood.
- Clever old Gavin (!)

124
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,357
He's got us cornered
and he's calling in the troops.

125
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,432
<i> Hardcastle,</i>
<i>we've not got a visual yet. Over.</i>

126
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,353
<i>Hardcastle, are you receiving me?</i>

127
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,238
<i>Please restate</i>
<i>your last position. Over.</i>

128
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,552
So, whose turn to choose
a map reference for Mr Hardcastle?

129
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,358
<i>Please confirm your last location.</i>

130
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,150
<i>We all seem to be standing</i>
<i>in the middle of a duck pond. Over.</i>

131
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,752
They've taken your family,
haven't they?

132
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,034
Yes.

133
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,158
What we need is the current location
for your wife and children.

134
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,232
What we have is a man in his shorts
in the know.

135
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,552
It's a start, Dr Jackman.
We're not beaten yet.

136
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,769
I... I...

137
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,310
I don't know what to say.

138
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,596
Can I vote very strongly for nothing?

139
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,197
- None of you needed to. I didn't...
- Cup of tea?

140
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,557
Yes, thanks.
We've got the good one?

141
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,995
- There's only one tea.
- Yes, but the one I like.

142
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,518
We've only ever had one tea.
I always give you the same.

143
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,516
Oh... I'll just...

144
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,272
Kettle.

145
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,839
She really likes you, Dr Jackman.

146
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,231
She prefers you to Mr Sexy Pants,
so there's no accounting for taste.

147
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,712
Mr Sexy Pants can hear you. We're
doing double shifts. He's awake.

148
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,030
What did he say?

149
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,278
It's a boy.

150
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:05,830
I said it was.
I did, didn't I? I said.

151
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,390
I take it Mr Sexy Pants has made up
his mind whose side he's on?

152
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
For now.

153
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,116
Right, so we need to find
your wife and family.

154
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,874
Knock yourself out.

155
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,839
I know what Klein & Utterson
can do to people.

156
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,230
Do you really think
I'll sell them out to you?

157
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
No.

158
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,868
Not to me.

159
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,350
Where's Hardcastle?

160
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,751
Probably Glasgow by now.
And still running.

161
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,832
- Got what you needed, though?
- Yes.

162
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,634
What's wrong with your hand?

163
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,588
Nothing. That's what's so odd.

164
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,831
Hyde's got a cut across his palm.
He got it late last night.

165
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,389
Hasn't healed properly.

166
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,870
But I don't have it,
and I've never had it.

167
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,555
It's like we're not sharing
the damage any more.

168
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,915
I didn't know
you could be injured separately.

169
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,355
Hasn't happened till now.

170
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,795
Maybe he thinks
I can't cope any more.

171
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,837
Can you?

172
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,468
I'd better.

173
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,108
Your suitcase is packed in the hall.

174
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,477
And the letter you're writing
is addressed to me.

175
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,791
You're leaving now, aren't you?

176
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,234
When I get back, assuming I get back,

177
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,312
I won't be needing this place
any more.

178
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,959
Or me.

179
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,559
I'll be gone in a minute or two.

180
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,599
You should probably get back to bed,
get some sleep.

181
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,116
Anything you need before you leave?

182
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,475
No, I'll be fine, thanks.

183
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
OK.

184
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,908
Goodnight, Miss Reimer.

185
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,433
Good luck, Dr Jackman.

186
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Tom!

187
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,958
Tom...

188
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,918
Oh, Tom, what have they done to you?

189
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,231
Tom, can you hear me?

190
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,029
It's OK. It's OK, I'm here...

191
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,511
Oh, baby...

192
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,516
Oh, God!

193
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,278
It's all right. They're harmless.
You're perfectly safe.

194
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,476
What are they?

195
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,872
Syme told you they attempted
to clone Dr Jekyll, didn't he?

196
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,350
Did he tell you how far they got,
or how many times they tried?

197
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,718
This is where Klein & Utterson
made its fortune. These rooms.

198
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,236
Drugs created from the antibodies
in these poor creatures.

199
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,229
- You said you were Tom's mother.
- Yes.

200
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,834
You're not, are you?

201
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,479
You just work here.

202
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,108
This is where Tom comes from.

203
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,953
I don't work here.
I'm not even supposed to be here.

204
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,917
What does that mean?

205
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,231
- Tom is not a clone.
- Then where did Tom come from?

206
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,312
From me. I'm his mother.
He's a Jekyll.

207
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,311
A direct descendant
of the original man.

208
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,436
Dr Jekyll didn't have
any descendants.

209
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,229
- Dr Jekyll died a virgin.
- You're not making sense.

210
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,789
You know how this works
better than anyone.

211
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,315
If Dr Jekyll is a virgin,
then what is Mr Hyde?

212
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,917
Edinburgh in the 1860s?
No birth control and Hyde rampant?

213
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,959
The world is full of Hyde's bastard
descendants, teeming with them.

214
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,509
Split personalities, Siamese twins.

215
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,389
Tom Jackman
is just one of many descendants.

216
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,472
But he is the only perfect one.

217
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,996
The only perfect throwback,
a chance in a million,

218
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,392
a perfect genetic duplicate,
generations later.

219
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,630
We tracked him yet? Any word?

220
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,870
Look at that.

221
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,036
Birds flying at night.

222
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,510
Looks like they're flying
away from something, like a fire.

223
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Freeman?

224
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,074
- Is there a fire?
- Sorry, what?

225
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,310
Is there a fire? Has anyone checked?

226
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,711
Um... I don't know. Don't think so,
no. We would have heard.

227
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,872
Then what's in the forest?
Why are they... flying away?

228
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,678
Why are they leaving?

229
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,434
"Run if you want to live."

230
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,312
Here, look.

231
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,233
It doesn't matter what I type. Look.

232
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,035
People think Hyde is rage...

233
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,358
...or hate, or greed, or lust.

234
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,795
But Hyde is far worse.

235
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,473
What is he?

236
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,873
What was the first day you knew
you could kill anyone if you had to?

237
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,030
The day I first held my children.

238
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,156
It's our oldest, deadliest impulse.

239
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,074
The need to protect our own at the
expense of any other living thing.

240
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,597
And we give that impulse
such a nice name, don't we?

241
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Hyde...

242
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,074
is love.

243
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,356
And love is a psychopath.

244
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,476
Dr Jekyll loved.

245
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,030
In 1864, he fell in love
with a serving girl.

246
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,352
That's her.

247
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,877
Alice Cameron.
She's standing at his shoulder.

248
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,510
They found themselves a new Dr
Jekyll, but it was Hyde they wanted.

249
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,877
To summon Hyde,
you need Alice Cameron.

250
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,909
They needed to bring back the only
woman Dr Jekyll has ever loved.

251
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,393
Tom Jackman isn't a clone, Claire.

252
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,635
You are.

253
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
No.

254
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
No.

255
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,515
What the hell's happening
with these lights?

256
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,956
- I just got a text.
- What?

257
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,758
I'm real! I have a life!

258
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,229
Of course you're real.
You're as real as anyone is.

259
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,313
But you were a baby in these rooms.
You came from here.

260
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,392
Grown from the cells
of Alice Cameron.

261
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,473
You've dreamed of this place,
haven't you? You always dreamt of it.

262
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,110
- No, I have a mother and a father!
- Who love you very much.

263
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,352
They should.
They were chosen for you.

264
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,830
What's happening?

265
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,434
Run if you want to live.

266
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,512
Run if you want to live.

267
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,036
- What's happening?
- Run if you want to live...

268
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,395
Jesus Christ.

269
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,836
That's not possible.

270
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,117
Did somebody do this?
Is this a joke?

271
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,955
He's in our heads.
He's messing with our heads.

272
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,238
Look, the real words are still here,
it's... it's like he's transmitting.

273
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,231
It's bleeding into everything.

274
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,992
That's impossible.

275
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,948
Yeah? You want to tell that
to the guy who switched off London?

276
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,635
- Mr Freeman, you stay here.
- Mr Syme, no, I won't.

277
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,315
- You get one warning!
- Mr Syme, the devil is coming!

278
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,270
The most powerful thing alive on the
planet is coming, right to our door!

279
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,876
And we've got his missus
locked up upstairs.

280
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,989
Do you seriously think anyone
in this room is frightened of you?

281
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,193
Sit down.

282
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,437
Give that to me. Give it to me!

283
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,353
You sit down!

284
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,115
You're not serious?

285
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,631
Jesus Christ.

286
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,236
Sorry about that,
it just... just, er... just went off.

287
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,789
Bloody hell, that hurts!

288
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,556
Sorry, everyone. Er... is everyone OK?
Just a stupid mistake, that's all.

289
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,280
Er... lf everyone just, er...
If you'd just stay calm...

290
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,637
Er... just stay calm and sit down.
You'II... I think...

291
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,509
Please, just... just sit.
If you just stay where you...

292
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:29,474
What's happening to the lights?

293
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,359
- Is the power going?
- It's your husband.

294
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,159
Love has arrived.

295
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,869
It's everywhere.

296
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,593
Oh, my God!

297
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,236
It's them! It's my boys.

298
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,914
Help me!

299
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Oh, God!

300
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,712
Help me!

301
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,950
Your men. Will they stay?

302
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,556
I'll round up those who will.
I'll kill those who won't.

303
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,998
Yeah, well, try and get that
the right way round, won't you?

304
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,798
Christ.

305
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,400
Most of my staff
seem to have taken the night off.

306
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,951
Very impressive.
How does it feel to be half a god?

307
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,917
I'm the other half.

308
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,514
Sounds a bit Denis Thatcher.

309
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Yeah.

310
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,471
Drink?

311
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,473
You look bloody awful.

312
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,108
I'm dying.

313
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,830
To old times?

314
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,560
To twenty years of lies?

315
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,710
To friendship.

316
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,069
So. Where do you want to start?

317
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,357
How long has this been going on?

318
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,796
Oh, since the beginning.

319
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,715
It was my job to befriend you.
That's why we met.

320
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,419
There wasn't a day I betrayed you.
It was the deal from the beginning.

321
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:42,056
Your defence is that it was all lies,
not just most of it?

322
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:44,913
I was never lying. We WERE friends.

323
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,640
- How can you say that?
- Because it's true.

324
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,678
I was your friend. I am.
As it happens, I'm also...

325
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,989
My enemy.

326
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,754
Oh, for God's sake, Tom, you know me.

327
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,673
I don't like anyone.

328
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,469
Except for my daughters. I mean,
I don't talk to anyone except you.

329
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,349
- You're the only friend I ever had.
- And look what you did.

330
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,646
Oh, for God's sake, Tom, grow up.
No one's who you think they are.

331
00:31:08,782 --> 00:31:10,829
- Haven't you learned that yet?
- Learning it now!

332
00:31:10,949 --> 00:31:12,671
People have different sides.

333
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,870
Sorry, just remembered
who I'm talking to. That's...

334
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,836
Is Hyde going to kill me?

335
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,991
I don't know.

336
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,398
Is there a way for me to... to?

337
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,996
Tell me how you...

338
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,231
...justify what you've done.

339
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,109
Explain to me how you can be forgiven
for what you did.

340
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,430
Is he listening?

341
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Yes.

342
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,117
- He's a psychopath, for God's sake!
- Aren't we all?

343
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,876
OK, OK. Um...

344
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,953
There is such a thing
as the greater good.

345
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,153
Hyde is a marvel.

346
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,118
The next stage in human evolution,
no exaggeration.

347
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,829
With Hyde, we could cure
every illness known to man.

348
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,037
He's... he's a blueprint
for a better kind of human being.

349
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,398
To have Hyde back
is worth almost anything.

350
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,630
And one day people will understand.

351
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,598
One day people will thank us
for what we're doing now.

352
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,797
Even you, even your family,
even Claire will thank us.

353
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,352
There have been sacrifices along
the way. There are always sacrifices.

354
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,829
You don't start out that way,
but it's inevitable.

355
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,991
It's the way things are.

356
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,596
Advancement comes at a cost.

357
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,479
Sometimes at a cost to your friends.

358
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,716
What does that count against the good
that can be done? The greater good.

359
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,872
No. I can justify myself, Tom,
because I believe...

360
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,032
I do, I absolutely firmly believe

361
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,317
there is such a thing
as the greater good.

362
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Now!

363
00:33:28,177 --> 00:33:29,756
This would kill a normal man.

364
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,755
Be Tom again. Let it kill him.
You don't have to share the damage!

365
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,117
Actually, let him die. He's dying
anyway, he's ageing to death.

366
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,635
That means
genetically, you're separating.

367
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,155
You don't have to
physically share the damage.

368
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,278
Become Tom again. Let Tom die!

369
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Oh, God.

370
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,029
Shut it off.

371
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,634
Shut the gas off.

372
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,756
Extractor fans. Now!

373
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,908
What happened?

374
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,799
<i>You said it wouldn't kill him.</i>
<i>It wasn't supposed to!</i>

375
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,155
<i>He's dead, for God's sake!</i>
<i>He's bloody dead!</i>

376
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,756
<i>We've killed him! What's the point</i>
<i>in any of this if he's dead?</i>

377
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,071
The gas is at non-toxic levels now,
Mr Syme.

378
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,435
Keep your mask on,
but it should be safe.

379
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,639
- Keep your mask on, until we can...
- Oh, shut up!

380
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,833
Strange, his...

381
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
his lungs are expanded
like they're full of air.

382
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,555
- Do you think he's faking?
- <i>Not unless he can stop his heart!</i>

383
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,551
He can.

384
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,998
Mr Syme, that's not air in his lungs.

385
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,598
Tom. Tom...

386
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,804
Tom, Tom, please don't let him...
Tom...

387
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,191
Old friend.

388
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,113
We can stop him.

389
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,716
What for? He's going
exactly where we want him to.

390
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Tom?

391
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Tom!

392
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,589
Claire!

393
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,991
- Oh, Christ! What's this? What now?
- Where are the boys?

394
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,630
In there. They're in those boxes
like you were. I can't get in.

395
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,109
Wait. Try this.

396
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,033
- Where did you get that?
- Just get the boys out of there.

397
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,191
Dr Jackman.

398
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,239
We have your family. We have you.

399
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,834
It is over.

400
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,798
Excuse me. Talking to my wife.

401
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,071
Claire, we need him again.

402
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,629
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

403
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,950
It's not OK. He's not OK.

404
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,839
He's you. You're him.

405
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,195
And it's OK. It's always been OK.

406
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,590
I mean, what the hell?

407
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,038
You bag yourself a handsome doctor,
there's bound to be a bit of baggage.

408
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,634
Dr Jackman!

409
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,031
You'll be kind enough
to turn around now.

410
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,749
- Don't dim the lights this time.
- What?

411
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,516
I want to see it happen.
I want to see you change.

412
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Why?

413
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,236
Been over a hundred years, you and I.
Did you know that?

414
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,470
- Yeah.
- Well, then...

415
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,679
don't you think it's about time
I saw my husband naked?

416
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,680
Just for you.

417
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,833
No one else sees this. Not ever.

418
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,155
Hello, toots.

419
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,913
Hello, sugar.

420
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,631
Look at you, Mrs Jackman.
Look at you.

421
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,588
- Wasted on him, you are.
- Well, I have been, many times.

422
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,876
Ooh, let's make that a date.

423
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,429
It's a date.

424
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,068
But not for you.

425
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,797
I might peek.

426
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,315
- I might let you.
- Ooh, baby...

427
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,914
- Dr Jackman...
- Talking to my wife!

428
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,557
Mr Hyde!

429
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,119
Nothing has changed.
This is over. We have your family.

430
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,232
You have six guys with guns.

431
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,915
Make it interesting. Give me names,
I'll do 'em in alphabetical order.

432
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Move!

433
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,871
Mrs Jackman, get the kids.
We're leaving.

434
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,032
Talking at the back! Something
you want to share with the class

435
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,399
- Tom, I don't know how to open them!
- Mummy?

436
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,835
- Harry.
- Mummy!

437
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,198
Eddie... Oh, God. Eddie, it's OK.
I'm here. Mummy's here.

438
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,591
- Mummy, we can't see.
- I'm right here, baby.

439
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,958
- Mummy! We can't see!
- Mummy, please let me out!

440
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,832
What's happening?

441
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,399
What's happening?

442
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,916
We have cut the power
to the life supports, Mr Hyde.

443
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,277
No! Please, you can't! No!

444
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,797
If you want to know how long
your children have to live, Mr Hyde,

445
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,439
hold your breath.

446
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,910
Switch the power back on,

447
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,117
right now.

448
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,909
- Change back to Dr Jackman.
- Why would I do that?

449
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,594
Because we can take Dr Jackman.

450
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,069
Then you'd have my family.

451
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,593
So will you.

452
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,796
You're not having my family!

453
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,635
Tom, they're suffocating!
They can't breathe!

454
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,997
It's me you want.

455
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,673
They're dying!

456
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,548
Now there's an idea.

457
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,470
Coming down there, boys.

458
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,189
Just coming to turn the power on.
Don't want any trouble.

459
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,478
- Stop, or we fire!
- Hold your fire. Nobody fires.

460
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,790
- I'm coming, boys...
- Stop or we fire!

461
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,154
Got a problem with that?

462
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,993
- Nobody fire! Nobody...
- Didn't think so.

463
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,195
Stop, stop!
Stop shooting!

464
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,550
Look at that. Look what you did.

465
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,399
This was clean on this morning!

466
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,638
You want to be careful with those.
You could put someone's eye out.

467
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,513
What? You think that's enough?

468
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,477
For me?

469
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,395
I'm Mr Hyde!
Show a little respect!

470
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,679
Colonel Hart,
when he's done, freeze the body.

471
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,230
I'm sure we can find
something we can use.

472
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,354
Your family will be safe to leave.

473
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,192
Someone's...

474
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,274
...going to kill you for that, Colonel.

475
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,112
Then...

476
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,869
...I'll die.

477
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,792
Here it comes.

478
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Ooh...

479
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,195
Tickles.

480
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
Tom!

481
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,109
Mrs Jackman!

482
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,078
Your children.

483
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,639
Oh, God!

484
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,473
I'm sorry, Tom.

485
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,074
Tom, I'm so sorry...

486
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
Oh...

487
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,159
Are you all right?
Let me look at you.

488
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,993
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Mummy.

489
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,276
How do you feel? Do you feel OK?

490
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
Were you scared?

491
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,071
You must have been so scared.

492
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,515
It was scary
when we couldn't breathe.

493
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,752
Of course it was.
Of course it was scary.

494
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,469
But it was boring most of the time.

495
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,757
Why did they put us
in the boxes, Mummy?

496
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,432
I don't know.

497
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,919
They were stupid men.

498
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,709
Stupid, stupid men.
They even put you in the wrong boxes.

499
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,394
No, we swapped.

500
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,993
What do you mean, you swapped?

501
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,879
They didn't know, but we did.
We swapped.

502
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,315
You mean
you got out of the caskets? How?

503
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,190
We didn't get out.
We just got so bored. We swapped.

504
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,318
Sorry, Mummy.

505
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,550
Where's Daddy?

506
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,755
Come here. Come and give Mummy
a great big hug.

507
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,638
But Daddy...

508
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,392
He can't...

509
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,120
He's not...

510
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,236
- Daddy.
- I'm sorry, Eddie.

511
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,994
Eddie, baby, I'm so sorry.

512
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,596
Daddy, why is Mummy crying?

513
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,111
He didn't share the damage.

514
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,396
He let me go.

515
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,438
Mummy. Here I come!

516
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,032
- Oh! Mwa!
- Be the horsie.

517
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,716
Let's go over here.

518
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,552
# You can't catch me

519
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,234
# Oh, yes, I can

520
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,470
You all right?

521
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,356
He's gone.

522
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,431
He's really gone.

523
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,751
I didn't think
it would feel like this. I thought...

524
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,748
I thought it would feel good.

525
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,515
Did you know he could do that?
Take the bullets for you?

526
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,513
It wasn't for me, Claire.

527
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,679
It wasn't for me.

528
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,194
It's over, though.

529
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,032
I promise you.

530
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,112
You know that, don't you?

531
00:49:58,722 --> 00:49:59,722
Shh.

532
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,960
How did you find me?

533
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,554
I know a good detective.

534
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,710
I imagine you have questions.

535
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,155
I am not a direct descendant
of Henry Jekyll.

536
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,834
This is my father.

537
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,878
There's no connection
with the Jekyll family line,

538
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,996
bastard or otherwise.

539
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,639
Not possible.

540
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,510
I am not a direct descendant of Henry
Jekyll, so where do I come from?

541
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,393
- How are your wife and children?
- They're very well, thank you.

542
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,391
And you?

543
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,439
I still have three bullets in me, but
I seem to have healed around them.

544
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,955
The legacy of Mr Hyde.

545
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,031
The legacy?

546
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,839
You think it's over, don't you?

547
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,629
You don't even know how it began.
Not really.

548
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,990
And it's never over, Tom.
Never, ever.

549
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,596
I need to know where I come from.

550
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,399
I need the truth.

551
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,394
I need to know why you left me
at a railway station.

552
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,870
Why you had to protect yourself by...

553
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,074
...rejecting me.

554
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,950
Your father was a good man,
a very good man.

555
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,237
- I miss him.
- But he wasn't a Jekyll.

556
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,278
A good man until the day he died.

557
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,237
What did he die of?
What killed him?

558
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,393
Hm? Oh, I expect I did. I must check.

559
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,076
- What?
- You still don't understand, do you?

560
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,674
What do you think
I've been fighting all this time?

561
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,910
You should know.

562
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,517
You didn't get the curse
of the Jekylls from your father.

563
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,149
You got it from me.

564
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,310
Hello, darling.
How smart you're looking.

565
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,713
What's wrong, sweetie?
Don't you have a kiss for Mommy?

566
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,758
Come on, sweetie, kiss for Mommy.

567
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,789
Kiss for Mommy.

568
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,518
A kiss for Mommy...
