1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,910
My name is michael westen.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,170
I used to be a spy until...

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,140
We got a burn notice.
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,810
When you're burned,you've
got nothing --

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,410
no cash,no credit,no job history.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,590
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,870
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,030
You do whatever work comes your way.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,590
You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,780
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
-should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,350
An old friend who's
informing on you to the fbi...

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,060
you know spies --a bunch
of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:31,920
Family,too...

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,010
is that your mom again?

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,270
If you're desperate.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,630
Someone needs your help.

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,420
Bottom
line --

18
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,600
until you figure out who burned
you,you're not going anywhere.

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,180
Whoa,mike.Easy. That'll
kill you,you know?

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,470
Yeah,no kidding.

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,460
No,the bucket of trans fatyou got there.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,760
Did veronica call you?

23
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,190
'Cause if you're takingher side
on this wholecholesterol thing,

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,370
it's gonna put a serious
strainon our friendship.

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,170
No,you can bingein peace,sam.

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah,well,thanks,but that's
not the only reasonwhy I'm here.

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,790
I got a job offer.

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,900
Here we go.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,070
Pete,one of my
buddiesfrom the seal teams.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,740
He's got a lady who's gotsome problems,

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,610
so she called him'cause
he's in special forces.

32
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,810
But he's got this
blood-pressurething,so he called me.

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,770
What do you say?

34
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,390
My plate's a littlefull,sam.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,490
What,you mean with this
wholephilip cowan thing?

36
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,910
Mike,you're doingarmed
sit-ups. I'm worried about you.

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,420
I thought this might
getyour mind off it.

38
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,200
Cowan burned me,cowan sent someone
to kill me,now he dropped off grid.

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,760
I need my mind focusedon this.

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,930
All right,fair enough. Mind if I
run with this?The money's not bad.

41
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,450
- No.Knock yourself out.
- All right.

42
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,090
Bayshore Park Fountain 1:00

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,540
What's that?

44
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,680
Wow,it looks like your
buddycowan finally made contact.

45
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,130
You want me to come with,back you up?

46
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,830
Sure. Bring your bucket of fat.

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,910
I'll bringmy chicken,too.

48
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,220
Oh,yeah.

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,980
Yeah,sam?

50
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,910
Well,it's the witching hour.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,140
Looks like your buddydidn't show.

52
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,270
He wouldn'tjust not show up.

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,470
He's watching.

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,580
You think?

55
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,580
Where do you thinkhe would be?

56
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,730
I know where I'd be.

57
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,070
Hollywood Bread BUILDING

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,290

64
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,250
What do you think he wants,mike?

65
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,230
He wants to meet.

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,290
So,why not just meet?

67
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,340
He doesn't trust me.

68
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,890
Fair enough. I don't trust him.

69
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,350
The first step in
dealing with a covert op

70
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,010
is establishing a way to
communicate privately -- a code.

71
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,850
Could be a key-encrypted cypher,

72
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,700
but really all you need is a
base of knowledge that you share.

73
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,240
He knows my entire career --
falsified a good bit of it.

74
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,340
It shouldn't be too difficult for
him to figure out a way to talk to me.

75
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,820
Ah,the mating dance of the spy.

76
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,710
It's a wonder spies ever get close
enough to kill each other,isn't it?

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,500
Ohh,got to go.

78
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,610
Veronica has you on a
pretty tight leash,huh?

79
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,080
Hardy har. I'm meeting
with a prospective client.

80
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,080
Mike,buddy,you call me
if you need anything.

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,930
Fiona,just keep doing
whatever it is you do.

82
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,380
Thanks for meeting me.

83
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,400
I-I thought there were two of you.

84
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,910
Yeah,usually. But my partner's on
something else right now.But it's fine.

85
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,950
GILLAN THE CLIENT

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,060
So,um,pete says you're
having some trouble.

87
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm a supervisor at sxg.

88
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,300
We build planes,satellites,weapons
systems -- government contracts.

89
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,070
I've been working there
10 years. It's a good job.

90
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,710
Are you okay?

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,360
- I...
- look,it's okay.

92
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,200
I'm like a doctor or a lawyer.

93
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,460
Well,not a lawyer.

94
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,820
But the point is,you can
tell me whatever you want --

95
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,230
just between the two of us.

96
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,150
My friend melissa
-- we work together.

97
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,570
She was having an affair.

98
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,160
Her husband,kent,is abusive,controlling.

99
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,450
The only time she has alone is at
the office,but to sign in guests,

100
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,090
you have to have
security clearance,so...

101
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,550
so you did her a favor.

102
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,360
Her boyfriend stole files...

103
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,490
took photos of them
together in the building.

104
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm the one who signed him in.

105
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,720
I could lose my clearance,my
job,go to jail,even.

106
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,270
He's blackmailing us.

107
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,690
What does this guy want from you?

108
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,190
I have to sign for packages,and
melissa smuggles them out.

109
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,760
Any idea what's in these packages?

110
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,020
They're from a subsidiary
of sxg in turkey.

111
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,130
I checked one.

112
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,230
It's --
it's drugs.

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,490
I don't know what kind.

114
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,280
Well,that part of the
world,it's probably heroin.

115
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,130
There's another one coming in this week.

116
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,130
I just want to get out.

117
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll see what I can do.

118
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,230
I-I don't want help.

119
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,750
MELISSA THE OTHER CLIENT

120
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,550
I-I want to keep my secret. I have to.

121
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,750
I don't want to get anybody in
trouble here,and I'm not here to judge.

122
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,750
I've made plenty of mistakes
myself. God only knows.

123
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,060
Listen. I was lonely.

124
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,520
And dave was --
I made a mistake.

125
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,290
I want to put it behind me.

126
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,230
Okay
-- dave.

127
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,250
Gillian was saying you
met this dave at a bar?

128
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,680
Which one?

129
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,330
I don't know. I-I don't remember.

130
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,440
My husband's home!

131
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,840
Come on,please. You have to go!

132
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,710
Okay. You know how to get ahold of me.

133
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,200
Don't worry about it.

134
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,100
We'll just fill in the
blanks ourselves,I guess.

135
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,540
Now,when was the first time melissa
ever talked about her new friend dave?

136
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,180
Mom? Got here as fast as
I could.What's the problem?

137
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,500
I got a phone
call,michael. I was scared.

138
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,470
Phone call? What kind of phone call?

139
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,380
It was for you --some man. He wouldn't
leave his nameor his number -- nothing.

140
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,310
All he said was,van buren
avenue. And then he hangs up!

141
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,580
What's that supposed to mean?

142
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,840
Oh,it's probablyjust a friend.

143
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,810
That isn't how
friendsbehave,michael. All right?

144
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,550
The way he said it scared me.

145
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,780
Michael!

146
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,040
Ma? I lost my key!

147
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,110
Worried it wasyour friend?

148
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,980
Hey,bro.

149
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,310
You look tired.

150
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,960
Hey,nate. You look clean.

151
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,320
You shaved the ferretoff your face.

152
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,610
So,what couldn'twait,mom? I had to
walk out on a pretty big investor.

153
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,640
What do you meanby investor?

154
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,270
Yeah,a buddy of mine,he's got a process
that recyclestitanium golf clubs.

155
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,440
It's gonna totally revolutionizethe
golf club -- forget it.

156
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,660
Mom,why did youcall nate?

157
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,330
I called your
brother,too,because I was scared!

158
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,410
What's going on here?

159
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,380
A strange man phoned here.

160
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,220
Michael won't tell me anythingabout
him because it's alla big mystery.

161
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,980
Mom,it's just betterif
I don't get into it.

162
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,500
Trust me.I know what I'm doing.

163
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,510
There's nothingto worry about.

164
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,170
This man who called,he
just wants to talk.

165
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,260
Well,you can't talk to us?

166
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,210
In 20 years,michael,I
havenever asked any questions.

167
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,270
But this is my home.

168
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,170
It's not like it's some waroff in some
country that I've never even heard of.

169
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,110
This --this
is your family.

170
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,280
Oh,I know.

171
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,260
Okay,you can tell me.
Seriously,what's going on here?

172
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,450
Nate,I need youto watch
mom. It's just a precaution.

173
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,560
I need you to lay lowfor a while.

174
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,270
Keep a low profile.

175
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,670
Don't leave the house.
You can do that,right?

176
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,310
Yeah.

177
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,470
Safety's off.

178
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,190
Of course,you know,I will
betaking time off work.

179
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,520
And I'll need to get some,you know,supplies
in casethings get dicey around here.

180
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,460
Recycled titanium,huh?

181
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,600
What is that --a
name of a horse?

182
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,020
Oh,fiona.

183
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,370
Hey,how you doing?

184
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,840
Thanks for coming.

185
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,600
Boy,you look great. Sit down.

186
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,190
So,to what do I owethe
pleasure of this invitation?

187
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,880
Am I to be yournew drinking buddy?

188
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,290
Uh Yeah.

189
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,750
It's this job that I'm on.

190
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,920
I need some backup,and mike's mind is
pretty muchon this whole cowan business.

191
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,240
- So I thought
- - of me!

192
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,990
I thought of you.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,300
Yes,that's what I thought.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,120
What's the job?

195
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,030
Well,it's a blackmail thing,and
one of the victimsgot spooked,

196
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,900
so she's not sayingwhere
she met the bad guy.

197
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,080
But I think I got enoughto
put it all together.

198
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,050
She met him out at a bar,and
I have an approximate date.

199
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,670
That's not much to go on.

200
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,900
I got a guy who's pullingher
credit-card statement.

201
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,120
Find the charge,find
the bar,find the guy.

202
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,580
And you need a wingman.

203
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,020
Damn straight,skippy.

204
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,230
My fee is $500 up front,expenses
and an hourly as we go.

205
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,490
You never charge mike.

206
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,390
Oh,I expect other thingsfrom michael.

207
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,270
Yeah,fi.

208
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,620
Sam just hired mefor a job.

209
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,530
I thought he was goingto be ill.

210
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,020
It was so much fun,michael. I
wish you could havebeen there.

211
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,370
Cowan sent me a message.

212
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,890
I'm searching the cafÈsof
south beach for a cutout.

213
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,940
Don't you thinkhe'll come himself?

214
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,520
He seems eagerto meet you.

215
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,800
I doubt it. He'll send someone.

216
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,300
I did something similarin
belgrade years ago.

217
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,460
Long story.

218
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,710
Have fun.

219
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,250
There's a reason I never
hadthe patience to be a spy.

220
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,930
All right.

221
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,280
The truly paranoid don't
go to meetings themselves.

222
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,340
They use
a cutout --

223
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,710
someone unrelated to them,hired to show
a pre-arranged sign and deliver a message.

224
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,350
The sign is something
innocuous,but hard to miss.

225
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,220
My favorite is the tourist
guide from madison,wisconsin.

226
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,230
No one will look at it twice,but
unless I'm in the midwest,

227
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,830
I know they're waiting
for michael westen.

228
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,960
You herefor the envelope?

229
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,660
Who are you?

230
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,490
I ain't nobody,man.

231
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,630
Look,some guy gives me100 bucks,he says,

232
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
give thisto the first guy
that comes byand bugs me.

233
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,410
You are bugging me.

234
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,010
LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR SPECIAL DAY-

235
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,210
Thursday 4pm alone

236
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,770
TERRORIST KILLED IN BUDAPEST

237
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,510
So,this is where
melissamet her boyfriend?

238
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,800
Seems a little unlikely,but she
definitely paidfor drinks here.

239
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,300
How do you wantto handle this?

240
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,940
Well,I think the ballsare in your court.

241
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,940
Oh,great.

242
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,370
What the hell am I paying youfor,anyway?

243
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,810
Hey,how you doing?

244
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,700
Um,I'm looking for a friendof mine.

245
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,780
I just want to seeif
you can help me out.

246
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,250
Handsome guy right there.

247
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,340
Hey. How you guys doing?

248
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,780
How 'bout those dolphins,huh?

249
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,680
So,how did we do?

250
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,140
Well,my new friendshave
informed me that the mysterious

251
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,490
dave is actually a
hustlernamed ray wagoner.

252
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,630
So he was just stepping upto the exciting
world of blackmailand smack dealing.

253
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,330
Yeah.

254
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,280
I guess he's brokena few hearts
and lifteda few wallets here.

255
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,480
But I have his address.

256
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,570
You know,sam,I have to say
You were captivatingover there.

257
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,580
Well,hey,a free drinkis
a free drink,baby.

258
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,740
They like the shirt.

259
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,820
RAY WAGONER HUSTLER

260
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,100
That's not a very nice wayto say hello.

261
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,590
Let's try that again. I'm sam.

262
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,470
Now you say,hi,I'm ray.

263
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,260
What do you want?

264
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,010
We want you to find a new
wayto import your heroin.

265
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,250
I seriously...

266
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,080
don't know whatyou're talking about.

267
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,450
Gillian walsh.

268
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,550
Melissa fontenot.

269
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,440
You're gonnaleave them alone.

270
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,910
Her?

271
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,630
I never messed with her.

272
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,110
We went on a couple dates. All she ever wanted
to dois take pictures in some building --

273
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,170
100 bucks a shot.

274
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,880
She took the pictures?

275
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,190
Yeah,and her husband paid.

276
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,720
Some guy,flattop
--weird.

277
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,650
I didn't ask questions.

278
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,590
Melissa lied to us.

279
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,530
- I knew it.
- You did not.

280
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,130
I suspected.

281
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,340
Suspected doesn't count.

282
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,150
We got to talk to mike.

283
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,930
If she was setting me up,why
would she be in the photos?

284
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,700
Why not just stealthe files?

285
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,090
Well,she's the only onewho
could get the packages out.

286
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,250
If melissa wasn't beingblackmailed,you'd
know that she wasin on it.

287
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,930
Oh,my god.

288
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,810
I-I can't believeI fell for this.

289
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,380
Don't be so hardon yourself.
Double blackmail'sa classic.

290
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,460
It's as old as the pyramids,you know.

291
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,800
You pose as a fellow targetof
your own blackmail scheme,

292
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,200
that way you'll always
knowwhat the victims are up to.

293
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,830
Pros use itall the time.

294
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,760
So,what do we do?

295
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,850
We got to get near kent.

296
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,420
If we can get evidencelinking him to
the heroin,we can do our ownblackmail --

297
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,310
get you off the hook,start
fighting fire with fire.

298
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,370
But melissa knowsI hired you.

299
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,540
We'll have to makeher think
that the investigation'sstalled.

300
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,280
Plus,we're gonna getsome more help
-- a little relieffrom the bullpen.

301
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,570
Do whatever you needto do.

302
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,580
I'll -- I'll
pay more.

303
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,040
I'll dip into my savings.

304
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,520
Don't worry aboutthe money,gillian.

305
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,760
We got you covered.

306
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,970
Hey,mike.

307
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,250
She running again?

308
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,560
More or less.

309
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,310
How's your dancewith cowan going?

310
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,360
I don't know.

311
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,490
It's hard to trust someoneunder
these circumstances.

312
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,050
But I don't have a choice,do I?

313
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,680
Yeah,that part of the
job,I don't miss it.

314
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,780
You guys set a meet yet?

315
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,330
I think so.

316
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,440
He sent an articleabout
a job I did in budapest.

317
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,190
I met a contact thereon
the steps of city hall.

318
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,190
I assume that's wherehe wants to meet.

319
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,740
Cowan gets the gold
starfor clever,doesn't he?

320
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,840
Or he just likes watching
merun around in this heat.

321
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,860
Want me to come with you?

322
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,250
Thanks,but I think he wants
a littlealone time with me.

323
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,320
Yeah,hey,uh,listen,mike.

324
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,430
Um,this new clientof
mine -- gillian.

325
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,610
She's in kind ofa tough spot.

326
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,000
I was just giving hera ride home,

327
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:28,790
and,well,there she
is,uh,in my car right there.

328
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,240
Shameless,sam,even for you.

329
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,840
Look,mike,I know you're busy,but
I need a fresh faceon this.

330
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,160
It's a tiny littlebit part.

331
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,750
You'd be posingas a green
beret -- like falling off a log.

332
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,560
What's the job?

333
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,990
Well,it turns out thatmelissa's husband,

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,330
kent,is running all this
smugglingdown at sxg.

335
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,630
It's a double-blackmailthing.

336
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,750
I got to tell you
--I saw it coming.

337
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,210
- Really?
- Yeah.

338
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,940
What I need you to dois
make friends with kent. Okay?

339
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,120
Just encourage himto
expand his business.

340
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,610
Open his horizonsa little bit.

341
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,890
So we threatento tell his bosses
and get him killedunless he lays off?

342
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,670
Exactly.

343
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,750
See,you're way ahead of me.

344
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,810
Call that a littlebit part?

345
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,320
Well,look,mike. Come on.

346
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,050
I'd do it for you.

347
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,650
Fine.

348
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,840
Oh,it's sweet. It's
black with a charger.

349
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,770
I haven't seen it before.

350
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,160
Hold on for a minute.

351
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,220
I'll call you back.

352
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,510
Nice phone. What
is that -- the razr?

353
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,370
Want to get off my truck?

354
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,170
HEAT THE HUSBAND

355
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,800
Sure. I noticed the sticker.Marines?

356
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,430
Used to be.

357
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,670
Rod bucksey,green
beret. I got out in '97.

358
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,980
Congratulations.

359
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,210
Get outof my way. I'm in a hurry.

360
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,010
Sure,kent.

361
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,600
I just want to talka
little business first.

362
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,430
How'd you know my name?

363
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,010
I know morethan your name,kent.

364
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,340
I know you got a sweetsmuggling
racket over at that sxg facility.

365
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,540
Packages leave the
buildingcompletely unchecked.

366
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,470
Unchecked is somethingI'm
very interested in.

367
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,640
You don't know what
you're talking about.

368
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,150
I do.

369
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,620
My service buddiesover in istanbul
clued me into what's going on.

370
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,180
What's going on is
noneof your damn business.

371
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,320
I don't care who your friends are.

372
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,910
Calm down. We're just talking here.

373
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,650
Oh,no,no. You show upout of the
blue,you know about meand my operation.

374
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,760
- We are not just talking.
- Sure,we are.

375
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,850
And I'm telling you I'm willingto
pay top dollar for your hook at sxg.

376
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,490
Look,I've been where
you are,taking orders.

377
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,310
Everyone else sits backwhile
you do the heavy lifting.

378
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,580
I can change all that.

379
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,010
It's like they teach
usin combat training.

380
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,880
You look for the
opportunity,you take your shot.

381
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,660
Listen.

382
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,120
- The guys I work for - -
don't ever have to knowabout it.

383
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,740
We're not steppingon anybody's toes.

384
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,750
And nobody besidesyour bank account
will ever knowthe difference.

385
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,850
I have to think it over.

386
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,000
You take your time. You think it over.

387
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,330
You call mewhen you're
ready. We'll talk terms.

388
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,850
Semper fi.

389
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,330
Fi,give me that little
tweezerup on the dash,will you?

390
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,300
That's okay. I got it.Thanks.

391
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,660
You about done there?

392
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,880
He usually goes out for a
runbetween 7:00 and 8:00.

393
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,120
Yeah,well,I'm hoping for 7:00.

394
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,960
As much fun as it is
hanging outwith you,

395
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,160
this little stakeout'scosting
me a fortune.

396
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,050
Can't you at leastcut your
hourly? I bought the snacks.

397
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,030
I'll reimburse youfor the snacks.

398
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,790
Oh,yeah. There we are.

399
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,010
Okay,let's make this count.

400
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,130
Oh,hey.

401
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,230
I'm glad I caught you.

402
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,590
What are you doing here? I-I told you.

403
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
- If my husbandsees you here
- - I understand.I'm sorry.

404
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,790
I know that you wantedto be
discreet,so I waited for himto leave.

405
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,310
I just thoughtyou'd want the update.

406
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,080
What --did you
find something?

407
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,820
No.

408
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,570
I mean,if you don't
give meany leads on dave,

409
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,140
there's not muchI can do.

410
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,310
You got anything?

411
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,370
No. I told you.

412
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,480
I-I don't know anything.

413
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,350
If you want to bug a
cellphone wirelessly,

414
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,740
you'll need a lot of
specialized scanning equipment

415
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,040
and a computer to deal
with the encryption.

416
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,800
I prefer a hands-on approach.

417
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,880
You just bug a duplicate phone

418
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,680
and swap out the sim card so the
new phone has the same number.

419
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,250
Your target will talk all day,certain
that no one could possibly be listening.

420
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,780
I bumped into this guy when I
was on my wayout to the store.

421
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,890
I'm telling you -- he's just
some half-ass P.I.Or something.

422
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,870
He's not helpinggillian anymore.

423
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,720
Good,good. I don't
needanyone sniffing around.

424
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,990
I got the meeting tomorrow.

425
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Don't you think you shouldtalk to our
connection about the green beret guy?

426
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,220
Hell,no!

427
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,270
Hell,no,are you crazy?

428
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,110
Yeah,buddy?

429
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,630
Yeah,you're good to go.

430
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,190
Kent's keeping our
littlemeeting a secret.

431
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,280
I think he's terrifiedof his supplier.

432
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,350
I don't even think he
knowsthe guy's name.

433
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,560
I'll back you up. Let's
get this chump on tape.

434
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,910
Yeah,about that -- how much
are you paying meon this job?

435
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,090
Because my
ratesare a little --

436
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,220
ohh,I got to go.

437
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,360
Mom?

438
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,620
- What are youdoing here?
- You gave your brothera gun?

439
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,300
I'm sorry,mike. I tried
to stop her,but she --

440
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,900
michael,what is going on?

441
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,130
- Nate,I told youto keep her at home!
- You know how she is!

442
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,760
What are you doing?

443
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,540
Stop it! Both of you!Stop it!

444
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,290
May I have a moment?

445
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,450
Michael,what is this about?

446
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,190
It's complicated.

447
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,530
I've had enough of,it's
complicated,it's a secret,

448
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,440
it's for my own safety.

449
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,510
Enough.

450
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,550
What do you thinkI do,mom?

451
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,360
- You thinkI'm playing games here?
- No.No,I don'T.

452
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,530
We're your family,michael.

453
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,420
I'm askingthat you trust us.

454
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,480
And when would I have
learnedhow to do that?

455
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,540
Well,sometimes trust
issomething that you work on.

456
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,140
You were gonefor a long time,michael,and
you were the onewho left us.

457
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,220
I left you?

458
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,400
Mom,I...

459
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,450
and you stillgot the car.

460
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,900
What?

461
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,920
I have a meetingto get to,so
if we couldwrap this up...

462
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,680
let's go,nate.

463
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,820
He's got a meeting.

464
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,950
Don't forget your gun.

465
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,340
Mom!

466
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,360
Get yourselfsome furniture,michael.

467
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,680
I didn't raise you to livein a
warehouse and eat off a bench.

468
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,100
You ready to get rich?

469
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,840
Let's talk about that.

470
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,770
Before we go any further,we
need to go overa few details.

471
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,770
First shipment comes innext week.

472
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,420
Your cut is 10 granda shipment.

473
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,360
Oh,damn it.

474
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,320
How do you likethose details?

475
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,800
I need to know who told
you about me --specifically.

476
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,390
- It doesn't really matter who
- - it does matter...to me...

477
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,350
to the men I work for.

478
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,960
They'd kill meif they found out I
was running productfor someone else,

479
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,800
found out you heard
about me --loose end.

480
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,040
That's the point.They
don't know. This is yours.

481
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,170
Not another scoreyou
got to cut them in on.

482
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,220
Having a gun to your
head is all about timing,

483
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,600
finding the right
moment to make your move.

484
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,890
Who told you about me?

485
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,510
Take it easy.

486
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,350
Take it easy.

487
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,330
Best to snap the trigger finger first.

488
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,710
After that,it's mostly downhill.

489
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,380
Oh,man,I just fixed that!

490
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,260
A minute after your dealwent
sour,kent and melissawere on the phone.

491
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,450
Son of a bitch had backup!

492
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,790
Someone put three slugsin my engine!

493
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,790
How much does he know?

494
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,110
Too much!

495
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,800
We need to shut this down.

496
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,380
We can't -- not yet. There's
another packagein lockup.

497
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,050
Have her get it out.

498
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,480
And I'll clean up this mess.

499
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,740
I can't let them knowwe got sloppy.

500
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,070
Kent's running scared.

501
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,760
It makes things complicatedfor us.

502
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,040
Was he talking about me
whenhe said,clean up this mess?

503
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,230
Well,that's whatour little dance at
the construction sitewas all about.

504
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Mike was their firstcleanup project.

505
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,470
I am so sorry.

506
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,760
- Kent - - busted
my windshield.

507
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,020
I'll just repair it... again.

508
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,550
He tried to kill you.

509
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,200
Happens all the time.
Don't worry about it.

510
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,370
Especially with the
part-timehelp on easy jobs.

511
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,880
The problem is,we don't have
enough evidence to use against him.

512
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,200
So,what do I do now?

513
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,430
You could run.

514
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,890
Kent might not find you.

515
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,770
But you'd have to stayon
the move for 5,10 years.

516
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,890
Plus,he still has allthe blackmail
materials,so he can stilltake you down.

517
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,540
But if you help melissa
getthat package out of sxg...

518
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,620
you want me to do it again?

519
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,750
I know you're afraid.

520
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,960
But I'm gonna be outsidethe whole time.

521
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,820
Once kent has that heroin,we
can use it to bring him down.

522
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,540
You need to trust us.

523
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,710
Okay.

524
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,460
Oh,come on.

525
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,540
Aw,crap.

526
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,970
Goddamn cellphone shielding.

527
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,780
Whether you're protecting a client...

528
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,920
monitoring electronic surveillance...

529
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,610
Hello?

530
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,970
Can you getthe package today?

531
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,650
I told you. Gillian's signing for it.

532
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,060
We can get it tonight.

533
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,360
Or meeting the man who burned
you,you've got to be patient.

534
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,650
In the real world,covert ops doesn't
involve many car chases or gunfights.

535
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,750
Mostly it's just hurry up
and wait -- not too exciting.

536
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,400
But you wait and you
watch and you stay alert,

537
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,610
because,at any minute,the
job can get way too exciting.

538
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,480
I just wanted you to
knowwe're good to go.

539
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,670
We're getting it out today.

540
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,450
And the woman?

541
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,300
I-I set her car this
morning. It's done.

542
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,070
It's not doneuntil it's done.

543
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,690
Get a visual,then tell me it's done.

544
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,900
Can I call you back,fi?

545
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,690
We got a problem.

546
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,220
Kent's gonna hit gilliantonight.

547
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,590
- Call sam.
- I can'T.

548
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,620
There's no cell reception.

549
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,710
All right,I'm on my way.

550
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,210
It's always tough to
reschedule a covert meeting.

551
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,760
You can't exactly leave a note,

552
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:20,660
so you have to leave behind just enough
to get them where you want them to go.

553
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,530
Working late tonight?

554
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,830
Yeah,you know engineers.

555
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,260
Got to get this crapdown the
machine shop,get it fixed.

556
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,940
Have to have it all doneby tomorrow.

557
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,820
So my husband's hereto
take me down to bal harbour.

558
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,280
I hear you. Good luck with it.

559
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,010
Thanks!

560
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,120
Can't we just go home?
I don't want to watch.

561
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,140
Then don'T.

562
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,250
- Miss me?
- Oh,yeah.

563
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,450
Kent wired gillian's carto blow.

564
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,870
Jesus.

565
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,100
Well,that's whyhe's watching,then
-- the white van,10:00.

566
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,510
We have to warn herwhen she comes out.

567
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,120
Think kent's just gonna
siton the sidelines for that?

568
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,830
Oh,great,sam.

569
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,280
So we sit here,we do
nothing,and she winds up dead.

570
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,250
That's not what I meant!

571
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,430
Guys,guys! Which one's her car?

572
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,430
It's the black jeepover there.

573
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,470
Keep the guard busy. I'm
borrowing your floor mat.

574
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,230
- Hey,good evening.How you doing?
- Evening.

575
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,440
We have a reservationfor 8:00 P.M.

576
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,370
A reservation?

577
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,720
This is the chart house,right?

578
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,580
The chart house?

579
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,610
Yeah,it's a restaurant.

580
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,750
- No.
- What?No?

581
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,180
I told you not to get offthe freeway!

582
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,200
Oh,hush,muffin.

583
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,880
This guy'sjust having some fun with us.

584
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,920
Chuck finley
--party of two.

585
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,440
Oh,hey,hey! Come on.

586
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,000
A little service here,you know?
I'm trying to eat.I'm hungry.

587
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,810
This is notthe chart house.

588
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,430
- This is notthe chart house?
- There's noreservations here.

589
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,150
I need to clarifysomething here.

590
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,050
There are two basic
ways to blow up a car --

591
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,250
use the gasoline in the tank
or provide your own explosive.

592
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,200
They are two techniques that
use opposite ends of the car

593
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,400
and are disarmed differently.

594
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,810
Some people prefer the gas tank.

595
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,960
It tends to look more like an
accident,but it's less reliable.

596
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,570
Others prefer plastic explosive on
the battery wired to the ignition.

597
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,840
Come on.

598
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,110
Come on.

599
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,170
- I thought you said you rigged her car!
- I did!

600
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,910
There must be something
wrongwith the detonator.

601
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,990
- They're gonna be pissed,kent!
- Don't you thinkI know that?

602
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,060
they really triedto kill me?

603
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,520
I'm afraid so.

604
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,740
Was that... under my car?

605
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,900
Well,yeah. It's a car bomb.

606
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,410
This may be kind of hardto get your
head around,but this is a good thing.

607
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,500
They're scared of you.

608
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,810
That's why they put this
toynext to your engine.

609
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,040
Scared of me?

610
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,150
They're afraidof a lot of people --
the police,the people they work for.

611
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,670
And now they've got a big box
of heroin theyhave to get rid of.

612
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,090
So,what should I do now?

613
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,140
Take a vacation.

614
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,180
By the time you come back,we'll
have your problemssorted out.

615
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,410
New hampshire's nice this time of year.

616
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,820
Vermont.

617
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,990
And what will you do?

618
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,100
Kent and melissa are
goingto have a little,uh,

619
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,350
well-documented
transactiongoing on -- a buy.

620
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
We're going to takethat
evidence,go to kent,

621
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,080
get him to shut downhis little
operation,and have him back off.

622
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:40,780
Thank you.

623
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,090
I-I can't believeyou did this for me.

624
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,110
We haven't done it yet.

625
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,520
Why don't you go makeyour arrangements?

626
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,900
- This deal -- the timing. -
You got this wholecowan thing.

627
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,860
It's good. We're covered.Don't sweat it.

628
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,660
You sure?

629
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,940
We're just taking pictures.
You need the backup.

630
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,440
No,I'm doing this alone.

631
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,760
Okay,I get it. Good luck.

632
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,970
Don't look at me. I don't get it.

633
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,740
I don't get why you'reso
dead set on getting back in.

634
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,600
Why go back to workfor the people
who've put you throughall this?

635
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,230
I want to clear my name.

636
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,700
I want to knowwho did this to me.

637
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,790
I spent my entire career doing
somethingI believed in,fi --

638
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,880
something important.

639
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,230
You're doing something
importanthere,michael.

640
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,990
Think about it.

641
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,470
Next time you are riskingyour life
to talk to this philip cowanfella,

642
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,920
you think about it.

643
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,570
Fi.

644
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,060
All right,that's where
kent'slittle meet is going down.

645
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,810
I'm gonna take the car
downthere on the opposite side,

646
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,860
use the telephoto lens onthe
camera so we get something.

647
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,250
Okay,no rush.

648
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,720
I'm on the clock.

649
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,430
I'm gonna work on my tan.

650
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,800
I want a flat ratenext time.

651
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,850
You sureyou told him 3:00?

652
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,540
Yes.

653
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,870
When you're communicating in
code,sometimes you just have to hope

654
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,060
that whoever you're talking to is smart
enough to figure out what you're saying.

655
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,970
Use a code that's too
simple,and it will get broken.

656
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,480
Use a code that's too complex,and
you're just talking to yourself.

657
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,320
No greeting card. I'm hurt.

658
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,710
Glad you made it.

659
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,870
Yeah,something came up.
Sorry I missed our meeting.

660
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,770
St.John's at
3:16 --clever boy.

661
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,960
Are you ready to meet?

662
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,480
Are you here?

663
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,880
W-we'll meet on my turf. Thanks.

664
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,500
I'm back where you gotmy first message.

665
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,920
Come alone,or I leave.

666
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,380
Unarmed,or I leave,in
10 minutes,or I leave.

667
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,860
It's over a mile away!

668
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,310
Yeah,well,I guess you better run.

669
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,800
Please calm down.

670
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,180
They were supposed to
be here20 minutes ago.

671
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,410
Something's wrong.

672
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,210
I'm sure they'reon their way.

673
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,670
Maybe the boss was right.
Maybe we're compromised.

674
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,150
Kent,you told him?

675
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,640
Melissa,yes!

676
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,870
These are very seriouspeople,okay?

677
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,620
They would kill us if theythought anything
was wrong. It's better to hear itfrom us.

678
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,680
It's better to hear itfrom me.

679
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,060
What are you doing now?

680
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm calling the buyer.
He's got five minutes.

681
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,700
Come on. Get in the car.

682
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,690
- What?
- Come on!

683
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,170
- What?What is it?
- Go.Just get in the car.

684
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,780
Hurry up!

685
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,280
Son of A...

686
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,870
out of the car!

687
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,630
Whoa,hey,hey.

688
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,130
Move it! Let's go!

689
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,150
Michael!

690
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,790
Hello again!

691
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,360
I always find my hand shakesa
little after a run like that.

692
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,810
Any advantage I can
get --well,you know.

693
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,470
Can't be too careful.

694
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,570
I'm not here to kill you.

695
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,950
Really?

696
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,270
I slept with a gununder my pillow every
night since I heard you werehunting for me.

697
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,630
To hear you say that
now,it's almost disappointing.

698
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,600
I want to knowwhy you burned me.

699
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,410
You think I burned you?

700
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,990
I know you did.

701
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,940
Why? Because you read it on a file?

702
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,240
Wow,you really unraveled
thatlittle mystery,didn't you?

703
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,970
You thinkthis is about me?

704
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,130
One man watched
you,targeted you,burned you?

705
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,900
Throws your accounts?

706
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,880
Cut off your travel?

707
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,080
One guy did all that,and then he decided
to cometo miami and explain himself.

708
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,380
You triedto have me killed.

709
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,840
Nothing personal.

710
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,850
You'd do the samein my position.

711
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,630
Michael,you keep
thinkingthat this is about me.

712
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,620
Banish that thought.

713
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,780
You're on the edgeof something
much,much biggerthan us,my friend.

714
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,550
People I work for,they
have plans for you.

715
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,600
People you work for?

716
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,130
Powerful,dangerous people.

717
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,520
And,man,are they upset with me.

718
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,840
I misread you,michael.

719
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,160
Didn't expect you to buckquite so much.

720
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,250
You're makingeveryone nervous.

721
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:10,790
Hey,bro.

722
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,890
Nate,get in your truck and meet me at the
cornerof pembroke and fletcher.Leave now.

723
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,630
- Mike,what?
- Nate!

724
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,640
Get in your truckright
now and meet me there.

725
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,730
Wait. What's going on?

726
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,780
Truth?

727
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,670
I have no idea.

728
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,400
This cowan guy tell youanything or what?

729
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,080
He was about to.

730
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,040
You think that's whyhe got shot?

731
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,420
Maybe.

732
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,120
I don't know. Maybe
they thoughtI'd kill him.

733
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,140
It was a setup. The
copswere there way too quick.

734
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,760
Somebody called thembefore
the shot was fired.

735
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,660
This is deep,bro.

736
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,200
Nate,I want youto go pick up mom.

737
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,830
It's about time you twogot out of town.

738
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,220
Right.

739
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,550
Thank you,nate.

740
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,610
I just,you know...

741
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,710
no,don't talk like that.
You're not good at it.

742
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,600
But the next time I ask youfor
20 bucks for gas,remember this.

743
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,540
Actually,I think I'll go with you.

744
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,040
- Michael?
- Fi,can I call you back?

745
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,490
Michael?

746
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,850
Kent and melissa's dealwent bad.

747
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,650
They're dead.

748
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,360
- And sam is --
- whoa,whoa,whoa. What,what?

749
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,380
Slow down,fi. Slow down.

750
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,150
Kent's boss is cleaning house,I think.

751
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,740
They were watching us.

752
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,030
They took sam.

753
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,210
- Who did?
- I don't know!

754
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,960
Whoever they are,they're damn good.

755
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,190
Where are you,fi?

756
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,460
I can't talk.

757
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,850
I'm in the warehouse districtby
the first street bridge.

758
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,700
They're coming!

759
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,820
You drop me offand you go. Got it?

760
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,040
It's too late. You need me.

761
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,430
Nate,sam and fi are
dealingwith heroin smugglers.

762
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,690
They already killedtwo people.

763
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,860
Yeah. Sounds like it'sa
bad time for me to bail.

764
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,580
No,it's the perfect timefor you to bail.

765
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,480
Look,man,something happens to you,and
mom is on my ass forever,all right?

766
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,120
And not to getinto your business,but
it seems likeyou could use the help.

767
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,900
Thank you.

768
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,830
You're welcome.

769
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,580
Family first,right?

770
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,300
She's in there somewhere?

771
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,020
I mean,she could be inany
one of those buildings,man.

772
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,870
She'll let us knowwhere she is.

773
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,440
In any operation,communicating
silently is often essential --

774
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,570
chalk marks,an unusual
arrangement of objects --

775
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,820
anything that stands out
from the background will do --

776
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,700
a piece of cloth on a window.

777
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,440
There. She's there.

778
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,740
Great. What are we gonna doabout it?

779
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,050
Those guys are all overlooking for her.

780
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,040
I'm gonna need to drive.

781
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,270
A warehouse door is going to be
reinforced,but the walls aren'T.

782
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,270
Hold on.

783
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:42,340
And the areas under the windows
don't have load-bearing beams.

784
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,950
- Fi?
- Through there.

785
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,380
You cover that door. You
don't let anyone through.

786
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,120
Jeez.

787
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,520
Hurry up.

788
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,030
I love machine shops.

789
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,700
They have polyesterthermoset resin.

790
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,720
They should have
some --ah,here we go.

791
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,300
Benzoyl
peroxide --yummy.

792
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,660
Guys,you wantto hurry it up,please?

793
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,440
Hurry up. I got them pinned down.

794
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,270
A good trap doesn't scare people.

795
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,310
It makes them curious.

796
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,260
A speeding truck makes people scatter.

797
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:08,160
A slow-moving truck,on the other hand,makes
people want to take a closer look.

798
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,900
Take cover! Go,go!

799
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,110
that was insane.

800
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,840
Those peoplewere heroin smugglers?

801
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,120
Sam had a job.

802
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,070
Things didn't go as planned.

803
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,260
You're out of your mind.

804
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,510
What happened with cowan?

805
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,720
Yeah,things didn't goas
planned with that,either.

806
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,030
He's dead,fi.

807
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,580
They shot himwhile we were talking.

808
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,630
Did you get anything?

809
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,820
A little.

810
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:00,380
He said the peoplehe works for --
they have plans for me.

811
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,030
Yeah,well,that's intriguing.

812
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,000
What the helldoes it mean?

813
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,400
Without knowing who
they are,hard to say.

814
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,410
They might wantinformation.

815
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,730
They might have a jobthey want me to do.

816
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,910
I mean,they shot himfor a reason.

817
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,390
It better bea good reason.

818
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,660
This is your place?

819
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:21,400
Yeah.

820
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,490
Well,it's a foreclosure.

821
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,890
You know,I guess they ranout
of money in the remodel.

822
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,830
Usually,I can hang outabout
three months in a place like this.

823
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,610
You know,you blew up my truck.

824
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,880
Anyone knowyou're here?

825
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:32,950
No,no.

826
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,910
I got a couple clientsin
my golf-club business.

827
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,570
They weren't real happy with the
way their investmentworked out,so...

828
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,940
nate,I need you to go
get momand bring her here.

829
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,060
Seriously?

830
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,270
Come on,man. Once she starts
smoking,we'renever gonna get the smell out.

831
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,620
The people who shot cowan
areprobably watching her place.

832
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,910
When you go get her,bring her here.

833
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,260
Make sureyou're not followed.

834
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,100
I know how to lose a tail,all right?

835
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,120
I hate to break it to you,but spies
aren't the only peoplewith enemies.

836
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,880
Tell me what happenedwith sam.

837
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,300
That was pretty good.

838
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,150
But you gotto follow through.

839
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,420
Okay,now we'regetting somewhere.

840
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,460
Yeah,that was pretty painful.

841
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,980
How was that for you?

842
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,310
You were taking pictures.

843
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,030
Who you work for?

844
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,200
Me?

845
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,610
I don't work for anyone.

846
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:30,600
I go out there
sometimesjust to -- to think.

847
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,080
Take pictures of the birds
and the local fauna,you know?

848
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,590
You're getting goodat that.

849
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,120
The guy that camefor the woman
-- he knew what he was doing.

850
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,130
Maybe D.E.A.?

851
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,400
D.E.A. Comes with a team.

852
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,070
D.E.A. Brings cops.

853
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,140
D.E.A. Does notblow up a truck.

854
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,910
You know,buddy,if I were you,I'd
watch itwith the stupid comments,

855
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:57,240
'cause,you know,your boss just killed
a lot of his own guysoutside,so...

856
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,250
HARRICH HEROIN IMPORTER

857
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,450
Let me guess -- trying to
buytime for your team. Is that it?

858
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,790
Team?

859
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,440
Uh,there's --there's
no team around here.

860
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,730
I work alone,in a cubicle.

861
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,860
- You work alone?
- Mm-hmm.

862
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,560
Pretty talkativefor a loner.

863
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,900
Called this numberthree
times at the docks.

864
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,630
Let me guess
--that your boss?

865
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,500
Nah,that's my boyfriend.

866
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,530
Okay,okay!

867
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,730
Look,I'm D.E.A.

868
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,090
We've been watching you guysfor months.

869
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,570
We got a grand juryready to go.

870
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,790
I'm cia.

871
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,390
That's right,cia.

872
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,320
We've been trackingyour turkish
heroin connection for terrorists!

873
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,530
Who do you work for,huh?

874
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,500
Okay.

875
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,540
Fbi.

876
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,580
We got an informant.

877
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,830
Your guy there
--he works for us.

878
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,610
Isn't that right,frank?
Come on,tell him.

879
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,060
No use lying now. He's got us!

880
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,850
Come on,frank!

881
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,900
You're a funny guy.

882
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,870
You're trained,aren't you,huh?

883
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,860
Let me guess
--special forces?

884
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,970
See,me,I'm an ex-green beret.

885
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:20,160
Admit nothing,deny
everything,make counteraccusations.

886
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,880
Special forces?

887
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,510
No,no.

888
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,300
I was a boy scoutfor a while.

889
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,800
Hey,take these restraintsoff me,I'll
show youhow to tie a slipknot.

890
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,760
Let's just kill him.

891
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,830
And then what?

892
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:33,860
The girl saw us.

893
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,010
We got to take careof the
whole team,plus gillian.

894
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,510
By the way,it seems likeshe
packed up and left early.

895
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,000
We went by her house.

896
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,740
Must have been in a hurry.

897
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,170
But don't worry.

898
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,730
I'll find her.

899
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,710
I'm really good at that.

900
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,830
Excuse me. I'm tired.

901
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,580
Yeah,okay.

902
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,210
You know what?

903
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,750
Show him what green beretsare all about.

904
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,600
There's more -- stashed undera
fort lauderdale overpass.

905
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,450
For any operative,stashing weapons
is second nature after a while.

906
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,600
Spies hide guns like
squirrels hide acorns.

907
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,780
You never know when
you'll need some firepower

908
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,590
or where you'll be when you need it.

909
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,550
If we needmore than this,we're
doing somethingvery wrong.

910
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,450
Or something very right.

911
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,250
Hello?

912
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,200
I've got someone herewho
says he knows you -- sam.

913
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,770
Yeah,he works for me.

914
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,230
Oh,yeah?

915
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,340
And what kind of workdo you do?

916
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,260
Choosing a cover I.D.On the
fly is always a challenge.

917
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:54,190
My work?

918
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,560
Yeah. Your work.

919
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,510
What was your man doing downat
the docks taking pictures?

920
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:02,250
When there's no time to think,it's
best to go with something simple.

921
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,640
That keeps your options open.

922
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:05,910
I'm in the same businessyou're in.

923
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,180
We're interestedin your operation.

924
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,270
I sent sam downto do some research.

925
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:10,290
Oh,yeah?

926
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,500
That's not what sam says.

927
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,520
I don't train my employeesto
talk about my business.

928
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,790
Listen to me,not to him.

929
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,700
Who am I talking to?

930
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,760
I think you knowenough about me for now.

931
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,120
So let me ask youa question.

932
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,790
You thought,what,you could just
come downhere and rip me off?

933
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,090
I'm just checking
outthe competition --

934
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,810
you know,move to a new
market,check outthe lay of the land.

935
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:32,000
Point is,the man you
haveis a valued employee.

936
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,670
I want him back. I'm willing to deal.

937
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:36,200
Let's set a meet.

938
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,450
We'll figure out a price.

939
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,430
I'm happy to negotiate,but I do
not payfor damaged merchandise.

940
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,210
I want proof of life.

941
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,000
You got e-mail?

942
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:52,670
Wake up,sammy boy
--picture time.

943
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,810
So,probably gonna bemy last photo,right?

944
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,710
I mean,you've got these
plansto kill everybody.

945
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:07,440
So I'm thinking I
shouldlook good for this,huh?

946
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,150
Let's see.

947
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,850
Nice.

948
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,810
I'll send it to your mama.

949
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,490
Freon is available at
most computer stores.

950
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,350
Buy a can of screen
duster,turn it upside down,

951
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,420
and you've got it in liquid form.

952
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,030
It's cold enough to crystallize
the metal in many commercial locks.

953
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,550
A hammer can take care of the rest.

954
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,000
So,this issam's storage locker. Phew!

955
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,600
We're lookingfor an old photo.

956
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,570
It'll befrom the mid
-'90s,when we wereworking together.

957
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,730
You really think samis
sending us a message?

958
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,100
He's trying to get
usany information he can.

959
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,940
It's the pose in the photo.

960
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,390
I've seen it before.

961
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:05,850
One advantage of working with the same team
is that secure communication is simpler.

962
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,230
You don't have to
work out a secret code.

963
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,310
If you have enough history,the
code is in every picture,

964
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,680
every memento,every
autographed leg cast.

965
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,370
What is it?

966
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,370
Sam leda hostage-rescue operation
in venezuelafor some U.S.Businessmen.

967
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,660
It was a setup.

968
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,810
The hostageswere bait for sam's team.

969
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,950
He lost a few men.

970
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,890
He's saying,stay away.

971
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,650
He's not gettingout of this alive.

972
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,320
Good. You made it
back. Was anyone there?

973
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,120
Government
types,bro --suits.

974
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,950
There was a fewplainclothes
guys there,too.

975
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,020
I didn't even see
themtill after I got mom.

976
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,260
I wasjust getting in the shower.

977
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,120
In a sec,mom.

978
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,640
As soon as we leftthe house,they
came outlike roaches,bro.

979
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,930
Did you get rid of them?

980
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,850
Yeah,I drove aroundlittle
haiti for an hour,

981
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,400
out to virginia keyand back.

982
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,870
I mean,it was a bitchand a half.

983
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:11,490
But unless they got
invisiblehelicopters,I lost them.

984
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,850
Did you leave the car
unattendedwhen you went inside?

985
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,220
Don't worry,I ditched that car.

986
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,980
I picked up a new one.

987
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,140
Uh-huh --
stole it.

988
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,030
It was likea
15-year-old pontiac,ma.

989
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,370
I did the guy a favor taking it.

990
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,010
The point is we lost them.

991
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,910
We're clean.

992
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,880
You think they're the
same guysthat shot cowan?

993
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:26,750
Yeah.

994
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,390
- Michael,what is going on?
- I'm not sure.

995
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,730
All I know is this isn't
justabout following me anymore.

996
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,710
They want to bring me in.

997
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:34,870
Who is it?

998
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,180
- I don't know what you're --
- I don't know!

999
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,600
Covert intelligence agenciesdon't call
you up and tell youwhy they're hunting you!

1000
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,760
Mom,just for now,I
need you to stay here.

1001
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,810
No calls until I figure
outwhat's going on.

1002
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,910
Here? Are you serious?

1003
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:51,130
Mom,just until I know more.

1004
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:56,060
Nate,I need you to pick upsome disposable
cellphones for emergencies only.

1005
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:56,630
What are you gonna do?

1006
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,730
Fi and I are gonna probe
theseguys,see how serious they are.

1007
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:05,660
Well,it's nota perfect
location,but it's not bad,either.

1008
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,390
Just need somethingnice
and traceable --

1009
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,360
a trail that the guysthat
killed cowan can follow.

1010
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,190
Who are you gonna call?

1011
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,210
My old handler.

1012
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,460
If they're not listeningto his
line,they don't deserveto catch me.

1013
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,270
Hi. Yes,dan siebels,please.

1014
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,530
This is michael westen.

1015
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,390
I need to talk to him.

1016
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,150
It's urgent.

1017
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,770
I havegovernment agents following me.

1018
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,480
I'm not sure what agencythey
are,but I need help.

1019
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:35,300
Could you send a helicopter --
Okay,good talking to you,too.

1020
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,240
Surveillance is a two-way street.

1021
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,640
If you know someone's looking
for you,you've got an advantage.

1022
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,050
They follow your lead,go
where they think you are.

1023
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,090
Nice response
time --10 minutes.

1024
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,410
They're good.

1025
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,680
They're not that good.
They're staring at a pay phone.

1026
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,770
Oh,no,fi,they are that good.

1027
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,440
Those guys arejust to keep us busy.

1028
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,420
They know we're here.

1029
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,950
Tires.

1030
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,030
- It's armored.
- I'll see youback at nate'S.

1031
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,630
Who drives armored cars?

1032
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,700
People who
expect gunfire --

1033
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,100
usually people with some
firepower of their own.

1034
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,310
- Hey,what are you doing? Hey,hey!
- I'm sorry about that.

1035
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:37,290
What are you doing?
Hey,you! Give me my keys!

1036
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,570
You ready to talk about
how to getyour guy sam back?

1037
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,120
Yeah. You got a price?

1038
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,330
We'll get to that.

1039
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,990
First,I want to meet
youand the girl -- together.

1040
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,200
The girl?

1041
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,580
You forgot already?

1042
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,870
Sure went to a hell of a
lotof trouble to get her back.

1043
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,290
She has nothing to dowith this.

1044
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,070
She's partof your operation.

1045
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,880
I want to knowwho I'm dealing with.

1046
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,490
Those are my conditions.

1047
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,070
Fine,but it's gonna takea
couple of days to track her down.

1048
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,320
A couple of days?

1049
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,990
After what happened,she
went underground.

1050
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,560
If you want to see her,you're gonna
have to waitfor me to find her.

1051
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,860
Don't take too long.

1052
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,010
I'm not sure if samcan hold out.

1053
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,800
He's got decent stamina,but
everyone's gota breaking point,

1054
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,090
and I'm goodat finding them.

1055
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,510
In a hostage situation,you
have to be cruel to be kind.

1056
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,520
The more you care,the more leverage
they have,like buying a car.

1057
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,960
You have to make them
think you can walk away.

1058
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,540
Just so we're clear,I
don't take damaged goods.

1059
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,880
You break it,you buy it,got it?

1060
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,390
Call mewhen you find the girl.

1061
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:36,320
I take ityou just bought us more time.

1062
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,400
It won't do us much good
unlesswe find out who this guy is.

1063
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:43,040
All we know now is he's got
samand he intends to kill us.

1064
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:43,940
Any ideas?

1065
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:47,150
Well,it'sa pretty small world when
you're importing heroinat that level.

1066
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,690
I'll make a call.

1067
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,400
Well,it's your lucky day.

1068
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,140
Your bossreally wants you back.

1069
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,660
Guess that's loyaltyfor you.

1070
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,640
You thinkhe's gonna deal for me?

1071
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,740
He's playing with you.

1072
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,780
Oh,really?

1073
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,690
Look,I got caught. He's
gonna kill me himself.

1074
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,130
Believe me,pal,you'd
be doing me a big favor.

1075
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,400
You got some death wishor something?

1076
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,110
You're gonna do it anyway,aren't you?

1077
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,460
What,I got to stay another
dayin this crappy metal box?

1078
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,010
Look,there's this sweet
littlepark in coral gables.

1079
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,120
Just dump the body.

1080
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,090
Give me a piece of paper.

1081
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,730
I'll draw you a map.

1082
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,780
Yap,yap,yap,yap,yap.

1083
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,370
He knows if we kill
him,his team won't show.

1084
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:31,900
Nah. We need him alive.

1085
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,680
Fellas,you're only
hurtingyourselves,I'm telling you.

1086
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:38,090
Come on,a little rat
poison --easy-peasy!

1087
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,510
So,you want me to put youin
touch with a heroin dealer?

1088
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:44,580
That is what I want.

1089
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,940
Look,heroin --I'm
allergic to it.

1090
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,300
BARRY THE MONEY LAUNDERER

1091
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,170
Don't need to touch
it,don't need to see it.

1092
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,950
I think about it,I get,like,hives.

1093
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:52,870
Heroin dealers?

1094
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,340
Seriously. This is not a favor.

1095
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,350
No,it's not.

1096
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,820
Favors don't get you killed.

1097
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:01,200
I give you a name,it gets back,we're in
a barry facedownin the river situation.

1098
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,520
I'm not asking,barry.

1099
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,390
We're friendsor we're enemies here.

1100
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,820
Well...

1101
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,660
if you put it that way...

1102
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,830
I put it that way.

1103
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,600
You want the biggestheroin
dealer in miami?

1104
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,940
If this guy's as bigas you
say,they're probablyworking together.

1105
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:21,090
No. Who's the second biggest?

1106
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,300
there's this clubup on 22nd,dito'S.

1107
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:30,100
It's a placeusually for smack trade.

1108
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,500
You're looking for carmelo.

1109
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:35,660
He hangs out there,does a lot
of businessin the V.I.P.Room.

1110
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,330
Yeah?

1111
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:47,440
Uh,mike,it's for you --
somethingabout your burn notice.

1112
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:50,720
Yello.

1113
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,870
Come out,come out,wherever you are.

1114
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:53,790
Who's this?

1115
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,140
We need to talk,michael.

1116
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:56,920
We've been tryingto bring you in.

1117
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,190
Talk about what?

1118
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,050
About your past,about your future.

1119
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:01,510
Oh,sweetie,I'm a little busy right now.

1120
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,700
Can you call me back?

1121
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,050
Keep it.

1122
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,870
It's yours.

1123
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,700
We friends?

1124
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,320
We're friends,barry.

1125
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,330
Anything I can doto help in here?

1126
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,670
No,mom. Please.

1127
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:37,530
We got to get herto stop smoking,bro.

1128
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,880
She's making me nervous.

1129
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,400
She just wants to help.

1130
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:42,800
She can helpby making sandwiches.

1131
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,810
Making explosives,are you,michael?

1132
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,540
Mom,there is some
seriousbusiness going on here.

1133
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,560
I'm not stupid. I can see that.

1134
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,400
Look,I was hoping to get
youhome in a couple days,

1135
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:00,500
but that doesn't looklike
it's gonna happen.

1136
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,230
What do you mean?

1137
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,660
I don't wantto stay here longer.

1138
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:06,250
I only brought a week'sworth of clothes,and
I got a poker gameat the house tomorrow.

1139
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,380
No,mom. You're goingto
have to leave town.

1140
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,920
Leave town?

1141
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,060
With nate.

1142
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:11,760
No!

1143
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:12,940
I'm not going anywhere.

1144
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,140
I'm staying here. You're
obviously in trouble.

1145
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,580
No,it's not safe.

1146
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,380
You can'T.

1147
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,860
I don't careif it's not safe here.

1148
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,350
- I'm not leaving you! Michael,I'm not afraid!
- Mom,please!

1149
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:26,800
I know you're not afraid,but I am.

1150
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,620
It's okay.

1151
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,930
I'll go.

1152
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,730
There's our manright there.

1153
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:16,460
CARMELO HEROIN DEALER(SECOND BIGGEST)

1154
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,180
He looks likehe's ready for trouble.

1155
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,650
I'll bring him trouble,then.

1156
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,650
There are some fights
you just can't win.

1157
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,720
A force can be so overwhelming

1158
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,320
that no tactical approach in a fight is
going to lead to a victory worth having.

1159
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,800
You sureyou don't want me to stay?

1160
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,620
No,fi. You need to go -- now.

1161
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,060
I'm usually all for
thehigh-risk,high-reward option,but this...

1162
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:44,380
if there was any other way,believe me...

1163
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,940
knock 'em dead.

1164
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,890
When you can't win in a fight,

1165
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:56,940
sometimes you have to settle for making
sure that if you lose,everyone loses.

1166
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,540
It works for nuclear weapons.

1167
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,050
It works for me.

1168
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,410
- Hey!
- Sorry.

1169
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,660
Private party. My bad.

1170
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,270
You got a death wish,my friend.

1171
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,610
Back off.

1172
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:15,330
What do you want?

1173
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,700
Send someone outinto the club.

1174
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,230
I need them to checkunder the bar,

1175
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:21,620
under the stairs,under the
chairsfor more of these.

1176
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,900
That's exactlywhat
it looks like --

1177
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,070
c-4 explosivewith a remote detonator.

1178
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,820
And this...

1179
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,700
a remote detonatoron
a dead-man's switch.

1180
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,010
You shoot me,I let go of this button,

1181
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,900
and the city of miami gets some
brand-new,undeveloped real estate.

1182
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,960
What do you want?

1183
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,580
I just want to talk.

1184
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,370
What are you drinking?

1185
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,860
Champagne.

1186
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:51,990
Would you like some?

1187
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,790
Please.

1188
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,810
Ooh,that's nice --a little dry,but
sometimes dryis a little refreshing.

1189
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:04,010
Glad you like it.

1190
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:07,170
That why you're here --put a bomb in
my club so you could drinkmy champagne?

1191
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:08,010
Partially.

1192
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:12,010
Also,I need the nameand location
of a certain heroin importer.

1193
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,440
I need it quietly,and I need it now.

1194
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,750
And I should do thisbecause...

1195
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:19,580
Because he's an importer --he
sells to your competition.

1196
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:22,280
I put him out of business,it's
a win for both of us.

1197
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,950
And if you don't dowhat I want,

1198
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,790
I will rain hell down upon
youuntil one of us is dead.

1199
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:33,050
And I am really,really
goodat raining down hell.

1200
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,700
I want an answer tomorrow.

1201
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:39,240
Who are you?

1202
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,920
I'm michael westen.

1203
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,960
I used to be a spy.

1204
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,750
You have a name for me?

1205
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,940
The guy's nameis glen harrick.

1206
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,780
He's got a boat on the
rivernear the 27th avenue bridge.

1207
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,130
It cost me a lot of moneyto
get that information.

1208
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,470
You've just done yourselfa
great favor,carmelo.

1209
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,910
Do yourself one.

1210
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,480
Don't let me see you again.

1211
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:11,770
You take care of this guy and
you stay out of my way,we're good.

1212
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:15,570
If I ever seeyour face again,I'll
kill you,bomb or no bomb.

1213
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,900
Agreed.

1214
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,900
Oh,look,they survivednate's
exploding truck.

1215
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,630
Think they'rekeeping sam here?

1216
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,900
Fits the backgroundon
sam's photo --

1217
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:28,930
lots of rusted metal,and they
probably got him downin the hold.

1218
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,710
Makes sense,a barge --
it's isolated,easy to defend.

1219
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:35,640
Guess it's timeto set
my meeting with harrick.

1220
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:36,820
We could go in there now.

1221
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:37,980
No,fi.

1222
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:39,360
We're gonnado this the right way.

1223
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,910
Boring.

1224
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,500
Yeah?

1225
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,510
I'm readyto make a deal.

1226
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:47,650
All right.

1227
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,680
Let's set it up.

1228
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,400
I can meet today.

1229
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:52,120
The girl coming?

1230
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:54,350
Yeah. I tracked her down.

1231
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:56,360
Fine. 4:00.

1232
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,910
Be at the grove harbor marina.

1233
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,460
Sounds good.
One more thing --

1234
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:01,740
I talk to sam before
I cometo the meeting.

1235
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:05,190
If he can't talk,if he
doesn'tsound healthy,I walk away.

1236
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,250
If he's anythingless than 100%,

1237
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,630
just kill him nowand
save us both some time.

1238
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,240
We'll takegood care of him.

1239
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,640
You do that.

1240
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:23,080
It will be over today.

1241
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:24,270
Hey.

1242
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,560
I was thinking about it.

1243
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,380
Maybe you should draw me a
picture of themap to that park.

1244
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,630
I'm gonna have to putyour
body somewhere,right?

1245
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,490
Hey,um,did he askto talk
to me before you meet?

1246
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:39,450
'Cause I've got newsfor you,buddy
-- I'm not gonna play ball.

1247
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,960
So you might as welljust
finish this right now.

1248
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,010
You'll dowhatever I want you to do.

1249
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,790
But until then,please,keep him quiet.

1250
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:52,660
Hey,um,so,what were you,army?

1251
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:53,790
I'm a navy man myself.

1252
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,770
But,you know,I've seenyour
boss's type before,

1253
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,170
and whatever shallow
gravehe dumps my body in,

1254
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:02,620
you're gonna be keeping
mecompany there real soon,pal.

1255
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,390
You know,I read in a book once that

1256
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:12,790
the things that make you the angriest
are the thingsyou know are true.

1257
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,510
Wise words,huh?

1258
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:17,620
I am getting so sickof your mouth!

1259
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:21,670
Take a good look,buddy,'cause
this is gonna be youreal soon.

1260
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,580
Oh,I get it.

1261
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,510
I kill you,your mandoesn't show,right?

1262
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,790
Nice try.

1263
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,960
I,uh --I got
your buddy's c...

1264
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,000
I had a friend who dealsin
secondhand cars check it out.

1265
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:00,850
It looks clean.

1266
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,630
He also fixed the
windshieldon the charger.

1267
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,620
So,mom said that you wanted
meto go away with her?

1268
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,060
I want you twosomewhere safe.

1269
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:10,130
Why is it,if you'rethe responsible one,

1270
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:14,500
every time you run offand you do your
spy thing,I got to pick upthe pieces?

1271
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,090
Please.

1272
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,770
I like this.

1273
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:23,100
You coming to me for
help,it -- it feels good.

1274
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,750
It's like a fresh thingfor us,you know?

1275
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,930
It's great.

1276
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:26,940
You gonna do it?

1277
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,100
Of course,bro.

1278
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:29,500
Thanks.

1279
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,630
You probably needa
moderate-sized blast.

1280
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,720
The metal on that
boatlooked pretty worn.

1281
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,310
I'd go with somethingwith
more direction.

1282
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,630
But it'll do.

1283
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,470
The sticky bomb was originally developed
in world war ii for mining tanks.

1284
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,210
For the homemade variety,tile
adhesive works best --

1285
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:14,530
sticky,waterproof,and it comes in
an easily portable plastic bucket.

1286
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,160
Mom,I'll call you when
--if it's safe to come back.

1287
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,840
Here. Take this.

1288
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:50,430
It's a new phone.

1289
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:53,880
It hasn't beenused,so it's untraceable.

1290
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,560
It's for emergencies only.

1291
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,800
We want to keep
communicationto a minimum.

1292
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,790
We're not taking your
car from you,are we?

1293
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,590
No.

1294
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,370
Whoever's coming after
memight have eyes on it,

1295
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:05,360
so I'll drive you and
nateup to fort lauderdale,

1296
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:09,160
and that's where
I'll...find you another car.

1297
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:12,860
I remember the timeyou
stole your first car.

1298
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:18,480
Dad was up god knows where,and
I had to get nateto the doctor.

1299
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,090
You must have been,what,12?

1300
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,060
10 I remember.

1301
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,340
You were pretty angry.

1302
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:25,680
Yeah. I was also proud.

1303
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:31,730
You did a lot of thingsI
didn't understand.

1304
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:35,020
But you did themfor the family.

1305
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,130
You know,michael...

1306
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:42,130
I did,too.

1307
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,740
I know,mom.

1308
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:45,160
I know.

1309
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,590
I know.

1310
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,900
Nate,you make any calls today?

1311
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,200
No,bro. You said not to.

1312
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,630
Mom?

1313
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:12,090
Um,I -- I called
hometo check messages,

1314
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,740
but I used the secure
phonethat you gave me.

1315
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:20,620
If you call a tapped
phone from an untapped --

1316
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,040
never mind.

1317
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,160
That's how they're following us.

1318
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,420
I need that phone right now.

1319
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,220
This phoneis no longer secure.

1320
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,220
From now on,let's makethis
simple -- make no calls!

1321
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,150
Fine!

1322
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:35,090
Nate,I'm gonna pull overand get out.

1323
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:36,640
You said they werefollowing us.

1324
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,450
Yeah. They want me.

1325
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,010
When I get out,you go.

1326
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,830
You don't stop for anything,you got it?

1327
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:41,610
Yeah.

1328
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,300
Be careful.

1329
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,490
Stay in the car.

1330
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,680
I know this line is tapped.

1331
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:08,170
I know you're listening.

1332
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,490
I don't know who you
are,but I know this.

1333
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:16,010
You want me to come in alive,you call
me now,or I will end this right here.

1334
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:23,010
Hello.

1335
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,370
Michael,don't do anything stupid.

1336
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,320
I have a proposalI'd like to discuss.

1337
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:27,980
I'm listening.

1338
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,040
I have a job to do.

1339
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,170
I need 12 hours.

1340
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,970
You give me that,I will come in alive.

1341
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:36,180
If you don't,if you even comenear me
before that,I will put a bulletin my head.

1342
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,870
You wouldn't do that,michael.

1343
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,470
You've gotsuch a bright future.

1344
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,940
Maybe. Maybe not.

1345
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:44,160
You give me 12 hours,you
don't need to find out.

1346
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,280
I believe we have a deal.

1347
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,810
You think it's okay to
takesam's car on the street?

1348
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,650
Those government types...

1349
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,880
I bought myself a coupleof
hours before they pick me up.

1350
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:11,800
I might as well drive ittill then.

1351
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:12,990
You're really gonna gowith them?

1352
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,320
Yeah,fi.

1353
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:17,200
They shot cowanin front of you.

1354
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,730
They didn't shoot me.

1355
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:21,030
I want to knowwhat's going
on,and I told themI'd meet them.

1356
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,010
You're a spy,michael.

1357
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,320
Why don't you just lie?

1358
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,070
That's what spies do,you know?

1359
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:27,900
You want
to run --

1360
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:31,440
this is not about honor,and
I'm not running anymore.

1361
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,310
I want answers,and this
isthe only way to find them.

1362
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,020
You ready?

1363
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:45,920
It's been fun,michael.

1364
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,840
At least this timewe get to say goodbye.

1365
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,710
Thank you,fi.

1366
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:14,600
You get overto the grove harbor marina.

1367
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,320
I'll call,put his guy on the phone.

1368
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:20,330
You wait until he gets
therewith the girl,understood?

1369
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:21,490
Yeah.

1370
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,730
Okay.

1371
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:26,330
Put twoin both their heads
and call mewhen you're done.

1372
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:28,420
You got it.

1373
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,940
Get out of here.

1374
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,990
Let's go.

1375
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,990
Looks like they're leaving
a three-man teamon the boat.

1376
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:02,300
I'm off to crash the party.

1377
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,790
A lot of people think the
word commando means superhero,

1378
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,500
or at least something close to it.

1379
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,770
In the popular mind,they're thought
of as the ultimate elite soldier --

1380
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,040
the solution to every problem.

1381
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:54,540
The fact is a commando is just someone trained
to fight under a specific set of circumstances.

1382
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:57,870
He's the guy you send in when there
are more bad guys than good guys,

1383
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:02,430
when surprise is the only advantage
you can get in an operation.

1384
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,750
When it works,commandos
seem unstoppable.

1385
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,270
Those are the operations
that make the papers.

1386
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,230
When it doesn't work,commandos get
killed just as dead as anyone else.

1387
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,390
Hey.

1388
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,740
Are you there?

1389
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:16,400
Okay,good.

1390
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,590
Here's what's gonna happen.

1391
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:20,650
When they get there,you kill them
both,but make sure they're dead --

1392
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,080
you got that?

1393
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,260
I'm gonna call the guy now.

1394
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,150
Morning,sunshine.

1395
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:33,780
Here's what we're gonna do.

1396
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,840
We're gonna call your boss.

1397
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:37,540
You're gonna say hello.

1398
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,340
And if you act really
nice,I'll finish you quick.

1399
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:42,350
And if I don't?

1400
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,750
Well,then I'll have to
findanother way to hunt him down,

1401
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:49,360
which means I'll haveto kill you
little by little until I find him.

1402
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:51,360
But,hey,sam,your choice.

1403
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:55,110
Boy,they both soundpretty good.

1404
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:56,870
Can I have a few
minutesto make up my mind?

1405
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,350
No.

1406
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,990
Kick his ass!

1407
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,910
Come on,mike.

1408
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,760
Come on!

1409
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,550
I've seen that wound before.

1410
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,810
I don't know what ammoyou have in here,

1411
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,190
but if it's teflon-coated,you
have about a half an hour.

1412
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:46,260
But if they'rehollow-point...

1413
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,960
I wouldn't make any plans.

1414
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,890
I told youto stay away,mikey.

1415
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,710
I tried to warn you.

1416
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,410
I was never goodat taking orders,sam.

1417
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:03,160
That's why you were a
soldierand I was a spy.

1418
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:04,940
Fair enough.

1419
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:12,730
Come on,michael.

1420
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,240
I was thinkingabout this
car when they had me.

1421
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:57,030
I thought,I'm gonna die before the
cadillac losesits new-car smell.

1422
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:59,630
I'd neverlet that happen,sam.

1423
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:04,400
Mike,uh,seriously...

1424
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,260
you would havedone it for me.

1425
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:08,310
Damn right,brother.

1426
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,530
Mike,you've been usingthe
navigation thingy?

1427
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,440
No,I
didn't --

1428
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:18,300
Onstar. Mr.Westen?

1429
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,120
How do you know my name?

1430
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,070
*******

1431
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,270
*************

1432
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:26,250
My destination?

1433
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,870
Mike,what's going on?

1434
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:31,360
Time to get some
questionsanswered,one way or another.

1435
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,180
Burn notice,huh?

1436
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:36,460
Uh,I needto borrow the c...

1437
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,430
No problem.

1438
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,150
Good luck,mike.

1439
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,770
Thanks,sam.

1440
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:33,360
*********

1441
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,190
Hello?

1442
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:59,000
Michael,we're so
lookingforward to meeting you.

1443
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:08,780
When you work in intelligence,

1444
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:13,590
you get used to the idea that some
information is worth risking everything for.

1445
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:17,320
You sign up for the lifestyle or
the chance to serve your country

1446
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,260
or the millions of
frequent-flier miles.

1447
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:25,860
But finally,it all comes down to putting
your ass on the line to learn something.
