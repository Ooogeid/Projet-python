1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,990
My name is Michael Westen.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,440
I used to be a spy until...

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,680
We got a burn notice.

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,200
You're blacklisted.

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,910
When you're burned,you've got nothing...

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,470
No cash,no credit,no job history.

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,850
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,740
- Where am I? 
- miami.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,430
You do whatever work comes your way.

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,600
You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,670
A trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend...

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,840
Should we shoot them?

13
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,380
...An old friend who's
informing on you to the fbi...

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,280
You know spies...

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,000
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

16
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,880
...Family,too...

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,060
Is that your mom again?

18
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,300
...If you're desperate.

19
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,680
Someone needs your help.

20
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,820
Bottom line... Until you
figure out who burned you,

21
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,960
you're not going anywhere.

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,400
Covert operatives have
a hard time dating.

23
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,790
Even if you find someone who doesn't
mind that you won't talk about your past

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,380
or that you carry a concealed weapon,

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,060
they usually want more
than you're able to give.

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,750
You're late.

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,060
What's that?

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,220
I said,"you're late."

29
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,900
watch the step.

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,950
I made you tuna with tahini...

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,230
Your favorite.

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,830
Good memory.

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,670
Oh,no.

34
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,490
No dossier at lunch.

35
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,440
You have had your head buried in this
thing every waking moment since you got it.

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,870
Come on,fi,it's not every day you get to
read a fictional account of your whole life.

37
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,710
Apparently,I sold secrets in lebanon,

38
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,780
code-breaking technology in jordan.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,580
Who knew?

40
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,480
I got to figure out my next move.

41
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,000
I just can't believe it's the
only thing on your mind these days.

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,020
Fi,I know we haven't talked about
what happened the other night.

43
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,020
It was...

44
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,220
Well,you know what it was.

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,720
But there's a reason why
it didn't work before.

46
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,400
We were in a war zone.

47
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,490
This is miami,Michael.

48
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,350
Fi,beach is this way.

49
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,290
Actually,I got a little
errand to run first.

50
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,100
It'll only take a second.

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,270
What will?

52
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,430
Bagging a bail jumper.

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,810
I thought it'd be fun.

54
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,080
You're a bounty hunter now,fi?

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
Girl's got to eat.

56
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,370
There's this bondsman.

57
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,880
He gives me odd jobs.

58
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,170
Fi!

59
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,130
How often do I help you?

60
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,260
All the time.

61
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,090
Here's who we're looking for.

62
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,190
Thomas mckee.

63
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,890
I got a tip about an hour ago
he's staying at the victor.

64
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,240
Fi,I have a feeling this guy
is not gonna survive on the lam.

65
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,560
Is it always this easy for you?

66
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,970
Oh,hey,sorry.

67
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,080
Uh,there's your guy.

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
THOMAS MCKEE 
FUGITIVE

69
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,080
Whoa,whoa,whoa,who is that?

70
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,750
WAYNE RAY 
OTHER BOUNTY HUNTER

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,120
Wayne ray, bounty hunter.

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,140
I might have snaked
a few of his collars.

73
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,070
Mckee,get on the ground!

74
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,350
You take wayne,I'll take thomas.

75
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,010
That doesn't seem fair.

76
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,870
Ugh! Oh,dude!

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,090
Dude!

78
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,970
There you are.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,700
Please,please,I didn't do it.

80
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,020
I'm innocent,I swear.

81
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,970
Get in.

82
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,240
Nice work.

83
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,590
Where do we deliver him?

84
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,950
We don't. He says he's innocent.

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
He's coming home with us.

86
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,290
Hi,I'm thomas.

87
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,580
Hey!

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,700
I told you this would be fun.

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,780
Hold it right there! Get back here!

93
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,620
Beijing,london,the taj mahal?

94
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,970
Look at all these.

95
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,850
Bounty hunter.

96
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,150
The point is to collect the
bounty by turning him in.

97
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,430
The job is what... $4,000?

98
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,700
He's offering us $8,000 just
to clear his name,Michael.

99
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,200
Hear him out.

100
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,060
Hey,you have been,like,everywhere.

101
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,810
Yeah,I work a job,buy a snow globe.

102
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,010
Some people say I'm sentimental.

103
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,920
Tell us about your situation.

104
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,700
Oh,right,yeah.

105
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,560
I do liquor promotions for a
bunch of the hotels on south beach.

106
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,000
Now,I'm friends with a girl
who night-managed the victor.

107
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,790
A couple months ago,I'm
making a delivery,

108
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,730
and she shows me this,uh,you know,like,

109
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,850
you pin on your,um,you
know,what do you call the...

110
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,650
A brooch?

111
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,370
Right. They were holding it for a guest.

112
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,610
2 million bucks.

113
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,130
She showed it to you. why?

114
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,080
Because it's worth 2 million bucks,man!

115
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,590
I mean,it had a huge rock!

116
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,780
I mean,this thing was just...

117
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,960
Anyway,it gets stolen,and my friend
gets fired for showing me the brooch,

118
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,080
and the cops arrest me.

119
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,790
For just looking at it?

120
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,900
I'm guessing there's more than that.

121
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,480
Yeah,I had an access card for the
hotel office for late-night deliveries,

122
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,850
and I lost it.

123
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,870
And then I find out that somebody
used it to rip off the brooch,

124
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,840
and now everyone's looking at me like
I'm some criminal mastermind or whatever.

125
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,070
And you went back to the
scene of the crime why?

126
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,210
Investigating.

127
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,340
I was trying to find
out who did it,you know?

128
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,810
My trial was supposed
to start yesterday,

129
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,710
and my lawyer basically tells me,

130
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,970
before we go in,that I'm gonna lose.

131
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,280
I mean,I just...

132
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,960
I kind of freaked.

133
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,170
I mean,I know that you're
not supposed to skip court,

134
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,080
but,man,I can't go to jail.

135
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,860
I want to help him.

136
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,140
Do it for me,Michael.

137
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,360
Okay.

138
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,900
Between the cops and wayne and
all the other bounty hunters,

139
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,570
we're gonna have to stash him somewhere.

140
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,790
Why can't you keep him here?

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,460
You're okay with that...

142
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,600
Another guy staying at my place?

143
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,990
Yeah,it's fine by me.

144
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,570
Okay,then,it's fine by me,too.

145
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,790
Yeah,Sam,I need a favor.

146
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,010
Diamonds? Fun.

147
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,270
Buying or selling?

148
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,370
BARRY 
MONEY LAUNDERER

149
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,370
Neither.

150
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,900
Looking for a $2 million brooch.

151
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,370
It's like a little spidey thing.

152
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,490
Yeah,the one that got lifted
from the victor two months ago.

153
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,560
****

154
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,600
That's the one.

155
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,110
You think it's on the market yet?

156
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,790
Doubt it.

157
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,550
A stone that big is easy to I.D.

158
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,730
It's like selling a fingerprint.

159
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,370
And if you cut it,the value plummets.

160
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,270
It takes months to line up a buyer.

161
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,520
*****

162
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,710
So,who does that around here?

163
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,260
Really only one guy in miami.

164
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,570
Don't ask me for an intro,though.

165
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,280
The guy shorted me on some
hot rocks a few months back.

166
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,370
It cost me a client.

167
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,320
We had words.

168
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,130
Give me a name.

169
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,080
Mike will see to it the guy
loses a few clients of his own.

170
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,720
Name's cristo...

171
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,670
Like madonna...

172
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,030
The whole one-name thing.

173
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,370
- Like charo. 
- sting.

174
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,720
- Fergie. 
- pel.

175
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,580
Spider-man.

176
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,930
Liberace.

177
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,580
Crap,I can't think of any more.

178
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,030
Anyway,cristo's got this
place on south beach,

179
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,100
but good luck getting a meeting

180
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,250
because he's,like,all
high-end referrals.

181
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,770
Well,you know Mike.

182
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,710
He's not gonna call
to make an appointment.

183
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,200
CRISTO 
THE FENCE

184
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,040
You're out of salsa.

185
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,750
You okay?

186
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,360
That looked like it hurt.

187
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,230
Who are you?

188
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,420
Let's not talk about me.

189
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,720
Let's talk about what I want.

190
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,260
I'm looking for a piece of jewelry...

191
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,140
30 carats,platinum
setting,spider-looking thing.

192
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,140
Sound familiar?

193
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

194
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,680
Oh,we got to do this the hard way.

195
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,070
Selling stolen goods
is all about discretion.

196
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,020
You've got to be the kind of person
who can keep your mouth shut...

197
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,690
Gerald? He sounds nice.

198
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,850
Hey,hey,hey,what are you doing?

199
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,860
Shh! It's ringing.

200
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,060
The kind of person who never,ever shares
the numbers in their little black book.

201
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,340
Hey,gerald,man.

202
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,210
My name is paco.

203
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,110
I'm buddies with your fence,cristo.

204
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,790
Man,I'm in some legal trouble.

205
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,210
Cristo said you could help me out.

206
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,740
Can I stay on your...

207
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,550
That's rude. He hung up.

208
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,410
- Maybe vincent will be nicer.
- No,no.

209
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,150
I can do this all night.

210
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,230
Stop.

211
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,640
I got a call about the brooch.

212
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,090
The guy was an amateur.

213
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,030
He thought you could sell a
rock like that on the street.

214
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,370
He got all pissed off when I said that he
better hang onto it for at least six months.

215
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,810
I told him I will look for a buyer,

216
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,370
but he needed the cash quick.

217
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,020
I think he's planning
to move it in europe.

218
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,700
What's his name?

219
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,660
I don't know his real name.

220
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,910
I got his phone number.

221
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,400
That's all.

222
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,650
Okay,good enough.

223
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,730
I'll take it.

224
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,690
Oh,and,by the way,I should mention,

225
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,300
I went through your
fridge while you were out.

226
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,080
Do you know it's one of the most
frequently used hiding places?

227
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,110
Found this in the orange sherbet.

228
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,830
I assume you're holding it for someone.

229
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,540
I'll keep it until our job is finished.

230
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,210
Until then,you keep your mouth
shut about our little chat.

231
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,580
Even the most careful spy leaves
a trail that could get them burned.

232
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,130
A patriot making illicit
deals for his government

233
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,210
looks a lot like a traitor making
black-market sales for his wallet.

234
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,130
Somebody upstairs gets the wrong idea,

235
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,530
and suddenly you're
burned and out of a job.

236
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,000
Mike,piece of advice.

237
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,450
Ladies like attention.

238
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,060
They don't want to be
second to a dossier...

239
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,370
Not even a big one.

240
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,100
You've been talking to fi.

241
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,570
If by "talking to fi," you mean
"listening to fi," then,yeah.

242
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,920
So,look,I got ahold of
my contacts at the fbi,

243
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,690
about the guy who put your
little dossier together.

244
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,490
They were not very helpful at all.

245
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,960
They stuck me with the bill.

246
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,040
Did you get anything?

247
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,780
Everything I know about philip cowan,

248
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,360
who works for the
national security agency,

249
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,050
fits right here on the
back of the receipt.

250
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,330
I'll read it for you.

251
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,780
"He works counterintel
for the nsa." that's it.

252
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,700
That's all I got.

253
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,790
Is there any way to reach him?

254
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,910
Mike,you know these nsa
guys. They're like ghosts.

255
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,630
They got no phone number,no
address,no nothing.

256
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,470
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

257
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,280
Guess I'll have to find another
way to get in touch with him.

258
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,730
How's your jewel thing going?

259
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,170
I could use some more help,actually.

260
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,930
I need you to run down a phone number.

261
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,120
It belongs to a jewel thief.

262
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,610
Make you a deal.

263
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,590
I'll talk to my cop buddies,

264
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,780
you cover my little working lunch.

265
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,950
You want one?

266
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,890
They're awesome.

267
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,470
Thomas is a hell of a cook.

268
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,290
Playing catch?

269
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,420
He's teaching me baseball.

270
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,360
It's really nothing like cricket.

271
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,980
Sam's checking up on the real thief,

272
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,920
so thomas should be
out of here soon enough.

273
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,520
Oh,no rush.

274
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,610
I like having him around.

275
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,490
Thanks for suggesting it.

276
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,790
I need a favor,fi.

277
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,290
I need you to reach out to
your black-market contacts...

278
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,350
The scarier,the better.

279
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,730
Is this about the dossier?

280
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,730
It's about the man who burned me.

281
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,960
He's hard to reach.

282
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,500
I need to recruit some help.

283
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,420
How you gonna do it?

284
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,590
I've been accused of being
a major security risk.

285
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
It's time I started acting like one.

286
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,640
I know a few iranians
who are coming into town.

287
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,450
Let's avoid people who use "Michael
Westen" and "jihad" in the same sentence.

288
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,530
How about libyans?

289
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,910
I hear there's a group here talking
to some south american oil companies.

290
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,770
See if you can set it up.

291
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,930
Hey,Mike.

292
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,460
Hello.

293
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,040
Phone number you gave me
belongs to lawrence henderson.

294
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,610
Does he work at the hotel?

295
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,000
I wouldn't say "work." he owns it.

296
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,830
I mean,for now,at least.

297
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,910
He bet big on the victor.

298
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,740
Now he's got a cash-flow problem.

299
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,500
So,if you do the
math,it's a little screwy.

300
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,200
He's got 2 million bucks for a brooch,

301
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,540
but that's not gonna
bail him out of his hole,

302
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,320
but it might give him a year
or two to turn things around.

303
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,540
LAWRENCE HENDERSON 
HOTEL OWNER, THIEF

304
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,050
Cops ever look at him?

305
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,190
No,they cleared him.

306
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,350
He had an alibi and a
fleet of lawyers to sell it.

307
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,080
A few years back,he had
a club in new orleans.

308
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,410
It was hit by,I guess you'd
call it,a very convenient fire.

309
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,710
Almost killed a busboy.

310
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,140
He got the hotel with
the insurance money.

311
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,250
Got a hell of a security setup.

312
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,910
He's a little paranoid.

313
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,890
Even paranoids have enemies,Sam.

314
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,110
You're living proof of that.

315
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,750
What are you saying?

316
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,450
Well,a little. I mean...

317
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,420
We should go.

318
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,410
The guy who owns the
victor did this to me?

319
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,210
I don't even know him.

320
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,410
It's not personal.

321
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,380
You handled the brooch.

322
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,470
You had easy access.

323
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,970
You're an easy fall guy.

324
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,690
So,what now?

325
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,700
I mean,can we go to the
cops with that guy cristo?

326
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,950
What do we tell them?

327
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,010
I broke into his house and
extorted information from him?

328
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,690
Meanwhile,lawrence ditches the brooch,

329
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,800
cristo denies everything,

330
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,940
and the only guys that
go to jail are you and me.

331
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,940
It's fine.

332
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,260
Hard or easy...Your choice.

333
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,470
Take thomas out the back.

334
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,430
- No,I... 
- fi.

335
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,440
Right.

336
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,820
- You?
- Can we talk?

337
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,520
No,I'm done talking.

338
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,470
Watch your head.

339
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,950
Oh,damn.

340
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,560
When you're giving 5 inches and 100
pounds to a well-trained opponent,

341
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,460
it helps to know the
terrain better than he does.

342
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,060
That step is hard to see.

343
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,970
I did the same thing earlier.

344
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,070
Where'd they go?

345
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,400
I can't tell you if you keep choking me.

346
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,210
Italy was one of my favorites.

347
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,590
Thank you.

348
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,300
he has to stay with you.

349
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,580
With me,fi?

350
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
My place isn't safe.

351
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,940
We just left the world's largest bounty
hunter knocked out on my front lawn.

352
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,550
Guys,look,I don't
want to cause problems.

353
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,420
I can go stay at a motel or something.

354
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,240
No,don't be silly.

355
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,740
Cheap motels are the first place guys
like wayne are gonna look for bail jumpers.

356
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,590
Michael's fine having you here.

357
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,460
Yeah.

358
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,570
Well,you guys are the experts,I guess.

359
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,480
Seriously,man,thanks.

360
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,270
We'll figure this out,thomas.

361
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,000
Tell him about the plan,Michael.

362
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,790
The plan.

363
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,660
There's a plan?

364
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,120
Oh,yeah,there's a plan.

365
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,590
I'm gonna pose as a buyer,set up a sale,

366
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,880
get lawrence to bring the
brooch out into the open,

367
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,440
then the cops will arrest him.

368
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,640
And we will be celebrating your
freedom by the end of the week.

369
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,600
Hey,fi,can I...

370
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,720
Can we talk about the plan?

371
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,690
Just...

372
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,290
What are you doing?

373
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,790
I'm not doing anything. We're working.

374
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,320
No,this is different,and
you know this is different.

375
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,320
I didn't think we were
in a relationship,Michael.

376
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,470
Do you want something to drink,thomas?

377
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,450
Maybe a yogurt?

378
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,140
Mixing romance and work is a bad idea.

379
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,370
Veronica...Just the other day,

380
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,510
she asked me if bullets
came in different sizes.

381
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,230
Isn't that the cutest
thing you've ever heard?

382
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,570
That is so adorable.

383
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,070
Sam,you gonna help me on this?

384
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,030
Yeah.

385
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,490
When have I ever said no?

386
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,760
Lawrence needs a buyer.

387
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,740
That'll be me.

388
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,830
You're the middleman.

389
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,190
Cristo is setting up an
appointment with you and lawrence.

390
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,170
So,what's my cover I.D....

391
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,080
A shady international business guy?

392
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,090
Yeah,something like that.

393
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,380
You're gonna take point on this deal.

394
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,780
Oh,that means I got to
shave and put on a suit.

395
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,250
It's 90% humidity,and I got
to come on all professional.

396
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,460
And paranoid...

397
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,980
Extremely security-conscious
so he doesn't have to be.

398
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,170
Veronica and I were
gonna go to the keys,Mike.

399
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,470
Sam?

400
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,440
Okay,okay,but I just
got to go on record.

401
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,970
I think this whole thing
with Fiona is unhealthy.

402
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,700
You got to go through all this crap just to
get some guy she picked up out of your place?

403
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,800
Okay,I'll break out the suit.

404
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,380
A good cover identity is a team effort.

405
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,390
If you want to meet someone,it's a
good idea to play a little hard to get.

406
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,100
Put people between
yourself and the target.

407
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,050
Make them come to you.

408
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,200
Yes,I'm looking for a mr. Henderson.

409
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,650
Ah,thank you.

410
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,550
Mr. Henderson?

411
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,000
Charles finley.

412
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,170
We spoke on the phone.

413
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,680
It's good to meet you.

414
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,160
Cristo said you were a good man.

415
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,710
He... He vouched for you.

416
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,830
Listen,can I get you a drink...

417
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,850
Some 20-year-old
single malt?

418
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,020
Thanks,but no.

419
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,540
I... I'm not a drinker.

420
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,470
Look,I'll get right down to business.

421
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,320
I represent a group of clients who deal
in merchandise that is bought and sold,

422
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,080
let's just say,quietly.

423
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,910
I understand that you have
something we might be interested in.

424
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,090
If I do business with a man,I
have to meet with him face-to-face.

425
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,090
I'm sorry,but that won't be possible.

426
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,240
For obvious reasons,discretion
is extremely important to us.

427
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,030
It's important to me,too.

428
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:04,340
If he would like to come
to my home,that's fine.

429
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,990
We could talk.

430
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,410
Otherwise...

431
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,830
No guarantees,sir,but I'll
try and make the arrangements.

432
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,370
Good day.

433
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,130
Hey,Sam. How's it going?

434
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,060
I got us a meeting for tomorrow.

435
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,470
We'll talk later. My
libyan just showed up.

436
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,090
Fine,but,from now on,

437
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,640
no cover I.D.S that involve
turning down 20-year-old scotch.

438
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,150
ANWAR 
LIBYAN OPERATIVE

439
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,460
Who are you?

440
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,960
Well,hello to you,too.

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
My name is Michael Westen.

442
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,370
I heard you were in town.

443
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,510
Just wanted to say hi.

444
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,140
You're Westen?

445
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,480
I thought you would be taller.

446
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,330
You can put the gun
down. I just want to talk.

447
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,770
With you?

448
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,930
I've heard,people talk to you,

449
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,520
sometimes they don't live so long.

450
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,770
Well,that was then. Ask around.

451
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,010
My situation has changed.

452
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,080
My side isn't talking to me anymore,

453
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,490
so that leaves you guys.

454
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,770
Don't make up your mind right now.

455
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,340
Do your homework.

456
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,650
See what you think.

457
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,910
I'm around.

458
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,120
Are in their convertible
at the gas station,

459
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,860
and she had her baby in the back.

460
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,750
Am interrupting something?

461
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,830
Thomas made dinner.

462
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,180
Yeah,to say thank you.

463
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,540
I,uh,I did make some
for you,Mike,but,um...

464
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,150
We ate it because it was so good.

465
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,950
How'd it go with Sam?

466
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,150
Great. The meeting is set with lawrence.

467
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,890
If I can get him to bring
the brooch out into the open,

468
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,110
we can get him caught with it.

469
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,620
So I might get to go home soon?

470
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,010
Let's hope so.

471
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,420
He's locked down pretty tight.

472
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,090
He's either expecting
an armored assault...

473
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,990
Or he has something to protect.

474
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,620
Unfortunately,we only
have a few minutes.

475
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,900
We have some important meetings.

476
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,560
Well,thank you for coming,mr. Uh...

477
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,570
Smith.

478
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,910
Smith?

479
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,570
Yes. Typically,with this sort of deal,

480
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,940
we like to keep things not
so personal...You understand?

481
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,100
For security purposes.

482
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,160
Normally,I do not like
to do meetings in person,

483
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,130
but for a piece like this,I was
willing to make an exception.

484
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,910
Well,the way I see it,

485
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,700
you can't trust a man if you
can't look him in the eye.

486
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,790
Am I right?

487
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,960
Of course you're right.

488
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,630
Mr. Finley,you can wait right here.

489
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,900
It's important that I stay...

490
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,330
Charles,that's fine.

491
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,420
Well,the least I can do is...

492
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,910
I'll take care of it.

493
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,060
Something to drink,sir?

494
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,500
Yeah,water will be just great.

495
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,640
Thank you.

496
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,430
So how did you hear about me?

497
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,800
I've worked with cristo before.

498
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,790
And the people you've
contacted in europe

499
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,080
aren't being as discreet
as you might like.

500
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Is that right?

501
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,930
Word is out.

502
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,280
None of my business,but
I would sell quickly.

503
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,880
It might not be long
before somebody tries

504
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,160
to take it off your hands
without your consent,

505
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,060
shall we say.

506
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,040
Well,let me worry about that.

507
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,050
That brooch isn't going anywhere soon.

508
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,760
Oh,don't be pessimistic.

509
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,490
Let me see what I can
do to pry it loose.

510
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,900
Brass tacks,then.

511
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,340
The item is worth $2 million.

512
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,500
I could give it to you
for $1.75 million cash.

513
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,650
For something I have to
cut up into little pieces?

514
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,150
Hmm,no.

515
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,850
$1.2 million is more than generous.

516
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,750
Then let's call it $1.6
million and be done.

517
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,120
Let me show you something.

518
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,180
Stolen from an armored
truck over two years ago.

519
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,620
I picked it up this morning
for 50 cents on the dollar.

520
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,640
Would you like to talk
to cristo about it?

521
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,910
$1.25 million.

522
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,310
I'm being very generous
offering $1.2 million.

523
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,030
Fine.

524
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,290
In cash...

525
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,160
Small,used bills.

526
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:29,830
Excellent.

527
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,720
Of course,I'll need to see it first.

528
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,790
Just because someone believes
you are who you say you are

529
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,820
doesn't mean he'll do
what you want him to do.

530
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,190
There it is.

531
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,010
Cute.

532
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,820
I'm serious.

533
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,730
Mr. Smith,this brooch
isn't coming out to play

534
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,420
till you come back with the money
in that little case of yours.

535
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,430
Fine.

536
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,210
We do the deal tomorrow,but not here.

537
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,590
We have to take the diamonds out to
an independent lab for authentication.

538
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,670
We do it here,where I can control it,

539
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,320
or it doesn't happen at all.

540
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,150
I'm afraid an independent testing
site is a deal breaker for me.

541
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,200
Then I'm afraid we don't have a deal.

542
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,530
Pity.

543
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,280
Lawrence needs the money.

544
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,000
He thinks it's too risky
to move the brooch now.

545
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,960
What do we do?

546
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,330
Convince him it's too risky to stay put.

547
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,300
I already planted the idea that
somebody might be trying to steal it.

548
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,870
We need to back that
up,push on his paranoia.

549
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,080
*****

550
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,520
I thought you said that his
place was impossible to get into.

551
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,460
It is...

552
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,010
Between the security
system,the guards,and the safe,

553
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,830
we'd need a small army. ***

554
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,810
We'll just have to make him
think we've got a small army.

555
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,700
Christ,this is turning into
a full psych-op campaign.

556
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,980
What are we talking about here?

557
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,110
Psychological warfare.

558
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,090
Give you an example.

559
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,970
U.S. Used to broadcast static
to soviet listening posts,

560
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,550
trying to get them to think
it was some new kind of cipher.

561
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,600
So they spent all kinds of rubles,

562
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,110
basically trying to decode white noise.

563
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,770
We need to convince the enemy
we're stronger than we are.

564
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah,except it takes forever.

565
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,620
Mike,I was supposed to go
car shopping with veronica.

566
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,230
We're talking cadillacs,you know.

567
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,340
You need to do it next week.

568
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,570
We got a lot of work to do.

569
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,900
You two scout it out.

570
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,600
I got to get ready for the meeting.

571
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,850
Clandestine meetings
are never fun to arrange.

572
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,270
It's a big part of the
job for a covert operative,

573
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,350
but it's never pleasant.

574
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,240
get in.

575
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,700
Where's anwar?

576
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,470
It's not so much the fear
of death that bothers you.

577
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,370
It's driving to the meet
with a bag over your head.

578
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,840
Sometimes they wash the bag.

579
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,240
Sometimes they don't.

580
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,420
Guys,you're really missing
out on the miami beach scene,

581
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,430
staying in a place like this.

582
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,640
Have you checked out the beach hotels?

583
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,360
They're surprisingly
affordable in the off-season.

584
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,250
Guys?

585
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,600
Okay,you wanted to talk.

586
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,120
Talk.

587
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,020
You checked out my situation,I assume.

588
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,750
Your own people turned on you?

589
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,750
Yes. So what?

590
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,910
Now you're working for us?

591
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,660
Why should I believe this?

592
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,230
Your government would like to know

593
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,970
who attacked your gas-supply
depot in ghadamis in 2002.

594
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,620
I could supply that information.

595
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,680
And why would you do this for us?

596
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,320
The u.S. And libya have mutual enemies.

597
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,450
This would be a win-win
situation for everyone...

598
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,010
Well,everyone except for the guys
who blew up the gas-supply depot.

599
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,320
Why don't I just make
you tell me,then kill you?

600
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,660
You could do that.

601
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,290
The information might
or might not check out...

602
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,190
Torture is unreliable,as you know...

603
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,940
And then you'd have to deal with Fiona,

604
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,320
who put me in touch with you.

605
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,530
More trouble than it's worth,trust me.

606
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,330
All right.

607
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,230
What do you want?

608
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,370
I'm trying to reach out
to the man who burned me...

609
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,660
Nsa officer philip cowan.

610
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,000
I just need you to mention
him as a friend of yours

611
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,690
when you know the
americans are listening.

612
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,990
A friend?

613
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,830
And say what?

614
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,070
I don't know.

615
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,390
Have the head of your secret
police send him a fruit basket.

616
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,120
Be creative.

617
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,640
He'll try to figure out
what the hell is going on,

618
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,820
and,in no time,he'll figure out it's me.

619
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,900
We'll think about it.

620
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,360
I love this part.

621
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,200
You ready back there?

622
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,940
Drive.

623
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,650
The thing about security
is that the very things

624
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,700
that protect you can
be turned against you

625
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,110
by someone who knows what he's doing.

626
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,650
It's tough to compromise a
well-thought-out security system,

627
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,230
but making someonethink
you can compromise it...

628
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,470
Well,that's much easier.

629
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,270
Take surveillance cameras,for example.

630
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,650
You can disable one by
shooting a laser at it

631
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,260
and overloading the
light-sensitive chip.

632
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,870
Cheap,easy...

633
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,140
...And exactly the sort of thing

634
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,280
a sophisticated criminal gang
with lots of resources would do.

635
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,470
Leave around some telltale
signs of surveillance,

636
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,290
like cigarette butts,a
forgotten camera-lens cap.

637
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,690
And the more security there is,

638
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,170
the more likely they are to think
they've got a very serious problem.

639
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,680
Even the security team
itself can be an opportunity.

640
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,360
The more employees you have,

641
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,230
the more you have to worry about.

642
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,260
Hello

643
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,640
- Can I help you? 
- maybe.

644
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,960
You work at the hendersons'.

645
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,030
You're ted,right?

646
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,840
Yeah,who are you?

647
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,140
My name isn't important.

648
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,060
We've been watching you.

649
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,090
You look like you
could use a little help.

650
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,220
We'll be in touch.

651
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,700
Deliver some vague threats and a few
hundred bucks to a security guard.

652
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,830
If he's honest,he'll tell his boss,

653
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,750
who then wonders whowasn'tso honest.

654
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,130
For the cost of a nice dinner,

655
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,980
you can get a whole
security team canned.

656
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,380
- Here you go,rocky.
- Okay, man

657
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,320
Thank you.

658
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,660
Mike,I got to tell you,

659
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,330
this is more fun than I expected.

660
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,630
I mean,I haven't done
this sort of thing since...

661
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,600
Gee,since there was an east germany.

662
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,620
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

663
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,880
So,how are things at home?

664
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,490
A little strange.

665
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,890
Fiona likes to test relationships with
the emotional equivalent of artillery fire.

666
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,530
Does she even want this guy?

667
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,200
I don't know. I've never
been able to figure her out.

668
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,950
Well,I'm not one to tell
you how to live your life.

669
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,990
Hang on.

670
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,000
It's our buddy lawrence.

671
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,750
Charles finley here.

672
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,030
Yes?

673
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,880
Well,I'm not sure if
the offer still stands,

674
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,070
but I can talk to him.

675
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,090
No guarantees,but I'll do my best.

676
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,180
Bye-bye.

677
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,250
- How'd it go?
- Good.

678
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,920
I think we got him whipped
into a pretty good lather.

679
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,850
He wants to meet you at the hotel.

680
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,070
I'll let him stew for a bit.

681
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,450
Call him back when I'm
done with my slushie.

682
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,970
Mr. Smith,it's good to see you.

683
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,230
We can have our meeting in my office.

684
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,460
I was about to leave
town when charles called.

685
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,660
I'm happy to talk,but my
conditions haven't changed.

686
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,050
We just have some issues
with timing... Details.

687
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,520
It's right this way.

688
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,710
One of the dangers of any
kind of psychological warfare

689
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,830
is it can betooeffective and send
the target into a paranoid tailspin.

690
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,210
I have to thank you for
telling me to check my security.

691
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,710
We've had some problems at the house.

692
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,200
Happens all the time in this business.

693
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,640
Better safe than sorry.

694
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,860
I agree entirely.

695
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,550
That paranoia can be
useful... or deadly.

696
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,370
At first,I thought it might
be one of the europeans

697
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,820
I was talking to about the brooch,

698
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,680
trying to rip me off.

699
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,230
And then I thought
that didn't make sense.

700
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,080
So I said,"it might be cristo."

701
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,650
so I brought him in.

702
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,520
Listen,whatever he told
you,whatever you think...

703
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:08,630
He has said some very
interesting things about you.

704
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,440
5 pounds of pressure
on his carotid artery,

705
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,790
he'll bleed out in 20 seconds.

706
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,600
Let him go.

707
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,020
That's not all you have to worry about.

708
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,780
I could crush his windpipe
with the tie if I'm not careful.

709
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,970
Oops. Back off.

710
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,290
Back off.

711
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,800
Back off!

712
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,980
Next time,lawrence,go limp.

713
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,510
It's really hard to drag a human shield.

714
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,930
Jesus. I mean,he really
tried to kill you?

715
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,670
It didn't get that far,but it was
heading in that direction,yeah.

716
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,830
I mean,w- what are you gonna do?

717
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,800
I mean,h- he knows who you are.

718
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,310
No,he just knows I'm
not who I said I was...

719
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,310
A big difference.

720
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,910
He still thinks we're gonna rip him off.

721
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,750
He still thinks his security
system is compromised.

722
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,180
He's still got to move the brooch.

723
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,130
And we've still got to get him busted***

724
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,120
We just need to figure
out where he's taking it.

725
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,890
But how are we gonna do that?

726
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,610
I've got some friends.

727
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,880
There he is.

728
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,630
Hey.

729
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,040
How'd it go? You work your magic?

730
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,350
Magic was made.

731
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,710
You have something for me?

732
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,040
Michael wanted you to know that
that was compliments of cristo.

733
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,940
Tico,hit me.

734
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,020
Bloody mary.

735
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:30,980
Well... In that case,lawrence has
accounts at five banks in the miami area.

736
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,160
Only one with a safe-deposit
operation is dade trust,downtown.

737
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,170
Yeah,any good?

738
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,040
You kidding?

739
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,060
Best in miami.

740
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Thank you.

741
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,280
If he's moving that
brooch,he'll go there.

742
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,450
Nice.

743
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,870
What else can you tell
me about dade trust?

744
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,990
You buying lunch?

745
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,680
You're the money
launder,for christ's sake.

746
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,150
Why doihave to buy lunch?

747
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,050
I know,I know,get in.

748
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,870
Can we do it without the head bag?

749
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,600
I hate the head bag.

750
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:13,370
So,this information you
have,we are interested.

751
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,610
And philip cowan?

752
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,720
Arrangements are being made.

753
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,330
That should give you what you need

754
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,230
to find out who the team was
that blew up your gas depot.

755
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,740
Don't be gentle on them.

756
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,860
They hurt a lot of innocent people.

757
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,480
The security services in my country
are not known for being gentle.

758
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,290
Michael,if you ever want
a job... Real work...

759
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,170
Let us know.

760
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,670
I'm flattered,but I've
got someplace to be.

761
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,730
The key to good security is
good systems...Consistency...

762
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,370
But those very systems
make you predictable.

763
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,490
Where will you take your valuables?

764
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,820
A bank you trust.

765
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,090
How are you going to get there?

766
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,510
With armed men in a big s.U.V.

767
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,920
When will you go?

768
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,840
When the bank is least crowded.

769
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,990
All good procedure,all 100% predictable.

770
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,830
Fi,they're on their way.

771
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,140
Yo?

772
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,160
All set,Sam?

773
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,790
I'm here. Good to go.

774
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,120
Looks like they're taking the highway.

775
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,430
They should be there in 5.

776
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,900
I'll call it in.

777
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,520
Yes,hello.

778
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,100
Is this the police?

779
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,430
Listen,I'd like to
report a bank robbery.

780
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,250
Yes,it's at dade trust,downtown.

781
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,610
I'm inside the building.

782
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,860
I can't talk loud.

783
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,520
There were men in an s.U.V. With guns.

784
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,970
Yes,they're here.

785
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,660
Oh,my god.

786
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,310
I have to go.

787
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,010
If you know someone's going to
be at a bank at a particular time,

788
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,900
it's not hard to make it look
like they're robbing the bank.

789
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,620
Shoot out a few
video-surveillance cameras.

790
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,910
Block off the street with a stolen car,

791
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,390
like they're preparing an escape route.

792
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,010
Fire up a spark-gap transmitter to
kill the security radios at the bank,

793
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,340
and they'll look like they
know what they're doing.

794
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,900
Mr. Smith,you're too late.

795
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,930
You sure?

796
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,450
Check the top floor of
the building behind you.

797
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,090
Gun!

798
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,440
You'll like prison,lawrence.

799
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,580
Drop your weapon!

800
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,270
They got a lot of cool security systems.

801
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,150
This is a mistake.

802
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,610
That's mine,that's mine.

803
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,050
*****

804
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,130
T- that's mine.

805
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,910
That's mine!

806
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,660
Quiet! Turn around!

807
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,040
All this to clear the
name of an innocent man.

808
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,370
That's noble.

809
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,670
You should be proud.

810
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,370
You know who I did this for,fi.

811
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,260
All right,I'm here.

812
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,910
What couldn't you say over the phone?

813
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,550
Bondsman won't have
anything to do with me now

814
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,890
that you've told him I
was aiding and abetting.

815
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,370
So I was thinking,when
you collect your bounty,

816
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,650
maybe we could split it.

817
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,220
Yeah,that's what you thought,huh?

818
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,910
I wouldn't be expecting a
check anytime soon. come on

819
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,840
Consider it a "sorry I brained
you with a snow globe" gift.

820
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,010
Why'd you wait to turn him in?

821
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:31,470
He was gonna pay us
off,but his check bounced.

822
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,440
You're all heart,lady.

823
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,490
Come on.

824
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,040
Mr. Bragin,wayne ray here.

825
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,900
I just collared mckee,and
I'm hauling him in right now.

826
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,340
Real cute.

827
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,270
You know,Fiona,next time...

828
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,900
Yeah,yeah,yeah.

829
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,730
Later,wayne.

830
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,460
I looked around for a washing machine.

831
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,620
I was gonna do the sheets.

832
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,620
Howdoyou do laundry,man?

833
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,910
I'll take care of it.

834
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,680
- Hello?
- You think this is funny?

835
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,100
Who's this?

836
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,240
This is philip cowan.

837
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,570
Nice to finally hear your voice.

838
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,040
You want to tell me what the
head of the libyan secret police

839
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,500
is doing sending me a fruit basket?

840
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,000
I got the fbi on my front lawn.

841
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,720
Yeah,well,welcome to my world,

842
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,490
and I'm just getting started.

843
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,800
I'd love to see what we can get the
north koreans to send you,or hezbollah,

844
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,900
and it doesn't stop until
you tell me why I was burned.

845
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,170
I was set up,and I want to know why.

846
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,230
Phil?

847
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,610
I'll be in touch.

848
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,300
Count on it.

849
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,920
Hey,man,if you got an important call,

850
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,520
I can just clear out.

851
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,800
No,it's fine.

852
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,710
My lawyer says my case is looking good,

853
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,840
but I got to go clear
it up in court tomorrow.

854
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,960
I would show up this time.

855
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:19,070
So,8 grand doesn't seem like
that much for what you guys did.

856
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,430
But here.

857
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,360
You're sweet.

858
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,080
Thank you.

859
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,800
You should go,thomas.

860
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,320
I'm not sure all the bounty hunters that are looking
for you got the memo that you're off the hook.

861
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,420
I wouldn't want you getting tasered
in the middle of our nice moment.

862
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,540
Well thanks.

863
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,110
I got you something,too.
