1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:01,876
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:04,161
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,173
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,732 --> 00:00:09,789
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:12,261
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,800
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,265
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,237
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:25,565
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:28,443
<i>An old friend
who used to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,821
You know spies,
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:33,240
- <i>Family, too...</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,450
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,078
<i>Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:39,955
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:48,214
<i>Nobody wants to hear
from a burned spy.</i>

18
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,466
<i>Your old handlers
send your calls to voice-mail,</i>

19
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,637
<i>your appeals are filed in the trash,
your old contacts are worthless.</i>

20
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,014
<i>Your best bet is to find an operative
who can't hang up on you.</i>

21
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:02,212
<i>If you're on domestic soil,
the airport's not a bad place to look.</i>

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,481
<i>Intelligence agencies
are like amateur magicians.</i>

23
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:09,193
<i>Watch closely and you can see
how they set up their tricks.</i>

24
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:12,801
<i>It doesn't matter how good they are
at misdirection and sleight of hand,</i>

25
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:16,555
<i>they can't make a covert-ops
supply plane disappear.</i>

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,050
4UMY

27
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:19,216
314.

28
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:23,332
You just wrecked
the most amazing dream.

29
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,488
All these beautiful nachos
were coming right.

30
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:27,962
4UMY314, runway 3.

31
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,549
- No flight plan, no problem?
- Yep, it's not a drug plane,

32
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,493
had clearance from the tower.
It's got to be a black flight.

33
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,680
Bringing toys to all the little spooks
in Latin America.

34
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:41,379
Tell me this means
I can go back to sleep in my own bed.

35
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:44,728
Is that how you celebrate these days?
Say it ain't so.

36
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,587
- You look...
- Like I'm ready for lunch?

37
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:59,467
I thought after a week of you
eating fast food in the car with Sam,

38
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:01,642
that you might like to take me.

39
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:06,208
I can't today. I found a spy plane.
I got the tail number.

40
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:11,338
Why do you use that shot for fake IDs?
It's like a bad prom picture.

41
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,707
I need to get records from the FAA.
You need a driver's licen...

42
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:18,053
I think
it makes me look trustworthy.

43
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:23,350
I need to find out who owns the plane,
who flies it, who registered it.

44
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,714
One of those people might be able
to pull some strings, get me back in.

45
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:31,277
- And you've to find them immediately?
- There's no time like the present.

46
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,321
It's time for Duane Winger
to make his move.

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,193
Great. I'm going to lunch.
Have fun getting your job back.

48
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,550
I know you don't like
what I'm doing,

49
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,080
but you know it's not
just about the job.

50
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,187
- You know that, right?
- Right.

51
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,295
It's about patriotism and duty...

52
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,589
and the sacred call of...

53
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,229
- Whatever.
- I was told...

54
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:00,679
that hell on earth would rain down on me
without an umbrella.

55
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:02,468
I don't know, Duane.

56
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:04,724
Looks pretty sunny out there to me.

57
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,343
I'm gonna enjoy it.

58
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,148
Prom picture?

59
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,118
Here we go.

60
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:20,574
The plane you're asking about
is owned by Executransport Ltd.

61
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:23,601
Want to write it down?
You can borrow my pen.

62
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:25,926
How about you pull the whole file?

63
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:28,707
- Could I borrow that?
- You're bad.

64
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:30,365
We can't sign files out.

65
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,795
Everything back here
is look but don't touch.

66
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,630
That is a shame.

67
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:38,293
I'm gonna level with you.
I'm a PI working a messy divorce.

68
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,761
Sleaze bag hubby's hiding the jet
under a shell company.

69
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:44,753
One little copy sure would help.

70
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,894
It'll be our little secret, miss...

71
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,020
Linda.

72
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,928
<i>Will Duane Winger
please report to reception?</i>

73
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:57,140
<i>Duane Winger to reception, please.</i>

74
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:00,072
The guy just wanted the files.
What's the big deal?

75
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,241
I just got a call
from the deputy director.

76
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:04,472
That file was red-flagged.

77
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,454
<i>When you get cornered,
there's a rush of adrenaline</i>

78
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,383
<i>as the fight-or-flight response
kicks in.</i>

79
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:11,866
<i>In those moments,
you can't listen to your body.</i>

80
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:15,108
<i>There are some circumstances
when flight just isn't the right option.</i>

81
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,993
<i>Fortunately, with a little training
and the right kind of hitch knot,</i>

82
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:21,343
<i>that adrenaline can make you capable
of something pretty close to flight.</i>

83
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:31,284
Doesn't help the landing, though.

84
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,445
Yogurt
Team

85
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,508
Barry wanted $1,000

86
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,704
to look into the company
that owned that plane?

87
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:53,257
Yeah, sorry. He said to get the articles
of incorporation,

88
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:55,532
he's got to go up to the Capitol.

89
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,839
Is he taking a cab to Tallahassee?

90
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,963
His mom is up there,
so he's got to see her.

91
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,013
The grand is like an annoyance tax.

92
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:09,076
Fair enough.

93
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:12,946
Money well spent, Mikey.

94
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:15,718
You track down the spooks
that are flying that plane,

95
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:19,610
get them to call in a few favors,
you might no longer be stuck in Miami.

96
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,477
And you won't have to buy me drinks
after range practice.

97
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:26,681
Subtle, Sam.

98
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:29,077
That's me, Mike.
See the olive?

99
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,266
I'm not complaining, but where's Fi?
It's not like her to skip our ritual.

100
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,419
Usually any chance
to pop off some rounds...

101
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,921
- She wasn't too thrilled.
- You in the sunglasses!

102
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,172
Can I see that gun?

103
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,219
- Careful there.
- I'm sorry. I promise I won't hurt you.

104
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,888
- That's good.
- It's you. I knew you existed.

105
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,890
- Who are you?
- My name's Spencer.

106
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,726
I didn't mean to scare you.
I had to make sure it was you.

107
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,937
He's the guy, right?
He's a special-ops guy.

108
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,916
<i>There are times in any spy's career</i>

109
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,825
<i>when someone somehow figures out
who you are.</i>

110
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,026
I need your help.

111
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,071
<i>The best approach
is to put on a good poker face</i>

112
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,657
<i>- and deny everything.</i>
- I think you have the wrong idea.

113
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,868
I've been monitoring the papers,

114
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,955
certain items in the blotter,
and crime rates, police-band chatter,

115
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,789
It all adds up.
It becomes clear.

116
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,939
- Not yet, it doesn't.
- The pattern. There's a pattern.

117
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:19,835
You don't just have

118
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,855
a series of explosions here
and a dip in violent crime there.

119
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,136
Ask yourself
what and who are the connection.

120
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,427
I think we're not talking
about Spiderman.

121
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,586
It's a real guy who has to practice.

122
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:31,811
So, I did an estimate,
and I got 63% odds

123
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:34,779
that he lives within a 5 mile radius
of this gun range, so...

124
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:37,121
Once you see a pattern,
you can't unsee it.

125
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:42,651
So, you've been staking out here,
looking for...

126
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:47,025
You and your gun and your skills
and that thing that you did with the...

127
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,484
All that seems to confirm
to me that you are the guy.

128
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:53,203
- You have to help me. You're the guy.
- What can I say? I'm not the guy.

129
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:58,964
It's a lie. You lied very convincingly,
as any trained operative would.

130
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:02,129
But, help me! I don't want to make you,
but I will if I have to.

131
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,730
He's an operative!
This guy! He's very famous!

132
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:07,173
He's a rogue agent,
special operatives guy!

133
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,829
Fine. We're gonna talk.
Boy, we're gonna talk.

134
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,107
He's the spy.
So, who are you?

135
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:24,902
No offense, Spencer,
but who are you?

136
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,289
I'm a mathematician, MIT.
Did my doctoral work at Duke.

137
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,434
You need help?

138
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,966
About a year ago,
I started to work at Stone Kittredge.

139
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,049
They do a lot of government contracts.
Construction, energy, tech...

140
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,860
It's a defense firm.
We know them.

141
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:39,583
I've seen some things there
that I shouldn't have.

142
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:44,546
One of their vice presidents is a...
well, a killer.

143
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,300
Is this just some kind of a joke?

144
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,553
She's killed 3 already. I guess
it will happen again, in Malaysia.

145
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:52,917
Malaysia?

146
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,891
I'm not sure what's going on here,
but do you have proof of something?

147
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:57,858
No, but how do you explain this?

148
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:01,261
I used my friend Brad's workstation
to do some digging around in the system.

149
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:02,330
2 days later,

150
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:04,900
the gas line at his house blew up,
he was burned to death.

151
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:08,619
They thought he was onto them,
so they killed my friend.

152
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:09,822
Calm down.

153
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,783
Let's back it up, Spencer.
Why were you using Brad's computer?

154
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,077
I don't have a computer
at the office.

155
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,247
I take care of the plants
at Stone Kittredge.

156
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:21,834
- There it is.
- I am too busy for a full-time job!

157
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,149
Do you have any idea how many messages
I have to decode every day?

158
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:27,453
Hundreds!
Do you think beings that advanced sleep?

159
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:30,967
- I'm sorry. "Beings"?
- Would you like me to say "Aliens"?

160
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,321
The bad ones are from
a nearby star system, Procyon A.

161
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,114
They take our form.

162
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,647
They encode their messages
in beams of light.

163
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:41,236
Gorgeous mathematics
wrapped around deadly messages.

164
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:42,688
But the Guardians,

165
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,023
they are from a planet
that orbits around Ross 154,

166
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,527
and they are being hunted.
Three of them are dead already.

167
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,241
- Every minute that we waste...
- Just calm down a little bit.

168
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,050
No, damn it! There is no time!

169
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,705
Spencer, calm down. Calm down.
It's okay.

170
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,430
Excuse me, there's something I need
right over here.

171
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,086
Sit down. Sorry.

172
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,533
He started talking about aliens...

173
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:10,632
and crazy stuff.
He thought I was a spy.

174
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,676
You know,
like James Bond or something.

175
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,683
- You don't want to file a report?
- No.

176
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:18,348
We just didn't want to see him
hurt himself or anybody else.

177
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,269
Those are the magic words
every time this guy goes to court.

178
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:23,023
He's been in before?

179
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,935
Dispatch told us that he has been
in and out of the psych ward

180
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,575
for the past four years.

181
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,195
Big-time schizo. Sad stuff, but thanks.
Appreciate your help, all right?

182
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,363
Take care.

183
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,825
If you're looking for a silver lining,
it's nice we can still call the cops.

184
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,677
Can't believe he found me, Sam.

185
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:43,525
Don't worry, most people can't decode
the secrets hidden in beams of light.

186
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,293
I don't know about you,
but I could use that drink now.

187
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:52,702
<i>A money launderer's natural habitat
is near rich people.</i>

188
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:54,930
<i>What they save by avoiding taxes</i>

189
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,297
<i>they usually spend
on overpriced drinks,</i>

190
00:09:57,516 --> 00:09:59,648
<i>but meeting with them
is never boring.</i>

191
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:00,873
Jesus, Mike.

192
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,938
"Meet me at the Chadwicke.
I'm poolside. Bring cash."

193
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,524
This text doesn't have a smiley face.
What happened to my friend Barry?

194
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:13,202
You know I don't like charging you,
but that was a big favor.

195
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,577
I go up north,
I got to stay with my mom.

196
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:18,075
She's still mad at me
I dropped out of podiatry school.

197
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,370
Makes me nuts.
Anyway, I need to unwind.

198
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:23,705
The view here helps...

199
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:25,039
a lot.

200
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,754
Executransport Ltd.

201
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,721
You're probably not gonna be shocked
to hear that it's a shell company

202
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,634
and its registrants
don't even exist.

203
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,095
Officially speaking,
nobody owns the plane you saw.

204
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,806
- Not shocked, no.
- But it wasn't a total dead end.

205
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,807
There's a business
tied to that plane?

206
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,811
North Andes Distribution.
They got a hangar over at the airport.

207
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,105
Probably packed the cargo
on the flight you saw.

208
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:50,511
Not bad, Barry.

209
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:53,819
Before you go,
will you help me out here, Mike?

210
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:55,897
Do my back?

211
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,728
- Look who's back.
- Hey, man.

212
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:10,702
I'm so sorry to bother you at home,
especially after...

213
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:14,214
I shouldn't have done that...
With the table.

214
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:17,467
Your new friend was explaining
that he hacked the DMV

215
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,657
and found your place
thanks to a parking ticket.

216
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,974
- He's really very clever.
- So, they let you out?

217
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,208
They may have.

218
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,824
The nurses don't disguise
the pattern of the rounds,

219
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,479
and the locks are child's play.

220
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:32,816
No hard feelings.
I know you were testing me.

221
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:35,902
You can't be here.

222
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:39,031
We shouldn't be out in the open.
They're probably looking for me.

223
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,324
- The aliens?
- The police.

224
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:44,286
I broke out of a psych ward.
Weren't you listening?

225
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,164
We can't do anything for you.

226
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,530
People think I'm not right,
but I'm right.

227
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,877
I'm right about this.
They killed my friend.

228
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,215
Please, just let me show you
what I learned.

229
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,341
I found you, didn't I?

230
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:00,092
He doesn't seem that crazy.

231
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,054
All right.

232
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:03,555
Show us.

233
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:16,151
Okay. I was wrong.
He's totally nuts.

234
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,577
Sorry about the...

235
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:21,030
There's something that I really need
to show you in the paper.

236
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,783
Can't find anything in this mess.

237
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:26,671
Sometimes I lose track of things
when I leave them on the ceiling.

238
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,251
No. That's...

239
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,900
Okay. We can start there.

240
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,518
This is the one
I was telling you about.

241
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:37,260
Three killed in the past four months,
just like I said.

242
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:40,258
You said "Aliens".
This looks like American spies.

243
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,132
The forms they take vary, but...

244
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:45,555
You're saying these men were outed
by an executive at Stone Kittredge?

245
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,350
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- Wait a second. Ronald Papa?

246
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,566
They said this was
a climbing accident.

247
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:52,854
This guy was a friend of mine.
I worked with him.

248
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:55,065
Good. You worked
with one of the Guardians.

249
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,441
Don't do that.

250
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:58,479
I sent flowers to Ron's wife,

251
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:00,821
don't be making up stories
about real people.

252
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:04,032
I'm not. I lost a friend, too.
My friend, Brad,

253
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,219
the one they killed to cover it up.

254
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:07,869
The one I told you about.

255
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:11,892
See, you just have to read all these.
Please, read them all.

256
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,626
These are just a bunch
of newspaper articles.

257
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:17,254
No. There's a pattern.
You have to see the pattern.

258
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,755
It's all connected.

259
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,578
There's a galactic war between these,
the bad ones.

260
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:24,635
The ones from Procyon A
are hunting the Guardians,

261
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,511
and guys like Brad,
who get in the middle, they kill them,

262
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:29,266
then the darkness will come.

263
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,921
Unless you...
It's up to you to stop them.

264
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:37,394
I know this guy.

265
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,317
He's a good guy.
He's a good doctor.

266
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,010
I want you to meet him.

267
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:45,079
<i>Whether you're infiltrating a cartel
or spiking a chemical-weapons sale,</i>

268
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:48,993
<i>the most dangerous people in any
covert op are the ones on your side.</i>

269
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,530
<i>If they crack,
you end up in a shallow grave.</i>

270
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,069
<i>That's usually a good enough reason
to avoid working with crazy people.</i>

271
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:01,381
Diplomat found dead in Malaysia.

272
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:03,797
<i>But sometimes you have no choice.</i>

273
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:06,160
That's the one!
See, it's like I told you.

274
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:07,735
It's today's paper.

275
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,098
It happened like he said it would.

276
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,351
If "Aliens" equals "Spies"...

277
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:15,979
What's wrong?

278
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:19,608
Spencer, I was really hoping
you were just crazy.

279
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,998
Okay. Let me get this straight.

280
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:38,034
2007, Stone Kittredge
gets the contract

281
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,879
to provide secure communications
between American embassies.

282
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:45,008
So they do the usual firewall crap,
plus they come up with a code.

283
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:46,249
Called Zydeco.

284
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,329
Okay, and you think somebody there
is intercepting these encrypted e-mails

285
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,278
and selling the names
of American spies.

286
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:54,452
- That's your theory.
- What these Procyon beings

287
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:57,624
are really doing is exposing
the Guardians from Ross 154.

288
00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:59,439
Right, like my buddy Ronnie.

289
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,047
But how do you know it's somebody
inside of Stone Kittredge

290
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:04,778
and not some whack job on the outside
who just cracked the code?

291
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,374
That's absurd.

292
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:09,991
Absurd like "Aliens are sending me
messages through the pennysaver" absurd?

293
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,619
Zydeco's unbreakable.
It's a four-kilobyte code.

294
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,787
4k?

295
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,581
I got pictures of Mrs. Reynolds
bigger than that.

296
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,085
No, an algorithmic code that takes up
4k of space is beyond secure.

297
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,237
It would take longer than the whole life
of the universe to crack it.

298
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:24,430
Impossible.

299
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:27,861
There's no way. You'd really need
the code to read those messages.

300
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:30,887
All right. Relax. Maybe there's
another way that we can do this.

301
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:35,267
- Will you sit down?
- There she is! That's her!

302
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:38,103
In the black! That's Shannon Park!
Her team created Zydeco!

303
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:40,564
She kept a copy?

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,246
I know she has access
to the embassy e-mail system.

305
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,700
That much I saw myself.

306
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:47,558
That's how my friend Brad got killed.
She thought he was onto her.

307
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,657
I'm telling you,
she's a murderer and a traitor.

308
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:55,248
And you can see how she takes
our form, but I swear, she's an alien.

309
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:00,544
Let's stick to Earth problems.

310
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,403
We need to look at Shannon's files.

311
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,463
If she has an unauthorized copy
of Zydeco, we can get her busted.

312
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,264
You can't get into her system.
It's Fort Knox.

313
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:10,677
No. I tried to get in remotely,
and I couldn't do it.

314
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:14,445
We hit her office,
we bury a keystroke-tracking program,

315
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,684
come back the next day for her password.
We get the e-mails and the code.

316
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:21,630
No, no. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh, but she's...

317
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,857
No, these are very advanced beings.

318
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,381
No, she'd be able to tell
if you were on her computer.

319
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,445
I think she's a little out
of your league.

320
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,904
OK, Mr. Computer.

321
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:32,306
Is she out of your league?

322
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:35,327
We need you to get us access
at Stone Kittredge.

323
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:41,330
Jeremy Dresner, consulting in IT.

324
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:44,585
There should be a visitor badge
in the system for me.

325
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:47,843
<i>In medieval Europe, </i>

326
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:51,015

00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,508

<i>In today's corporate office, </i>

329
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:57,767
<i>posing as IT works the same way.</i>

330
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,589
<i>It's the perfect cover if you need
to linger without being bothered,</i>

331
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,719
<i>and it gives you a pretext
for talking to almost anyone.</i>

332
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:06,105
Ms. Park,

333
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:09,694
Jeremy Dresner, IT, Alexandria office.
I need to speak with you.

334
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:12,389
- Great. Make an appointment.
- No problem. How about now?

335
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:13,907
Excuse me?

336
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,838
We're doing an internal audit
of security procedures.

337
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,828
I've the paperwork.

338
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:22,248
We were told your whole department
would be cooperative, Ms. Park.

339
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,765
That's funny, Jeremy,

340
00:17:23,953 --> 00:17:26,628
I'm the head of this department,
and nobody's said word one to me.

341
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:29,214
Well, here I am,
and we're way past word one now.

342
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:31,508
Security is our business
on this wing.

343
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,933
Your business is installing
software upgrades,

344
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:37,113
I suggest you have somebody up on 14
give me a call about this.

345
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:39,228
And I suggest they send
somebody else next time.

346
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:42,469
I bet they will.
I'll bet they'll send you up to see me.

347
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:44,553
I'm looking forward to it.

348
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:52,057
Can I borrow your bathroom key?

349
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:55,365
You're my hero.

350
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,788
<i>All you need to beat
a modern tumbler lock </i>

351
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,124
<i>is a little information
and some stone-age tools.</i>

352
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:07,409
<i>If you know the basic type of key
you need to spoof, </i>

353
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,129
<i>pick out a matching blank,</i>

354
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,079
<i>file down the valleys
to the center ledge,</i>

355
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:15,798
<i>and you have a bump key.</i>

356
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:19,973
<i>Apply torque, whack it with
anything handy, and you're in.</i>

357
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:22,577
Not quite as much fun as
kicking a door down.

358
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:26,622
You ready to go?

359
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,007
To dinner?

360
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:30,632
It's 4:30.
I told you no more early-bird specials.

361
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:33,311
I thought we would stop
by the airport first,

362
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,493
pay a visit to that front business
Barry found.

363
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:36,740
More spy hunting?

364
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,076
Why must everything you do revolve
around getting your old job back?

365
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,287
Fiona, really, this is important.

366
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:43,663
Come on.

367
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,884
I'll do it alone.

368
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,266
We're gonna have
to do this eventually.

369
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:57,335
Just not right now.

370
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:02,979
<i>Drug cartels aren't
the only organizations </i>

371
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:05,571
<i>who use import/export businesses
as fronts.</i>

372
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,141
<i>Intelligence agencies like them because
they make it possible for missions </i>

373
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,698
<i>to finance themselves.</i>

374
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:13,109
Who parked that gray truck out there?
Where's your boss?

375
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,654
<i>They send out guns and supplies
and get back goods to sell.</i>

376
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:18,672
<i>Native antiquities are favorites</i>

377
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:22,509
<i>because their subjective prices
make money laundering easy.</i>

378
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,134
Are you the manager?

379
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:28,705
No, Mr. Westen.
I'm Diego Garza.

380
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:31,122
I'm the spy you're looking for.

381
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:35,507
You're not supposed
to tell you're a spy.

382
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:37,509
What's the point in subterfuge?

383
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,386
All the memos they sent from DC,
they say you're very, very good.

384
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,634
I have to assume you're here
because you want back in.

385
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,909
Trying to reach out?

386
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,393
I like you, Diego.
You're doing all the work for me.

387
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:49,501
I don't want this
to hurt your feelings,

388
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:52,198
but I'd really like you
to get the hell out of here.

389
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:54,943
Not everything they told you
about me is true.

390
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:57,575
The part about me being really,
really good, but,

391
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,865
I just want to talk to your bosses
so we can clear this up.

392
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:04,094
I wish it was that simple.

393
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:06,913
I have 20 years at the Company.
I've seen villages burned.

394
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,661
I've seen children orphaned.
I've been shot twice.

395
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:11,688
Then they transferred me here.

396
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:14,006
You know what the hardest
part of this job is?

397
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:16,714
That forklift turns funny.

398
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:20,225
Now, if I report back that
I made contact with a burned spy,

399
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,496
do you know where they'll send me?

400
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:26,221
Me neither,
but I'm not rocking this boat.

401
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,857
I'm giving you a chance
to be a friend.

402
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,977
Mr. Westen, I don't like threats.

403
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:38,863
But I love your sunglasses.

404
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,488
You have a good one, okay?

405
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:52,902
<i>Doing a job in broad daylight means
easier access but more witnesses.</i>

406
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,495
<i>You can walk right in
with your unwanted audience,</i>

407
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,639
<i>but you better have a plan
to entertain them.</i>

408
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,401
Well, all right.

409
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,468
Ladies and gentlemen,

410
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,597
if I can borrow your attention,
I promise to return it in about an hour.

411
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,802
My name is Charles Finley.

412
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,730
You can call me Charles.

413
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:15,239
I'm the dreaded teamwork consultant
that popped up on your calendar there.

414
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:16,479
Come on, everybody.

415
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,693
Follow me in to the conference room
right now. 

416
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,404
There's gonna be ice-cream cake.
It's my birthday.

417
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:23,861
Let's go. Come on.
Did I mention ice-cream cake?

418
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,951
Come on, folks. Come on.
Break free from your cubicle.

419
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,519
That's the ticket.

420
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,206
They warned me about you, Ms. Park.

421
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:34,626
- I don't have time for this.
- Come on, boss lady.

422
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,875
Let's be a good example
for everybody.

423
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,963
What do you say?
Hey, folks.

424
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,631
Let's do this thing.

425
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:53,322
Have they all been taken?

426
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:55,480
Yeah, to the conference room.

427
00:21:58,224 --> 00:21:59,924
Next chapter is entitled

428
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:04,369
"Talk to me" and
"Enhancing your empowerment sphere".

429
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,869
Let's make this quick.

430
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,594
Has anyone here heard
of the seventh sigma?

431
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:24,133
This is the newest commandment
in the business bible, people.

432
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:25,218
Anyone?

433
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:29,305
Though shalt not lie
about ice-cream cake?

434
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:34,310
You're a joker, Todd.
You're gonna stay after class.

435
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:35,853
See, that's all.

436
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:37,230
Do you see that?

437
00:22:37,745 --> 00:22:40,445
That encryption is Zydeco.
Those are all...

438
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:43,777
She shouldn't have those. Those are
all coded e-mails she's stealing.

439
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:45,137
Yeah. I was right.

440
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:48,026
Spencer, I can't send a page
of numbers to the FBI.

441
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,951
- I need the code.
- I don't like this.

442
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,078
- Does she have it or not?
- I don't see it.

443
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:53,329
Look at this.

444
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,510
She wiped all her bank records within
24 hours of accessing the system.

445
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:58,935
Here, here again.
Every time she...

446
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,950
I need you to focus.

447
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:07,079
There's no point in her intercepting
the e-mails if she can't decrypt them.

448
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:10,178
No, no, listen.
Every time there's a payment.

449
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:12,181
Yesterday, today, twice.

450
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,017
She sent two more names out.

451
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:17,011
I don't know where it's gonna happen.
And who's gonna die.

452
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:20,452
It's gonna be fine,
if you find the code right now.

453
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,900
I told you. It's not here.
She's too careful.

454
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,309
She must borrow the copy from the room
and put it back when she's done.

455
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:28,100
- I should've seen it.
- Wait.

456
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:32,385
Now you're telling me that her copy
of the code is in a scif room?

457
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,510
That's a vault!

458
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:35,948
I'm sorry. The pattern.
I didn't see it.

459
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:38,638
- I didn't see any of this.
- Get out of the chair!

460
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,047
Which brings us to
the Finley method.

461
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:47,759
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. Are you leaving?
- I've work to do.

462
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:50,717
Folks, be right back.
Turn to page seven.

463
00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:57,388
I'm sending myself a copy
of everything encrypted.

464
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:59,823
- Let's go.
- Let's hit the reset button.

465
00:23:59,948 --> 00:24:02,523
Do it together. Hit the button.
Let's reset the clock.

466
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:05,698
No. Wait. We've to take her machines.
No. We've to take her machines.

467
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,905
We've to find the names.
She could've buried it.

468
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,559
No. We have to warn the guardians.
No! We have to!

469
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,673
The darkness will come.
The darkness will come, and you'll see!

470
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:16,721
You'll look up, the stars will go out,
and every night, every night...

471
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:19,305
We can be positive, Shannon.
This is all about us.

472
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:23,237
You're killing me here. Oh, come on.

473
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,714
Enough.

474
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,691
Come on, Spencer. Come on.

475
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:40,387
They're all gonna die.

476
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,949
We don't have the code.
They're all gonna die.

477
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:50,602
I could...

478
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:53,763
I'll try to hack into
Shannon's computer again remotely.

479
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,532
If I leave a line open, maybe
I can catch her when she uses the code.

480
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,337
You can't. If you get caught,
she can trace where you leave...

481
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:02,081
She sent more names! We don't know
who or where, but they're gonna die,

482
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:05,233
and those files you stole are useless
without a copy of Zydeco.

483
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:08,005
- That's not true. We can use...
- There's no point in trying.

484
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,427
No. There's no use in even...

485
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,716
Even attempting to break that code.
You understand?

486
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:18,463
- The whole life of the universe.
- Listen, please!

487
00:25:18,588 --> 00:25:22,214
If you think you can break in
to the scif room to steal that code,

488
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:24,046
that's never gonna happen.

489
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,484
- There's a nine-digit keypad.
- I'm not going.

490
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,277
Shannon and her friends from Procyon A
won't just sit back and watch.

491
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:39,453
Michael isn't going to decrypt
the e-mails that Shannon stole.

492
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,165
He's gonna use them
as a prop to scare her.

493
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:44,203
I don't see that.

494
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:49,234
We're gonna convince her that
someone's hunting for the leak.

495
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,611
She'll stop selling names,
cover her tracks.

496
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:55,136
We'll tip the FBI when she goes
to erase the scif room's access code.

497
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:57,513
She'll be arrested,
and no more spies die.

498
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,781
There's justice for your friend.

499
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:02,310
The alien goes to jail.

500
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:05,730
Well, that sounds good.
Is that what you were gonna say?

501
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:15,836
If you want to keep your job,
keep walking,

502
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,311
keep your voice down,
and act casual.

503
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:21,621
We don't have a Jeremy Dresner
in Virginia. I checked. Who are you?

504
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,300
People we work for don't know my name,
and neither will you.

505
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:27,376
I'm the guy cleaning up your mess.
That's all you get.

506
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:29,610
What mess? Two days ago,
you were an IT guy.

507
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,359
Two days ago,
I was shaking the tree.

508
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,898
There's a leak coming from tech.
That's your department.

509
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,423
We're staring down the barrel of a
federal case and a massive PR disaster.

510
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:40,014
Zydeco's compromised.

511
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:42,298
3 American operatives are dead.

512
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,921
This is ridiculous.
I don't know who you are.

513
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:46,562
- I'm calling my boss.
- Go ahead.

514
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:50,566
Use mine if you'd rather deal
with a massive federal investigation.

515
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,903
Shannon, the feds are just sniffing
at this now. We got two days.

516
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,948
After that, your stock options won't
be worth the paper they're printed on.

517
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,782
This doesn't make any sense.

518
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:02,662
That embassy system is airtight.
Zydeco was my project.

519
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,372
Believe me, I know it was.

520
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:07,500
Where did you get that?

521
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:11,004
I need you to call upstairs, cancel
all your appointments for the day.

522
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,672
There's something I need you to see.

523
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:18,691
Two weeks ago,
I get a call from one of our employers.

524
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:22,499
One of your programmers in your
department got himself blown up.

525
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:25,126
Brad Wilkins.
They asked me to have a look.

526
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:27,234
Cops said that was an accident.

527
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,550
Miami Dade detectives make
56 grand a year.

528
00:27:29,675 --> 00:27:31,065
How much do you think I make?

529
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:33,317
They didn't even know
about this boat.

530
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,111
Your boy Brad had it registered
under his mother's name.

531
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,864
- He was careful, just not enough.
- Where'd he get those?

532
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,575
That's what we're trying to find out.
Try to keep up, honey.

533
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,768
Notes in the margins.
I learned about the leak

534
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:46,480
because Brad found out about the leak.
He was hunting them.

535
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:49,640
Why he didn't share this, I don't know,
but he sure did get himself killed.

536
00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:51,365
What do the notes say?

537
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:53,796
He wanted to look
at the scif access logs.

538
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:56,016
- Now I do.
- That's eyes only.

539
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,384
- I'm not gonna show you that.
- You absolutely will.

540
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:00,864
Tomorrow is Saturday.
There'll be nobody in the office.

541
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,973
Meet me at 10:00 so I know you're clean.
Then we go have a show-and-tell.

542
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,201
<i>Cellphones are basically
wireless computers.</i>

543
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:07,226
What's this?

544
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,813
<i>Upload the right program, and you've got
a roving bug you can turn on remotely.</i>

545
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:12,440
You'll keep that on you.

546
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:15,109
If you need to talk to me
before tomorrow, you'll use that,

547
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,527
not the office, not the home phone.

548
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:20,665
Last person who looked
into this leak was killed.

549
00:28:21,175 --> 00:28:22,742
You never know who's listening.

550
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:26,662
- What if we're not the only ones...
- Tomorrow morning. No excuses. Be here.

551
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,820
"We don't know who's listening".

552
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:33,440
Guess we're up and running.

553
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:34,565
10 by 10.

554
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:36,380
How'd Virgil's boat work out?

555
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:39,300
Did I tell you about the marlin
we caught off of Pigeon Key?

556
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,551
Yeah, a few times.

557
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:43,051
Do you mind keeping an ear
on Shannon tonight?

558
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:46,265
I got to head down to the airport,
see if I can't motivate our pal Diego.

559
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:55,508
<i>Front companies generally
make easy targets for burglary.</i>

560
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:58,356
<i>They don't want people wondering
what they have to hide,</i>

561
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:00,441
<i>so they tend not to install
a lot of lights,</i>

562
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:02,406
<i>alarms, and security cameras.</i>

563
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:09,100
<i>And, of course, they'd never invite
the police in to investigate,</i>

564
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,850
<i>so there's really no need
to be shy about leaving clues.</i>

565
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:24,556
<i>But you got to admit, it's elegant.</i>

566
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:28,087
<i>We catch Shannon wiping the access log
tonight, and she goes to jail.</i>

567
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:29,972
<i>It's not the crime.
It's the cover-up.</i>

568
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:32,510
I understand the plan.
I just don't like it.

569
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:35,808
I wish we could forget about this
catch-her-in-act, call-the-feds nonsense

570
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:38,388
and drive to her house right now
and finish this properly.

571
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:42,010
- I should be home in bed right now.
- Don't be dozing off out there.

572
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:44,090
Freaking amateur hour around here.

573
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,282
Yeah. Hold on.

574
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,120
<i>Yeah. It's Shannon. You find it?</i>

575
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:50,076
10437 Crest, right?
You sure you want to do this?

576
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:52,013
I don't know.
You wanna get the needle?

577
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:53,990
I told you,
there's heat on me at work.

578
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:57,380
An IP address at that location tried
to hack me, some nut from the office.

579
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,330
I am not taking chances.
We got to tie this up cleanly.

580
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:03,217
- You cannot be around...
- I'll put a timer underneath the house.

581
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,029
<i>Same as Brad. It goes off at midnight.
I'll be long gone by then.</i>

582
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:08,054
Good, and get off the phone.

583
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:11,990
Fi, did you hear that? Spencer stuck
his neck out, and she caught him.

584
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:14,513
It'll take me 20 minutes
to get to Spencer's.

585
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:17,398
I'll have to leave the front door.
What if she comes to wipe the log?

586
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:21,634
He's on the other side of town.
I can't get there. You gotta go.

587
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:35,291
Hey, Sam. Do you need some bowls?

588
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,002
Mike, you got to get to Spencer's house.
Shannon set a bomb.

589
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,930
- <i>It's under the house.</i>
- It's gonna take me 25 minutes.

590
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:44,164
Fi said 20. I got my money on you.
Get your ass in gear.

591
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:09,200
You can't be here!
I'm not one of them!

592
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:11,827
Fi, we've got a minute. Come on.

593
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,040
You can't talk to him
when he gets like that.

594
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,480
- If you're here...
- We missed her.

595
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,555
She's gonna erase everything.

596
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:45,341
<i>Did you see the news?
Nobody was home.</i>

597
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:49,399
- <i>I should've triggered the bomb myself.</i>
- <i>Don't. Do not second-guess me.</i>

598
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:51,830
<i>I took care of the thing at work.
We should be clear.</i>

599
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:53,155
<i>I'll call you.</i>

600
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:56,995
On the phone?
Messages from Procyon A don't usually...

601
00:31:57,335 --> 00:32:00,751
- No. They come on beams of light.
- This must be a special occasion.

602
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:02,755
You know, desperate times?

603
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,713
You tried to hack her files,
didn't you?

604
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,925
Yeah. We were in such a rush before.
I thought if I took one more shot...

605
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:11,011
- Were they talking about killing me?
- You're gonna be all right.

606
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:16,300
There's no way to catch her.
You heard her. She wiped the evidence.

607
00:32:16,425 --> 00:32:18,852
We're gonna have to convince her
to give us new evidence.

608
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:22,975
Now that you're the only one
she has reason to be afraid of,

609
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:25,484
you're going to have to help.

610
00:32:25,745 --> 00:32:27,736
Oh, no. What are you... How?

611
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,115
For starters, you're gonna have to be
able to string two sentences together.

612
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:34,785
You're gonna have
to talk to Shannon.

613
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:36,480
You got to be kidding me.

614
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:39,623
She's one of their leaders.
Even the Guardians fear her.

615
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,950
Spencer, this is really important.

616
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:43,544
You must stick to the script.

617
00:32:43,815 --> 00:32:46,964
You cannot mention aliens,
light beams, or any of it.

618
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:51,955
Shannon can't find out
we know what she is.

619
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:54,945
She can't find out
that her cover's blown.

620
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,165
She'll call in for backup...

621
00:32:57,922 --> 00:32:59,101
All the other beings.

622
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:02,021
Okay. That makes sense.

623
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:13,310
There is no leak.

624
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:15,560
I checked the scif access log.
There's nothing.

625
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,815
I think we need to consider
the possibility that Brad...

626
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,860
There's a leak,
but we got bigger problems.

627
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:21,620
Somebody else found out.

628
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:24,845
I got a call this morning
from a Spencer Watkowski.

629
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:28,088
You've seen him.
He waters plants at the office.

630
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:31,410
He's ex-NSA.
He's a real heavy hitter.

631
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:32,870
That's impossible.

632
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:36,390
- The guy, he's a nut. He's way off.
- Yeah. Nice cover, don't you think?

633
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,865
He wants to meet,

634
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,916
but what I can't figure out
is why he wants you there with me.

635
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:48,565
Breathe, Spencer.

636
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:53,781
I said no surprises.
Why'd you bring a bodyguard?

637
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:56,116
Because she's the one
who's selling names of spies,

638
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,702
and she killed my friend Brad
and she tried to kill me.

639
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:01,090
- You're the leak?
- That's not true.

640
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:03,332
It is true.
She's a murderer and a traitor.

641
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:07,586
Now, if you want this to be kept quiet,
then I'm gonna need $5 million in cash.

642
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,905
- You don't have a shred of proof.
- I know everything.

643
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,092
I know your whole dark plan,
and I know that you're one of them.

644
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:18,806
Ms. Park is one of those who doesn't
cover her tracks as well as they think.

645
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:22,351
Yesterday, her password
was "Goldleaf1510".

646
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:26,313
- Have you changed it yet, Shannon?
- Yeah, you should see her computer.

647
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,982
She's got Zydeco-encrypted e-mails
that look like this,

648
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,537
and when she decodes them,
they look like that.

649
00:34:31,662 --> 00:34:33,904
It's a fake. He doesn't have the code.
He's bluffing.

650
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,197
This is pathetic.

651
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,467
If you want to stay
for this charade, you can.

652
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:38,492
I'm leaving.

653
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,210
Bluffing? How do I know
that you're setting up a deal

654
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,928
to sell another name
to the Venezuelans?

655
00:34:58,155 --> 00:34:59,205
$5 million?

656
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:07,141
I'll bring the cash here at 10:00.

657
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:09,189
You'll bring a copy
of everything you have.

658
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,776
Fine, but don't try and bring backup,
don't try and bring friends from Proc...

659
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,319
It'll be me and the money.

660
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:22,536
Venezuela? How did you...

661
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:25,551
The patterns, sometimes,
when you study them long enough.

662
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:28,640
Also, I saw a file labeled "Caracas"
when I tried to hack her,

663
00:35:28,765 --> 00:35:30,665
but I couldn't get in, so...

664
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:34,548
I can't believe you're this stupid.

665
00:35:34,805 --> 00:35:37,200
You put a hit out on him?
Who else knows?

666
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:40,137
A thug. He's nobody. I found him
in a biker bar. He knows nothing.

667
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,514
Give me his name and address.
I'm cleaning this up.

668
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,100
Why did you agree to pay them?
Why not just kill them?

669
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,311
You really think I'm gonna pay them?

670
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,465
We're going to the office.
You're gonna give me a copy of Zydeco.

671
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,132
I'm gonna pin that on their bodies
along with embassy e-mails.

672
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:57,196
- I don't understand! What do you...
- Are you really this slow?

673
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:02,380
It has to look like he stole the code
and the e-mails from an embassy.

674
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:05,746
If the problem is on the client's side,
then we're protected.

675
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,956
Stone Kittredge stock
doesn't take a hit.

676
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,709
I can't get into the scif room
on a weekend without people finding out.

677
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:13,003
Do you really think
you're gonna keep your job?

678
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,381
Today's your last day, honey.
You're gonna run, and never gonna stop.

679
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,799
You understand?

680
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:34,805
Is that Zydeco?
Where are the e-mails?

681
00:36:35,005 --> 00:36:38,230
My computer, but we have to print them
out from a printer outside the building

682
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:41,073
- so the Feds can't trace them.
- Yeah. I may skip that part.

683
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:44,065
What...

684
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:46,815
This isn't goodbye.

685
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,615
I'll say hi at your trial.

686
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:00,255
Let's see if this works.

687
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,810
<i>This is special Agent Johnson.</i>

688
00:37:10,045 --> 00:37:11,395
Hello. Hi. Hello.

689
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:12,795
This is...

690
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,002
Never mind. I was calling

691
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:18,160
because there's a traitor locked
in the scif room at Stone Kittredge.

692
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:19,410
<i>What did you say?</i>

693
00:37:19,535 --> 00:37:22,792
And there's a gig of state department
e-mails on Shannon Park's computer,

694
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,540
so you'd better get down here.

695
00:37:24,665 --> 00:37:27,762
And you really should bring some backup.
That bitch is an alien.

696
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,375
Maybe he got abducted.

697
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:43,552
Sorry I'm late. Thanks for meeting me.
I don't really trust the phones, so...

698
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,555
I wanted to be sure you saw the paper.
Shannon's copping a plea.

699
00:37:46,925 --> 00:37:50,058
We saw it. She's going to testify
against the guy who killed Brad.

700
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,720
You ask me, something's wrong 
when we don't hang traitors anymore.

701
00:37:53,845 --> 00:37:55,295
Doesn't seem right.

702
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:58,525
You look good, Spencer.

703
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,950
Oh, really?
Well, I feel a little foggy.

704
00:38:01,075 --> 00:38:04,364
But the meds aren't great, but they come
with the job, so it's worth it.

705
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,360
I hooked him up with a crypto gig.
Buddy of mine has a tech firm.

706
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:11,413
- How you liking it, Spence?
- It's great. In fact, look, I'm late.

707
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,644
- I should probably go.
- I'll walk with you.

708
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,417
I have to make a stop myself.

709
00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:18,225
And, you guys, thank you.
Thank you for listening to me.

710
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,208
You probably shouldn't have listened to
anything I said, but I'm glad you did.

711
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:28,096
- You got him a job.
- I actually am kind of a sweetheart.

712
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,090
So, there's one more thing I wanted
to tell you about all the aliens.

713
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:34,878
Spencer, I thought that you were...

714
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:38,705
I know they're not real.
I just wanted to explain.

715
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,610
In the beginning,
the first messages,

716
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:44,070
this light in the window, this...

717
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:46,490
This beautiful equation,
I should have said something.

718
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,825
I should have just told people.

719
00:38:49,055 --> 00:38:51,404
But it was all secret and in code,

720
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:53,997
and I didn't have anyone
I could trust.

721
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:56,541
And you're lucky.
You're lucky to have people like that.

722
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:01,745
If there's ever anything I can do...

723
00:39:15,237 --> 00:39:16,770
I had some bowls like that once.

724
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,523
That is crazy.
I got this in an online auction.

725
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,531
Had to beat out some nasty Russians
who were overbidding on everything.

726
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,259
I knew you liked Colombian art,
so I thought,

727
00:39:26,384 --> 00:39:28,699
"What better way to say
I still want us to be friends"?

728
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,164
My boss has noticed
your auction screen name.

729
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,782
MichaelHeartsDiego.

730
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:40,252
You heard about that.
I'm embarrassed.

731
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,010
Nice choice you gave me.

732
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:44,132
Cop to the fact
that I made contact with you,

733
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:47,300
or admit to skimming and accepting
bribes from enemies of the state.

734
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,761
- Did you choose "A"?
- You're getting what you want.

735
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,556
I've been assigned to be
your point of contact here in Miami.

736
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,993
You see? Now you don't have
to leave town.

737
00:39:55,118 --> 00:39:57,120
No one has to lose. It's a win-win.

738
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:58,603
Well, I get to win twice.

739
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,170
The new perk of my job
is that I get to tell you this.

740
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:04,693
The Company is not interested
in your services at this time.

741
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:05,905
Really?

742
00:40:08,265 --> 00:40:10,040
Maybe you should show them this.

743
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:12,743
They know. Did you really think
that would get you back in?

744
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:17,023
The boys upstairs don't want
to pin a medal on anyone for that mess.

745
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,167
They want to sweep it under the rug.

746
00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:22,745
Get to know me, Diego.

747
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:24,805
I'm not one of the bad guys.

748
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,511
They did say
they'd review your file.

749
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:34,765
I wouldn't hold my breath,
but who knows?

750
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,379
- Tell me, how did it go?
- To be honest, I'm not sure.

751
00:41:06,826 --> 00:41:10,420
They're gonna need some more convincing.
Even then, I don't know.

752
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:11,995
Whatever happens...

753
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:14,471
One of us will be happy, I guess.

754
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:20,310
Why can't you be with me on this?

755
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,645
Talking to you

756
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:24,606
is like talking to Spencer.

757
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:26,900
You're both so focused on one thing.

758
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,903
It clouds everything else.
It's a crazy way to live, Michael.

759
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:32,114
You know what? I am like him.

760
00:41:32,964 --> 00:41:36,493
We both see the world a certain way,
and we have skills to make it better.

761
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:38,655
That's not a bad thing.

762
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:41,106
I don't want to keep ducking this,
so let me be straight.

763
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:44,453
This job, what we just did,
saving American lives,

764
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,502
this is the type of work
I was made for, Fi.

765
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,841
It's what my old job gave me a chance
to do every single day.

766
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,810
So, no,
getting back in isn't just...

767
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:56,250
a way to survive,
to protect the people I love.

768
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:57,725
It's what I want.

769
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:03,200
And if you truly care about me,

770
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:06,675
you should damn well want for me
what I want for myself.

771
00:42:13,975 --> 00:42:15,775
If that's what you want...

772
00:42:18,275 --> 00:42:19,625
I'll be with you.

773
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:21,538
I'll be with you.
