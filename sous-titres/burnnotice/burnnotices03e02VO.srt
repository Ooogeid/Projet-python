1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:01,834
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,263
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,835
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:09,902
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,209
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,759
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,223
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:19,124
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,531
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,524
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:28,402
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,780
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,199
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,409
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,037
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,914
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:53,370
<i>Whether you're hunting down extremists
in the mountains of Kashmir</i>

18
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:56,795
<i>or tracking arms dealers
through the streets of Moscow,</i>

19
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:59,350
<i>the life of a spy takes a toll.</i>

20
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,774
<i>So during downtimes,</i>

21
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,920
<i>you work out, eat right,
and try to recharge your batteries,</i>

22
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:12,655
<i>because you never know what's waiting
for you around the corner.</i>

23
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:15,366
Hello, Michael.

24
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,284
This is Bud, bail jumper.

25
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:21,031
- We just got back from the Everglades.
- You've a real chair in this dump?

26
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:24,458
Poor Bud's in a bad mood.
He didn't like the music in my trunk.

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,668
Why is he here?

28
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:29,065
We're killing time,

29
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:32,091
waiting for the bail bondsman
to open his office.

30
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:36,136
You know, he's been throwing me
more jobs than I can manage lately,

31
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,806
and I was thinking,
as long as you're still burned...

32
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,904
Trudging through swamps,
for guys like Bud?

33
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:43,644
- I'm not hurting for money that bad.
- Could have fooled me.

34
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,555
Think about it, Michael.

35
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,245
Your strategic know-how...

36
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:51,902
My expertise in the field.

37
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,487
My brains, your brawn.

38
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,533
Time for you to go, Bud.

39
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,249
Detective Paxson.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
Miami PD. This is Detective Lopez.

41
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:10,421
- You mind if we ask you questions?
- I'm in the middle of something.

42
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:15,718
I understand you're a bounty hunter.
Do you have a bail-enforcer's license?

43
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:18,005
Actually, I'm freelancing.

44
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,892
Actually, you're harboring a fugitive.
Consider this a warning.

45
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:26,970
Detective, I spoke with some officers
at the station recently,

46
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:30,065
and I think we cleared up
all the questions they had.

47
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,720
I've different questions.

48
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,780
They're about a traffic incident...

49
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:36,200
Three cars blown up,
three more totaled.

50
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:39,533
Apparently, we have a one-man
wrecking crew on our hands.

51
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,494
How can you be so sure it's a man?

52
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:44,550
I'm as progressive as the next gal,
miss Glenanne,

53
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:47,040
but someone matching
Mr. Westen's description

54
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,120
was spotted driving away
from the scene.

55
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:50,820
White male, dark hair...

56
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:52,440
Athletically built?

57
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:54,293
I hope your department
pays overtime,

58
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:57,218
because you're gonna be searching for
a few hundred thousand suspects.

59
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,677
I've got just one.

60
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:02,488
Stuff's been blowing up pretty steadily
since you arrived in Miami.

61
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:05,135
Are you gonna answer my questions,

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,720
or am I gonna pick my way
through everything you own?

63
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:10,230
That would be a workbench,
six power tools,

64
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:13,200
Four yogurts... Three yogurts.
I actually had one.

65
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,325
Blueberry.

66
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:18,323
Well, you can tell me all about it
at the station, Mr. Westen.

67
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,448
Get in the car.

68
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:21,365
I'm gonna enjoy this.

69
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,918
Welcome to your worst nightmare,
Mr. Westen.

70
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:57,160
You look wretched, Michael.

71
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,400
Well, it's not a day spa
in there, Fi.

72
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,175
Spent the last 24 hours
in the drunk tank.

73
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:05,420
So, Detective Paxson wasn't
questioning you the whole time?

74
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,745
No, there was plenty of that, too.

75
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:11,870
She's gonna be some real trouble.

76
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,910
She already is.
She cost me my bounty.

77
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,692
- I'll make it up to you sometime.
- Well, how does now sound?

78
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:19,447
I lined up a new gig. I'll fill you in
on the details over lunch.

79
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:21,302
Come on, Fi.
Not another bail jumper.

80
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:24,940
But one of my old bail jumpers
got me the job.

81
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,265
It's a referral.

82
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:38,402
- So, how's Stevie?
- Doing time at Raiford medium-security.

83
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,170
Says "Hi", by the way.

84
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:42,910
Her brother jumped bail
on forgery charges.

85
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:44,370
I chased him to Boca.

86
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:47,244
Had to hit him with a brick
to get him in the car. Sweet guy.

87
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:50,080
- He your partner?
- Well, you'd have to ask him that.

88
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,624
What can we help you with?

89
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:56,337
This is my son, Brandon.
He's been staying with his dad, Howard.

90
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,925
We're separated. Howard hasn't let me
see or talk to Brandon for three days.

91
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,580
It sounds like
you should be talking to a lawyer.

92
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:04,929
I have. Three of them.

93
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,060
They all say it'll take months
to get him into court.

94
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:10,768
Howard just needs someone
to knock some sense into him.

95
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,936
- I'm not sure...
- It's not a problem.

96
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,107
- Anything else you need?
- I just want to see my son.

97
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,085
Everything will be fine.

98
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:20,475
Right, Michael?

99
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:25,505
Excuse me.

100
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,085
Do you know my new girl?

101
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,645
She rebuilt this engine by herself.

102
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:36,030
I'm telling you, just put a nice,
sturdy tool in that woman's hand...

103
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:38,504
I got it, Sam.
Find out anything?

104
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:41,645
Yeah, I asked around
about your lady detective.

105
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:44,570
Turns out you got
a stalker with a badge.

106
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:48,514
She checked every self-storage place
from here up to Fort Lauderdale.

107
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:52,601
She found some surveillance video of you
ducking into a place down by Homestead.

108
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,969
- Not good.
- What you got there?

109
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:56,820
Some C-4 and detonators.

110
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:59,540
She's gonna own them soon,
'cause she's working on a warrant.

111
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:03,089
There's a hearing in a few days, but
you got to get your stash out before.

112
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:04,914
Are you coming, Michael?

113
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,492
You know, since I'm helping you
avoid felony charges,

114
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,810
I thought maybe there'd be
a lunch in it for me.

115
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,414
Next time.

116
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,542
Geez.

117
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:18,877
I got you, baby.

118
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:26,718
Typical. Howard spends
80 hours a week at the office,

119
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:29,263
and he can't find an hour
to take care of his yard.

120
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:33,934
Go ahead and take it.

121
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:38,189
Just keep your eyes on the street.
This should be pretty straightforward.

122
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,108
Yeah, ma?

123
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:44,117
It's somebody's birthday today.

124
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,531
I thought you could come over
for a nice dinner with Sam and Fiona.

125
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,825
We're celebrating birthdays now?

126
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:52,570
We always did.
Don't you remember sixth grade?

127
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:54,288
Your friend Billy Kane was there.

128
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:55,873
It was his party, mom.

129
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:57,750
It's never too late.

130
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:00,711
All right, where are we
getting takeout from?

131
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,225
Who said anything about takeout?

132
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,843
- So, you coming or not?
- I'll try.

133
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,160
Michael, I don't want to hear
how you'll try. I want you to promise.

134
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:13,705
Fine. I promise I'll try.

135
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,498
You can stop now.

136
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,126
You can stop now!

137
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:57,309
- We just want to see your son.
- You don't understand.

138
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,477
I'm sure whatever the issue is,
you can work it out with your ex.

139
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,215
That's not what I mean.

140
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,650
He was kidnapped.

141
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:07,155
Of course he was.

142
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:11,115
Brandon didn't come home
from school on Thursday.

143
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,433
I got a call.

144
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,035
- I don't know the guy's name.
- Is he asking for money?

145
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,830
No, I work at a diamond wholesaler.

146
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:21,285
He wanted information
about an upcoming shipment.

147
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:25,395
Said not to contact the police,
or I'd never...

148
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:27,798
see Brandon again.

149
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,386
- He's calling today with instructions.
- How could you not tell me?

150
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,737
I didn't want you calling the police.
I was trying to protect Brandon.

151
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,225
That was not your decision to make!
He's my son, too!

152
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,490
Look.

153
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:42,229
He just wants diamonds.
I'm going to give them to him.

154
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,106
Howard, it's not that simple.

155
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,985
If this guy really wants to disappear,
he has no incentive to return your son.

156
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:51,516
Brandon's old enough
to identify him.

157
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,115
What... What are you saying?

158
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,033
You know what he's saying, Howard.

159
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,801
They're not gonna bring Brandon back!
We should call the police.

160
00:08:57,926 --> 00:09:00,289
No! No cops!
He said he would kill him.

161
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,457
Enough.

162
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,625
Michael and I will take care of him

163
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:08,610
without involving the cops.

164
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:11,335
But you can't be
at each other's throats, okay?

165
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,380
When the kidnapper calls again,
you're going to say

166
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:18,420
you're not doing anything until you get
proof that your son is alive and unhurt,

167
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,225
and you're gonna ask for a meeting.

168
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:23,253
- You think he'll come?
- If he wants his diamonds, he will.

169
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:25,911
And if we're lucky, we'll follow him
back to where Brandon is.

170
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:29,836
- Well, won't that be dangerous?
- It doesn't matter. I'll do it.

171
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:32,779
Whatever it takes
to get Brandon back.

172
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:43,540
I told Howard not to take
that stupid job.

173
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:44,875
Sales manager.

174
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:46,627
We were doing just fine as reps.

175
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,670
- You work together?
- We did.

176
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:51,048
It was great
till he took that promotion.

177
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:53,075
Long hours, travels...

178
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:54,835
And now this.

179
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,260
Well, I'm sure this was not part
of the plan when he took the job.

180
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:00,685
Well, he should have known the risk.

181
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:05,270
Patricia, I want you to try something.
It's a...

182
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,538
a relaxation exercise
I do in situations like this.

183
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,485
I want you to close your eyes...

184
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,128
and breathe deep.

185
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:16,949
Picture a peaceful mountain stream.
Can you do that?

186
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,435
Now picture yourself...

187
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:22,746
drowning the kidnapper
in the stream.

188
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:26,875
You're taking a rock from the stream
and raising it above your head...

189
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,110
... and with tremendous force,
you're bringing...

190
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:33,170
We got something.
He's passed by twice.

191
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:35,553
<i>Smart criminals have
a variety of ways</i>

192
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,553
<i>to find out if a meeting
is under police surveillance.</i>

193
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,965
<i>Some are more subtle than others.</i>

194
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:42,599
- Howard, right?
- Yeah.

195
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:44,455
I'm Santora.

196
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,228
Nice to meet you.

197
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:49,839
<i>Throw a few punches...</i>

198
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,568
<i>and any cops in the area
have to come running.</i>

199
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,070
God! Do something!

200
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:56,697
He's testing us.

201
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,740
But he's gonna kill him!
He's...

202
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:03,870
If you want your son back,
you'll stay in the car.

203
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:10,002
You got any friends around here
I should know about?

204
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,381
You tell anyone about
our little arrangement?

205
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,967
Look at me, Howard.

206
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:20,980
<i>Behavior in a combat situation
is unpredictable.</i>

207
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,765
<i>Sometimes trained soldiers
go screaming for the hills.</i>

208
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:27,978
<i>Sometimes guys who have never fired
anything bigger than a cap gun</i>

209
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:30,915
<i>turn out to have ice in their veins.</i>

210
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:34,645
Nobody knows.

211
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,955
Let me see my son.

212
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:46,163
Today's headline.

213
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:47,845
The kid's fine.

214
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,666
Now, let's be clear.

215
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:51,900
You're not calling the shots here.

216
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:55,714
You're not gonna make any more demands,
and you're not gonna try anything cute.

217
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,945
If anyone touches me,
if I'm a minute late

218
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,762
checking in with my guys,
you never see the kid again.

219
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:03,765
Got it?

220
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,433
Good.

221
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,187
That's just so you don't forget.

222
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:12,735
Now...

223
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,858
Let's talk about my diamonds.

224
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:16,266
<i>In the field,</i>

225
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:19,965
<i>it's often your human instincts
that jeopardize an operation.</i>

226
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,720
<i>Helping people is great,</i>

227
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:24,659
<i>but there are times that impulse
can get people killed.</i>

228
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:29,206
<i>Sometimes the right thing to do
is let a guy bleed for a while.</i>

229
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,335
Stay here.

230
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:44,875
He kept hitting me.

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,309
- I didn't know what to do.
- You did everything right.

232
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,811
He said he wants the stones
in 24 hours, or Brandon dies.

233
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:53,035
That's not gonna happen.

234
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:03,345
How'd we do?

235
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,775
Not so great.

236
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:08,770
Santora didn't go near the kid.

237
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:11,230
He's hanging out at a bar,
sipping mojitos.

238
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,855
Mike, this guy's not afraid
to be seen.

239
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:16,786
I thought you could follow him
to where Brandon is. I thought...

240
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:19,714
He's smart. He's keeping
the job compartmentalized.

241
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,144
Howard's at the hospital
getting stitches.

242
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,159
- That was all for nothing?
- Not nothing.

243
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:26,819
We'll know when he moves.
I got a buddy keeping an eye on him.

244
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:29,790
Why can't you just grab him
and waterboard him or something,

245
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,515
make him tell us where Brandon is?

246
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,493
You torture somebody, they'll tell you
anything to make it stop.

247
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,898
No, there are better ways
to get reliable information.

248
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,193
Sam, how do you feel about a little
reverse interrogation?

249
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,653
Never been a big fan.

250
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,910
- What's reverse interrogation?
- We used to do it during the Cold War.

251
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:47,085
You send one of your guys
to be interrogated

252
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,994
to learn what they're worried about.

253
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,913
You play your cards right, the questions
will tell you all about them.

254
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:54,749
- You play your cards wrong...
- Have a little faith, Sam.

255
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:58,151
How long do you think it'll take?

256
00:13:58,276 --> 00:13:59,296
Car, building...

257
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:03,175
- Some cop lights... A couple hours.
- All right, call me when it's done.

258
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,920
We're gonna find your son.

259
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,760
This is a valuable lesson for you.

260
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:24,431
- C-4 is meant to be used, not stored.
- I'll keep that in mind.

261
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,386
I'm serious.
All those times you told me

262
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:29,224
to make the explosions smaller,
I shouldn't have listened to you.

263
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:31,828
Paxson wouldn't have anything
to hang you with.

264
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,240
<i>When you're concerned you might be
walking into a police stakeout,</i>

265
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:37,570
<i>there are a number of things
to look out for.</i>

266
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:39,195
<i>Parked cars or vans,</i>

267
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,520
Hold on, Fi.

268
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,555
<i>Workers that seem
unusually preoccupied...</i>

269
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,303
<i>and curious kids.
No matter where you go in the world,</i>

270
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:52,140
<i>little boys like candy,
puppies, and cops.</i>

271
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,603
I think our detective friend
had a surprise planned.

272
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,608
Mr. Westen.

273
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,236
Detective Paxson and
Detective Forget-your-name.

274
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:06,831
I was thinking about renting
one of these storage units.

275
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:09,407
- You mind if I look at yours?
- Storage unit?

276
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:13,828
Or you could give us the fake name
you used when you rented it.

277
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,790
Or go ahead and clear it out.
Don't let us stop you.

278
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:21,538
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
I heard you were in the neighborhood.

279
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,060
I came by to see you.

280
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:24,920
I wanted to give you some receipts,

281
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,842
give you a better idea of what
I've been doing, where I've been going.

282
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,165
That one's for breakfast.
Fi had a spanish omelet.

283
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,346
Egg whites only.

284
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,015
Thank you.

285
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:37,455
If you get the urge to destroy
any evidence, stop by.

286
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:39,938
We'll be waiting for you.

287
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,402
Was that flirting,
or does she hate you?

288
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,820
I am not her type.

289
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,493
Mike, you ready to do this?
I'm all set.

290
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:56,580
<i>Seriously, though,
I think this is a little risky.</i>

291
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,905
I'm on my way.

292
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,440
<i>When it comes to cover Ids,</i>

293
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,300
<i>impersonating a bad cop is much better
than impersonating a good one.</i>

294
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:12,061
<i>An honest cop follows
policies and procedures,</i>

295
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,626
<i>from the way he cuts his hair</i>

296
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:16,250
<i>to the approach he takes
when carrying out a traffic stop.</i>

297
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,200
<i>Pose as a good cop,
and you have to go by the book.</i>

298
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:23,270
<i>Pose as a bad cop, and you can
throw out that book and write your own.</i>

299
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:24,395
Hi, there.

300
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,332
Detective Finley.

301
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,085
Nice seats.

302
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,450
What is that, pearl leather?

303
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,070
Let me call my lawyer.
He can tell you all about them.

304
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:35,702
All right, just relax.

305
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:38,115
I'm here unofficially.

306
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,115
Just think of this as...
a business meeting.

307
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:44,711
You want to do a business meeting?
How about you make an appointment?

308
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,424
When's a good time to talk about someone
who's moving in on one of your scores?

309
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:51,535
Just worked a drug bust.

310
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:54,475
Heard something that
might interest you.

311
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:56,485
<i>In the criminal world,</i>

312
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,560
<i>selling yourself as a colleague
often means doing something illegal.</i>

313
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,995
<i>So while snorting lactose
isn't pleasant...</i>

314
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,875
<i>it may put people's minds at ease.</i>

315
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,413
Got this on the bust, too.

316
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:13,755
90% pure.

317
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:16,660
Puts hair on your chest,
I'll tell you that.

318
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:19,663
What's this you heard about a score?

319
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,030
Yeah, it was a coke buy
down in overtown.

320
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:24,258
Busted a guy I know,
a junkie named Shep.

321
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,047
He's trying to get me to lay off him

322
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,023
'cause he says he knows
something about a plan to...

323
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,048
rip you off.

324
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:32,384
Some junkie told you this?

325
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:35,887
He's a snitch. Hey, the guy's a mess,
but his intel's usually good.

326
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,301
So, why'd you bust him?

327
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:40,320
Well, I take him in every so often
just to keep him in line.

328
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:41,495
So, listen,

329
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,795
I'm taking him to the station.

330
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:46,065
For a couple of grand...

331
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:48,335
you can question him first.

332
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:49,943
Interested?

333
00:17:53,715 --> 00:17:56,616
He said something about a kid,
if that means anything.

334
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,827
A kid?

335
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,929
Yeah, he didn't say
much more than that.

336
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:03,354
Man, I cannot get over this leather.

337
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,999
It's hand-tooled, right?

338
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:06,418
Where is this guy?

339
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:08,837
So, what you're saying is,

340
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:12,125
Michael's missing
his own birthday party?

341
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:13,826
He's busy.

342
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:15,235
Busy?

343
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,910
Busy being shot at
or busy get blown up?

344
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:20,055
Does he ever take a day off?

345
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,125
Damn it!

346
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,730
I mean, you know, a little
consideration is all I'm asking.

347
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:30,155
I'm making an effort.
So should he.

348
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:33,665
Well, he seems to be
making progress.

349
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,310
Don't fool yourself, honey.

350
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:40,035
Loving Michael is always
trench warfare.

351
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:47,675
You tell him to come to the party.

352
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,855
Busted a few raves here.

353
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:05,630
Don't worry.
No one comes around now.

354
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,205
Place is condemned.

355
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,605
It's where I do my freelance work.

356
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:12,859
So, the snitch is in there.
You got my money?

357
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:17,489
- Here you go. I'll take it from here.
- Oh, oh, no, my friend.

358
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:20,742
That's not how it works.
We question this guy together.

359
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:24,287
No offense, but I don't like
people knowing my business.

360
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,540
Yeah, no offense, but I don't care.
Your business doesn't concern me.

361
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,001
What concerns me is nobody
touches my prisoner but me.

362
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,897
I got my own way
of asking questions.

363
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:35,043
Yeah, and I got to explain every scratch
when I take him down to the station.

364
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:37,240
If you want to come down
there with me, fine.

365
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:38,802
Otherwise, we do this my way.

366
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:43,139
And what about later?
This guy Shep gets to mouth off?

367
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,265
Don't worry about that.

368
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,685
I got enough on him to send him
to prison on the moon.

369
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,925
He'll keep his mouth shut.

370
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,595
So, nobody knows you got
this guy here, huh?

371
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,125
Don't get any ideas.

372
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:59,480
As far as my supervisor's concerned,
I'm working on a case.

373
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:01,869
Officially, I'm in the middle
of interviewing you,

374
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,270
so if anything happens to me,
he knows who to come looking for.

375
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:06,595
Let's do this.

376
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,565
So, I don't know you...

377
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:12,105
but I hear you know me...

378
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,649
and my business.

379
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:17,120
<i>Interrogation professionals
don't ask questions directly.</i>

380
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:19,634
<i>They hide what they know
and don't know.</i>

381
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:23,775
You're a real prince, Finley,
a real stand-up guy.

382
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:26,224
After all I've done for you,
this is what I get?

383
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,775
Nothing personal. Just business.

384
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:31,815
<i>Amateurs tend to ask
for exactly what they want.</i>

385
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,364
Who told you about the kid?

386
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:36,067
<i>It's like playing poker
with your cards showing.</i>

387
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,631
I think your buddy here
wants to kiss me, Finley.

388
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:40,363
Hey, I'm not that type.

389
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:43,116
Answer the question.

390
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,235
- Who told you?
- A friend of a friend.

391
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:48,288
I didn't get his name.

392
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:51,025
They didn't give me details.
I didn't ask for them.

393
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,750
All right, tell me about this job.

394
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:58,506
They needed help moving a...
a kid.

395
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:02,920
They wanted a place that they could
stash him for a few days off the street.

396
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,846
I found it.
Can I go now?

397
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:07,527
You can go when I find out

398
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:10,268
what the hell is going on.

399
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:14,350
The guy who hired you,
he say when they were planning this?

400
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,588
Come on, you think
they're gonna tell me when?

401
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:19,311
Yeah, right after they told me
their vacation plans

402
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:21,112
and their social security numbers.

403
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,864
I don't know.

404
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:24,805
You got a smart mouth.

405
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:27,285
Maybe you should start
using it to save your ass.

406
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:29,845
They told me...

407
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:31,515
to find a place...

408
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:33,458
where they could stash the kid...

409
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,205
for a few days.

410
00:21:35,785 --> 00:21:38,588
- Do you want me to say that slower?
- Where'd you meet them?

411
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,633
Right. Do you think I'm stupid?

412
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:45,720
I tell you that, and you're gonna go
tell them and I'm gonna get killed.

413
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,723
You worry about that later.
You got more immediate problems.

414
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,310
All right, all right.

415
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:56,814
All right. It was a restaurant...
A diner, I think.

416
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,879
<i>When people are desperate
for information,</i>

417
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:02,604
<i>they start filling in the blanks,
often without realizing it.</i>

418
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:04,930
<i>It's something
fortune-tellers rely on.</i>

419
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:07,742
<i>It works pretty much
the same way for spies.</i>

420
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,830
Think harder.

421
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:13,805
<i>Although fortune-tellers usually
don't get smacked around as much.</i>

422
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:18,965
It was a diner.

423
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,506
It had burgers and fries.

424
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:24,092
The Seaside Diner?

425
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:27,745
- Was that it? Off the causeway?
- Yes. Thank you.

426
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:31,057
I met the guy at the Seaside Diner.

427
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,685
What'd this guy look like?

428
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:36,365
Well, I don't know. He was a guy.

429
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:38,106
Was a white guy, maybe.

430
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:39,475
White?

431
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:42,604
I'm just gonna go out in Miami
and look for a white guy?

432
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,862
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

433
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:49,948
No! All right, all right, all right!
It was... The waitress knew him.

434
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,494
She called him "Flowers".

435
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:53,955
They knew him there.

436
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:57,145
And that's it.
That's... That's all I know.

437
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:09,945
Get over to the Seaside Diner now.

438
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:12,455
Ask around for a guy named Flowers.

439
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,220
Surprising how much a guy remembers
when you help him out a little.

440
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:21,810
Listen, this is taking longer than
I thought. I got to make a call.

441
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:23,335
You two play nice.

442
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:29,715
Fi, get over to the Seaside Diner.
It's off MacArthur causeway.

443
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:33,120
Santora is sending a guy. You might be
able to tail him back to Brandon.

444
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,455
Just stay out of sight, all right?

445
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,790
<i>Stay out of sight?
You're seriously telling me that?</i>

446
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:41,002
It's nothing personal. Things are just
getting a little tense around here.

447
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:44,855
So, you and your friends
thought that you could rip me off?

448
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,916
That right?
What was the plan with the kid?

449
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,094
I told you everything.
I was supposed to get...

450
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,345
What was the plan?

451
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,400
I was paid a lousy
150 bucks for this job.

452
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:57,170
You think I don't want to tell you?

453
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:59,687
Put the knife away!

454
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,272
You've got a sharp knife!

455
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:04,695
- Get that knife out of my face!
- Fi, just go, now.

456
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:10,490
Fine. You want to...
You want to know the plan?

457
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,508
- Yeah, I do.
- All right.

458
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,690
Well, you're never gonna
know the plan with a knife,

459
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:17,365
because cutting me up

460
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:21,167
ain't gonna turn me
into a mind reader!

461
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,415
There, friend.

462
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:28,174
My prisoner, my rules, remember?

463
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:32,428
Now, you want me to lean on him,
all you have to do is ask.

464
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:37,558
We clear?

465
00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:40,055
Now, put it away.

466
00:24:53,485 --> 00:24:55,835
We may have a lead
on Brandon's location.

467
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,370
You're going to get him now?

468
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:01,040
- If things go according to plan.
- I'll come with you. I can help.

469
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:05,086
Well, that's sweet and very brave,
but you are gonna get yourself shot.

470
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,209
If that's what it takes to get
our son back, I don't care.

471
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,383
Brandon is gonna need you alive.

472
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,485
Getting shot sounds noble
until it actually happens to you.

473
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:17,306
Don't volunteer for it
unless it's absolutely necessary.

474
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,393
Brandon's gonna be fine.

475
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,161
I know it.

476
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,821
You wanna do something for your son?

477
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:26,970
Don't forget this moment.

478
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:31,824
And don't ever work together.

479
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,161
Not all couples can handle it.

480
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:40,761
Okay, this Flowers...
He show you where the kid is?

481
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:43,291
No, they drove me
through the neighborhood...

482
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:46,169
The route they were gonna take.
I don't remember...

483
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,754
I've had enough of
you-don't-remember.

484
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:53,426
- No more warnings.
- I've answered all your questions.

485
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,221
I want you to tell me
who is trying to rip me off!

486
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,132
And I want a house on Star Island,

487
00:26:00,257 --> 00:26:02,414
filled with strippers and bikinis,

488
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:04,979
but wishing just
doesn't make it so, man!

489
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:06,564
It's time to focus.

490
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:10,081
Listen, I assume
there isn't a sign on the place

491
00:26:10,206 --> 00:26:13,329
that says "the kid's here",
so how would he know if he saw it?

492
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,449
Come on, you got guys with the kid?

493
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,862
Maybe Shep saw them.

494
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:20,119
- Yeah, I got two guys.
- Could be.

495
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,914
I saw guys, but I didn't talk to them.
I don't know their names.

496
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,082
- Did you see the kid?
- No.

497
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:27,615
Okay, Santora, so calm down.
He didn't see the kid.

498
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,019
- Maybe it's not the same place.
- He didn't see him because the kid

499
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:33,257
is in a shed behind the house!

500
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:35,484
Now shut up and let me think!

501
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:44,345
<i>Searching for a concealed enemy
who could be anywhere</i>

502
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,699
<i>is a waste of time.</i>

503
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:46,997
Yeah, it's Jimmy.

504
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,025
Nobody's heard of "Flowers"
at the diner.

505
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:55,655
<i>Usually, your best bet
is to stay put,</i>

506
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,491
<i>and give your enemy
a reason to come to you.</i>

507
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,033
What's going on?

508
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:04,322
<i>Is there something
I should know about?</i>

509
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:05,790
Don't worry about it.

510
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,264
<i>Just get back to the house
and watch the kid.</i>

511
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:15,841
<i>To tail someone,</i>

512
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:18,985
<i>you need both skill and instinct.</i>

513
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,388
<i>You need skill
because the driving is tough.</i>

514
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,642
<i>You can't get too close,
and you can't drift too far away.</i>

515
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,353
<i>You can't go too fast or too slow.</i>

516
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,356
<i>You need instinct
because every turn,</i>

517
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,933
<i>every lane change,</i>

518
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:35,058
<i>every bridge raises the risk
of being seen.</i>

519
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,643
<i>Anyone can be trained
to follow a car.</i>

520
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:40,677
<i>But it takes good instincts</i>

521
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:42,994
<i>to know when it's time
to stop following.</i>

522
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:49,165
So, I had one of my guys ask around.

523
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:53,212
No one at that restaurant
ever heard of anyone named Flowers.

524
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:55,798
Why is that my fault?

525
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,892
Maybe he went to the wrong place.

526
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:00,461
He went to the diner,
you lying son of a bitch.

527
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:01,968
Why would I lie to you?

528
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:05,066
That's it.

529
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:08,154
I'm shutting this thing down
before it gets any worse.

530
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,731
<i>When you work with someone long enough,
you learn to trust them.</i>

531
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:14,515
<i>When things go bad,</i>

532
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,774
<i>that trust is the difference
between life and death.</i>

533
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:21,992
<i>Of course, knowing that
doesn't make it less terrifying</i>

534
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,950
<i>to back a play
you know nothing about.</i>

535
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Listen.

536
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:28,292
I know this guy, Shep.

537
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:31,250
He's a pain in the ass,
but his information is good.

538
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:34,659
Yeah? Because he told me some story
about a guy who doesn't exist?

539
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:38,507
Maybe the guy does exist.
He could be one of your own guys.

540
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,123
So, one more time...

541
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:48,517
this Flowers guy.

542
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,395
What did he look like?

543
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:56,572
He has slicked-back hair.

544
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:58,819
Feels a muscle guy.

545
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:04,824
He wears those muscle shirts,
to show off his arms.

546
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:07,286
That's the best I can do.
That's all I got.

547
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:09,662
That's Flowers?
You're sure?

548
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:13,834
That's the guy who told me
about the kid.

549
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:24,093
What is wrong with you?

550
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,592
That's my guy.

551
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:29,005
Like you said, my own guy
is trying to steal from me.

552
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,130
What guy?

553
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:31,792
His name's Jimmy.

554
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:34,312
The guy I sent to the diner
to look for Flowers...

555
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:36,680
It turns out
the son of a bitch is Flowers.

556
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:38,564
He's supposed to be
watching the kid.

557
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:41,889
- Instead, he's planning to rip me off.
- Things are little hot right now

558
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,667
You know, you can call it off.

559
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:45,292
Let the kid go.

560
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:49,077
Hell, just give him to me.
I'll tell his parents I found him.

561
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:51,518
It's too late for that.
He saw my face.

562
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:55,000
It's over.
I got to clean this whole mess up.

563
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,919
What are you gonna do?

564
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:00,296
Listen, you've been a stand-up guy.

565
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,589
I appreciate that.

566
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,515
And I don't wanna cause you problems.
But that guy in there, Shep...

567
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,822
He's got to die.

568
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:11,194
Now.

569
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:20,030
<i>Every profession
has occupational hazards.</i>

570
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:23,525
<i>Butchers cut themselves,
house painters fall off ladders,</i>

571
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,332
<i>and operatives get asked
to help kill their own people.</i>

572
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:29,121
You watch it, friend.

573
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:32,163
- I got unis checking on my interview.
- Back off.

574
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:36,000
This is my snitch. I got to be able
to explain what goes on.

575
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,303
My own guys are turning on me.
If he's part of it, he's got to go.

576
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:41,942
- They all do.
- I see. I'm just supposed to sit back

577
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:44,433
and hope none of this blows back on me?
No way.

578
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,845
- That's not how this goes down.
- You got any ideas? I'm listening.

579
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,315
Yeah, I say that...

580
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,311
Dropped him off by the road.

581
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:57,655
I let him out 'cause
he was sick from the dope.

582
00:30:57,888 --> 00:31:01,276
I'll just tell them that he attacked me
and he tried to escape.

583
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,401
Wait, you?

584
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,892
Yeah. Don't you remember?
He's my prisoner.

585
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:08,069
How am I gonna explain a suspect
full of these random bullet holes?

586
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:11,202
We'll have the damn FBI here.
It's better this way.

587
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,306
Put a few rounds in his chest with
my gun, but you do it out by the road.

588
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:16,384
- You understand?
- Your gun?

589
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:19,034
What the hell are you talking about?

590
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:21,923
I got to be able to sell
this story to my department.

591
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:24,755
If I don't, they're coming after me.
Trust me,

592
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:27,009
it's better this way.
Come on, come on.

593
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,598
All right.

594
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:34,558
I'll go get Shep.

595
00:31:34,955 --> 00:31:36,958
Get your guy on the phone.
Tell him to sit tight.

596
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,014
I don't want this situation
any worse than it already is.

597
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:53,060
You all right, Mike?

598
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:56,195
You still pack a pretty good punch.

599
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,322
The good news is

600
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:01,113
Santora's planning on
going back to the kid.

601
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:03,611
Fi followed their guy.

602
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,148
They're holed up on an island
off the causeway.

603
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:08,404
And the bad news?

604
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:10,678
Santora wants to kill you first.

605
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:15,315
I convinced him to do it
with my gun,

606
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:18,610
up on the side of the road, make it
look like you were trying to get away.

607
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:21,340
- How far is the road?
- A couple hundred yards.

608
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:23,949
- I guess it'll have to do.
- If there was any other way...

609
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:25,149
There isn't.

610
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:27,086
All right, when you get free,

611
00:32:27,365 --> 00:32:30,698
take his car and head to the causeway.
I'll get you the address.

612
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:32,901
Good luck, Mikey.

613
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:37,045
Let's take a walk.

614
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,243
Listen, listen,
you don't want to do this.

615
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:45,029
This I could tell you more.

616
00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:47,759
I could tell you about Flowers
and the plan.

617
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:50,401
- You don't want to do this.
- I know plenty already.

618
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:53,773
I mean, why shut this down?
There's money to be made here, man.

619
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,312
I could help you.
We could split it 50/50.

620
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:01,287
I don't want to die, man!
Please.

621
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,480
Please, I'm begging you!

622
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:44,869
He got away.

623
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:47,992
What the hell are you talking about?

624
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:49,902
- Where's my gun?
- He took it!

625
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,353
He's got my gun?
We got to find him! Now!

626
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,328
- Could he go to meet up with Jimmy?
- I don't know. Maybe.

627
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,830
- You told him to stay put with the kid?
- Yeah.

628
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:03,485
Where's the house?

629
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:06,627
We don't have time for this!
Where's the house?

630
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,378
- Hibiscus Island.
- What address?

631
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,758
I got to know!
They got my gun!

632
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:15,480
Look, if I go down for this,
so do you!

633
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:18,496
1313, Prospect Street.
What are you doing?

634
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:21,392
They've security office
on the island.

635
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,893
I'll ask if they've seen him.

636
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:30,383
This is Officer Finley,
Miami PD.

637
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:33,612
I'd like to know if you've seen anyone
go to 1313 Prospect Street.

638
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,196
There's someone going there
right now.

639
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,745
I got the address.

<i>Guard duty's boring,

00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,155

645

We're gonna take you back

646
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:44,926
The junkie's here.

647
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:48,117
We do him and Jimmy first,
then the kid.

648
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:50,930
You cut through the backyard,
I'll cover you from the front?

649
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,112
Have fun in there,
you son of a bitch.

650
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:01,235
Look who's here.

651
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:05,829
- You thought you could steal from me?
- What do you say?

652
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,526
Where's the kid?
I said where's the kid?

653
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:11,251
- I don't know! He was just there!
- I know what you did.

654
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,545
I know you're Flowers.
I know everything.

655
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,274
What are you talking about?
Get that thing out of my face!

656
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:19,343
Put it down now! You picked
the wrong guy to double-cross!

657
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:21,276
You sold me out to a junkie!

- You don't have to say anything.

662
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,247
Think about leaving Miami.
Imagine if his friends come looking.

663
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:52,333
We weren't planning to be.
We've talked about making a fresh start.

664
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,670
Somewhere else,
together.

665
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,085
Thank you... for everything.

666
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,093
You ready?

667
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:08,809
A fresh start... together.

668
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:12,396
- Kind of inspiring, don't you think?
- I'd settle for staying out of jail.

669
00:37:14,124 --> 00:37:15,874
Come on, we got a date...

670
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:17,845
with the storage unit.

671
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,152
<i>When a front door is being watched,</i>

672
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:44,257
<i>your best option oftentimes
is just to make a back door.</i>

673
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:48,250
<i>If you don't mind getting damp,</i>

674
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:51,473
<i>a water saw is a great tool
for the job</i>

675
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:54,855
<i>It will cut through the wall much more
quietly than a metal saw</i>

676
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:59,067
<i>and won't ignite anything flammable
that happens to be lying around.</i>

677
00:38:52,054 --> 00:38:55,499
Detective, would you like to come in?
I have some more receipts.

678
00:38:57,225 --> 00:39:00,671
I finally did get a look at that storage
unit that didn't belong to you.

679
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,465
Find anything interesting?

680
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:07,552
I found a hole in the back of the wall
and a puddle of water inside.

681
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:11,556
The heavy rains the other night
must have done some funny things.

682
00:39:12,091 --> 00:39:13,391
This isn't over.

683
00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:41,336
- Did you make this?
- You like it?

684
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,131
I wanted this to be special,
so I cooked.

685
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,361
It's good.

686
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,911
- Happy birthday, Mike.
- Beer. A five-pack.

687
00:39:58,253 --> 00:39:59,855
- Thanks.
- It's imported.

688
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,134
It's supposed to be brewed
by some monks in Belgium.

689
00:40:03,712 --> 00:40:06,247
It's really good, or so I heard.

690
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,531
- Would you like some?
- Yeah, thanks.

691
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,370
It's kind of pricy,
but I figured only the best for you.

692
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,995
- Would you like a bottle opener?
- No, I got one. Thanks.

693
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,500
- I never leave home without it.
- Sam, you need a bottle opener.

694
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,818
Why don't I show you where it is?

695
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:58,622
- It's a bayonet.
- Used during war for close fighting.

696
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,525
- Thanks?
- Well, someone once told me

697
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,129
that caring for you
is like trench warfare.

698
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:13,823
So I thought you should
arm yourself.
