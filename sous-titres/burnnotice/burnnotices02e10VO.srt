1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,070
My name is michael westen.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,530
I used to be a spy until...

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,960
We got a burn notice on
you. You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,530
When you're burned, you've got nothing
-- no cash, no credit, no job history.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,680
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,700
- Where am I?
- Miami.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,610
You do whatever work comes your way.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,680
You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,810
A trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend...

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,850
should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,380
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the fbi...

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,080
you know spies --a bunch
of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,900
Family, too...

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,110
hey, is that your mom again?

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,410
If you're desperate.

16
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,740
Someone needs your help,michael.

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,470
Bottom line -- until you figure out who
burned you, you're not going anywhere.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,500
Prev iously on "burn notice"...

19
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,810
the people who burned me got
aspecialized rifle for a sniper,

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,830
got him an access cardfor this building,

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,290
and sent him to the
conferenceroom on the fourth floor.

22
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,230
Yeah, but we don't knowwhat
he was doing in there.

23
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,190
He's scouting a perch, sam.

24
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,800
I thinkI found his target.

25
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,230
If you want to get in her
room,now would be the time.

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,190
Find anything?

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,240
We hit the jackpot.

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,010
Well, there's
somefamiliar faces in here.

29
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,310
I thinkwe're getting close, mikey.

30
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,870
There arethings in the works
that are far, farover your head.

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,930
Stay out of themor there
will be consequences.

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,410
There are cops here, and
they'rearresting your brother!

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,270
It's as setup.

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,530
She's gonna have her
snipertake his target out now.

35
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,890
If I can get homeand get that access card, I
can get to the sniperbefore he takes his shot.

36
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,120
Yeah, I gotsome news,
mikey. The sniper's dead.

37
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,920
Someone booby-trappedhis
front door, mike.

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,490
When you're a spy, you learn to live with
the idea of people wanting you dead --

39
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,390
an old enemy, a dissatisfied
employer, a disgruntled asset.

40
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,490
Work long enough, and the line
to kill you gets pretty long.

41
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,770
Still, getting blown up isn't
really something you get used to.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,410
- What?
- Don't try it. Don't try that.

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,710
You just tooka pretty bad fall.

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,750
Uh, make thata very bad fall.

45
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,890
Come here, buddy. Easy.

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,680
I think your carsaved your life, mike.

47
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,000
Not the first time.

48
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,280
You've been outfor about 20 minutes.

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,490
I got hereas soon as I could.

50
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,630
Watch your head.

51
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,980
Either someone'svery interested in waterfrontstorage
containers or they're hereto pay you a visit.

52
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,480
Get yourseat belt on, mikey.

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,500
Sam...

54
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,970
Brace yourself, mikey.

55
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,500
Oh, mike, steady. You okay?

56
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,630
I'm fine.

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,310
Sam, I'm sorryabout the car.

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,130
Yeah. It's just I --I
put a lot of love into it.

59
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,180
Well, it'spretty identifiable now.

60
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,080
Yeah, I know. I justneed
a sec to grieve here.

61
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,470
All right, look. You
thinkwe should be out here?

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,180
- I mean, maybe we shouldget you to a hospital.
- We got to keep moving.

63
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,710
When you're being hunted,
paranoia is inevitable.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,630
If you don't know what to do with it,
it turns into cold, directionless fear.

65
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,100
With the right training, it turns into
hyper-awareness of your surroundings --

66
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,420
not always pleasant,
but a lot more useful.

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
You seem a little unsteady.

68
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,280
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

69
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,370
So, mike, who do you
thinkwas in those cars?

70
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,060
Probably carla's guys.

71
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,110
Whatever's going on, my guess isshe needs
to talk to me. She had nate arrested.

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,650
What? Are you serious?

73
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,430
I got a call from my momright
before I talked to you.

74
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,170
Hold on.

75
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,300
Distinguishing between different kinds of
suspicious behavior is crucial for an operative.

76
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,520
Surveillance?

77
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,680
Not surveillance,sam.

78
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,870
Someone doing surveillance,
for example, looks different...

79
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,210
than someone who's
trying to commit suicide.

83
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,970
let's just start with your
name. What's your name?

84
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,700
- It's kenny.
- Kenny.

85
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,950
You want to tell me why you
were trying to kill yourself?

86
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,080
It's my son, jack, okay?

87
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,830
He needs the money.
I was just trying to...

88
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,320
j-just forget it, okay?

89
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,090
Uh, mike, we should keep moving.
I don't know how much longer...

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,410
in a sec.

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,130
Listen, I really need to go.
Are you gonna be all right?

92
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,570
You're not gonna be okay.

93
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,520
What's up with him?

94
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,540
He's just looking for
some friends of mine.

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,540
Who are you? I still don't understand.

96
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm someone who might be able
to help you with your problem.

97
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,010
You know, you look like you're
in pretty bad shape yourself.

98
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,650
Just tell me about your son, jack.

99
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,830
He's 6, and he's got a heart
problem since he was born.

100
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,210
And it's getting worse.

101
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,270
He, uh, might not make it.

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,780
And how does getting
hit by a bus help that?

103
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,700
There's a treatment center in arizona that
looks like it might be able to help him,

104
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,630
but I can't afford it.

105
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,310
A few months ago, I, uh...

106
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,810
I blew all my money on a scam.

107
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,820
A scam?

108
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,610
Yeah. I met a lady in a pharmacy, and she told
me her kid had the same thing, and he got cured.

109
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,730
250 grand later, it looked like it was
working until the "doctor" vanished,

110
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,570
and it turned out to be pep
pills mixed with a painkiller.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,020
It just made jack worse.

112
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,970
So I...

113
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,980
I left a note for the
babysitter, and I...

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,890
I went out to get the money.

115
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:57,390
From the first day of training, you're told
not to get emotionally involved in operations.

116
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,190
But sometimes it happens, and
there's nothing you can do.

117
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,760
<i>JACK</i>

118
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,300
Give me whatever you have that's
connected to the people that did this.

119
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,130
I will get you your money back.

120
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,870
Get my money back? Seriously? How?

121
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,410
By any means necessary.

122
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,560
<i>HENNY*****</i>

123
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,330
- This is insane.
- It's done, sam.

124
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,980
It's irresponsible.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,030
You're raising this guy's hopes --
not to mention you were almost killed.

126
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,520
You gotsurveillance everywhere. Your
brother's in jail. You got plenty going on.

127
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,920
And some guywalks in
front of a bus and --

128
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,110
I didn't make himwalk
in front of the bus, sam.

129
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,350
You were looking for this. I know you.

130
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,040
If it wasn't this guy, it'd be
somebody elsewalking down the street.

131
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,950
I'm running on fumes,sam.

132
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,610
This is all I got. I can help this guy.

133
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,090
All right, mike. I get it.

134
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,700
Oh, look. There's our surveillance
car,just like I said. Come on.

135
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,700
Mike, let's go!

136
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,010
I'm not running.

137
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,440
Oh, no. Oh, you're not gonna...

138
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,880
Oh, you are gonna.

139
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,150
You hereto bring me in? Let me helP.

140
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,290
You got tounlock the door. It's on the
handle. Push, push. There you go, jackass.

141
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,760
- Michael.
- Carla. New office. I like it.

142
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,420
What the hell was that today?

143
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,710
You're asking me?

144
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,940
Last time I checked,you put my brother in
jail, you chased mehalfway across miami,

145
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,410
and you nearly gotmy head blown off.

146
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,630
We had nothingto do with that!

147
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,160
Nothing? Your sniper
gotblown up the same way.

148
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,760
By the way,how'd the assassination go?

149
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,470
An operationwas compromised.

150
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,630
Which is why you're holed up in an
office with two guysand a bag of cheetos.

151
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,230
Tell me --why
am i here?

152
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,740
You were toldto stay
out of our business!

153
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,350
Well, clearly, youidn't thinkI
would do what I was told,

154
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,830
because you went toa lot
of trouble keep me busy!

155
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,880
We need to knowwhat happened.If
you're playingsome kind of a game --

156
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,440
I am flatteredthat you
think I'm that devious,

157
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,450
but I didn't blow myself
up for your benefit.

158
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,340
I wantmy brother out of jail!

159
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,180
I want answers!

160
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,380
I want... my life back.

161
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,390
We'll be in touch.

162
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,660
Get him out of here.

163
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,730
Whatever blew you upwas
pretty substantial.

164
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,510
If you'd haveopened the door any wider, we'd
be picking uplittle itty-bitty pieces of you.

165
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,540
Can you checkthe chemical traces,
see what kind of explosives they used?

166
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,870
Sure.

167
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,010
Michael, I do admire yougetting right back
to work, but you didalmost die yesterday.

168
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,450
You want to call the guy? Say, "sorry about
your kid, but I got a lotgoing on right now"?

169
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,490
Find anythingin the
medical records, sam?

170
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,770
Well, I cross-checked the
clinics andthe pharmacy records,

171
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,050
and it looks likeour scammers got their
lead through a clinicin coral gables.

172
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,110
Probably have a source
theretipping them off?

173
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,410
Sounds about right.

174
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,100
How do you wantto play it, mike?

175
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,530
How's your liver feeling?

176
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,790
We don't have any
appointmentsfor several weeks.

177
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,470
But if you want, you
couldalways try calling other --

178
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,380
I've been calling.I've
beento every clinic in town.

179
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,800
It's liver damage,for christ's
sake. How complicatedcan it be?

180
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,080
I understand, sir.

181
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,770
Oh, please.

182
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,410
Ma'am, I am
inp-a-I-n, okay?

183
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,720
Let's get somethinggoing here.

184
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,190
Sir... no, no, no. That
really won't be necessary.

185
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,950
I'll seeif we can fit you in.

186
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,290
Okay. Thank you.

187
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,770
Man.

188
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,160
Modern-day healthcare.

189
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,540
I'm sorry, sir.

190
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,010
I couldn't helpbut overhear.

191
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,850
You saidyou're having liver trouble?

192
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,030
Yeah. Damn thing'sfalling apart.

193
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,950
Have you heard ofhepatodyne?

194
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,060
It's an experimental drugout of
europe -- did wondersfor my father.

195
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,540
Medical scammers, like pimps, drug dealers,
of feral dogs, need to protect their territory.

196
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,470
They can't let anyone new operate
there, or they're asking for problems.

197
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,480
I actually --I
have some in my car.

198
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,460
Sign me up.

199
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,890
Like a corporation has a lawyer
to handle copyright infringement,

200
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,600
a scammer will often have an enforcer
to deal with unwanted competition.

201
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,010
"Take oneto two tablets by mouth
every four hours as needed."

202
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,590
<i>******</i>

203
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,960
And here's my number,if
you have any questions.

204
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh, that's very nice. Thanks a lot.

205
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,260
- You're welcome.
- Appreciate it.

206
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,170
Good luck.

207
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,090
- What do you thinkyou're doing?
- What? Who the hell are you?

208
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,640
- Get out of here.
- This is a public place. I have every right.

209
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,890
You want a problem?

210
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,760
Is that a gun? I'll call the police.

211
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,590
And then what? You gonna
sell them some pills?

212
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,510
There's already
somebodyworking this place.

213
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,740
What's the problem here?

214
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,310
- You with her?
- Yeah. We're sorry.

215
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,540
We didn't mean to move
inon your score, all right?

216
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,980
Look, there's plenty of money
to be madein that clinic, right?

217
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,900
Maybe we can work
together. What's your name?

218
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,200
As a spy, the best approach is
usually to become a target's friend.

219
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,770
- It's todd.
- Yeah, I'm donny. Good to meet you.

220
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,290
I'm a lefty. Sorry.

221
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,440
Some situations, though,
call for a different approach.

222
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,850
Subtle. I like it.

223
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,950
********

224
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,730
***********

225
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,720
Used to be some kind of gallery.

226
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,120
My buddy'sthe building manager.

227
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,290
They're gonna remodelin a couple of months,
but for now we gotthe whole place to ourselves.

228
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,230
This is perfect, sam.

229
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,740
Looks likeyour pal's waking up.

230
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,250
Just sit tight --be
with you in a bit.

231
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,480
Securing a room isn't about walls.

232
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,350
A determined captive can
kick through plasterboard,

233
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,800
but he can't bite through steel bars
or pry out screws with his fingers.

234
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,610
Though it might be fun to watch him try.

235
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,530
You're sure aboutthis
treatment in arizona?

236
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,590
I mean,as sure as I can be.

237
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,210
You go aheadand make the arrangements.

238
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,050
What? You got the
money back? You serious?

239
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,570
Not yet... but I will.

240
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,710
Listen,I appreciate you trying, but I really
don't thinkyou know what you're up against.

241
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,790
You just callthe treatment center, you
sign jack up,and make plane reservations.

242
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,650
Okay.

243
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,560
Just got a lot of stuffto put in order.

244
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,450
I need to find some placeto put jack.

245
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,260
I know someonewho can babysit.

246
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,750
You're doing a job? What about your
brother? He's sitting ina jail cell, michael.

247
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,210
- I'm handling it.
- Yeah? You almostgot yourself killed.

248
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,910
I'm handling it.

249
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,920
Will you do this favorfor me, please?

250
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,610
Hi, there, sweetheart.

251
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,940
What do you say you and i go find some
toysfor you to play with? Would you like that?

252
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,620
What kind of toys?

253
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,930
Michael's old toys.

254
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,340
Most of them are
blown-upor taken apart.

255
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,070
But I bet we could finda
few good ones. Want to?

256
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,510
Let's go. He's a good boy.

257
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,630
I got it. Thank you.

258
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,520
Michael, what am I
supposedto do here exactly?

259
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,270
Someone came after mewith a bomb.

260
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,470
I don't want thathappening here.

261
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,520
I was supposedto meet campbell.

262
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,130
I'm spread a little
thinright now, fi. Please.

263
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,690
What do you want?

264
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,450
You guys got a great
little scamgoing down here.

265
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,590
We want in.

266
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,830
What do you want,a job application?

267
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,030
You're good.

268
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,340
You're a funny guy, todd.

269
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,660
"Job application."

270
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,330
No.

271
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,340
You know how it iswhen
you get to a new area.

272
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,060
You got to doa little research
-- know the competition,

273
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,630
the business environment.

274
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,300
So...

275
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,020
tell me all aboutyour little
business, starting withyour co-workers.

276
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,690
Get out of my face.

277
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,300
I got nothingto say to you.

278
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,740
Nothing? That's disappointing.

279
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:40,100
There's a saying in interrogation --
"violence perceived is violence achieved."

280
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,460
You don't want someone screaming.

281
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,540
You want him asking questions -- asking,
"what is he doing with that knife?"

282
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,120
Now, why would you wantto
disappoint me like that?

283
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,860
That hurts me.

284
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,500
That hurts me like this.

285
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:58,390
Asking, "if he'll do that to
himself, what will he do to me?"

286
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,000
That is a sharp knife.

287
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,510
Mostly you want him asking,
"how do I make this stop?"

288
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,370
What do you want? Stop!

289
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,630
I just want to knowabout your business.

290
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,670
There's nothing to know.

291
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,300
I workedwith this guy a couple times.
He said he hadthis medical scam.

292
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,490
They needed some muscle, so
they broughtme in. That's it.

293
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,740
Tell me about this guy.

294
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,900
Yeah, mike. I think we've got something.

295
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,030
A guy named philip -- hangs out at
a bar in south beach named teasers.

296
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,450
Nice work, sam.

297
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,080
Thanks. I got to get some band-aids.

298
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,300
Nearly getting killed shakes you up,
no matter how much experience you have.

299
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,020
Brushes with death are like snowflakes.

300
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,190
Each one is unique and icy cold.

301
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,080
Kenny, it's michael.

302
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,560
I need you to meet me tomorrow.

303
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,270
I need a little helpfinding someone.

304
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,360
Now, when you see him, just
point him out to me, okay?

305
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,350
- Yep. Okay.
- Calm down.

306
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,290
The guy sold fake
medicinefor my kid, you know?

307
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,650
I know. Breathe.

308
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,780
- That's him.
- All right, which one?

309
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,250
The guy with
-- Kenny!

310
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,960
Hey, you son of a bitch!

311
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,780
<i>******</i>

312
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,930
How's that feel, huh?

313
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,900
You like that? You need some medicine?

314
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,180
All right. You want to kill him,
or youwant me to solve your problem?

315
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,570
Don't answer that. Just
go back to the car. Go.

316
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,810
"Never." You're sure?

317
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,960
Yes! I don't knowwho they are.

318
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,140
The guy saidhe wanted in on the scam.

319
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,340
And you told them where I was,how to
find me. What the hellwere you thinking?

320
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,620
He had a knife.

321
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,530
You thinkI'm gonna get cut up
just to keepyour name out of it?

322
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,790
I had no choice!

323
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,240
They were withthat guy kenny
-- the one with the little kid.

324
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,520
You know anything about that?

325
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,400
Maybe they triedto rip him off, too.

326
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,180
I told you! I don't know!

327
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,340
Could they be cops?

328
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,960
They're not cops. That I know.

329
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,030
Did you tell them about...

330
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,940
no, man, of course not.

331
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,270
Keep it that way 'cause thatbitch
will kill us in a second.

332
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,470
And trust me. I've seen what she can do.

333
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,070
We got more to worry aboutfrom her than
we do from these guys,whoever they are.

334
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,630
Yeah, mike, I think we
finallygot something we can use.

335
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,050
There's a boss. She
sounds like a hard case.

336
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,060
Good. I'll be right over. It's
time to play"who talks first."

337
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,610
Aw, mike, are you sure?

338
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,240
You know I don't likedoing
that kind of stuff.

339
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,830
Mike?

340
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,010
All righty, then.

341
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,880
Listen, just tell uswho
you are, what you want.

342
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,700
We can work this out.

343
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,090
Hey, you want in on the
scam,huh? Let's talk.

344
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,820
We'll cut you in. It's good
money. What do you want?

345
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,570
- I got 5 grand cashback at my place. It's yours.
- Shut up!

346
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,730
The "who talks first" interrogation technique
originally involved taking two blindfolded prisoners

347
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,060
up in a helicopter and tossing
one out to get the other to talk.

348
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,290
Jesus!

349
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,650
When a helicopter's not available,
any tall building will do.

350
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,680
What is this?

351
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,160
We're gonna havea little conversation.

352
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,320
One of you is gonna tell
meall about your boss...

353
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,420
and the other oneis
gonna go out the window.

354
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,620
Keep your mouth shut.

355
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,730
- Yeah, but you
-- - shut up!

356
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,280
So, who's feeling talkative, huh?

357
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,340
You?

358
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,150
How about you?

359
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,790
Okay, guys. Last chanceto volunteer.

360
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,430
Anybody,anybody at all?

361
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,570
Okay. Eeny...

362
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,280
meeny... miney... mo.

363
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:14,550
You don't actually want to kill anyone.
The screaming is all you really need.

364
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,460
Rachel! The boss's name is rachel!

365
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,820
Oh, my
god. Todd --

366
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,010
Todd is gone, philip.
Todd hasleft the building.

367
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,050
Tell me about rachel.

368
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,870
I was working a scamup
in fort lauderdale.

369
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,150
She found me up there.

370
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,280
Stay focused.

371
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,930
She works clinicsall over town.

372
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,200
What do you want?

373
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,600
I want you to call her.

374
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,350
Set up a meeting.

375
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,930
Tell heryou met some new talent,
some folks you thinkshe should know.

376
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,680
Yeah.

377
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,630
Right? Yeah.

378
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,700
So, I've beenworking through the
paperwork to get himinto the program.

379
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,580
And they're asking for...

380
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,820
- you'll have the money.
- Okay.

381
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,010
How?

382
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,110
I'm meetingwith rachel later.

383
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,080
Uh, mike gets her goingon a new scam
-- something we can taketo the cops.

384
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,020
Now, you hold that over her
head, she'll cough up the money.

385
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,150
Hello.

386
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,260
Hello, michael.

387
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,010
There's a car waiting
for youin the street.

388
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,030
Apparently,I have a meeting.

389
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,150
Go. I'll handle it,brother.

390
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,880
This happens all the time.

391
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,340
Any time now.

392
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,860
The drugstoresells blindfolds now.

393
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,740
Just old-fashioned,I guess.

394
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,360
We havea new job for you.

395
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,540
Really? 'Cause last we spoke, I got the
sense I wasn't up for employee of the month.

396
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,210
Something change?

397
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,860
I thinkyou're gonna like this job.

398
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,330
We want youto try and find whoever
it wasthat tried to kill you.

399
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,400
Oh, like a lead investigator, huh?

400
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,540
Something like that.

401
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,070
And if that doesn't work, you're hoping they'll
takeanother shot at me and expose themselves.

402
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,520
The point is someone out therewants
you dead, and we bothneed to know who.

403
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,700
Michael...

404
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,710
we don't want to loseour new operative, and
I'm assuming you don'twant to lose your life.

405
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,510
Get my brotherout of jail.

406
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,100
We can do that. He'll be released
afterhis arraignment on thursday.

407
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,590
Is that all? 'Cause I
have some place to go.

408
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,820
Yes -- your
side job.

409
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,470
Say hi to all the desperatelittle
people for me, huh?

410
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,150
I thinkhe could use some company.

411
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,130
Well, I'm newto the babysitting thing.

412
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,520
Do I sing songs or...

413
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,910
Honey, there's no point in pretendingthat
you're mary poppins. It's just not in you.

414
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,190
Just be yourself. Go with what you know.

415
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,070
- Do you want to play army men?
- Okay.

416
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,180
my guy hasan m2 browning . 50 caliber.

417
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:46,030
It's a belt-fed weapon,so it's big and hard
to hide, but it's gotgood range, though.

418
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:51,130
So I thinkhe would
shoot... from up here.

419
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,790
Let me see your guy.

420
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,070
Okay.

421
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,800
Your guy has a mark 2
pineapplefragmentation grenade --

422
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,570
short range.

423
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,560
So he needs a really,
reallygood hiding place.

424
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,990
In the flowerpot.

425
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,790
Let's see if we can get
yousome more tactical support.

426
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,400
- Hello.
- Fi, it's me.

427
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,320
Hey, michael. How'd the meeting go?

428
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,350
Fine. I've officially been hiredto
find the guy that tried to kill me.

429
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,340
Uh, fi, we need to...

430
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,430
yeah, I'll be therein a
bit. We're playing army men.

431
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,670
Binoculars.

432
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,410
For the truly security conscious, there's
no better meeting place than a pool of water.

433
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,390
Even if you manage to hide
a bug in your swim trunks,

434
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:04,320
chlorinated water conducts electricity well
enough to short out any listening device.

435
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,770
You're rachel?

436
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,330
<i>*****</i>

437
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,570
Kate?

438
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,990
My associate, donny.

439
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,830
Yeah,rachel. Good to meet you.

440
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,700
Philip saidyou had an opportunity.

441
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,080
He sounded impressed.

442
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,160
Listen, we don't have to
competewith each other.

443
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,000
You workmostly terminal cases?

444
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,180
They're simpler.

445
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,910
Yeah, the folkswe deal with --
they're gonna be aroundfor a while,

446
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,710
taking a lot of pillsfor
the rest of their lives.

447
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,730
A lot of money there.

448
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,620
We can work together.

449
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,230
You find a prospect for
us,you steer them our way.

450
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,860
We find someone on the 
way out,they're all yours.

451
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,060
Nobody walks away. We both win.

452
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,440
Sounds interesting.

453
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,280
We just want to operate herewithout stepping
on your toes. We just want to be friends.

454
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,840
All right.

455
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,490
To friendship.

456
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,940
Donny, be a sweetheartand get the check.

457
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,550
Rachel and ineed to talk.

458
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,990
- I'm curious.
- Yeah?

459
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,800
What is the age mixof your marks?

460
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,620
Mm, older mostly.

461
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,190
But the kids are wherethe real money is.

462
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,250
I mean, parents will shell outwhatever
it takes, no matterhow hopeless it is.

463
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,130
And that's a score.

464
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,240
And when it's over,half the time they
thank you and they're hugging you, crying,

465
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,590
and you're thinking, "you just paid
for my housein keystone island."

466
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,530
In covert work, you try to
make friends with the bad guys.

467
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,370
But sometimes you
just can't pull it off.

468
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,860
Once it's clear that you'renot
going to be friends...

469
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,740
who are you, huh?

470
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,280
You have to resolve the situation
as quickly and as cleanly as you can.

471
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,460
Sometimes you can't
pull that off, either.

472
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,170
Sorry.

473
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,030
As she was talking,I just kept thinking
about jack, and I --I couldn't help it.

474
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,100
It's not your fault.

475
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,170
I'm mad at myself.

476
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,940
Go back to my mom's house. Make
sureeverything's okay there.

477
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,270
What are you gonna do?

478
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,660
What I have to.

479
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,820
Any luck finding rachel?

480
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,120
No. Talked to myfed buddies.

481
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:39,110
Had them runa trap-and-trace, but she uses a
dial-back system out of eastern europe for that phone.

482
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,420
So, we're notfinding her then?

483
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,130
Not that way, mike.

484
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,700
Where are you going?

485
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,710
I'm gonna get the money.

486
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,290
Wait, what are youtalking
about?Rachel's not --

487
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,710
not rachel. From carla.
She's offered cash before.

488
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,630
Mike, come on. You don't
evenknow where to find her.

489
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,520
I'll buy a plane ticketleaving miami.

490
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,040
She'll find mesoon enough.

491
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,890
You and I both knowthis is a bad idea.

492
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,390
You take carla's money,
andshe's got her hooks into you.

493
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,500
What else can I do, sam?

494
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,120
I promised I'd get the money!

495
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,060
There's no other way!

496
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,280
I want to save this kid, too,
but I'm not gonna let youdo this.

497
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,730
Now, look, I knowit's been rough on you.

498
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,230
So I understandthat
you're a little edgy.

499
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,950
Move, sam.

500
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,280
Move.

501
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,180
Not bad, mike.

502
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:53,500
You can hit meall you want, but I'm gonna stand
here till you get your headback in the game.

503
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,360
That's all she said
--"house on keystone island."

504
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,870
That's a lotof houses there.

505
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,150
I mean,it's a nice neighborhood, but
we'd be knocking on doorsfor a month.

506
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,290
We have her phone number. Do
you think I couldlure her out?

507
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,980
No. She's careful,she's smart.

508
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,340
She follows her instincts.
She's gonna lay low.

509
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,740
What do you wantto do, mike?

510
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,580
Fi, can you getyour boyfriend
to lend ushis ambulance tomorrow?

511
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,410
He's got an idea. See, I
knewit. I knew he'd come through.

512
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,070
He hits me in the mouth a
couple times,and he gets an idea.

513
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,120
Can you do it, fi?

514
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,130
Michael, if I ask
campbellone more time --

515
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,030
please.I'm not asking for me.

516
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,980
Using sound to determine an enemy's position
is one of the oldest techniques in a war,

517
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,170
whether it's putting an ear to the
ground or bouncing sonar off a submarine.

518
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:25,520
If you can get your enemy on the
phone, that opens up new possibilities.

519
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:30,390
Hook up your cellphone to an amplifier
and a computer that can analyze sound,

520
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,950
and you have a powerful weapon,
if you know how to use it.

521
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,550
I thinkwe're good to go.

522
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,520
Oh, I think we are, too.

523
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,930
Here we go.

524
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,970
<i>******</i>

525
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,280
Look, fiona,we need to talk.

526
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,260
Yeah. When michael'son the phone, you
drive down the streetwith the siren on.

527
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,960
We use the
sound to --

528
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,070
yeah, I know, I know.That's
not what I meant.

529
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,980
Look, fiona,you're a great girl.

530
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,600
I mean, you're excitingand
you're passionate.

531
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,850
I just don't thinkI can take this.

532
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,730
Campbell.

533
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,930
Look, you and mike -- I
mean,I know you have a history.

534
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,290
But he's your boyfriend... not me.

535
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,510
No, he's
not. You're --

536
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,970
no.I'm a guyyou fool around with
and you borrowambulances from.

537
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,240
He's the most important
thingin your life.

538
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,950
That's him, isn't it?

539
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,310
You know, it's okay.

540
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,250
I know you're alwaysgonna
answer when he calls.

541
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,500
<i>*******</i>

542
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,290
It's time, fi. Let's go.

543
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,500
Running an operation is like poker.

544
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,610
Ideally, you've got good
cards, and you play them well.

545
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,380
When your cards are bad, though,
you have to know how to bluff.

546
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,630
- Hello?
- Yeah,rachel. Yeah, yeah, it's donny.

547
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,870
What do you want?

548
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,890
You pissed off my
bosspretty bad yesterday.

549
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,360
She wanted me to call
youwith a new offer.

550
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,260
A new offer?

551
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,140
Yeah. You settle with usfor 250
grand. You clear out of miami.

552
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,870
You want a
quarter-milliondollars or what?

553
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,670
Or your little girlfriend'sgonna
come after me again?

554
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,180
I'll take my chances.

555
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,310
Yeah, keep laughing.

556
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,830
There's an ambulancecoming
down your street, rach.

557
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,020
You know what it's for?

558
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,840
I called that ambulancefor your
guys -- you know,todd and philip.

559
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,500
You want to saygoodbye to them?

560
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,560
Say goodbye to rach.

561
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,440
Get us out of here, rachel!

562
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,680
I don't think that ambulanceis
gonna get here in time.

563
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,820
250 grand and you clear
out,or you're next.

564
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,890
Forget it. You're not getting anything.

565
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,920
Suit yourself, rach. I'm
coming for you. See you soon.

566
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,590
Fi, tell me you got that.

567
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,570
In modern warfare, a well-positioned
microphone can tell you anything from

568
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,170
where troops are moving to
where a sniper is firing from.

569
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,260
The same basic technology will also tell you when
an ambulance passes someone talking on a cellphone.

570
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,330
Got it, michael.

571
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,930
Looks likewe're in
business. Thanks, sam.

572
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,660
You'd do the samefor me, mike.

573
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Hi, there. Look who's back.

574
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,020
You want 250 grand? I can do that.

575
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,010
Nah, that offer expired.

576
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,770
She's all excitedabout shooting you now.

577
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,790
You don't want to do this.

578
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,520
Don't waste your time.
When she gets like this...

579
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,660
As long as you're on the
street,we got a problem.

580
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,540
Trust me. It's simpler this way.

581
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,160
Oh, there's got to beanother way.

582
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,030
We can make a deal.

583
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,530
We can't take the risk.

584
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:30,570
Unless somebody's deador
in jail, she gets itchy.

585
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,100
Okay, wait! Wait!

586
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,140
What if I go to jail?

587
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,950
Jail?

588
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,870
Oh, think about it. I'm out of your way.

589
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,550
There's a half a
milliondollars in this house.

590
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,010
It's yours.

591
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,960
Don't look at me. She's the boss.

592
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,850
It's simpler this way.

593
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,040
Yeah, I hear you,but it's messy.

594
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,950
The wall --we'd
have to clean it up.

595
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,900
Besides, we coulduse
the start-up money.

596
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,330
Fine.

597
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,730
- Phone.
- Money.

598
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,710
Dial first.

599
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,500
You figure we can't shoot
youafter we call the cops.

600
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,950
Yeah, you're smart. Real smart.

601
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,450
It's in the cabinetbehind
the liquor bottles.

602
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,300
I need to speakto the police.
I want to report a crime.

603
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,580
Yeah, I'll hold.

604
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,180
Oh, and this confession
--make it convincing.

605
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,180
Because the dayyou get out of jail...

606
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,720
You're serious? T-that's all for jack?

607
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,820
It's a little morethan
you need for the treatment.

608
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,980
Take the rest,start a college fund.

609
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,030
- What happened to, uh...
- rachel?

610
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,130
She confessedto an
impressive list of scams.

611
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,670
She won't be aroundfor a while.

612
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,470
Cops foundtodd and philip hog-tied
behindthe miami police station.

613
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,030
I-I don't knowwhat to say.

614
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,270
I'm glad I could help.

615
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,960
Oh, and thankyour friend, too, 'cause
jackcan't stop talking about her.

616
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,930
He, uh --he
drew this.

617
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,750
That's, uh... you and her together.

618
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,650
Tell him thanks.

619
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,770
You'll findanother boyfriend.

620
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,580
Not like campbell.

621
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,340
He was sweet and cute.

622
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,790
He had otherimpressive qualities.

623
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm sorry.

624
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,240
Are you?

625
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,250
I want you to be happy.

626
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,770
I got the chemical analysis
backfrom the explosion.

627
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,120
Shaped charge
--professional.

628
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,220
However, they couldn'tgo out
the front door after they set it.

629
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,350
If theywent off the balcony...

630
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,330
I could checkthe security cameras
at the businessesalong the river.

631
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,380
You're reallygonna do
this? Hunt them down?

632
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,610
Worth a try. The enemy of
my enemycould be my friend.

633
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,270
It's from jack.

634
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,300
Thanks again, fi.

635
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,460
Hello, michael.

636
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,100
Carla.

637
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,130
You're here.

638
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,360
I helped myselfto a yogurt.
I hope you don't mind.

639
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,730
Funny thing -- I poisoned all my
yogurtsjust in case you came by.

640
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,280
Even you aren't that good.

641
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:36,830
A part of you --a little part
of you -- is wondering if I am.

642
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,340
I see youbought a new door.

643
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,070
Any progressfinding our bomber?

644
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,170
Nope. Checked the blast.
Crude I.E.D. Amateur hour.

645
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,610
We recruited youbecause
you're a good liar.

646
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,110
I guess we can't complain
toomuch when you lie to us, hmm?

647
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,010
But know this --
one way or another,

648
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,780
I expect results. Understand?

649
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,710
Loud and clear.

650
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,540
Good.

651
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,100
Doing your own errands?
It's not like you.

652
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,280
Exceptional timescall
for exceptional measures.

653
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,890
When you've spent enough
time as an operative,

654
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:35,000
recovering from a brush with death isn't about an
appointment with a psychiatrist or a week in hawaii.

655
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:41,430
It's about having a purpose, whether it's
something to fight or someone to hunt.
