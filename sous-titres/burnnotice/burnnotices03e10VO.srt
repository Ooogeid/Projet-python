1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:01,751
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,179
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,751
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,818
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,136
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,771
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:16,098
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:19,040
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,440
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:28,318
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,696
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:33,115
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:35,325
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,953
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,789
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,193
Previously...

18
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:47,421
We had one fight,
and you decide to go back to Ireland?

19
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,923
This isn't about one fight.

20
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,842
It's bad news, McBride.
Someone's coming to kill my sister.

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,266
Thomas O'Neill.
Bloodthirsty hooligan.

22
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,728
You tell me where Fiona is now!

23
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,757
Why don't you do yourself a favor
and just forget the past?

24
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,842
Fiona is not my past.

25
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:27,586
O'Neill outed you as an American.

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,422
You can never go back to Ireland.

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,840
Neither can she.

28
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,326
What were you doing with Tom Strickler?</i>
You know the people he was in bed with?

29
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,807
Now someone's in town
cleaning up the mess he left behind.

30
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,642
- Wait, who's in town?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,770
Someone's coming for me,
and they're coming for you, too.

32
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:01,365
Hold still.
I'm almost done.

33
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,330
You're doing this on purpose.

34
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,625
I'm not the one who tore
your stitches out second week in a row.

35
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,966
Now stop moving,
or you're gonna do some serious damage.

36
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:13,050
I will do some serious damage to you
when this is over.

37
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,159
I promise you that, Michael Westen.

38
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:17,219
You have the sewing skills
of an orangutan.

39
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:19,513
There.
Now you can kill me if you want to.

40
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,085
God, I want to.

41
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:25,186
Okay, yes, you should rest.

42
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:26,729
There you go.

43
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,608
You're lucky that these sedatives

44
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,067
are kicking in 'cause...

45
00:02:32,715 --> 00:02:33,736
I will kill you.

46
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:35,070
I'll be here.

47
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:38,600
<i>Doing your own field medicine
has its advantages.</i>

48
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,457
<i>No conversations with the police,
the food's better,</i>

49
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:45,414
<i>and the relationship between patient
and caregiver is very close.</i>

50
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,670
<i>Of course, that last one
can be a disadvantage, as well.</i>

51
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:52,838
Gotcha.

52
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:58,219
So, is she finally out?

53
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,389
I was afraid the paint
was gonna peel off the walls.

54
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,431
- She'll be asleep for awhile.
- It's funny.

55
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:04,650
When I thought she was leaving town,

56
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,352
I actually felt a little bad.

57
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,395
Hard to believe, I know.

58
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,713
It looks like she'll be sticking around
for a while.

59
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:15,372
- You find out anything?
- Yeah, I been calling around.

60
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,249
The intelligence agencies
are checking in to Diego's death.

61
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:21,367
Apparently, enough people saw you
on the street that you're not a suspect.

62
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,994
For once, they're not blaming me
for something.

63
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:26,240
It doesn't mean you're popular.

64
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:29,416
Operation Unburn Michael Westen
is officially off.

65
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,963
I figured as much.

66
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:33,834
In the meantime, I'm checking out
the phone lifted off of Strickler.

67
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,010
I've been trying to figure out
who threw Diego off that hotel balcony.

68
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,301
- Any luck?
- Well, it's slow going.

69
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,946
I mean, the guy called for takeout food,
escort agencies,

70
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:45,599
and of course, he was calling all around
the world about your little burn notice.

71
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,767
But...

72
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:48,850
Best lead is this hotel
on South Beach.

73
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:51,750
If we're looking for someone in Miami,
that's my bet.

74
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,732
- Thanks.
- Want me to go down there with you?

75
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:56,694
I mean, everything you say, this guy
sounds like a grade A psychopath.

76
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,162
I'll be careful.

77
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:01,125
- Take care of Fi?
- Of course.

78
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:13,043
<i>Getting information out of hotels
requires a delicate touch.</i>

79
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,675
<i>One whiff that you're snooping</i>

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,644
<i>and you'll just hear a lot of
"we can't give out that information".</i>

81
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,591
<i>You need to get them on your side,</i>

82
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:23,053
<i>convince them that you're someone
that needs customer service.</i>

83
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,723
Excuse me.
Wondering if you could help me.

84
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,850
A friend of mine
was staying here at the hotel,

85
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,227
and, well,
we were supposed to hook up.

86
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,182
We've been expecting you.

87
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,946
<i>Of course, when the hotel clerk
turns out to be expecting you,</i>

88
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,890
<i>that makes things a little easier.</i>

89
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,112
Left it for me? You sure?

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,739
He had the bellman drop it off.

91
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,616
He said you'd be 6'1",

92
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,410
exquisitely dressed,
with impeccable posture.

93
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:56,337
<i>In the world of espionage,</i>

94
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,361
<i>there are a lot of ways
to introduce yourself.</i>

95
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:01,400
<i>You can use official channels.
You can use a cover ID.</i>

96
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,830
<i>You can use encrypted communication.</i>

97
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,105
<i>Whatever the method,</i>

98
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,284
<i>that first contact tells you
a lot about a person.</i>

99
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,788
<i>Especially when someone
introduces himself</i>

100
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:16,899
<i>by firebombing a hotel room.</i>

101
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,819
Yogurt Team

102
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,219
He must have been there to trigger
the fire. Did you see anything?

103
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,910
Not really.
I don't know what he looks like.

104
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:31,670
They never saw his face
at the front desk.

105
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:34,208
The room is registered
to Dr. Randolph Quilling.

106
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:36,752
Quilling? Mike, you serious?

107
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,620
He was a British nuclear scientist,
killed in '99.

108
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:42,618
Burned to death in his hotel room.

109
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:45,594
I think Mike's new friend
is telling us that he was involved.

110
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:49,180
It's a hell of a thing, torching
a hotel room as your business card.

111
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:53,309
Well, as long as we're waiting for
our mystery man to say hello again,

112
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:55,646
I need you to take a meeting for me.

113
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,764
It's an insurance-scam thing.

114
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,225
I would do it myself,
but in my current state...

115
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:03,516
You were gonna leave the country.

116
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:06,082
- You were still taking jobs?
- I had already committed to this.

117
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,320
One last thing
before going back to Ireland,

118
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:11,286
but someone got outed
as an American spy,

119
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,914
- and now I can't go home.
- We saved your life, remember?

120
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,749
Saved? Please.

121
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,115
It's out at the Hallandale
impound lot.

122
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:31,321
Thank you for meeting me.
A friend of mine referred me to Fiona.

123
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:33,373
Said she could take care
of anything.

124
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:36,015
Yeah, Fiona's good at what she does.

125
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,840
That's my husband's car.

126
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,691
He was killed last month
in a five-car pileup.

127
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,902
I thought it was an accident,
but I found this.

128
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,865
They're insurance forms,
already filled out.

129
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,433
Some scam was gonna pay him
to say that he hurt his neck.

130
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:53,705
We had money problems, and...

131
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,756
He was just trying to save us.

132
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,460
Instead, he got killed?

133
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,570
Some guy came to my house
last week in a Corvette.

134
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:02,525
He said that since my husband died,

135
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,549
I've to sue the city for wrongful death
and give them the money.

136
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,134
He threatened my family.

137
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,219
Do you think that Fiona can help?

138
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:10,971
I'll see what she can do.

139
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,268
She'll be in touch
when we know more.

140
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:17,657
Thank you.

141
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:25,897
I need you to go over
to the county records office.

142
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,489
See if you can get them to slip you
some insurance records.

143
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,282
You can't just ask for that stuff.

144
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,900
Use your Sam magic.

145
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:34,995
Why didn't I think of that?

146
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:41,731
<i>The day that the cellphone call log
was invented</i>

147
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:45,056
<i>should be celebrated
as a national holiday for spies.</i>

148
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,047
<i>Even a cautious cellphone user</i>

149
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:50,509
<i>who uses dial-back systems
or switches phones often</i>

150
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,240
<i>leaves behind
a lot of information you can use.</i>

151
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:56,037
- You still going through that thing?
- Strickler used this phone.

152
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:59,098
Chances are he talked to whoever it is
that's torching hotel rooms

153
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:00,673
to say hello to me.

154
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,920
Have you considered turning this over
to Homeland Security?

155
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,100
They get paid
for this sort of thing, you know.

156
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:09,400
For all I know, he could be working
for Homeland Security.

157
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,534
I'll call someone
when I need someone.

158
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,386
How'd it go
at the county records office?

159
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:16,411
Not good.

160
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,539
I tried to get something,

161
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,390
anything, out of that lady down there
about the insurance scam.

162
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:23,373
She's 65, a widow,

163
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,754
and completely immune
to my charming ways.

164
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,672
Seriously?

165
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:30,259
You couldn't get the medical records
out of a 65-year-old woman, Sam?

166
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,908
She's my kryptonite, okay?

167
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,749
I'm telling you, you wanna get
the files out of that broad,

168
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:36,640
it's gonna take
some extreme measures.

169
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:40,352
I got an idea how to do it,
but you're not gonna like it.

170
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,500
You want me to lie to some woman
in the county records office?

171
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,483
- What did she do?
- She didn't do anything.

172
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:49,778
She's the only one that has access
to the information we need.

173
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,946
Why me?

174
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,690
Because she's your age,
smokes your brand, and...

175
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,725
shops at the same stores you do.

176
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,994
Sam did some scouting.

177
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:59,746
We just thought that you would be
someone she would trust.

178
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,720
So that I can lie to her.

179
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,695
It's for a good cause, mom.

180
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:06,587
The people we're trying to find
got some guys killed already.

181
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:17,590
<i>Human intelligence can often
be collected with a cover identity.</i>

182
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:19,067
<i>There are times, though,</i>

183
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,992
<i>when a cover ID has more to do
with who you are than how you act.</i>

184
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,340
Yes, I've been through our records
dozens of times.

185
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:30,965
We lost a lot of that stuff
in a hurricane a few years ago,

186
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:34,577
and I've got files
that are nothing but mildew.

187
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:36,750
Isn't that the worst?

188
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,160
I lost a couch that way.

189
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,913
I swear, sometimes I think
we should all move to Phoenix.

190
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,880
If you could just give me all the names
of the doctors who treated my husband...

191
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:52,900
I wish I could.

192
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,275
Those files are all sealed, though.

193
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,846
Doctor/patient confidentiality.

194
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:01,423
I just thought maybe...

195
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,685
Not even a quick glance?

196
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,445
Not even a peek.

197
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:16,810
<i>Working an intelligence asset</i>

198
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,163
<i>is part acting, part strategy.</i>

199
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:21,625
<i>Some people don't have the talent...</i>

200
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,705
<i>And some people do.</i>

201
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:26,083
Thank you for your time.

202
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,651
Are you all right?

203
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,545
Sorry.

204
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,383
It was so much easier
when my husband was alive.

205
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:36,645
Thank you.

206
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:39,179
And he used to do
all of this stuff for me.

207
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,059
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

208
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,021
Wait.

209
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:51,191
Let me see what I can dig up.

210
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,361
This will be our secret, though.

211
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:55,737
Of course.

212
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:57,458
Don't get me fired.

213
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,860
No. My goodness.
Thank you so much.

214
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:07,778
There he is.

215
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,551
Your mom's got a gift
for working assets.

216
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:12,921
She brought back every document
I asked for.

217
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,049
Well, she's done her fair share
of manipulating people over the years.

218
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,017
Well, she wasn't very happy
about doing this.

219
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:21,430
So, our local county clinic
is looking good.

220
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:24,141
It's got your normal folks,
but there're too many shady characters

221
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,607
walking out of there with neck braces,
you know?

222
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:27,853
Check out the wheels.

223
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,896
You said that our guy drove a Vette?

224
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:34,151
So I called my buddy to run the plates.
The guy's name is Ryan Johnson.

225
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:37,237
He's on parole for fraud and assault,
so I'm guessing

226
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,449
he didn't get the Corvette and the watch
from his work-release job.

227
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:43,171
Looks like the guy
Calia said smacked her around.

228
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:44,870
Got a cover ID for you.

229
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,956
You're from North Carolina.
You're a friend of Erik Lee's.

230
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:50,542
- Who's Erik Lee?
- He's one of Ryan's buddies

231
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,066
who was killed in the same crash
as Calia's husband.

232
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,737
Stuff should check out
if they don't check too deep.

233
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,008
Looks like I'm going for a drive.

234
00:11:58,337 --> 00:11:59,637
Have fun, Mikey.

235
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,265
<i>Precision driving is part
of the training for an operative.</i>

236
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,768
<i>It's mainly used when pursuing
or being pursued.</i>

237
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:10,693
<i>But on occasion...</i>

238
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,357
<i>it's a great way
to make an impression.</i>

239
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,861
Hey, boy!

240
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,613
Yeah...
You and me need to talk!

241
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:58,151
Jesus! Are you crazy?

242
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:00,612
Hey, I'm Alex.
You must be Ryan Johnson, right?

243
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:02,489
What is this?

244
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,283
Hell, what's it look like, boy?
It's a job application.

245
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,630
<i>Criminals deal with a shortage</i>

246
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:14,835
<i>of skilled labor,
just like all businesses do.</i>

247
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,295
<i>They can't give too much information</i>

248
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,104
<i>to new hires, of course,
but they also can't pass up real talent.</i>

249
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:24,629
I was driving for an insurance crew
up in North Carolina.

250
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:27,654
I was working
with your boy Erik Lee up there.

251
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,817
- Erik's not with us anymore.
- I know.

252
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,351
Got himself killed.

253
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,312
Squashed by a truck
a few weeks back.

254
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:36,488
Something like that.

255
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,583
Word on the street is you're
the number-one crew around town.

256
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:42,362
And sounds
like you got a job openin'.

257
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,578
- You can drive. I'll give you that.
- Really?

258
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,997
Hell, I'll take it.
I'm the best wheelman around.

259
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,459
You got someone you think is better,
you point him, and I'll prove you wrong.

260
00:13:57,692 --> 00:14:00,151
There's a bar down at the river
on Fifth Street.

261
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:02,294
Meet me there tomorrow at noon.

262
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:13,827
They sent some more guys
by the house.

263
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:16,438
Sat there glaring at me
while I filled out some paperwork.

264
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,315
You're doing the right thing.
Stay cool,

265
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,367
do as they ask,
and we'll take care of it.

266
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,777
But can't you just talk
to them or...

267
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,112
It's not gonna do much.

268
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,405
They may back off,

269
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,699
but they'll come back
and do it again to someone else.

270
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,743
An insurance scam is like a network.

271
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,076
Doctors, lawyers,
auto-repair places, enforcers.

272
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,833
To avoid people coming after you,
you have to take down the whole thing.

273
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,710
We'll get these guys
going on a scam,

274
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,808
call the cops,
and get them caught in the act.

275
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,380
I'll keep you and your boys safe.

276
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:44,907
Thank you.
You've been so amazing.

277
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,844
And the people that you have
working for you, they're just great!

278
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:51,952
It's so important to find good help.

279
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:57,092
I've been working
on our little manhunt.

280
00:14:57,217 --> 00:14:59,373
I wish I had more to go on
than a nameless,

281
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,057
faceless murderer
with a taste for arson, but anyway...

282
00:15:02,182 --> 00:15:04,248
Feds got nothing.
They ruled Diego a suicide.

283
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,099
And you?
You done any better?

284
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:08,228
A little. I've been triangulating
one of the phones

285
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,414
that Strickler was calling,
trying to get a location.

286
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:11,819
How long to get something?

287
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,482
Couple of days, but no matter
who this guy is, we know two things.

288
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:19,411
- He's a killer, he saw you coming...
- I don't have a lot of options here.

289
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:22,298
Someone killed my CIA contact.
Now, that is on my head.

290
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:25,735
I don't get to walk away
or pretend it didn't happen,

291
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,369
no matter how dangerous
this game he's playing is.

292
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,144
You'd do the same thing.

293
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,410
I get it.
I don't like it, but I get it.

294
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,263
Let me know
when you got something solid.

295
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:36,914
You got it.
Mike, one more thing.

296
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,111
I think your mom is a little unclear

297
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:42,236
about the proper handling
of intelligence assets.

298
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:43,858
You may want to talk to her.

299
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:53,817
You want another gin and tonic,
Tina?

300
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:56,054
No, no, thanks! I'm fine.

301
00:15:58,993 --> 00:15:59,993
Hi, honey.

302
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,328
Tina, this is my son Michael.

303
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,397
Your handsome son!

304
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,975
It's very nice to meet you.

305
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:10,067
Mom, could I talk with you
for a second?

306
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:11,056
Sure.

307
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,981
Would you excuse me, Tina?

308
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:14,913
Sure you don't want another?

309
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:24,276
Mom, what are you doing?

310
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,444
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm playing canasta with a friend.

311
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,572
- A friend? No, she's a...
- She did me a favor!

312
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:31,906
Why can't we be friends?

313
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:34,566
That's not how it works.

314
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:36,225
You told her your name, my name.

315
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,101
You don't socialize with an asset!

316
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:39,553
She's not an "asset".

317
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:42,042
She's a person,
sitting at my dining-room table.

318
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,310
I know that!

319
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:46,921
It's dangerous.
She broke the law.

320
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,840
You said that that job was over.

321
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,288
Just don't get too close.

322
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:05,565
What are you worried about?

323
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:09,019
So your mom becomes friends
with the county records lady. So what?

324
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:10,820
You never know
how things are gonna go.

325
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,323
She's an asset.
Things could get very complicated.

326
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:15,286
I was an asset of yours once.

327
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,261
And things got complicated.

328
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,162
And people got hurt.

329
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,330
True.

330
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,607
But in my experience...

331
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:27,754
People get hurt and things
get complicated no matter what you do.

332
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,276
Dad, this is the guy
I was telling you about.

333
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,695
You wanted drivers?

334
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:53,196
This guy can drive.

335
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,781
He drove with Erik Lee.

336
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,658
I checked him out,
he's the real deal.

337
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,243
So you're the big, bad boss.

338
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,791
Boss? No.

339
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:01,816
Just a businessman.

340
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,209
Good.
I'm looking to do some business.

341
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:07,877
I'm looking for a crew.
You know?

342
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,462
I did some driving up north.

343
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,339
Amateurs.
They didn't know real talent.

344
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:12,831
Talent?

345
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,885
What Ryan said,
it sounded more like recklessness.

346
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,929
Talent, recklessness.
It's a fine line.

347
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:20,265
You got any warrants?
You do, you don't drive.

348
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,517
- I'm clean.
- Accidents? How's your driving record?

349
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,769
I got plenty of accidents,
but none on my record.

350
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,229
All right, here's the deal.

351
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:29,482
We use a couple dozen drivers a year,
rotate them in and out,

352
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,929
make sure nobody shows up
in the system too much.

353
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:34,299
You make sure
Ryan has your information,

354
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:35,874
and we'll call you.

355
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,860
Next time,
bring me your driver's license.

356
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,202
- I'll need local and out of state.
- My friend...

357
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:43,453
Maybe I wasn't making myself clear.

358
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,375
I'm not looking to make a few bucks
driving third wheel in a bump-and-run.

359
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,335
I'm here looking for some business,

360
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,203
with a team, management.

361
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:53,339
Get your hand off me.

362
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,511
I'm just hoping
you're not wasting my time, is all.

363
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,848
Management?

364
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,224
I'll tell you what.

365
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:06,269
There's an auto-body shop in Boca
owes us 10 grand,

366
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,772
and my boy here
hasn't been able to collect.

367
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,482
I told you I can handle that.

368
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,859
Shut up. You're the one
that brought this guy in here.

369
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,904
You two go up there together.
You get our money back,

370
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:17,932
you got a job.

371
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,825
Now, that sounds like a deal.

372
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:27,373
<i>Family businesses are tough,
and they're even tougher for criminals.</i>

373
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:30,126
<i>Mix normal family issues with cash,</i>

374
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,879
<i>violence, and the danger
of getting arrested,</i>

375
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,597
<i>and things get tense.</i>

376
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:38,076
Come on, kid, don't be like that.
This'll work out good. You'll see.

377
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,177
Whatever.

378
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,762
You need the help.

379
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,651
From what I saw in the papers,

380
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:44,420
you could use someone like me.

381
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:45,850
I mean, a crash like that...

382
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,318
We do just fine.

383
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,728
More than fine.

384
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:51,065
The wife of one of the dead guys,
she's suing.

385
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,982
We'll get a million of the city,
maybe more.

386
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:55,485
- She's willing to go to court for you?
- She will.

387
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:56,846
Or...

388
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,947
Her kid will fall down the stairs.

389
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:01,993
You boys know
how to kick some ass, don't you?

390
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:04,244
Tell me more
about this little collection.

391
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:06,397
It's a bunch of bikers.
This is stupid.

392
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:08,373
I've already talked
to these guys twice.

393
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:10,577
Well, third time's a charm.

394
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:24,610
I told you,
we're not kicking back 10 grand.

395
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:27,433
Tony, you wouldn't have made any of that
if we hadn't rigged the bids!

396
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,769
We already did the work!
That's the way it's...

397
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,813
Girls, don't fight.
You're both pretty.

398
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,475
Tell you what.

399
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:36,306
You won't give him the money,
you can give it to me.

400
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:38,226
You're not getting that money.

401
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:40,222
Y'all are gonna give me
the money right now.

402
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,331
What are you doing?

403
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:53,256
What the hell's it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting you your 10 grand!

404
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:57,130
<i>Anybody who works around acetylene
knows to be extra careful.</i>

405
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,217
<i>It's one of the hottest-burning,
most explosive gases in existence.</i>

406
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,511
They ain't gonna shoot,
not while we're near the tanks.

407
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,432
Because if they do, there'll be pieces
of biker raining all around here!

408
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,750
10 grand now!

409
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,272
- Hey, stop!
- You can make this stop anytime.

410
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,234
If you put 10 grand into a bag, throw
your guns in it while you're at it!

411
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:20,305
Anytime now!

412
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,697
Do what he says!
Get the money!

413
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:27,493
Dad, we got it!
Yeah, all 10 grand!

414
00:21:28,135 --> 00:21:30,830
- Looks like you got a job!
- Good news. You're making my day.

415
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,803
We should celebrate somewhere else!

416
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:39,805
Damn!

417
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,590
Looks like I got a meeting
with the boss.

418
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:45,219
I'm gonna bring him some ideas.

419
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:48,456
Calia and son are at my place.
I'll go give them the good news.

420
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:52,352
You are doing so well on this job.

421
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:54,228
I think we're almost even.

422
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,356
Almost.

423
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,080
What's wrong, Sam?

424
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:05,198
I've never seen you
drink a beer that slowly.

425
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,875
I just think we'd be better off

426
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,055
if we focused
on this insurance-scammer thing

427
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,307
and forgot the whole
"Diego getting murdered" business,

428
00:22:11,432 --> 00:22:13,831
- 'cause it's not looking pretty.
- Well, what is it?

429
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,877
I did the triangulation
on that phone.

430
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,350
The one that our hotel-room-torching
mystery man was using?

431
00:22:19,475 --> 00:22:21,214
- And I found it.
- Well?

432
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,832
The thing is, the phone is down
at the old Marine Stadium.

433
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:27,506
- Marine Stadium? Isn't it closed?
- Yeah, for like 20 years.

434
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:28,940
It's a graffiti magnet.

435
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,730
And the phone is just sitting there?

436
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:34,255
It's such a setup, Mike,
it's not even a setup, you know?

437
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,061
So, what are you gonna do?

438
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:38,856
I'm gonna go down there.
I'm gonna check it out.

439
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,358
Of course you are.

440
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:47,010
<i>For a covert operative,
there's often a fine line</i>

441
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:48,700
<i>between hunter and hunted.</i>

442
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:50,354
<i>Letting someone hunt you</i>

443
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,950
<i>is just another way
of finding out more about them.</i>

444
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,160
Cellphone signal's coming
from out here.

445
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:58,910
<i>Of course, there's also a fine line
between following up intelligence</i>

446
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:00,410
<i>and walking into a trap.</i>

447
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:02,330
Doesn't get more exposed
than this, does it?

448
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,866
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, I'm sure. Stay here.

449
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:07,005
Cover me as best as you can.

450
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,380
Hello?

451
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:36,205
<i>Sorry we missed each other
at the hotel.</i>

452
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,123
Me too.

453
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:40,084
<i>I've heard so much about you.
It's an honor to see you in the flesh.</i>

454
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,695
<i>You're quite a puzzle, Mr. Westen.
Fascinating.</i>

455
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,298
I'm far more interesting in person.
Who are you?

456
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,468
<i>I can't just tell you, now, can I?
Where's the fun in that?</i>

457
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,850
<i>I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man you are.</i>

458
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:54,974
<i>I need to decide if you're someone
I should get to know better...</i>

459
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:57,602
<i>or someone I should kill.</i>

460
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,910
Let me know
when you make up your mind.

461
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:03,983
<i>You'll know.</i>

462
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:07,278
Mike, get out of there!

463
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:20,785
- You okay, brother?
- I'm fine, Sam.

464
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,105
So, how did the big meeting go?

465
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,925
We had a brief
and unsatisfying chat on the phone.

466
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:33,180
So, who is he?

467
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,640
I don't know,
but he shot up the Marine Stadium.

468
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:40,080
Reminded me of a stadium shooting
back in '98 in South America.

469
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:42,558
Sam's looking into it,
seeing if there's a connection.

470
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,024
I started on a listening device
for your meeting with Ryan later.

471
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,985
Would you care to join me?

472
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:49,821
I would love to.

473
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:55,917
You know...

474
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,289
After the other day, I never really
did get a chance to actually say...

475
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:05,450
Not that I have any doubt in my mind
that I would have saved myself.

476
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:09,310
And I still think that your tactical
approach was a little iffy.

477
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:10,835
But you and Sam...

478
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,385
You did come back for me.

479
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,696
You gave up a lot
to come back for me.

480
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:18,432
- Whether I need it or not.
- You're welcome, Fi.

481
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:25,596
Watch it. You're getting solder
on my transmitter.

482
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:36,895
So, 10 grand.

483
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:41,109
Ryan here is still a little fuzzy
on the details of how you two got it.

484
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,365
But...

485
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,293
Me and Ryan are like Bonnie and Clyde.
You'd have been proud.

486
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,379
- I'm sure I would have.
- We got the money, all right?

487
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:52,535
You want to talk about
management opportunities?

488
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,689
- Talk.
- Scam's called "Deathwish".

489
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:57,221
I ran it a couple times
back when I was just starting out.

490
00:25:57,545 --> 00:26:01,267
I'm gonna need a stooge, someone who can
take some damage for a serious payday.

491
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,602
I know a few people.

492
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,653
The stooge sets up
at a railroad crossing,

493
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,524
gets a city vehicle behind them.

494
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,075
We come in as a three-man team.

495
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,530
Two drivers box the city vehicle in.

496
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,848
Third driver,

497
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,326
he knocks the city vehicle
into the stooge's car,

498
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,077
stooge goes into the railroad...

499
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,270
- Train hits the car, right?
- That's right.

500
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:25,634
One of those big engines clips it,
bashes it up real good,

501
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,211
spins it around,
newspapers take photos,

502
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,378
and we cash in.

503
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:31,400
You go after the deep pockets.

504
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:34,575
The train company,
the city government, the state.

505
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:37,330
Clear 100 grand
without even breaking a sweat.

506
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:40,139
Someone gets killed, you could add
a couple of zeros to that.

507
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,350
You're a big thinker.
That's why he's the boss.

508
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,894
But a train.
We've never done anything...

509
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,022
Shut up! Listen for once!
Maybe you'll learn something.

510
00:26:48,535 --> 00:26:50,585
You come back in a couple days.

511
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:53,205
I'll put a few guys together.

512
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,695
We'll see if we can do this.

513
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:00,265
I'm sorry.

514
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,450
Would you mind popping this
into my car?

515
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,678
I'm just so hot,

516
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:07,370
and I really don't want
to leave it behind.

517
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:09,345
- No problem.
- Thank you.

518
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:20,972
<i>The best place for a bug is on something
people keep with them.</i>

519
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,560
<i>Many car remotes these days
have enough space inside</i>

520
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,185
<i>to hide a small bug.</i>

521
00:27:30,345 --> 00:27:32,775
<i>Not to mention a battery
to power the transmitter.</i>

522
00:27:36,515 --> 00:27:38,065
Sam, can you hear me?

523
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,850
<i>It's a quick, efficient,
low-risk operation</i>

524
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,060
<i>that costs as much as you care
to tip the valet.</i>

525
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:46,185
Thank you.

526
00:27:50,981 --> 00:27:52,355
You got some serious balls.

527
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,444
I'm just trying to make us
some money. That's all.

528
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:57,049
Why don't you just slow down?

529
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,553
You've been here for a few days
and you act like you run things.

530
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,025
Whatever problem you got
with your pop don't concern me.

531
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,830
I don't have any problems
with my dad. All right?

532
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:08,076
- It's none of your business.
- All right, I'm just trying to help.

533
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:20,284
You done fiddling with your car?

534
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,006
Just fixing a taillight.

535
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:24,262
I'm glad your father's tools
are still getting some use.

536
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:27,349
It always makes me sad to think of them
sitting there getting dusty.

537
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:30,655
- What happened to the charger?
- You know, just wear and tear.

538
00:28:31,505 --> 00:28:32,505
Whatever.

539
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:34,260
I'll see you later!

540
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:36,185
I'm off to the beach with Tina.

541
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:40,217
- Mom, we talked about this.
- About the fact that she's my friend.

542
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,510
Forget it.

543
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,679
I'm not gonna wear
my bathing suit after all.

544
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,347
It's too horrifying.

545
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:46,695
Hello!

546
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,144
You're lucky to have a son
who's over here so much.

547
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,605
Yes, well, he was gone
for a couple of decades.

548
00:28:52,955 --> 00:28:55,205
He's still making up for lost time.

549
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:56,475
Let's go!

550
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,282
Bad news, Mike.
I've been monitoring Ryan's bug.

551
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,518
- And?
- Sounds like he decided to jump the gun

552
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,370
and pull your Deathwish scam
himself.

553
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,330
- What? When?
- Right now, it sounds like.

554
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,792
He's paying some poor guy to get knocked
in front of the 5:35 commuter train.

555
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:15,260
- Sam, the 5:35...
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

556
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:17,550
They're headed toward
the 5th Street crossing right now.

557
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:20,633
Look, I could call the cops. By the time
they figure out what's going on...

558
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:22,511
We can't risk it.
We gotta get over there!

559
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,345
I'll get myself a new set of wheels.

560
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,196
<i>When you work under a cover,</i>

561
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:29,947
<i>whether you're a cop,
a DEA agent, or a spy,</i>

562
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,603
<i>you're getting into business
with the bad guys.</i>

563
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,525
<i>Your job is to stay
in control of that business.</i>

564
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:42,155
<i>The problem is,
criminals are unpredictable.</i>

565
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,907
<i>Sometimes they take
your ideas and resources</i>

566
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:46,965
<i>and hurt innocent people.</i>

567
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,010
<i>It's every undercover agent's
worst nightmare.</i>

568
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,591
<i>Which is why you do whatever it takes
to make sure that doesn't happen.</i>

569
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:08,180
<i>Boxing in a large vehicle
and forcing it into a crash</i>

570
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:10,545
<i>takes a coordinated group effort.</i>

571
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,769
<i>It's a little like flying planes
in formation</i>

572
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,130
<i>if one of the planes
is trying to get away.</i>

573
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:18,983
<i>Very difficult
and very, very dangerous.</i>

574
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:29,577
<i>The good news is
that when a plan requires</i>

575
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,579
<i>clockwork timing
and precise movements,</i>

576
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,166
<i>it doesn't take much
to ruin that precision.</i>

577
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:46,385
<i>Do it right,</i>

578
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:49,638
<i>and you can avoid
sending anybody to the morgue.</i>

579
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,601
<i>You may bruise a few egos, though.</i>

580
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:05,885
- What the hell happened?
- Ryan jumped the gun on the train scam.

581
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,781
We had to stop him
before he kill someone!

582
00:31:08,455 --> 00:31:10,580
- And?
- Well, nobody was hurt...

583
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:12,754
But our cover was blown,
and now Ryan knows

584
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:15,532
that his new recruit
is not who he imagined him to be.

585
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:16,457
Great.

586
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,083
And now we've got nothing.

587
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:21,504
I was just telling Calia she'd be able
to go home for her son's birthday.

588
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:24,115
Yeah, well, I've been listening in
on Ryan's conversations,

589
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,509
and daddy has put a halt
to everything.

590
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:29,710
They're not making any new moves,
which, unfortunately,

591
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:32,723
means they're gonna focus on all
the irons they already have in the fire.

592
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:33,974
Like my client.

593
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,812
What would the cops need
to build a case against these guys?

594
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:42,149
You mean if they didn't catch them
red-handed?

595
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:43,443
The only thing we have

596
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,980
are the medical and insurance records
for Calia's husband.

597
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,750
If we're gonna nail these guys,
we need the records on everybody

598
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,797
that those doctors have treated.

599
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:55,496
And if we're gonna save Calia,
that's what we need.

600
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,941
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

601
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:02,086
Good luck with that.

602
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,004
You can't be serious.

603
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,965
Mom, I wish there was
some other way.

604
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,841
She's my friend, Michael!

605
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:09,899
You want me to go back to my friend,

606
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:12,858
a woman I tried on bathing suits with,
for god's sake,

607
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:15,570
and blackmail her
into giving me documents?

608
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:18,310
I told you there was a reason
not to get too close.

609
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,528
Why? So I wouldn't feel bad
when I destroy a life?

610
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:25,693
Mam, these are bad guys!
They're using desperate people!

611
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,861
Don't you talk to me
about using people!

612
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,734
You're asking me to force Tina
to sneak into the records office!

613
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:32,090
She's gonna lose her job!

614
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:34,451
And if she doesn't,
people will lose their lives!

615
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,775
It's one job.

616
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,458
I know it's not easy,
but if you do the math, mom.

617
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,426
That's what this is, then?

618
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,628
The math?

619
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,046
Sometimes, yeah.

620
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,075
Is this what you do, Michael?

621
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,845
You destroy good people?

622
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,763
My job is to help people.

623
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:58,225
And that can mean doing things
that I wish I didn't have to do.

624
00:32:59,225 --> 00:33:01,475
And sometimes there's no other way.

625
00:33:01,865 --> 00:33:04,023
Now, you lived
in the same house I did.

626
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,791
You made hard choices.

627
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,612
So you know this as well as I do.

628
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:16,856
<i>When you're blackmailing someone,
you have to be cruel to be kind.</i>

629
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:20,320
<i>Show any sympathy for your target,
and you only make it worse.</i>

630
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:21,970
<i>You have to be the bad guy.</i>

631
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:24,180
<i>Let them feel they have no choice.</i>

632
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:25,562
<i>It's easier that way.</i>

633
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:28,714
<i>Easier for them, anyway.</i>

634
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,424
How sweet of you to come by.

635
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,925
Do you like my new haircut?

636
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,053
Of course.

637
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,472
Tina, I wondered if we could talk.

638
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,090
Sure. Come on back.

639
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,800
- What are you saying?
- I don't expect you to understand,

640
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:44,146
but you've already given me
something you shouldn't,

641
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:47,024
something you could get
in a lot of trouble for.

642
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:49,568
That information is confidential.

643
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:53,447
I can't get that many files that fast
without anyone knowing.

644
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,333
I don't want to hurt you,

645
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,550
- but I need the documents.
- You don't want to hurt me?

646
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:01,275
You are blackmailing me.

647
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:05,185
You acted like
you were my friend, and...

648
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:11,020
- What kind of a person...
- Listen to me, Tina.

649
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:14,301
This will go a lot easier for you
if you just do what I'm asking.

650
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:18,199
So they'll find the documents missing.
You can say you misfiled them,

651
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:20,307
you forgot about them.
I don't care what you say.

652
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:24,697
You know I'm going to lose my job,

653
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:26,605
and you don't care.

654
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:30,651
You play ball, don't cause any problems,
you can get another job.

655
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
There.

656
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:43,125
It's everything you asked for.

657
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,680
Well, mom, where are you going?
Don't you want a ride?

658
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:48,089
I'll take the bus!

659
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:59,080
- Mike, how we doing?
- Good to go, Sam.

660
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:03,036
There's a city vehicle on Holliston Ave.
Driver parked it, headed off to lunch.

661
00:35:03,161 --> 00:35:05,733
It's just sitting there,
waiting for a crash.

662
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:08,026
- You ready to do some driving?
- Oh, yeah.

663
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:11,501
By the way, the documents
your ma picked up are perfect.

664
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,505
Put them in the right place
at the right time,

665
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,730
whole thing comes crumbling down.

666
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:21,010
Fi, Ryan's coming out of the bar.
Are you good to go?

667
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:23,704
Never been better.
This should be fun.

668
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:25,918
Yeah, just stay focused.

669
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:28,801
My mother may never speak
to me again after this job,

670
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,426
so I want to make sure
it was worth it.

671
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:33,155
All right, and...

672
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:34,882
Go.

673
00:35:55,515 --> 00:35:59,465
<i>A push bar is a hardened steel frame
attached to the front of a car.</i>

674
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,625
It's usually used by cops.

675
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,223
<i>But it's useful for anyone planning
on being in a high-speed collision.</i>

676
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,278
Yeah, baby!

677
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Hello, police?

678
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,720
I'm over on Holliston Avenue.
There was a crash.

679
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:44,450
There's a guy with a goatee
and well-dressed.

680
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:46,995
Well, I think he crashed
into a city truck on purpose!

681
00:36:47,225 --> 00:36:49,590
He was waving
a gun around in traffic.

682
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:51,834
Hell, boy, anyone
ever teach you how to park?

683
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,702
- You son of a bitch!
- Me, son of a bitch?

684
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,769
You're the one who tried
to steal my scam and take it to daddy,

685
00:36:57,894 --> 00:36:59,299
but it didn't help, did it?

686
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,802
Daddy knows you can't take it,
doesn't he?

687
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,270
<i>There's a tunnel vision
that people develop in a fight.</i>

688
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:09,695
<i>They focus on their enemy
oblivious to everything else.</i>

689
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,271
<i>The angrier they get,
the more intense their focus.</i>

690
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:15,357
<i>There comes a point
where the adrenaline is so intense,</i>

691
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:18,620
<i>you could land a jet behind them
and they wouldn't notice.</i>

692
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,280
Nice one, nice one.
I'm all done.

693
00:37:24,435 --> 00:37:25,635
You know what?

694
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:28,579
I'm gonna go somewhere
where I'm appreciated.

695
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,136
Stay right there! Don't move!

696
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:52,340
Get on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

697
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:54,361
Get your hands behind your head!

698
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:01,740
Thank you so much.

699
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,239
I still can't believe
you were able to take care of this.

700
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,533
That's the reason people call me.

701
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,828
- And him.
- Are you sure it's safe?

702
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,097
Are they really gone?

703
00:38:11,233 --> 00:38:13,582
The cops had a pretty good basis
for an investigation.

704
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,170
Once things got going,
Ryan turned on his father.

705
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:19,296
They went after each other and
practically handed the case to the city.

706
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,754
They'll be leaving you alone.

707
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:24,384
I have to pick up Ben
from school, but...

708
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,678
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

709
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:32,994
I spoke to your mom earlier.

710
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:36,887
She's still pretty upset.

711
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:39,764
It was the right thing to do, but...

712
00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:41,615
that poor woman, Tina?

713
00:38:42,515 --> 00:38:43,987
She's gonna lose everything.

714
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,615
I'll see what I can do.

715
00:39:03,745 --> 00:39:05,092
Good morning, mom.

716
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:07,205
Look who's here.

717
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,165
I didn't sleep at all last night.

718
00:39:14,295 --> 00:39:16,186
I kept seeing Tina's face.

719
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:20,095
Her mascara all smeared from crying,

720
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,566
calling me a monster.

721
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:29,366
Made me wonder how you've ever been able
to sleep at all the last two decades.

722
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,034
Sometimes it's hard.

723
00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:33,663
- That's not enough, Michael.
- Mom, I came to...

724
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,331
Who said that you get to decide
what's right and what's wrong?

725
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,965
And who gets sacrificed
for the greater good and who doesn't?

726
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,461
Do you think I like it?

727
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,760
What can I do?

728
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:45,632
- People come to me.
- Don't give me that, Michael.

729
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:49,575
You don't go running around blowing
things up when a problem comes your way.

730
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,431
You were offered a job,
and you dragged me into it!

731
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,725
You think I do this for the money?

732
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,311
I don't know why you do it.

733
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:04,145
People need me.

734
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:06,835
So I have to.

735
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:12,555
Yes, I guess you do.

736
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:17,065
I'm just tired.

737
00:40:25,645 --> 00:40:27,758
What are you doing here at 6:00?
Where you been?

738
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:30,615
County record building.

739
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:32,440
There was a break-in.

740
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:35,740
Someone went through all the files.
They'll discover it Monday.

741
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,851
Your friend Tina, she'll be fine.

742
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:41,021
Nobody will ever be able to tell
that she took any files.

743
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:46,705
Someone broke in?

744
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:54,493
Sun's come up.

745
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,412
You want a cup of coffee?

746
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:20,599
- What's wrong, Sam?
- Well, I've been doing some research,

747
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:23,520
trying to connect the dots
to find our killer, you know?

748
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,990
So there was the hotel thing, right?

749
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:29,361
Then I followed up your hunch about
that stadium shooting in South America.

750
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:32,405
Six police officials
shot in a soccer stadium,

751
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,574
six shots at the Marine Stadium.

752
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,927
No one claimed credit
for either incident, though.

753
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,565
Thing is, you were off in Bosnia
when they did the follow-up,

754
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,380
and both times, there was a lot of talk
about the same guy.

755
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:43,655
Mason Gilroy.

756
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,335
I've heard the name.

757
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:47,805
Are you sure?

758
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,629
There was some cologne on that note
you got at the hotel.

759
00:41:50,754 --> 00:41:52,754
Stuff is called Monaco Silver.

760
00:41:53,155 --> 00:41:54,737
Last sighting of Gilroy?

761
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:55,762
Monaco.

762
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,350
What a coincidence.

763
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:58,932
So I came here to tell you...

764
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:02,185
And I found this by the gate.

765
00:42:02,745 --> 00:42:03,937
He knows where you live.

766
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:07,225
And he didn't kill me yet.

767
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,610
Gilroy.

768
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:14,300
<i>You figured out my name. Good for you.
I knew you were a clever boy.</i>

769
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:16,199
Are we done playing?

770
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,800
<i>That is the question, isn't it?</i>

771
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:20,335
<i>I noticed you didn't sound the alarm
with the authorities,</i>

772
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,332
<i>which I think is a promising sign.</i>

773
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,880
<i>I think, perhaps we should meet.</i>

774
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:27,105
Just give me a time and a place.
