1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,854
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:07,135
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,223
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:14,770
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,227
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,272
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:22,567
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:25,528
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:28,406
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

10
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,784
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:31,993
Family, too...

12
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:33,203
Is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:34,287
If you're desperate.

14
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:35,413
Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:38,416
Bottom line... 
Until you figure out who burned you,

16
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:42,003
you're not going anywhere.

17
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,680
Previously on "Burn Notice"

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,592
Why go back to work for the people
who've put you through all this?

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,970
I want to clear my name.
I want to know who did this to me.

20
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,200
- You think I burned you?
- I know you did.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,475
You're on the edge of something
much, much bigger than us, my friend.

22
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:58,603
People I work for...
They have plans for you.

23
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,770
Nate, I need you to pick me up.

24
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,067
Fi and Sam are on a job
dealing with some heroin dealers.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,340
Out of the car!

26
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,905
They took Sam.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,909
Yeah, that was pretty painful.
How was that for you?

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,910
- Uh, Mike, it's for you.
- Yello?

29
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,249
Come out,come out, wherever you are.

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,335
- Nate, I'm gonna pull over and get out.
- You said they were following us.

31
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:24,700
Yeah, they want me.
When I get out, you go.

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,173
You don't stop for anything,you got it?

33
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,134
I have a job to do. I need 12 hours.

34
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:33,012
If you even come near me before that,
I will put a bullet in my head.

35
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,597
I believe we have a deal.

36
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:36,599
At least this time 
we get to say goodbye.

37
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,642
Thank you, Fi.

38
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,857
- Time to get some questions answered.
- Burn notice, huh?

39
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,273
We need to talk, Michael.
We've been trying to bring you in.

40
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,866
We're so looking forward to meeting you.

41
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,368
As a spy, you get to spend
a lot of time alone.

42
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,560
Whether you're in an indonesian prison,
a cave in the afghan mountains,

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,320
or the back of a cargo truck,
it comes with the job.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,430
You're trained to make the most of it,
plan your next move,

45
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,295
go over your intel,
review your training.

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,154
But when you've cleaned
your gun 30 times

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,636
and reviewed the past tense
of every verb in five languages,

48
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,993
you start itching to make a move.

49
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,852
- Hello?
- Hello, Michael.

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,300
Sounds like you're having
quite a party out there.

51
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,816
Indeed we are.
And you're the guest of honor.

52
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,580
No need for that, Michael.
The shooting's all over.

53
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,124
I hope you're not too disappointed.

54
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,659
You can see me?
Oh, I wish I could see you.

55
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,230
I thought we were gonna meet.

56
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,220
We will. First some business.

57
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,509
Yeah, sweetie. I thought
we were gonna discuss why you burned me.

58
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,970
We've had our eye on you
for a while, Michael.

59
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

60
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:39,806
No, you didn't.

61
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,538
Why don't you call me "Carla"?

62
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:48,784
Go over to the car.

63
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,650
We have something
we want you to take care of for us.

64
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,443
A job?

65
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:55,170
Don't call it a job. Call it a favor.

66
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:58,283
I assume it has to do with the guy
you've got gift-wrapped and duct-taped.

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,171
His name is Jimmy.
He's someone else we asked for a favor.

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,747
See, he decided to skip town instead.

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,603
Oh, so this is
your employee-retention program.

70
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,246
You... could call it that.

71
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:14,299
He needs to go back to Miami
and do as he's told.

72
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:15,947
You need to help him.

73
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,595
- I do? And why is that?
- We have his wife and daughter.

74
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,889
If you don't help, what happens to them?

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,519
Oh, and one more thing.
Jimmy called 911 when he saw our team.

76
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,315
You probably want to move along.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,657
I do this and then we meet.

78
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,773
I keep my promises.

79
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,367
I'll see what I can do.

80
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:39,228
Don't move.

81
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,040
<i>JIMMY THE CLIENT</i>

82
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,101
Air bags are great
for surviving crashes,

83
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:09,312
but they make
some evasive maneuvers tough.

84
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,553
Gone are the days when
you could run through a stand of trees

85
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:14,567
without a face full of nylon.

86
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,508
Of course, anything you used
to do head-on, you can still do.

87
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,999
But it's a little hard on anyone
who's stuffed in the trunk.

91
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,610
Security measures can
sometimes seem a little cruel.

92
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,583
Just like parents sometimes
twist their kid's arm

93
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,323
yanking them out of a busy street,

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,827
sometimes the safest thing
isn't the most comfortable.

95
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:08,890
Sorry about the trunk, but I had to
keep you out of sight for a few counties

96
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,967
until we got clear of the police.

97
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,252
Jimmy, what are you doing?

98
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,690
We don't have time for
this! I'm here to help you!

99
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,390
Now, the people who did this
are putting the screws to me, too.

100
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,175
I don't want to be here
any more than you do.

101
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,328
Now, do you want your family back?

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,139
I'm gonna work on that. Can you be good?

103
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,920
We have a long drive back to Miami.

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,852
If you can be good,
you get to ride upfront.

105
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,840
A couple months ago,
I got a call from this lady.

106
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,952
Smokey voice, lots of attitude?

107
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:49,287
Wait a minute. You know her?

108
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,550
Not as well as I'd like.

109
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,334
Anyway, she wanted me to break
into this place where I did a job.

110
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,320
A job? What is it you do, jimmy?

111
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,600
Look, I-I'm -- I'm
in computer systems, okay?

112
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,300
I did a gig about a year ago for
this company called Security Associates.

113
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,719
Security Associates...
Is that private military?

114
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,270
Yeah, sure, something like that.
I don't know, okay?

115
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,722
They were corporate guys,

116
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:09,120
but really scary.

117
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,890
And the lady on the phone, she told me
I had to break into there, okay?

118
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,729
And get a memory dump off
their hard drive and get it back to her.

119
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:15,560
What did you say?

120
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:18,190
I said she was freakin' insane!
I'm a computer tech, man.

121
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,318
I'm not -- I'm not a break-in guy.

122
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:21,640
So I was like, "no way!"

123
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,880
And this led to you
being hog-tied on an airstrip.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,840
The lady on the phone threatened
my family, so we decided to bail.

125
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,536
We hired this guy with a private plane,
and then we went upstate.

126
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,038
And we were about to leave,

127
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,350
and these guys with guns...
they came out of this helicopter.

128
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,084
And then they just...

129
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:39,128
They took my wife and my kid.

130
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,756
Please, I don't even know
who you are, but...

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,051
you got to help me.

132
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,812
We'll figure something out.

133
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,946
Mike, easy.

134
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,532
Just me and a couple of
slicesof wonder bread.

135
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,534
Hey, you okay?

136
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,446
I got to say, I didn't expect you back.

137
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,788
Yeah, I didn't expect 
o be back, either.

138
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:15,540
Making yourself comfortable,I see.

139
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,770
Uh, comfortable? I wouldn't go that far.

140
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,378
Mike, how do you fit into
these little shirts?

141
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,753
They're like doll clothes.

142
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,250
Anyway, after you got meout of the boat,
I didn't want to scare veronica,

143
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,241
You know, with all this, so I thought
I'd lay low at your place for a while.

144
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,280
Wait a minute.
What happened with the big meeting?

145
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,406
It didn't go as well as I'd hoped.

146
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:36,110
It seems the people that burned me
want me for a job.

147
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,040
- For now, that's all I got.
- A job? Does it pay?

148
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,480
More of a "we'll kill you
if you don't doit" type of thing.

149
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:43,750
Never liked those.

150
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:45,800
So, what is it?

151
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,947
Help some computer tech
steal some data.

152
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,450
I figure if I find out
what they want stolen,

153
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,118
I might get an idea
of who they are.

154
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,585
The guy's outside
in the, uh, in the caddy.

155
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,570
The caddy. You brought back the caddy.

156
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,744
Oh, Mike, that's great. I was afraid
to ask, you know, 'cause Veronica,

157
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,947
she was getting on my case, and I...

158
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,885
Yeah, about that.
It's gonna need a little work.

159
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:19,346
So we're safe here?

160
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:22,315
Safe would be a stretch,
but let's just say we could do worse.

161
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,950
- Okay, well, I need my phone, 'cause...
- No, Jimmy, you don't need your phone.

162
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,110
You called 911 on a double homicide.
The police are now tracking it.

163
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,657
You just need to go on in
and clean yourself up.

164
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,053
Go ahead.

165
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,621
I can't believe you, michael.

166
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,959
48 hours ago, we said goodbye...
possibly forever.

167
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:52,020
And then I get a message
from you on my cell

168
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,200
that I should come right over
because you got a job.

169
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,415
Fi, there's a lot going on, so...

170
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:58,935
you couldn't start with "I'm alive"?

171
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:00,811
I thought the fact that
I was calling covered that.

172
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,355
That's not the point.

173
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:06,442
Fi, I called you because
I need your help.

174
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,500
Sorry. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hello.

175
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,992
Yeah, mom, I'm fine. I told you
not to make calls on that phone.

176
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,100
Well, I know that, but I'm stuck
in a motel in Fort Lauderdale.

177
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,681
And I've been worried sick.

178
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,823
And if the phone's being bugged
by those spy people,

179
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:24,940
I guess now they know it, too.
I'm worried about my son.

180
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,005
Besides, calls from
a motel phone cost a dollar.

181
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,593
Oh, that's terrible.

182
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,885
So, when can I start making calls again?

183
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,596
Just come on home.
You can make all the calls you want.

184
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,210
What about those men with the guns?
Are you okay?

185
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,100
Yeah, more or less.

186
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,268
I'm so glad.

187
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:42,103
I'm glad too, mom.

188
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:43,187
Bye, michael.

189
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:46,190
You hadn't called your mom yet?

190
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,836
I was going... to wait a bit.

191
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,702
Thanks for coming, Fi.

192
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,189
So, this woman on the phone...

193
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:12,820
Did you ever see her in person?
Did she give you a name, anything?

194
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,120
No, I told you, I never met her.
She said her name was Carla. That's it.

195
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,050
Besides that, it was just, you know,
"Go steal the stuff for us or else."

196
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,102
What is this data? What's on
these computers that they want so badly?

197
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:25,563
I don't know. I mean, they don't pay me
to look at the files.

198
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:27,430
They pay me to keep people
from stealing them.

199
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,770
Why do they even need us?

200
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,090
I mean, if they're blowing up a plane,
they've got guys.

201
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,800
The people behind this, they
don't want to gettheir hands dirty,

202
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,823
so they get others to do
their work for them

203
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,326
like making us break
into Security Associates.

204
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:39,744
I checked that place out.

205
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,020
Guy who runs it is Ryder Stehl.

206
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,462
Guy's been in all the hot spots,
usually has corporate clients

207
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:46,171
who want some heavy firepower.

208
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,877
basically any place where

209
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:49,170
more guns equal more money.

210
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,921
Yeah, that's the guy. Yeah.

211
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:53,841
I'm gonna need you
to make an introduction.

212
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,260
Talk to ryder? Face-to-face?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

213
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,780
Private security companies don't have
a lot of walk-in business, Jimmy.

214
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,970
So we're gonna need an introduction,
and you're the best we've got.

215
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,896
If I'm gonna do this, I need
to lookat their security setup.

216
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:08,170
It'll be fine.

217
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,192
Sam and Fi will back us up
if anything goes wrong, right?

218
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:14,403
Yeah, right. Right, we got you covered.
Absolutely no problem.

219
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,000
- Calm down. You'll be fine.
- Right.

220
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,030
- Can we just go over itone more time?
- Sure.

221
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,883
We go in, you introduce me, you leave.

222
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:44,120
Private military companies are
best known for their bodyguard work.

223
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,147
For a big enough check,
they'll rain hot lead down

224
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:51,633
wherever you want.

225
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,194
It's not work that attracts
"service with a smile" types.

226
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,598
Thanks for, um...

227
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,030
this is the guy that I told you about.

228
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,810
You wanted to talk to me?

229
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,164
Terry Millar. I heard a lot of
great things about your operation.

230
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,040
Ryder Stehl. Jimmy here
tells me you're in mining.

231
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,252
My boy jimmy here,

232
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:14,505
 he says that you're the folks
to look for when we need a mercenary.

233
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,470
We're security consultants,
not mercenaries.

234
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,970
<i>RYDER STAHL MERCENARY</i>

235
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,805
Right. I think what he meant was...

236
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:25,725
I can speak for myself, mate.
Piss off, then. We've got business.

237
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,272
You call yourself what you like.

238
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,232
I got serious business to be handled.

239
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,609
Now can we go upstairs
and talk in private?

240
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:42,533
I've got mining interests up around
the northern border of Kenya.

241
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,160
Locals are my problem.

242
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,911
I need 'em dealt with.

243
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:47,997
"Dealt with"

244
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:49,957
What does that mean?

245
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:52,262
You know what it means.
Enough with the word games.

246
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:56,529
I'm willing to pay good money
for a permanent solution to my problem.

247
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,231
Mr. Millar,

248
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,843
you just solicited an illegal act,

249
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,380
and my security tells me
you've got a backup team

250
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,558
sitting on the roof
of the parking garage across the street.

251
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,670
Are you a cop?

252
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,020
Is this a joke?

253
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,607
No joke. Two-person team watching.
We do regular security sweeps.

254
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,970
I don't know who these blokes are,
but they're not backup.

255
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,820
I've got an operation that looks
to prove out in the low nine figures.

256
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,489
I got enemies, mate.

257
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,365
- So they're not yours.
- Not mine.

258
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:25,701
I guess we'll just have to find out.

259
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,704
Take him out the back.

260
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:29,989
You're being too hard on Mike.

261
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:32,280
You know, he damn near got
himself killed saving me.

262
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,169
Yeah, and I damn near got myself
killed saving the both of you.

263
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,755
And then he comes back
and acts like nothing happened.

264
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm just saying, I can count on one hand
the number of buddies I got

265
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,196
who would stage an armed assault
to save my butt, okay?

266
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,533
You got Mike.

267
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:46,760
You got...

268
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,898
When you're claiming
to be someone you're not,

269
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,380
the key is commitment.

270
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,149
You've got to sell it like
your life depends on it.

271
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,193
Because sometimes it does.

272
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,489
The point is, Mike is
the kind of guy who's got your back.

273
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:04,823
Gun!

274
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,453
One reason to work with the same people
is you know each other's moves,

275
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,056
So if you shoot at your team
in the middle of an operation,

276
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:14,750
they know to go with it.

277
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,377
What the hell is he doing?

278
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,340
I think we just got recruited
into Michael's cover I.D.

279
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,548
Get down! Get down!

280
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,556
It takes a good marksman to shoot you
at 50 feet from a moving car.

281
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,433
But it takes a great marksman to miss...

282
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:36,280
while making it look like
they're trying to hit you.

283
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,983
Or "markswoman," as the case may be.

284
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,409
- So, you're saying that that went well?
- He doesn't think I'm a cop anymore.

285
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,266
It's true.

286
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,340
I got him backstopped
with a job history, bank accounts,

287
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,167
even got a british mining company
to hire him as a contractor retroactively.

288
00:15:57,327 --> 00:16:00,129
Point is, Ryder's boys have been
calling around, checking him out.

289
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,302
Now we just go back to him,
sell him on the deal,

290
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:03,632
and check out his security layout.

291
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,800
Listen, even if we pull this thing off,

292
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm the only guy that can get that data,
and they know that, okay?

293
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,432
If we do this,I'm a dead man.

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,602
Never let that happen, jimmy.
One problem at a time.

295
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:15,936
That's easy for you to say.

296
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,710
- Yo, Jimbo.
- What?

297
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,525
Come on. Let's go upstairs,
set you up with a beer,maybe a yogurt.

298
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,819
Got this great card game
we used to play

299
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,988
back in the S.E.A.L. Teams
when we were feeling crappy.

300
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:27,990
I'll teach you. You're gonna love it.

301
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,630
Yeah, ma,you're back in town.

302
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,790
Michael, you have to come
over here now. It's a disaster.

303
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,857
On my way.

304
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,787
What are you doing?
Put the shotgun down.

305
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:47,093
What am i supposed to do?
There were men in suits with guns

306
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,427
out there after me.

307
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,637
They were after me.

308
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,598
Well, you're here,
so maybe i should have a shotgun.

309
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,059
What's the disaster?

310
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,645
It's the coffee maker.

311
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:02,983
You had me rush out of here on such
short notice, the damn thing burned out!

312
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,410
It blew a fuse in the kitchen,
and it spoiled a fridge full of food.

313
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,513
This is the disaster?

314
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,326
A coffee maker built in 1967?

315
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,786
And the food.

316
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:15,643
I've been cleaningfor hours.

317
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,247
I got your phone

318
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,583
in the glove compartment of the charger.

319
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,120
My phone in the charger?

320
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,710
I assumed it was one of yours.

321
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,203
You go through those things
like toothpicks.

322
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,057
Car's in the garage.

323
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:30,450
Excuse me a sec, mom.

324
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,250
Hello there, Michael.
Good to hear from you.

325
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,518
Glad I could brightenyour day.

326
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,230
Looks like you owe my mom
a new coffee maker.

327
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,050
Care to tell me why
you're breaking into her house?

328
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,150
Just letting you know we can.

329
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,740
I'd like to remind you that
there's a clock on this operation of ours.

330
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,746
I want you to speak to someone.

331
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,454
Daddy?

332
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,706
No, it's not your daddy.
I'm a friend of your dad's.

333
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:00,582
Can I talk to him?

334
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,001
He's not here right now,

335
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:04,420
but he wants me to tell you
that he misses you.

336
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,256
I don't like it here.
When is he coming?

337
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,633
Can you tell me where you are?

338
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,510
No, she can't.

339
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,060
Leave her alone.

340
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,190
You're not really
gonna hurta little girl.

341
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,588
Maybe. Maybe not.

342
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,742
If I get what I want,
you don't need to find out.

343
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,484
They said you weren't in, so I waited.

344
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,230
You got a lot of balls coming here.

345
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,430
It seems to me if anyone
should be upset, mate, it's me.

346
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,582
I'm the one who got shot at.
I'm the one who needs a job done.

347
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,009
If you're not interested,
I'll leave Miami.

348
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,713
If you are interested, we talk now.

349
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,026
Come on. Let's try it again.

350
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:57,181
Every thief knows that
the best way to scout

351
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:59,600
a place you want to rob
is as a customer.

352
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,620
Who gets to see the
vault at the local bank?

353
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,771
The rich guy with something to protect.

354
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:07,232
Who gets to see the security
at a private military company?

355
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:10,043
A guy who wants to start
his own little war.

356
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,946
There's unoxidized kimberlite
in this region here.

357
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,865
It's called blue ground.

358
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:17,910
It means diamonds.

359
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,432
My problem is the village.

360
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:23,624
We can handle the problem area.

361
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,919
Eliminate the civilians and burn it...
You'll never know it was there.

362
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,810
Let's get to the details and the deal.

363
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,218
Not so fast, mate.

364
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,840
There's a hundred mil U.S.

365
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:35,314
People'd kill for this deal,
not just those people from the other day.

366
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:37,221
I need to know my information is secure.

367
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,141
Building security is 24-7.

368
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:47,312
We have biometric security
in all the key areas.

369
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,691
Key-card access
through out the building.

370
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:51,193
A great way to get people

371
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:54,558
talking about their security
is to put them on the defensive.

372
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:58,015
Accuse a guy of having bad locks,
and before you know it,

373
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,600
he's telling you
where his motion detectors are.

374
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,328
Right. That's a nice toy.

375
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,148
But what about this door?

376
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,286
Hollow-core veneer.
You can cut through that with a handsaw.

377
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:10,860
That may be, but what do you do then?

378
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,260
The door's alarmed.

379
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,711
Building security is here in
under a minute, police under five.

380
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:21,139
Here...

381
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,728
the computer is kept in a sealed room
with a burn vault.

382
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:30,190
Someone breaks in,
it melts the drives to slag.

383
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,442
It takes some practice,

384
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:34,987
but counting your steps
can be extremely useful

385
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,990
if you need to reproduce
a floor plan from memory.

386
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,047
Not bad. Could be better.

387
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,020
I'll come back tuesday.
We'll talk terms.

388
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,654
Once you've memorized the floor plan,

389
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:48,280
you want to get it down on paper
as quickly as you can.

390
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,820
Combine that with the technical specs
of the security devices in the room,

391
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,280
and you'll know where
the holes in the security are.

392
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
Then it's just a matter of slipping
through one of those holes.

393
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,670
That is a terrible 2.
So let's do the math.

394
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,879
- How many 2s in a deck?
- Four.

395
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,970
Right. So those are your cards
you can play... 2s or 4s.

396
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,102
Or, 2 plus 4 is what?

397
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:10,650
6. You can play an 8.
2 times 4 is what?

398
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:14,151
8. You can play a 4, an 8, a 2...

399
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:14,985
Sam!

400
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,779
I appreciate you trying
to distract him, but

401
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:18,906
could you take it outside?

402
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,890
Sure. Come on, jimbo.

403
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,686
Let's go out on the balcony,
get some fresh air so you can concentrate.

404
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,300
Figuring out a time when
we can have our conversation?

405
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,667
Fi, I'm planning a heist.

406
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,140
Um, c-can you just...
I mean, I-I got to do the job...

407
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,055
first.

408
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:47,327
Right.

409
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,812
So, what can i do for the job?

410
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,090
I need you to get us into iso-gene labs.

411
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,730
It's a dna-testing facility
one floor above Security Associates.

412
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:59,363
I need to get in there
for an hour at night alone, and...

413
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:01,573
we're gonna be making a lot of noise.

414
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,285
You have a high estimation
of my skills, Michael.

415
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:07,120
You've earned every bit of it, Fi.

416
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,690
So, once I'm in,
how do I get the data?

417
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,922
It's complicated. You have to, um...

418
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:21,769
I have to come with you.

419
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:26,974
I don't think
this is your kind of operation.

420
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:28,950
I know. None of this is.

421
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,700
But those computersand hard drives
are completely secure,okay?

422
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,000
I made them that way.

423
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,740
So to steal the data, we have to tap
into the hardwiring in the wall.

424
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,480
And we'll only have
one chance to do that.

425
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,890
Well,that's gonna be dangerous.

426
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,176
Doesn't matter.

427
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,294
This is for my wife and my daughter.

428
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,410
Get me in and I'll get the data.

429
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,560
Hold on a sec.

430
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,030
What's the matter?

431
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,103
Oh, bum knee. I got to, you know,
stretch it once in...

432
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,095
badly done surveillance

433
00:23:05,255 --> 00:23:07,514
that is surveillance you notice,

434
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,308
can mean a lot of things.

435
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:13,186
Some organizations need intelligence
but can't afford to pay for training.

436
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,750
Some organizations just
want you to know they're watching.

437
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:27,316
- Who are you? Who sent you?
- I don't know. I answered an ad.

438
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,328
100 bucks to watch and take notes.

439
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:30,412
Some woman.

440
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,080
- She give you anything?
- Yeah.

441
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,958
She told me not to open this.

442
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,091
<i>HURRY UP
WE'RE WAITING</i>

443
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,512
I was wondering when you'd call.

444
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,474
Oh, that was some operative you sent.

445
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:54,550
A freelancer. I don't think he'll be
answering newspaper adsfor a while.

446
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,979
Jimmy got our message?

447
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,007
We thought you could use a little
reminder of what's at stake here.

448
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:02,130
We head in tonight.
Is that soon enough?

449
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,820
That will be fine,thank you.


450
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,790
Now...

451
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,750
I need something from you.

452
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,910
What is that?

453
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,180
The guns your guys used to kill
those men at the airstrip. You have them?

454
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,081
They could probably be located.
Whatever for?

455
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:15,030
I want them.

456
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,640
If I'm gonna work for you,
I want tactical support.

457
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,291
I confess, I'm curious.

458
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,254
Fine, you'll have your guns.

459
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,839
And Jimmy's family.

460
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,341
I will give you a date and location.

461
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:26,330
You will deliver them
when and where I say.

462
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,244
Of course, Michael. We want this
to be a good experience for everyone.

463
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,688
I am so sorry.

464
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,192
We called as soon as
we realized the problem.

465
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,654
Apparently the engineer missed
the defect in the architectural plans.

466
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,710
We're dealing with all the floors.

467
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,367
We'd start with
Security Associates below you,

468
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:53,120
but you're up first 'cause
you've got all the heavy equipment.

469
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,580
Well, lucky us.

470
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,624
I'm just glad you guys caught it
before someone fell through he floor.

471
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,252
Getting into a secure facility

472
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:03,580
 is as simple as giving yourself
a good reason to be there.

473
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,757
- Here we are.
- Uh, yeah.

474
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,169
- It's so stiff.
- I'll pull it out.

475
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:12,514
Right here.

476
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,684
Right here.

477
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:18,510
Our guys will need a few hours.

478
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,120
The defect's in the beam,
so they'll be cutting.

479
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,520
We just need you to notify the building
and let the workers in.

480
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,111
The next morning, it will be like we were
never here, and I'll be out of your hair.

481
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:28,697
Hey, you come back anytime you'd like.

482
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:30,157
They'll be by tonight.

483
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:32,081
Please don't forget to call
building security,

484
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:34,037
or I will get into so much trouble.

485
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:36,163
We can't have that. I'll call now.

486
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:53,690
Talk to our rep?

487
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,200
- She told me you were coming, yes.
- How 'bout her, huh?

488
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,060
We're gonna be
in the back lab over here.

489
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,229
We're gonna be making some noise.
Should only take a couple of hours.

490
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,940
There's some B.S.
about the chemicals we use.

491
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,279
Now, you can come back,
but it's got to be on your insurance.

492
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,906
I'm, uh... I'm fine here, thanks.

493
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,180
The typical floor is concrete
slab over 20-gauge steel pan

494
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,624
with steel trusses spaced
30 inches for support.

495
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:22,792
When you cut through a floor,

496
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:25,150
the thing you have
to worry about is wiring.

497
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,580
Cut into the wrong wire, and
you'll set off the building alarms,

498
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,592
electrocute yourself, or both.

499
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,850
If you don't want a chunk of concrete
crashing through to the floor below,

500
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,503
you need to drill a hole
and anchor the slab.

501
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:52,280
A concrete saw cuts it like butter.

502
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,266
If you've done your planning right,
you'll be dropping into a blind spot

503
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:23,169
for the security system,
usually behind an interior wall.

504
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,470
Motion detectors bounce sound off objects
and analyze the reflection.

505
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,946
If something changes,
the alarm goes off.

506
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,366
Move slow enough,

507
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,243
and a wool comforter absorbs
enough sound to keep it from triggering.

508
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:42,205
A thermal blanket, meanwhile,
shields your body from heat sensors.

509
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,906
- How do you think he's doing in there?
- It's michael.

510
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:51,249
So, look, Fi...

511
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,051
I got to go back to Veronica,

512
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,515
explain where I've been,

513
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,250
why I'm all beat to hell,
and what happened to the caddy.

514
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,183
- I'd pay to watch that.
- Oh, come on. Fi, you're a girl.

515
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:03,476
What do I say?

516
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:05,530
I'm your girl consultant now?

517
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,896
When did I sign up for that job?

518
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:07,819
Fine. Forget it.

519
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:11,313
You know, I got lots of other friends
with ovaries. I got you...

520
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,666
Tell her you got beaten up
defending a helpless man from a gang

521
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,760
of ex lowlife soldiers.

522
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,212
- It's true enough.
- Okay.

523
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:33,465
- So I'm the hero.
- And the helpless man.

524
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,158
Somebody's working late.

525
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,963
Better let Mike know.

526
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,213
Evening, mr. Stehl.

527
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,273
Hey, Stevie. Thanks for the call.

528
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,984
- What's going on?
- It's, uh,probably nothing,

529
00:28:53,144 --> 00:28:54,830
but you said you wanted us
to call you any time

530
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,905
if something unusual
was going on in the building.

531
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,657
<i>Ryder is back</i>

532
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:00,700
- How long?

533
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,577
I don't know.
It's supposed to be backing up now.

534
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:04,621
The data runs along the cable
of the backup drives.

535
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:06,450
Well, what's the problem?
'Cause we don't have time.

536
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,820
I set the backupf or 11:30.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

537
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,830
Okay, it's coming, it's coming.

538
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,674
Oh, god. Oh, god.

539
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:19,594
- That's not good.
- Give them a minute.

540
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:22,329
- Oh, god, I'm so sorry. What do we do?
- Plan "B."

541
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:30,413
Quadrangle buckshot
 is a specialized round

542
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:33,211
designed to destroy
the inside of anything delicate

543
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:35,276
a computer, for example.

544
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:43,201
Get back!

545
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,254
Take the rope and tie it off.

546
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:51,459
- We're going out the window?
- Unless you want to wait around.

547
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:54,894
For hardened security glass,
I prefer frag-12,

548
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,799
a military round
with an explosive projectile.

549
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,245
Ohh, I think I sprained my body.

550
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,092
You want another beer?

551
00:30:41,252 --> 00:30:43,678
- Telling you,did wonders for my ribs.
- You're fine.

552
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:45,847
I just want my family back.

553
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,891
- We're working on it.
- Yeah, how?

554
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,809
Those guys at Security Associates,

555
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:51,561
they're gonna kill me
as soon as they get a chance.

556
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,893
Exactly, and that
makes them predictable,

557
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:55,690
and that's how
we're gonna solve your problem.

558
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:58,420
Can you get me a
boat,something disposable?

559
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,529
Disposable?

560
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,404
Oh, I see where you're going.

561
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:02,550
I know a guy.

562
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,073
Yeah. It's a decent boat,
once upon a time.

563
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:06,226
It's got mold, but...

564
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:08,495
it doesn't sound like it's gonna be
around long enoughto bother us.

565
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:10,246
How is this gonna solve y problem?

566
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:12,830
These guys from Security Associates
want to kill you.

567
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,293
We need to give them
the opportunity to do just that.

568
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,850
Trust me.The heat that's on you,

569
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,233
everyone thinking that you're dead

570
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:21,626
is gonna be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

571
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,967
Yeah, Fi?

572
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:25,958
Michael, I got a delivery today.

573
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,932
Someone was kind enough
to break into the trunk of my car.

574
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:29,933
Yeah, what was it?

575
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,353
A present from your friends.

576
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:35,480
Be careful with those, Fi.
They're very hot.

577
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,816
Oh, I'll take good careof them.

578
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:40,660
Michael, your mother keeps calling me.

579
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,820
These last few days have been
a lot for her to handle.

580
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,988
I know the feeling.

581
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:45,754
Go see her, Michael.

582
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,723
I got to go visit my mom.

583
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,705
- Sam, get on that boat.
- Aye, aye, skipper.

584
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,711
You might want to slow down, mom.

585
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,113
How, Michael?

586
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,860
You tell me.

587
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,591
I'm not sleeping.

588
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:05,885
This business with the coffee maker.

589
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,847
- This is about a coffee maker?
- It isn't just that.

590
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:11,092
Your brother's still up
in Fort Lauderdale, you know.

591
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:13,140
I mean, he believes it's not safe here.

592
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,435
Uh, Nate has disappeared
for years before, mom.

593
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:19,280
He's been in Fort Lauderdale
for a few days.

594
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,077
What about me, Michael?

595
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,652
All these years,

596
00:32:22,812 --> 00:32:24,529
and finally I see what you do.

597
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,050
You tell me I have to leave town
at a minute's notice.

598
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,610
I can't talk on the phone.
We're being chased by men with guns!

599
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,290
How am I supposed to deal with this?

600
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,260
All these years, you wondered why
I didn't come home, why I didn't call.

601
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,621
This is why, mom.

602
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:38,835
I never wanted thisfor you.

603
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,505
I'm sorry.

604
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,014
Well, it still doesn't explain
why you didn't write.

605
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:15,830
You want this big, right?

606
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,350
Just enough for the boat, Fi.

607
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,137
Try not to break all the windows
in South Beach.

608
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,506
- Call Ryder.
- Are you sure?

609
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:27,258
You said the cops
will be listening on this phone,

610
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:28,680
and that's
--that's the point.

611
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,638
We talked about this,and we practiced it,
so if you could do thatnow.

612
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:38,478
Security associates.

613
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,550
Uh, I need --I need to speak to Ryder.
T-tell him that it's jimmy.

614
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,755
Hold, please.

615
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,050
Did a hell of a jobin my office, kid.

616
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,340
Do you really think
you're gonna get away with this, huh?

617
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,430
Do you have any idea
who you just took on?

618
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,500
Please, just listen, okay?

619
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,233
It was... it was the guy, the one...
the one that I introduced you to?

620
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,950
Look, I want to make this right, okay?

621
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,350
If we can just meet,
then I can explain everything.

622
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,960
I don't need explanations, Jimmy.

623
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,630
I need my data back.

624
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,338
I want to give it back to you.

625
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:07,965
That's good. Just tell me where you are.

626
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,406
Once the cops pick up a call
on a flagged cell,

627
00:34:14,526 --> 00:34:16,840
they triangulate its location.

628
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,540
From there, they organize
and deploy units,

629
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,689
a process that can take 10 minutes,
give or take.

630
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:24,980
Bad guys don't have
that chain of command.

631
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,231
They can be anywhere as fast as
their wheels can take them.

632
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,320
Get in position. Stay out of sight.
Going down to the boat.

633
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,730
What do we do if he comes out?
Do you want us to pop him?

634
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,270
No, I need to figure out
what the hell's going on first.

635
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,647
Then you pop him.

636
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,122
Get going.

637
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,519
You want to talk,
we do it face-to-face.

638
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,090
So you coming out,
or do I come down to the boat?

639
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,314
How do I know you're not armed?

640
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,316
I don't want to shoot you, Jimmy.

641
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:08,901
I just want to get my data back.

642
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,254
Hold him off.
Tell him to prove he's unarmed.

643
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:18,400
I don't believe you. Okay? Show me.
Show me that you don't havea gun.

644
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,330
What do you want me to do?
Here. Here. See?

645
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,418
Unarmed.

646
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:26,711
I-I don't believe you.

647
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,380
Jimmy, I'm not messing around.
I'm coming down.

648
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,840
Okay, just wait a second.

649
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,140
He's gonna figure this out.
How much longer do I have to do this?

650
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,429
If he finds out you're not on that boat
before the ATF gets here,

651
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:37,650
he will track you down.

652
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,020
He will go after you and your family
for the rest of your life.

653
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,517
Now, you will do this now.

654
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:42,477
Do it.

655
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,565
Stay back.

656
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:50,040
You don't want your data
all over the internet, do you?

657
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,069
Now don't take another step.

658
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:52,153
All right.

659
00:35:52,514 --> 00:35:53,488
All right.

660
00:35:53,648 --> 00:35:57,575
Take off your clothes, the jacket
and the pants, and then you can come.

661
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,587
- I'm not taking my pants off.
- I'm not messing around.

662
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,433
Neither am I.

663
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:24,018
I lied, jimmy.

664
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,088
Want to see my gun?

665
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,800
Here it is.

666
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,857
Now, want to know
what I'm gonna do to you

667
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:31,526
if you don't come out right now?

668
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:35,404
Yeah. Tell me.

669
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:36,906
Tell me what you're gonna do.

670
00:36:48,828 --> 00:36:50,378
Drop it and show me your hands.

671
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,083
On your stomach... now!

672
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,449
Get your butt off this deck.

673
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:07,069
Move!

674
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,401
Nice hardware.

675
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,370
It's not mine. It's a setup.

676
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,951
Put him in the truck.

677
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:24,524
It's going to be hard for them to explain

678
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:27,294
why they have guns linked
to a double homicide.

679
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,127
Still, probably best to make sure
no one ever knows you're alive.

680
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,651
And my family?

681
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,030
Sam has a friend who's gonna take you
on a boat to Haiti tonight.

682
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,270
Should be fine.

683
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,304
Coast guard doesn't pay much attention
to boats going to Haiti.

684
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,940
From there, you'll fly to Argentina
and meet your family at the airport.

685
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,380
- You really think they'll be there?
- Well, Carla needs me for other things.

686
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,801
If she doesn't keep her promises to you,

687
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,857
she loses me as an asset.

688
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,526
Man, I-I don't know how to thank you.

689
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:58,154
Do you want my car?

690
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:01,623
I mean, it's at my work.
I don't really need it anymore.

691
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,348
It's a Saab.

692
00:38:04,306 --> 00:38:05,161
Convertible.

693
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,624
Yeah. Love convertibles.

694
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,588
There you go.

695
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,960
I got to leave the country,
and you're stuck working for them.

696
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,890
I don't know who has it better.

697
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,675
You do, Jimmy. Believe me.

698
00:38:24,245 --> 00:38:25,156
You do.

699
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,987
In intelligence gathering,

700
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:35,149
too little information
is obviously a problem,

701
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,820
but too much information is just
as bad in some ways.

702
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,966
500 files.

703
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,221
And every op looks pretty nasty.

704
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,537
The question is,
why does she want this stuff?

705
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:50,008
No clue,

706
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:51,811
but it's a start.

707
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,599
Time to talk.

708
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:17,818
I lost youthe other day.

709
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,057
- I came back, Fi.
- But you left...

710
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:24,490
You had a choice to make,
and you made it.

711
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,104
I always thought...

712
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,783
maybe

713
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,270
when it came down to it that...

714
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,469
but you didn'T.

715
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,756
What are you saying, Fi?

716
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:43,494
That I'll always care about you.

717
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:51,637
And I'll still help you with your thing,
and you'll still help me with mine.

718
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,115
But we can't be together.

719
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,271
I know.

720
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,654
I said that for a long time.

721
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,404
Yes, you have.

722
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,969
When you work as a spy

723
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:14,551
it's easy to think of people as assets,

724
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,191
resources to accomplish a goal...

725
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,883
because you don't have
a personal relationship with an asset.

726
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,510
You don't care about an asset.

727
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,907
You don't miss the scent of an asset
when she leaves the room.

728
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,695
I think 4 across is "beets."

729
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,033
- That looks like a tough one.
- A little.

730
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:51,452
But I'm getting through it.

731
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,680
Well, if you need any help,
I'm right over there.

732
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,750
I was just leaving, actually.

733
00:40:58,126 --> 00:40:59,075
Next time?

734
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:06,870
It's a good thing
I'm patching things up with Veronica,

735
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,660
'cause if I wasn't,that's
a real firecracker there.

736
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,888
Hey, what about you?

737
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:14,266
You're a free man now that
you and Fi are, well, you know.

738
00:41:14,426 --> 00:41:16,528
- We weren't together, Sam.
- Okay.

739
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,130
- How'd it go with Jimmy?
- Great.

740
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,150
He gave a call.
He's with his family. He's safe.

741
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:26,779
Looks happy enough.

742
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,611
Hold on a sec.

743
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,502
- Hello?
- Hello, Michael.

744
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,780
Just wanted to call now that
you're done with our little project.

745
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,260
See how that worked out?

746
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,551
He's happy. We're happy. You're happy.

747
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,719
We want to make this arrangement work.

748
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,447
Or you'll kill me.

749
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,515
See? Now you're catching on.

750
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:57,010
Yeah, just one thing.
You said we'd meet.

751
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,530
You promised, I believe.

752
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,250
But we did meet, michael.

753
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,421
Tell sam thanks for the help
with the crossword.

754
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:05,526
What's up?

755
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,540
<i>ENJOY THE PUZZLE. I'LL SEE YOU SOON.</i>

756
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
<b>Arrangement :</b> <i>S@lomon</i>
