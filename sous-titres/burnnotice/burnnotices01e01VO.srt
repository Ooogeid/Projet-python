1
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:31,090
Covert intelligence involves
a lot of waiting around.

2
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:33,358
Know what it's like
being a spy?

3
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:36,696
Like sitting in your dentist's
reception area 24 hours a day.

4
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:39,610
You read magazines, sip coffee,
and every so often,

5
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,169
someone tries to kill you.

6
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,550
In.

7
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,727
You know,
mercedes makes an s.U.V. Now.

8
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:19,425
Big backseat.

9
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,174
It's great.

10
00:01:21,238 --> 00:01:22,764
Surprisingly affordable, too.

11
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:24,614
Cia?

12
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:28,112
What do you say to that?

13
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:28,969
"No"?

14
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,160
Explain that a lot of spies
don't work directly

15
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,161
for the cia?

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,915
A lot of good that'll do.

17
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:46,408
Welcome.

18
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:49,033
Mr. Cia.

19
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:50,348
No, no, no, no.

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,035
I don't work
for anybody directly.

21
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,720
That's why I get to do stuff
like give you $750,000

22
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,637
to stop blowing up
oil refineries.

23
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:06,881
Hi, hi, everybody.

24
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,215
Whoa, easy, guys, easy.

25
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:17,551
Just getting the map.

26
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:22,541
You guarantee security
for the nembi oil field.

27
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:25,462
No fires, no explosions,
nobody falls into a swamp

28
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,637
and gets eaten by an alligator.

29
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:29,443
You mean "crocodile."
yes, that's...

30
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:30,444
I mean crocodile.

31
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:31,943
We agreed?

32
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:33,505
Da.

33
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:41,820
I'm now reaching into my jacket
for my phone

34
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:44,202
so I can get this man
his money. See?

35
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,777
Yes, I have
the wire-transfer information.

36
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,760
The aba number
is 0210010175...

37
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,255
Stop.

38
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,442
We got a burn notice on you.

39
00:02:58,443 --> 00:02:59,443
You're blacklisted.

40
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:00,569
Excuse me?

41
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:01,757
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:07,505
Is there problem?

43
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,879
No, no problem.

44
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:10,489
Computer mix-up... Pc, mac.

45
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,756
Put your boss on the phone
right now.

46
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:14,443
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,320
I can't help you.

48
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,568
I have a wire-transfer number.

49
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:17,569
0210010...

50
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:33,880
You cia bastard!

51
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,565
You think you can steal from me?

52
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:37,552
Sometimes, the truth hurts.

53
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,871
In these situations,
I recommend lying.

54
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,755
I'm cia! I'm c...

55
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,129
I'm cia!

56
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:46,196
I've got the money!

57
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:47,695
Enough, enough!

58
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,195
Pick him up.

59
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:55,524
I've got the money.
It's not here.

60
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:57,153
I can take you to it, though.

61
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:59,799
I was gonna steal it
and blame it on you guys.

62
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:01,640
It's not personal, okay.

63
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,810
That's just what I was gonna do.

64
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:06,810
In 20 minutes, you'll have
your money... I promise.

65
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
Take him.

66
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:16,948
I need the bathroom.

67
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,149
I'm gonna be sick.

68
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:18,771
I'm gonna...

69
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:19,459
Wait, wait!

70
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,395
I'm gonna be sick!

71
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,448
I need the bathroom!

72
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:25,343
I'm gonna be sick in
the mercedes, you understand?

73
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:27,835
In the mercedes!

74
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,638
Blood... Everywhere!

75
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,429
In a fight,
you have to be careful

76
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:45,735
not to break the little bones
in your hand on someone's face.

77
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,459
That's why I like bathrooms.

78
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,617
Lots of hard surfaces.

79
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:19,584
Sorry.

80
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,111
I'll leave it at the airport.

81
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
Quick, quick!

82
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:46,177
Southern nigeria isn't
my favorite place in the world.

83
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,302
It's unstable, it's corrupt,
and the people there

84
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,707
eat a lot of terrible-smelling
preserved fish.

85
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,784
I will say this
for nigeria, though...

86
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:15,661
It's the gun-running capital
of africa,

87
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:18,222
and that makes it a bad place
to drive a passenger sedan

88
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:19,380
into a crowded market.

89
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:40,088
Right this way, sir.

90
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,928
If you're gonna collapse
on a plane,

91
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:58,395
I recommend business class.

92
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:00,964
The seats are bigger
if you start convulsing.

93
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:02,938
Although once you pass out...

94
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:06,598
You okay?

95
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:09,321
...It really doesn't matter.

96
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,879
You're a lucky man.

97
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:41,716
That many bruises, anyone would
think you fell under a truck.

98
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,234
Fiona, what are you doing here?

99
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,882
You've been out for a couple of days.

100
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:47,304
The maid got curious,
went through your stuff.

101
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,484
You still have me in your wallet
as your emergency contact.

102
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,688
You take that out when
you leave someone, you know.

103
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,067
I'm flattered you came.

104
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:56,878
Don't be.

105
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,826
I need to get out
of new york anyway.

106
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:00,763
Old associates
sniffing around.

107
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:04,088
And I wanted to try
someplace sunny.

108
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,982
And it sounded like
you might die.

109
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:09,871
I- I wanted to be there.

110
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:11,672
At the end.

111
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:16,000
To tell you
what a bastard you were.

112
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:17,358
Sunny...

113
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:18,482
Where am I?

114
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:21,693
Miami. Apparently you collapsed
on the flight out of nigeria.

115
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,230
Miami?

116
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:24,231
Why am I here?

117
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:27,639
Airline would only say they
were instructed to fly you here.

118
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:28,856
"Instructed"...

119
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:29,909
What does that mean?

120
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:32,537
It's home, in a manner
of speaking, isn't it?

121
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:35,889
Oh, I called your mom.

122
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:38,420
My mother?

123
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,157
Yeah, yeah,
we had a lovely chat.

124
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:42,700
She's thrilled
you're home for christmas.

125
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,025
Home... I'm not home.

126
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:45,905
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

127
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,537
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

128
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,421
Leaving?
yeah.

129
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:52,688
You're good at that.

130
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,945
Yeah, it's just better if my mother
and I aren't in the same hemisphere.

131
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:58,209
Fiona, someone put a burn notice
out on me.

132
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,267
I got to take care
of this now.

133
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:04,224
Or a few cracked ribs
will be the least of my worries.

134
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:05,570
Surveillance.

135
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:06,571
Two-man team, fbi.

136
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:09,446
Fi...

137
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,697
Why don't you go run
interference for me?

138
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:12,750
Please, fi, come on.

139
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,319
Make one of those scenes
of yours.

140
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,132
Bite one of them.

141
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,135
Set the other on fire.

142
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:18,767
Just do it in about 10 minutes.

143
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
I need to clean up.

144
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,365
You'll owe me dinner.

145
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:25,573
Fine.

146
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:29,872
Most people would be thrilled
to be dumped in miami.

147
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:31,545
Sadly, I am not most people.

148
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:35,131
Spend a few years
as a covert operative,
and a sunny beach

149
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:37,072
just looks like a vulnerable
tactical position...

150
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,073
No decent cover.

151
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:43,228
I've never found a good way to
hide a gun in a bathing suit.

152
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,072
Welcome to the chadwicke, sir.

153
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:49,967
I need a room
one, maybe two nights.

154
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:53,722
We've got a 10th-floor suite
with an ocean view.

155
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:54,874
I don't want a view.

156
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,196
Facing a wall, something
with no windows, if you have it.

157
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,944
Far from the elevators,
close to the exits...

158
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:01,945
If you have it.

159
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:08,136
Do you have another card?

160
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:09,669
This one was declined.

161
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,196
Declined?

162
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:16,540
I... I don't care
what the computer says.

163
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:18,816
I want my money
from my account.

164
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,109
I understand that, sir.
I...

165
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,399
Let me check
with the manager.

166
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:29,820
When a spy gets fired,
he doesn't get a call from the

167
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,399
lady in h.R. And a gold watch.

168
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:32,822
They cut him off.

169
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,134
They make sure
he can never work again.

170
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,756
They can't take away his skills
or what's in his head,

171
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:40,862
so they take away the resources
that allow him to function.

172
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:41,758
They burn him.

173
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,653
All I know
is the account is frozen.

174
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:45,703
The code
is government-related.

175
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,493
If you care to discuss this
with the police...

176
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,196
Hey. Hi.

177
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:07,838
Looks like
you could use a free hat.

178
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:11,382
Uh, pay phone?

179
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:12,571
Huh?

180
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,034
You put coins in,
and then...

181
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,681
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
um...

182
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:19,944
Right over there.

183
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:23,259
I need to speak
with dan siebels.

184
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,008
I'm sorry. There's no one here
by that name.

185
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:25,884
He's my case officer.

186
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,881
I need to speak with him.

187
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:29,071
I know the protocol, I know
you're just doing your job,

188
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:31,193
but I don't have access
to a secure line.

189
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:32,007
I'm sorry, sir...

190
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:33,218
This is Michael Westen.

191
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,628
Just put dan on the phone.

192
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:36,383
He's my handler.

193
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,854
I've worked with him
for 15 goddamn years!

194
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:42,076
Sir, there is no one here
by that name.

195
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,395
Sorry, kid.

196
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:44,869
Please,
we trained together.

197
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:48,207
There's a lucite plaque on his
desk with a bullet hole in it.

198
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:48,895
He drinks sprite.

199
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:49,896
He's a friend.

200
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:51,874
Sir, I can't help.

201
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,470
No, no, don't hang up on me!

202
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:05,690
When you're being watched,
what you need is contrast...

203
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,585
A background that will make
the surveillance stand out.

204
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:12,204
An fbi field office
is full of guys in their 40s.

205
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,628
At most south beach
business hotels,
it would be tough to tell

206
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:17,997
which middle-aged white guy
was watching you.

207
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:26,835
So you stay in the place
where everyone is a jello shot

208
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,413
away from alcohol poisoning.

209
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:34,127
If you see someone
who can walk a straight line,

210
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,128
that's the fed.

211
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:44,563
In miami.

212
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,353
I need the address
for securacorp.

213
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:52,626
Brigalow south.

214
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:57,753
Thanks.

215
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,750
Sorry.
wrong room.

216
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,152
Come on.

217
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:11,655
No, wait.

218
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:12,656
He's kind of hot.

219
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,781
Kids, come here.

220
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,970
See that cop?

221
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:53,527
I'll give you guys 5 bucks each
if you go over and tell him

222
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,422
that a man in that car
over there
tried to make you sit

223
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:57,655
on his lap.

224
00:13:57,905 --> 00:13:58,905
Can you do that?

225
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:02,813
Make it 10 bucks each.

226
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,314
$15, but you split it.

227
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:11,405
All right.

228
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:12,563
For $15, I want tears.

229
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:13,592
All right, dawg.

230
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,045
Hey, you,
come out of the car.

231
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,029
Come on.

232
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,653
Come on out.

233
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:28,654
Get out of the car.

234
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:30,562
Officer, uh, anderson.

235
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:33,016
I'll get some I.D. For you.

236
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:34,279
Hey, no, no.

237
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,967
Come on!

238
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:35,968
Whoa! Come on!

239
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,042
Come on.

240
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:52,093
Need to go someplace
you're not wanted?

241
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:54,778
Any uniform store will sell you
a messenger outfit,

242
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:57,377
and any messenger
can get past a security desk.

243
00:14:58,781 --> 00:14:59,781
Show him in.

244
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,964
Janet,
can you give us a minute?

245
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,199
What an office.

246
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,748
Michael,
what are you doing here?

247
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:20,952
You cannot be here.

248
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,074
You heard, then?

249
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:23,075
Are you kidding?

250
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:25,446
You've been flagged
on every government list.

251
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:29,911
Why didn't you call me?

252
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:32,442
- Would you have seen me if I did?
- Of course not.

253
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,699
You were always good
at pissing people off.

254
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,197
It's a mistake. It has to be.

255
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:37,510
Just tell me what you've heard.

256
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:38,514
I don't know the details.

257
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:39,883
I just heard you were out.

258
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:41,447
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

259
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:42,447
I'm just out?

260
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:44,237
What am I,
your complaint hotline?

261
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:46,228
Lucy, I'm broke.

262
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:48,626
Bottom line,
they trashed my credit,

263
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,344
they froze my bank accounts...

264
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:52,903
If I'm gonna figure this out,
I need to put some money together.

265
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:55,467
I don't have stacks of cash
laying around, and even if I did...

266
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:56,290
Lucy.

267
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,291
Michael.

268
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,291
Michael.

269
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,066
Okay,
there may be something.

270
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,041
I'll call Sam.

271
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,042
Sam? Sam axe?

272
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,354
You still work with him?

273
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:13,603
Not when I can avoid it...

274
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,165
He's been drinking,
sponging off

275
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,540
of every rich divorc\e
in the greater miami area.

276
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,537
I throw him a job every now and then
when he's between sugar mommies.

277
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:21,709
What's the drama?

278
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,353
Guy's an operation manager
at an estate in miami beach.

279
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:27,406
Anyway, the place got robbed, and it
looks like he's in some kind of trouble.

280
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:28,472
What kind of trouble?

281
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,052
He didn't want
to get into it.

282
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:32,895
We talked price... Guy's
breaking open his piggy bank.

283
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,178
I told him the job
was a little small for us,

284
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:38,442
but he sounded desperate, so I
told him I'd keep my eyes open.

285
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:39,616
You're all heart.

286
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:41,226
Do you want the job or not?

287
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:44,678
I'll call Sam.

288
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Thank you, Lucy.

289
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,730
Get yourself cleaned up.

290
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:50,728
New clothes.

291
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:51,729
You look terrible.

292
00:16:57,105 --> 00:16:58,105
You look good.

293
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:07,854
Don't go away.

294
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:15,419
...Mama.

295
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,228
I assume you got word
of my situation?

296
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:18,229
You know spies.

297
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:19,881
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

298
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:22,293
Good news for you...
I'm a drunk and a washout already,

299
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:24,715
so I can talk to whoever I want,
burned or no.

300
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,042
You hear anything else?

301
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:27,358
Nobody tells me anything.

302
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:30,265
I'm not exactly
security-clearance material anymore.

303
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,266
Oh, Sam.

304
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,659
There she is!
keep 'em coming.

305
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,830
Look at the bright side... They
wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

306
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,362
Florida will do you some good.

307
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:43,994
I've been here a year,
and I've never been better.

308
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,097
Yeah, I understand
your main source of income

309
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,796
is an allowance
from a lawyer's wife.

310
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:48,849
Hey, don't knock it.

311
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,763
Free clothes,
ocean-view apartment,

312
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,501
and an endless supply
of little blue pills.

313
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,424
Speaking of apartments, you know
a safe place I can stay?

314
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,688
I been at a motel
with the girls gone wild.

315
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:00,553
I know a guy. I'll make a call.

316
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:01,990
How long you around?

317
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:05,039
Just long enough to put together some
cash and track down this burn notice.

318
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:06,510
Hey, so, this job tomorrow...

319
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:09,672
You want to do the meeting, or you need
me to come along and hold your hand?

320
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:11,751
Yeah, I'll be fine, Sam.

321
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,727
With this much money,
things get complicated.

322
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,206
Change a light bulb
in a place like this,

323
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,127
and a week later
you're on a speedboat

324
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:33,812
in the cayman islands
with someone shooting at you.

325
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,439
Mr. Westen.

326
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
I spoke to Lucy.

327
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,479
She told me
you do investigations.

328
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:51,983
I do a lot of things.

329
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:56,623
Last month,
there was a robbery.

330
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,795
$22 million
in odd jewelry and antiques.

331
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,003
It was very bad.

332
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:02,817
Looks like the police
are into it.

333
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:05,396
Says here they're talking
to persons of interest.

334
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,541
You're a person of interest.

335
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:13,564
The police asked me questions.

336
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:16,617
When this happened, I was
at home watching tv with my kid.

337
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,965
The security code they used for
the alarm is the master code.

338
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:21,941
My code.

339
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:24,363
Besides supervise the staff,
I set the shifts.

340
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,127
- It looks bad.
- Yeah, that looks pretty bad.

341
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:30,131
I told the police,
I worked there 15 years.

342
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:31,289
I would never do this.

343
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,630
Mr. Pyne talked to them,
said it wasn't me.

344
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,999
They took my passport,
told me not to travel.

345
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:39,196
If they arrest me,
my son, he's 8 years old.

346
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:41,006
I'm all he has.

347
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:43,880
"I'm desperate. Please
don't make my son an orphan."

348
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,038
just so we're clear...

349
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,378
You want me to figure out
who ran off

350
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:49,800
with $22 million in stuff,
catch the bad guys,

351
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:52,626
clear your name,
all for... What is it?

352
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:53,565
$4,500?

353
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:54,501
$4,600.

354
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:55,815
Oh, well,
that's much better.

355
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:56,816
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:58,564
I have nowhere else to turn.

357
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,565
Please.

358
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:02,461
All right,
I'm gonna see what I can do.

359
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:04,213
I need to talk to your boss.
Can I do that?

360
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:05,192
Yeah. Come on.

361
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:08,191
What are you, exactly,
mr. Westen?

362
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:09,244
A private detective?

363
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,380
Oh, no, I wish.

364
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,751
Nothing that official.

365
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,127
No, I'm just a friend
of a friend in town for a while.

366
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,565
I thought
I'd see if I can help.

367
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:16,566
Oh, thank you.

368
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,130
Javier's been with me
for a number of years.

369
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:23,828
It kills me
to see what he's going through.

370
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:25,131
What was stolen?

371
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:26,553
Some jewelry,
some artwork.

372
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:29,018
Insured, but the artwork
was irreplaceable.

373
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,400
Impressionists, mostly.

374
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:33,154
I had a sisley,
a clausen, and some other works.

375
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:35,382
Houses, landscapes.

376
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:38,597
I'm in real estate, so I've got
this thing for houses.

377
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,564
And you're confident Javier
had nothing to do with it?

378
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:46,565
Oh, this is miami.

379
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,668
Any incident, and the police
blame the nearest cuban.

380
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:52,534
Or haitian.

381
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:55,931
You should have seen the way
they were all over my gardeners.

382
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,661
What about
the security codes?

383
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:00,662
Oh, lord knows.

384
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,041
The police are looking into it.

385
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:06,126
You know, to be honest,
I'm just glad nobody was hurt.

386
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,785
Was there anyone
unknown to you around... Guests?

387
00:21:08,786 --> 00:21:11,221
Any new business associates
that came to the house?

388
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:14,286
Not that I can think of. I went
over all this with the police.

389
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,234
You can talk to Vince
if you want to.

390
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,935
He takes care of my security.

391
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,836
I just have a few questions,

392
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,415
see if anyone missed anything.

393
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:25,336
I talked to the police.

394
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:26,758
I don't mean to bother you.

395
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:27,897
It would be a big help.

396
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:29,460
Does mr. Pyne
have any enemies?

397
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,303
Anybody worth $100 mil
has enemies.

398
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,461
Which is why
he hired a bodyguard,

399
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:34,883
I mean, a head of security.

400
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,960
I'm specifically talking
about enemies

401
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,645
that might rob his home, though.

402
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:41,631
We know who did this.

403
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:44,607
Mr. Pyne has a soft spot
for Javier.

404
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:48,649
I don't.

405
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,335
As far as I'm concerned,
the sooner he's arrested,

406
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:52,336
the better.

407
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:57,111
Well, you've been
a big help.

408
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,730
Place is upstairs in the back.

409
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:04,058
Rent is $200 a month, and...

410
00:22:05,085 --> 00:22:08,400
If anyone finds out I'm there,
I say I broke in... Sam told me.

411
00:22:10,774 --> 00:22:13,352
It's not so easy to live
in this place, you know.

412
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:15,111
All night,
club is boom-boom.

413
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:16,776
Fine, it's fine.

414
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:21,835
But I think guy next door
sells drugs to my customers.

415
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:23,046
Make fight with people.

416
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:25,272
Try to talk,
he puts a gun in my face.

417
00:22:25,523 --> 00:22:26,838
Now, at home,
I can deal.

418
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:29,351
But here, with immigration,
liquor license,

419
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:31,710
it's a big risk for me, yeah?

420
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:32,974
I can handle that.
good.

421
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,176
The real Michael Westen,
yes?

422
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:38,899
Yeah.

423
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,649
Back home, your story russian
intelligence tells to scare.

424
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,860
They say you are one name
for many people.

425
00:22:44,053 --> 00:22:45,316
Special operations team.

426
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:48,736
They think one person
cannot make so much problems.

427
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,802
Nope.

428
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:53,431
Just me.

429
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,135
Nice to meet you, Michael.

430
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:00,828
New world, yes?

431
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,019
Yes.

432
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:23,642
Mom?

433
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:27,050
My mom would have been a great
nsa communications operative.

434
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:28,926
How did you get this number?

435
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:31,005
That's how you greet
your mother?

436
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,328
I got it from your girlfriend...

437
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:32,826
Fiona.

438
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:33,984
Mom, what do you want?

439
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:36,023
Were you gonna come and see me?

440
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:40,078
I'm not gonna be in town
that long, so I can't.

441
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,142
Come now, then.
You can drive me to the doctor.

442
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:43,642
I don't even have a car,
so I...

443
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:45,748
Yeah. Well, you'll figure
something out.

444
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:48,265
Drop me in the middle
of the gobi desert.

445
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:50,266
Bury me in a goddamn cave
on the moon.

446
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,934
And somehow,
she'd find a way to call me

447
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,852
and ask me for a favor.

448
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:04,295
I don't like stealing cars,
but sometimes it's necessary.

449
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:05,534
I have rules, though...

450
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:06,574
I'll keep it clean.

451
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,854
If I take your car on a work day,
I'll have it back by 5:00.

452
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,509
Things have gone to hell since you left.
Thank god you're back.

453
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,510
I'm not back.

454
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:24,508
You're here for the holidays, though.
You're staying for christmas...

455
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:27,072
Mom, don't smoke in the car,
please. It's not mine.

456
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,073
Please.

457
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,571
Figuring out if a car
is tailing you

458
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,940
is mostly about driving
like you're an idiot.

459
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:38,895
You speed up, slow down,
signal one way, turn the other.

460
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:42,383
Of course, ideally, you're doing this
without your mother in the car.

461
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:43,884
Michael, where are you going?

462
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:45,148
The hospital is on 20th.

463
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:48,521
This is a shortcut. Mom,
please do not smoke in the car.

464
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:49,729
Donotsmoke in the car.

465
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:54,133
You know, you missed
your father's funeral.

466
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:55,134
By eight years.

467
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:58,332
Well, last time I talked to him,
he said, "I'll see you in hell, boy."

468
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,263
so I figured we had
something on the books.

469
00:25:01,264 --> 00:25:02,264
Michael.

470
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:04,677
The two of you
were so much alike.

471
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:07,323
I don't know why
you had to antagonize him.

472
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:08,639
Mom, we werenothingalike.

473
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:10,997
Everything I did
antagonized him.

474
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,484
Being alive antagonized him.

475
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:16,394
Everything I did was a reason
for him to slap me around.

476
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,232
Michael, what are you doing?

477
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,931
Who's driving... You or me?

478
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,338
Actually, losing a tail
isn't about driving fast.

479
00:25:27,637 --> 00:25:30,198
A high-speed pursuit
is just gonna land you on the 6:00 news.

480
00:25:30,637 --> 00:25:32,321
So you just keep driving
like an idiot

481
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,216
until the other guy
makes a mistake.

482
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,618
Again, all of this is easier
without a passenger

483
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:40,572
yelling at you
for missing a decade's worth

484
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:41,573
of thanksgivings.

485
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:43,698
You were the one
that kept the family going.

486
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:45,962
After you left,
everything just fell apart.

487
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,383
I've been sending money.

488
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:49,323
What about nate?

489
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:50,198
Don't get me started.

490
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,409
Your brother is a mess.

491
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:54,009
You really should go see him,
Michael.

492
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,509
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to see each other.

493
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,199
I can't take care of him all by myself.
I am sick.

494
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:00,946
You know that I'm sick.

495
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:03,009
Well, what I know
is that you've been treated

496
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,447
for every disease
known to man.

497
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:06,697
I know this because
I'm paying all the bills.

498
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,196
Just because they can't find out
what's wrong with me

499
00:26:09,197 --> 00:26:10,618
does not mean
I'm not sick.

500
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:11,697
Please!

501
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,009
You don't know, Michael.

502
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,822
I don't tell you
everything that goes on.

503
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,260
I don't need to know
everything.

504
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:17,198
What?
stop.

505
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,199
Mike...

506
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:19,572
Just...

507
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:22,886
Look, we're here.

508
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:26,323
Are you coming in?

509
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:27,885
No, I have to make
a phone call, mom.

510
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:28,991
I'm right behind you.

511
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:31,947
Fine, Michael.

512
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:33,074
Okay, mom.

513
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:40,885
Michael Westen for dan siebels.

514
00:26:40,886 --> 00:26:41,448
I'm sorry...

515
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:43,197
Yeah, I know, I know,
he doesn't exist.

516
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:45,829
You tell him from me
if he doesn't call me back, I

517
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,017
will be in touch with him soon.

518
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:06,946
Sorry, I'm, uh...

519
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,313
I just... I'm not...

520
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:09,751
Yeah, he's with her.

521
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,072
Sleep through
an aerial bombing or two

522
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:25,388
and noise isn't an issue.

523
00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:29,584
You just need some privacy
and a bed.

524
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,873
In a pinch,
you can lose the bed.

525
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,831
But the privacy is important
for projects like this one.

526
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,729
With everyone x-raying
and chemical-testing their mail

527
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:41,050
these days,
a box of wire and pipe

528
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:43,660
and batteries sprinkled
with chemical fertilizer

529
00:27:44,072 --> 00:27:45,545
is a great attention-getter.

530
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:05,656
Hey. Thanks for coming.

531
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:06,884
Come on in.

532
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:07,761
You want some coffee?

533
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:08,762
No, no.

534
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:09,698
It's not a problem.

535
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:10,909
I made some just fresh.

536
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:12,597
I just wanted to
talk about...

537
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:14,519
This is my son, david.

538
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
David, say hi.

539
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:17,272
Hi.

540
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:27,959
Are you a soldier?

541
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:29,396
Uh... No.

542
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:31,083
Sort of.

543
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,926
My dad says
you're here to help us.

544
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:35,959
I might be. I just need to talk
to your dad about some money first.

545
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Then are you gonna shoot
the people that robbed mr. Pyne?

546
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:40,208
No, no.

547
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:42,080
That shouldn't be necessary.

548
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:43,449
What if they shoot at you?

549
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:46,141
Well, in that case,
it would be necessary, so yeah.

550
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:47,645
Okay.

551
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:48,646
David, go play.

552
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,646
I can play here.

553
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:52,019
In your room.

554
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,072
Want to see my room?

555
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:54,082
David, go.

556
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,770
I'm sorry.

557
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
It's fine.

558
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,646
So, will you help?

559
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,059
I'll need half the money
up front.

560
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:13,499
I don't know, $2,300.

561
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:17,834
Okay, wait. Wait.

562
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:21,108
I need you to know something.

563
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:22,893
I'll follow this
wherever it leads.

564
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:23,769
I finish what I start.

565
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,454
We do it my way... No questions.

566
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,831
Got it?

567
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:30,959
Thank you.

568
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:46,207
Working hard?

569
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:49,081
Tanning is an art
and a science, Mike.

570
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:51,150
You want something to drink?

571
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:52,893
They can bring you whatever you want.

572
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:53,894
No, I'm fine.

573
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:57,140
So, what have you found out
about Pyne's hired gun?

574
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:00,630
Well, he washed out of the
rangers after a couple years.

575
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:03,691
Then he went to work for some
private military outfit in iraq,

576
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:06,113
some kind of meathead
mercenary sort of thing.

577
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:07,624
Any progress with the job?

578
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:10,318
I checked the estate's
security logs... Nothing there.

579
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,740
So it's the hard way, then.

580
00:30:11,755 --> 00:30:13,123
The best angle is the art.

581
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,318
I find the buyer,
I'll work my way back

582
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,687
to who pulled off the job.

583
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:18,478
Well, how you gonna do that?

584
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:21,332
I need you to set up a meeting
with me and Barry.

585
00:30:22,132 --> 00:30:23,132
Can do.

586
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:26,693
Whether you're a coke dealer,
a thief, an arms dealer,

587
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:29,167
or a spy, you need someone
to clean your money.

588
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,003
Which makes a good money launderer

589
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:33,005
the closest thing you
can get to a yellow pages

590
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:34,006
for criminals.

591
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,317
Even better,
a money launderer will always

592
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:43,880
take your phone call,
burn notice or no burn notice.

593
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:45,816
Good to see you.
I've heard about your troubles.

594
00:30:45,817 --> 00:30:47,395
Yeah, well, I'm working on it.

595
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:48,692
Thanks for coming, Barry.

596
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:49,879
I'm in the service industry.

597
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,301
That's what I do... I help.

598
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:52,504
So...

599
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:53,818
What you need?

600
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:54,690
An art dealer.

601
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:55,691
No, no, no, no.

602
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,067
Art's a bad place
to park money these days.

603
00:30:58,068 --> 00:30:59,566
I.R.S. Is all over the place.

604
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,193
Plus, some schmuck in new york
says the wrong thing,

605
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,129
take a bath.

606
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,130
How about stamps?

607
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:05,255
Nice and portable.

608
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:06,256
Coins.

609
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:08,292
Got this guy who does coins.

610
00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:09,691
All cash.

611
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:10,692
Has to be art...

612
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:13,254
I need someone to find me
a piece that's not

613
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:14,412
on the regular market.

614
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:16,944
Hot paintings.

615
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:19,672
I might know someone.

616
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:21,755
Nobody gets hurt?

617
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:23,100
Nobody you care about.

618
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,472
Just remember who still helped
you when you were down.

619
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:30,207
Me, Barry... That's who.

620
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,630
I gave you love.

621
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:33,693
You remember?

622
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:35,317
I'll remember.

623
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:41,217
Excuse me.

624
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:42,842
I'm just...

625
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:56,583
Sorry, man, we were waiting
on sugar and got carried away.

626
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:58,341
Sugar?

627
00:31:58,342 --> 00:31:59,654
Yeah, I don't know
his real name,

628
00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:01,181
but he usually hooks us up...

629
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,465
We wanted to score some "e."

630
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:03,887
are you the new guy?
leave.

631
00:32:05,154 --> 00:32:06,154
Now.

632
00:32:23,718 --> 00:32:24,718
Mom, what is it?

633
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:26,532
This isn't your mom.

634
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:29,650
Dan, hey, good to hear from you.

635
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:31,468
I thought you lost my number.

636
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:33,277
Just spent three hours
with the fbi,

637
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:34,909
discussing your little present.

638
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:39,048
They wondered why someone was sending me
a pipe bomb with no explosive in it.

639
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,465
Thought it'd get your attention.

640
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:44,714
So tell me what's going on.

641
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:45,404
I don't know.

642
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:46,720
Burn notice is eyes-only.

643
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,715
For what it's worth,
I think it's bull,

644
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,452
but I don't control
these things.

645
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:53,529
Tell me who to talk to
or I'm coming to d.C.

646
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,655
And raising some hell.

647
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:55,866
Don't do that, Michael.

648
00:32:56,216 --> 00:32:58,005
You're on
all the fbi watch lists.

649
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:00,465
You go anywhere,
they're all over you.

650
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:01,591
What for?

651
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:04,444
All I know is that whoever
did this wants you on ice.

652
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:06,215
You leave miami,
you heat up fast.

653
00:33:06,216 --> 00:33:08,584
We're talking manhunt,
police in every state.

654
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:11,998
Things may change,
but for now, be smart.

655
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:14,404
Lay low.

656
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:15,964
Can I at least see
the burn notice?

657
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:19,098
If I could see who issued it, then
maybe I can do something about this.

658
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,625
I risked enough just calling.

659
00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:23,267
Look, some of us
are still on your side.

660
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:27,458
You pull another stunt like this,
though, and I won't be one of them.

661
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:44,411
What's up, bro?

662
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:45,464
You new around here?

663
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:51,375
Well, my name is sugar.

664
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:55,216
And I heard you messed with
some of my friends last night.

665
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:59,664
I asked a few of your customers
to get out of here, yeah.

666
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,839
What's your problem?

667
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,976
My problem right now
is a pretty-boy drug dealer

668
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:05,345
with a bad dye job
that's standing in my way.

669
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:09,294
Ohh!
whoa,
did I hurt you, bro?

670
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:11,623
Doesn't matter
how much traing you have...

671
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,378
A broken rib is a broken rib.

672
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:18,069
Don't start fights
you can't finish, bro!

673
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,351
I'll break it.

674
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,536
I don't want to,
but I will if I have to.

675
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:23,642
All right, all right!

676
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
All right, let go!

677
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:26,913
Let go! Let go!

678
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:41,657
You come highly recommended,
mr. Westen.

679
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:43,580
What are you
interested in...

680
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:46,742
Specifically?

681
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:48,974
British post-impressionists.

682
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:50,311
Sisley, steer.

683
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:51,500
That's nice.

684
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:52,869
We don't see much of that.

685
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:56,121
Most specialty stock
is out of the east these days.

686
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,547
Iraqi antiquities,
russian icons.

687
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:01,186
Although
that's mostly forged garbage.

688
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:04,595
I can get you
some french impressionists.

689
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:07,998
My collection is mostly focused
on the camden town group.

690
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,250
Oh. Very nice.

691
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:12,772
I wish I had something.

692
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,207
Several pieces were on
the market about six months ago.

693
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,855
There was a sisley
and several clausens.

694
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:23,941
Although, it didn't sell.

695
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:24,936
Really?

696
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:25,937
Do you rember who?

697
00:35:25,942 --> 00:35:27,520
Oh, I don't remember the name.

698
00:35:27,563 --> 00:35:30,773
One of these condo developers
that are everywhere these days.

699
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,185
But, during the impressionist
bubble in the '90s,

700
00:35:33,186 --> 00:35:35,998
he went to all the major
dealers... Wanted to dump it.

701
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,683
It was all very discreet,
but...

702
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:40,251
People talk.

703
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,810
Really?

704
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:41,437
What happened?

705
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:44,543
Nobody was interested is what
happened... Not at his price.

706
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:46,576
I'm sorry I can't help, but...

707
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,062
No, no, no, you... You have been
very helpful. Thank you.

708
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,828
I do have some greco-roman
nude wrestling statues

709
00:35:58,687 --> 00:36:00,423
you might like
to take a look at.

710
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:10,471
I never run around
in the bushes in a ski mask

711
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,103
when I'm breaking in someplace.

712
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,181
Somebody catches you,
what are you gonna say?

713
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:16,972
You want to look
like a legitimate visitor

714
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,394
until the very last minute.

715
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:21,555
If you can't look legit,
confused works almost as well.

716
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:24,653
Maybe get a soda
from the fridge or a yogurt.

717
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,409
If you're caught,
you just act confused

718
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,660
and apologize like crazy
for taking the yogurt.

719
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:30,292
Nothing could be more innocent.

720
00:36:32,597 --> 00:36:34,912
Cracking an old-school safe
is pretty tough,

721
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:38,221
but modern high-tech security
makes it much easier.

722
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:41,563
Thing is, nobody wipes off
a fingerprint scanner

723
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:44,222
after they use it,
so what's left on the scanner

724
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:46,065
9 times out of 10
is a fingerprint.

725
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,987
Fighting for the little guy
is for suckers.

726
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:12,971
We all do it once in a while,
but the trick

727
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:15,814
is to get in and out quickly
without getting involved.

728
00:37:16,972 --> 00:37:19,129
That's one trick
I never really mastered.

729
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:23,299
Javier? Javier?

730
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:26,161
You want some cereal?
no.

731
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:28,283
All I got is the one with
the little marshmallow guys.

732
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:29,542
Don't worry about that.

733
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:31,909
I just want to talk to you
before you go to work.

734
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,284
What is it?
Is it something wrong?

735
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,074
Basically,
your boss sold you out.

736
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:38,181
He robbed his own house,
probably had Vince do the job.

737
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:40,908
He collects the insurance,
and you're the fall guy.

738
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:42,535
Mr. Pyne?

739
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:43,536
No, he wouldn't...

740
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,911
He talked to the police for me.

741
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:48,095
That just makes it easier for
him to collect on the insurance.

742
00:37:48,096 --> 00:37:49,464
You're a trusted employee.

743
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:50,973
He had no idea.

744
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:52,588
Take a look at this.

745
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,511
Half his real-estate projects
are just paper...

746
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:59,427
Empty lots he paid
a loan officer to sign off on.

747
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:04,220
He borrowed against those
to finance other deals,

748
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:06,285
but with the market cooling,
he's bleeding money,

749
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:07,347
and the art is all he has.

750
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:10,348
Without the insurance payout,
it all comes crashing down.

751
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:14,409
What do I do?

752
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,936
Well, you could go to jail...

753
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:17,308
10 years, give or take.

754
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,410
You could run.

755
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:20,816
Statute of limitations
is about 20 years.

756
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:22,799
Or you could fight back.

757
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:25,004
Pyne doesn't want any of this
to get out.

758
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:27,347
As long as we have this
information, we have leverage.

759
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,611
I'll handle the details.

760
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:30,708
But it could get dangerous.

761
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,912
People do bad things when
this much money is on the line.

762
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:34,847
Money...

763
00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:36,284
Don't worry about the money.

764
00:38:36,285 --> 00:38:37,706
You want to do this or not?

765
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:43,777
You're not going to work today
or ever again.

766
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:45,464
I'm gonna go talk to Pyne.

767
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:46,597
But be prepared...

768
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:47,931
This could get sketchy.

769
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:50,284
Hey.

770
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,632
You really want me
to shoot someone, don't you?

771
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:15,725
Hey.

772
00:39:18,224 --> 00:39:20,224
So, mr. Westen,
what can I do for you?

773
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:22,321
I just wanted
to update you.

774
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:24,224
Fortunately, I think
we can be pretty sure

775
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:26,698
that Javier had nothing to do
with the robbery.

776
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:28,347
Have you spoken
to the police?

777
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:29,847
I'm not sure you want me
to do that.

778
00:39:29,848 --> 00:39:30,900
Take a look at this.

779
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,322
I think this points
pretty clearly

780
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,823
to, um, some other suspects.

781
00:39:40,284 --> 00:39:41,095
Where'd you get this?

782
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:43,464
I found it in
the course of my investigation.

783
00:39:44,534 --> 00:39:47,376
Cops might find it, too,
if, say, Javier was arrested.

784
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:50,543
I'm guessing that's something
you'd want to avoid.

785
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:54,588
Well, you two
have a lot to talk about.

786
00:39:55,097 --> 00:39:56,097
I know my way out.

787
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:58,613
Does that shirt
come in men's?

788
00:40:03,972 --> 00:40:05,393
You're head of my security!

789
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:10,123
Well, it's your job,
damn it!

790
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:13,258
Powerful people
don't like being pushed around.

791
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,596
You can never quite predict
what they're going to do...

792
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,649
Or have
their washed-out special-forces

793
00:40:20,596 --> 00:40:21,596
security guys do.

794
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:24,721
The point is, blackmail is a
little like owning a pit bull.

795
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,511
It might protect you,
or it might bite your hand off.

796
00:40:32,162 --> 00:40:34,847
That's why it pays to make sure
you know what they're thinking,

797
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:36,374
and that means eavesdropping.

798
00:40:37,221 --> 00:40:38,221
Hi, can I help you?

799
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,009
Yeah, I need two of these...

800
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:43,279
And your cheapest phone...

801
00:40:44,161 --> 00:40:45,161
That one?

802
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,159
Oh, the "hello, sweetheart."
is it for your little girl?

803
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
No.

804
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:53,572
Oh, the "hello, sweetheart."
yeah, that's fine.

805
00:40:57,723 --> 00:41:00,159
To build a listening device,
you need a crappy phone with a

806
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,738
Mike that picks up everything.

807
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:07,799
But you want the battery power
and circuits of a better phone.

808
00:41:07,972 --> 00:41:10,220
It's a trick you learn
when the purchasing office

809
00:41:10,221 --> 00:41:11,431
won't spring for a bug.

810
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:17,158
Hello, sweetheart.

811
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:21,847
So, Sam and I are gonna plant
the bug tomorrow

812
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:23,321
so we can listen in on Pyne.

813
00:41:24,536 --> 00:41:26,009
Fi, I want to ask you,
um...

814
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:29,787
Yeah?

815
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,527
I need someone to track him,
provide a little

816
00:41:32,597 --> 00:41:33,597
tactical support.

817
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Sure.

818
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,469
It'll be just like the old days.

819
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,265
That sounds like fun.

820
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:41,908
I'm glad you think so.

821
00:41:41,909 --> 00:41:45,224
I haven't worked so hard for so
little money since afghanistan.

822
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:46,721
Afghanistan.

823
00:41:47,043 --> 00:41:48,970
But at least there,
my mother wasn't calling me

824
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:49,971
30 times a day.

825
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,002
Thank you
for giving her my number.

826
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:53,284
You're welcome.

827
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,674
Any thoughts as to why
you're so unpopular?

828
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:58,846
Why didn't they just kill you?

829
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,531
It might be a lesson,
a warning.

830
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,534
Maybe somebody
wants to offer me a job,

831
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:05,032
but they want me desperate
before they make the offer.

832
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:06,847
It could be a lot of things.
I don't know.

833
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:10,220
It'll be good for you to stay in
one place, resolve some issues.

834
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:12,273
Well, I travel
halfway across the world

835
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:13,807
to get away from those.

836
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,034
My point exactly.

837
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,046
Maybe if you stop running,
you can maintain

838
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:19,219
a normal relationship.

839
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,693
Listen, fi, there's a few things
I'm good at...

840
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:26,296
Tactical analysis, hand-to-hand
combat, and I'm a decent cook.

841
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:30,220
But relationships...

842
00:42:30,221 --> 00:42:31,589
They're just not my thing.

843
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:33,096
They never were.

844
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:34,840
Well, now you're in miami.

845
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:38,069
Get yourself a 24-year-old
with big, fake tits.

846
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:41,408
They bore me.

847
00:42:46,848 --> 00:42:48,637
If it makes you feel
any better...

848
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:51,057
You were the closest...

849
00:42:52,848 --> 00:42:53,848
I ever got.

850
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:57,986
It... It just wasn't
close enough, I guess.

851
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:01,535
Things could have worked out
with us, Michael.

852
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:03,483
You were robbing banks
for the I.R.A.

853
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:06,331
A spy is just a criminal
with a government paycheck.

854
00:43:09,222 --> 00:43:11,958
You're the one with two
fbi agents watching him eat.

855
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:13,095
Three.

856
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:14,347
One.

857
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:18,034
Two.

858
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:23,452
Behind me at the bar.

859
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:26,909
Bravo.

860
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:30,147
Shall we shoot them?

861
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:31,600
I've got enough problems.

862
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:33,942
Well, more sake, then?

863
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,285
When.

864
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:42,347
When, fi. When.

865
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:43,723
What? What?

866
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:46,400
I can't shag a man
who works in a bank.

867
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:49,409
The end.

868
00:43:49,411 --> 00:43:52,253
He was rich, he's handsome,
and you broke up with him.

869
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:54,935
He had
no tactical awareness.

870
00:43:57,783 --> 00:43:59,256
He didn't know how to shoot.

871
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:02,737
He didn't know how many exits
were in a building.

872
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,660
Oh, god!

873
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:06,629
You spoil me, Michael.

874
00:44:07,471 --> 00:44:09,260
I thought it was
my winning smile.

875
00:44:13,095 --> 00:44:14,095
Don't move.

876
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:18,399
Sugar wants you out.

877
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:21,658
She has nothing to do
with this.

878
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,659
Shut up.

879
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:24,098
He's right.

880
00:44:24,346 --> 00:44:25,346
Michael, shut up.

881
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,462
I can handle myself.

882
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:44,220
You really ought to do something
about your neighbors.

883
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:45,221
I know, I know.

884
00:44:46,285 --> 00:44:47,285
Fun.
yeah?

885
00:44:48,471 --> 00:44:49,096
Shall we?

886
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:50,202
Yeah, well, fi, fi...

887
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:54,846
Violence is foreplay for you.

888
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:55,847
It's not for me.

889
00:44:57,785 --> 00:45:00,732
I got to take care of this,
and then I got to go to bed.

890
00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:02,283
Night.

891
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:03,441
I'll see you tomorrow.

892
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:07,922
Fi, you know, I could...

893
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:13,033
That went well.

894
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:19,597
You'll like this.

895
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,622
I found out Vince is calling
all his army buddies,

896
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:23,062
trying to figure out
who you are.

897
00:45:23,063 --> 00:45:24,431
Yeah, good luck with that.

898
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,310
I don't even know.

899
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:29,088
I'll have them feed him
something, hold him off.

900
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:30,186
Well, stay on it.

901
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:33,465
I have a little home-improvement
project I have to do.

902
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:40,346
Once somebody sends
a guy with a gun after you,

903
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:42,403
things are only going
to get worse.

904
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,210
But like it or not,
you've got work to do.

905
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:51,311
For a job like getting rid
of the drug dealer next door,

906
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:53,733
I'll take a hardware store
over a gun any day.

907
00:45:56,873 --> 00:45:57,978
Guns make you stupid.

908
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,907
Better to fight your wars
with duct tape.

909
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:02,429
Duct tape makes you smart.

910
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:18,154
Every decent punk
has a bulletproof door.

911
00:46:19,186 --> 00:46:20,186
Who's there?

912
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:22,648
Hi. It's your neighbor.

913
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,907
But people forget
walls are just plaster.

914
00:46:27,112 --> 00:46:28,950
Hopefully, you get him
with the first shot.

915
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,060
Or the second.

916
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:32,938
My knee!

917
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,380
Come on inside!

918
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,563
Now he's down
and waiting for you

919
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:40,195
to come through the front door.

920
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,223
So you don't come through
the front door.

921
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:50,563
Don't move.

922
00:46:50,564 --> 00:46:51,564
Easy, vanilla ice.

923
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:53,815
Now, you got 20 minutes
to clear out.

924
00:46:53,816 --> 00:46:54,816
Do you understand?

925
00:46:55,004 --> 00:46:56,004
Yes! Yes!

926
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,751
The wound is not that bad.

927
00:46:57,752 --> 00:47:00,752
Disinfect it, wrap it in this,
and you get to a hospital.

928
00:47:01,272 --> 00:47:02,559
You won't walk with a limp...

929
00:47:02,631 --> 00:47:04,556
You're still here in 20 minutes,
a limp will be

930
00:47:04,563 --> 00:47:05,629
the least of your problems.

931
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,998
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

932
00:47:13,432 --> 00:47:17,115
Look, point is,
you getting burned

933
00:47:17,215 --> 00:47:18,563
wouldn't have happened back then.

934
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:20,985
I mean, in the '80s,
the rules were the rules.

935
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,380
They had their guys,
we had our guys...

936
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:24,688
Wasn't so goddamn complicated.

937
00:47:24,689 --> 00:47:26,478
You could get your head
around it.

938
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,193
Now, today, it's all
about religion and oil.

939
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:32,118
It's no fun anymore.

940
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:34,128
I tell you,
I'm glad I got out when I did.

941
00:47:34,129 --> 00:47:35,497
Good morning, bloody mary.

942
00:47:36,877 --> 00:47:37,877
Hey, you want some?

943
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,188
No, I'm fine.

944
00:47:42,441 --> 00:47:43,914
Hey, is that your mom
again?

945
00:47:44,254 --> 00:47:45,254
Yep.

946
00:47:45,691 --> 00:47:46,689
All right, there she is.

947
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,900
Pyne's coming out soon.

948
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:00,564
You sure this is a good idea,
you hooking up with her again?

949
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:02,038
I'm not hooking up with her.

950
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:05,292
That's not what's happening.
I need her for tactical support.

951
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,191
Is that what they're calling it
these days? Tactical support?

952
00:48:08,192 --> 00:48:09,563
What about your cab driver?

953
00:48:09,564 --> 00:48:10,827
Is he gonna let me down?

954
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:11,314
Pierre?

955
00:48:11,315 --> 00:48:12,315
Don't worry about him.

956
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:14,878
I told him I'd give him 50 bucks
to punch me in the face.

957
00:48:14,879 --> 00:48:16,247
That's all he had to hear.

958
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:17,592
Yeah, I'd do it for $20.

959
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:29,317
I don't want any excuses.

960
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:31,341
Now, you're my damn attorney.

961
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:33,440
I want to know what I can do
about this situation.

962
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:34,967
Hey, what the hell was that?!

963
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:36,878
You cut me off!

964
00:48:39,246 --> 00:48:40,246
No, no, no, no, no!

965
00:48:40,495 --> 00:48:41,547
There are two lanes!

966
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:43,621
You got a problem?

967
00:48:43,622 --> 00:48:44,779
Yeah, I got a problem.

968
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:57,105
Hey, I'm not
through with you, man!

969
00:48:57,106 --> 00:48:58,106
I'm calling...

970
00:49:03,996 --> 00:49:04,996
I got your number!

971
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:09,532
The bastard breaks
into my house, into my safe.

972
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,904
You can't tell me
a damn thing about him?

973
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,093
Here you go, Mike.

974
00:49:14,135 --> 00:49:16,406
Less than a week in miami,
you're already making friends.

975
00:49:16,434 --> 00:49:18,531
It doesn't sound like he's
gonna roll over that easy.

976
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:20,775
Yeah, these rich guys bite
when you got them by the tail.

977
00:49:20,804 --> 00:49:22,122
Call me
if he makes any moves.

978
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:24,322
We'll get about 24 hours
out of that battery.

979
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:26,060
It's voice-activated,
so you'll hear a beep.

980
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:28,059
Yeah, I know the drill, Mike.
You do your thing.

981
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,291
People with happy families
don't become spies.

982
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:35,557
A bad childhood is the perfect
background for covert ops.

983
00:49:35,997 --> 00:49:37,839
You don't trust anyone,
you're used

984
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:40,713
to getting smacked around,
and you never get homesick.

985
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:44,970
I think I've got a parasite.

986
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,428
You don't have a parasite.

987
00:49:50,247 --> 00:49:52,557
Pills don't work... As soon
as it reaches your liver...

988
00:49:52,558 --> 00:49:55,310
The pills are for you not to
think you're sick all the time.

989
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:57,416
You and the doctor,
you think I'm crazy.

990
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:00,405
I think he's letting me
die of a parasite

991
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:01,969
'cause I can't pay his bill.

992
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,217
Oh, for now,
can we just try these pills?

993
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,060
I put up the tree.

994
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:12,809
I can see that.

995
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:15,869
Did you go see
your brother yet?

996
00:50:20,247 --> 00:50:21,247
'Cause, um...

997
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:25,152
I thought we could all be, you
know, together for christmas.

998
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:26,991
But he's not returning
my calls.

999
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,683
The last time I saw him,
he threw a telephone book

1000
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:30,374
at my head.

1001
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,560
So what makes you think
ican make him come home?

1002
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:34,929
Remember when you were 6
and daddy locked you

1003
00:50:35,808 --> 00:50:38,206
in your room and wouldn't let you see
the "star wars" movie?

1004
00:50:38,256 --> 00:50:39,723
Well, you just pulled up
the floor

1005
00:50:39,747 --> 00:50:41,904
and sneaked out
through the heating vent.

1006
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:44,497
I mean, since when
was there ever anything

1007
00:50:44,498 --> 00:50:46,761
that you wanted to do
that you couldn't do?

1008
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:48,123
Please, Michael.

1009
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:49,372
For me.

1010
00:50:56,495 --> 00:50:57,600
30 years of karate...

1011
00:50:57,934 --> 00:50:59,986
Combat experience
on five continents...

1012
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,343
A rating with every weapon
that shoots a bullet

1013
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:04,433
or holds an edge...

1014
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,881
Still haven't found any defense
against mom crying

1015
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:08,934
into my shirt.

1016
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:16,650
Mom, I-I can't,
'cause I'm gonna...

1017
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:20,559
I'm sorry, hold on.

1018
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:23,164
We got trouble, Mike.

1019
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:24,434
Well, what is it?

1020
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:27,487
Looks like Pyne is trying to get
some leverage of his own.

1021
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:30,705
Vincent, you're gonna have
to go over and take the kid.

1022
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,870
I don't know
what the hell else to do.

1023
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:34,997
Maybe then we can talk
some sense into Javier.

1024
00:51:34,998 --> 00:51:35,998
Jesus, the kid.

1025
00:51:36,058 --> 00:51:37,490
Pyne got Javier
out of the house.

1026
00:51:37,518 --> 00:51:39,336
He had his lawyer call
with some legal thing.

1027
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:41,184
Now the kid is home alone,
and your boy Vince

1028
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:42,311
is on his way over there.

1029
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:43,245
How long ago?

1030
00:51:43,246 --> 00:51:45,193
I called as soon as I heard,
brother.

1031
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:46,792
Mom, where's your tool box?

1032
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:29,882
You about to get ran over.

1033
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:31,084
Move over.

1034
00:52:31,141 --> 00:52:32,607
Damn, please don't jack me!

1035
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:36,773
This is not a carjacking.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1036
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,718
I just need a big car
with no airbags.

1037
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,059
You need a what?

1038
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:46,623
Where the hell
are you taking me, man?

1039
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:48,311
Just got to go to little havana
for a bit.

1040
00:52:48,312 --> 00:52:49,811
Little havana?! Just let me out.

1041
00:52:49,812 --> 00:52:51,285
I'll forget I ever seen you.

1042
00:52:51,373 --> 00:52:53,688
I don't have time
to drop you off right now.

1043
00:52:55,932 --> 00:52:57,142
Watch out for this car!

1044
00:52:57,872 --> 00:52:58,995
You got to get this fixed.

1045
00:52:58,996 --> 00:53:00,259
This is really annoying.

1046
00:53:07,429 --> 00:53:09,052
I just need to do something
real quick.

1047
00:53:09,095 --> 00:53:10,333
What do you need to do?

1048
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:19,336
All right, man.
Slow down, slow down, all right?

1049
00:53:19,386 --> 00:53:20,721
It's almost over, okay?

1050
00:53:20,763 --> 00:53:22,289
What does "almost over" mean?

1051
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:25,882
There's a lot of cops
around this area, dude.

1052
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:32,994
Sean, hold on really tight.

1053
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,761
Why do I
have to hold on tight?!

1054
00:53:35,388 --> 00:53:36,388
Because...

1055
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,140
Of... This.

1056
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:57,861
Look what you did to my car!

1057
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:02,180
Damn, look at my car!

1058
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,037
Air bags save a lot of lives.

1059
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:10,387
But they also put you out
long enough

1060
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:13,072
to get your hands cable-tied
to the steering wheel.

1061
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:16,919
I just had this fixed!

1062
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:20,387
Who's gonna pay for my car, man?

1063
00:54:20,388 --> 00:54:21,760
Sean, there's cash
in his wallet.

1064
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:23,510
The rolex should take care
of the rest.

1065
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:24,886
The cops will be here soon.

1066
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,044
I'd be someplace else.

1067
00:54:29,638 --> 00:54:30,901
But how I'm-a get home?!

1068
00:54:36,264 --> 00:54:37,264
What's up?

1069
00:54:40,513 --> 00:54:41,513
Yeah, he's fine.

1070
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:44,171
Do you have a place to stay?

1071
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,386
Great.

1072
00:54:46,387 --> 00:54:47,439
You'll come get him?

1073
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,451
Good.

1074
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,385
David, your dad
will be here soon.

1075
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:54,017
You two are gonna stay
with your aunt for a while.

1076
00:54:55,765 --> 00:54:56,765
You live here?

1077
00:54:57,015 --> 00:54:58,857
I usually stay
at four-star hotels.

1078
00:54:59,574 --> 00:55:01,626
I mean, I don't really have
a lot of...

1079
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:03,825
Stuff.

1080
00:55:04,574 --> 00:55:07,679
If you're hungry, there's a
blueberry yogurt in the fridge.

1081
00:55:19,825 --> 00:55:20,511
That black eye...

1082
00:55:20,512 --> 00:55:21,512
How'd you get it?

1083
00:55:22,264 --> 00:55:23,264
Kids at school.

1084
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:26,327
Yeah, why?

1085
00:55:27,638 --> 00:55:28,450
I don't know.

1086
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:30,187
They don't need a reason,
mostly.

1087
00:55:30,513 --> 00:55:32,302
Last time,
they took my new shoes.

1088
00:55:34,326 --> 00:55:36,220
The time before,
it was just 'cause.

1089
00:55:39,638 --> 00:55:40,690
How many were there?

1090
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:43,332
Is it a group
or an individual?

1091
00:55:44,512 --> 00:55:45,512
It matters...

1092
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:47,326
Tactically.

1093
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:48,450
It's a group.

1094
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:51,639
They get up in my face, and
they start pounding me, okay?

1095
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:00,639
Are you crying?

1096
00:56:03,262 --> 00:56:04,262
You're not crying?

1097
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:06,890
Looks like you're crying.

1098
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:08,199
Don't, okay?

1099
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:12,992
All right, don't cry.

1100
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:15,123
All right, stop, all right?

1101
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:19,240
You have to lose some fights
so you can learn to win.

1102
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,745
I mean, look at this.

1103
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,386
I got the crap
beat out of me.

1104
00:56:25,387 --> 00:56:27,639
I have two black belts,
and they kicked my ass.

1105
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,073
So you got nothing
to be ashamed of with me, okay?

1106
00:56:30,074 --> 00:56:31,916
I'm the champ
of getting beaten up.

1107
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,638
But I'm also very good
at winning.

1108
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:34,691
You want it to stop?

1109
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:35,890
Yeah.

1110
00:56:36,511 --> 00:56:38,888
The key to fighting a group
is taking out its leader.

1111
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:41,260
Take out its leader,
they'll all leave you alone.

1112
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:42,418
It's bully psychology.

1113
00:56:42,574 --> 00:56:44,701
Works with third-world
military units, as well.

1114
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:46,175
When I was in afghanistan...

1115
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,639
Never mind that.

1116
00:56:49,888 --> 00:56:50,993
Um, who's the leader?

1117
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,950
His name's jake.

1118
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:54,141
Jake.

1119
00:56:54,698 --> 00:56:55,698
I'm gonna push you.

1120
00:56:55,699 --> 00:56:59,446
When I do that, you drop down
into a ball like you're scared.

1121
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:00,783
Protect yourself.

1122
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:02,118
Tight up like a ball.
Good.

1123
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:03,970
Now, he's gonna move in
to make fun of you.

1124
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:05,150
Keep those elbows tight.

1125
00:57:05,186 --> 00:57:07,784
He tries to kick you.
Protect that spleen, protect that liver.

1126
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,347
I want you to stand up quick

1127
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:11,748
and get your head right up
underneath my chin.

1128
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:12,807
Go.

1129
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:15,461
I'm a little dazed.
Make your fist.

1130
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,812
One, two, three, four, five.

1131
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:24,307
Very good.

1132
00:57:44,014 --> 00:57:45,435
Guys, it's like I told you.

1133
00:57:45,492 --> 00:57:47,731
There's nothing else.
We did the one job, and that's it.

1134
00:57:47,752 --> 00:57:49,097
How about the threatening package?

1135
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,133
You may not take that seriously,
but the terror...

1136
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,069
Oh, come on, guys.
He was just making a point.

1137
00:57:53,112 --> 00:57:54,849
We're not here
for our health, Sam.

1138
00:57:55,637 --> 00:57:56,637
Hi, guys.

1139
00:57:56,638 --> 00:57:57,638
Talking about me?

1140
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,641
Can I get a coffee?

1141
00:57:59,953 --> 00:58:00,953
Sam.

1142
00:58:01,952 --> 00:58:02,952
Hey, Mike.

1143
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:05,128
You don't want to introduce me
to your fbi buddies?

1144
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:07,264
You got the wrong idea, pal.

1145
00:58:07,265 --> 00:58:08,951
Ford outside
has g-series plates.

1146
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,637
Fast-draw holsters, off-the-rack
suits, and cheap loafers.

1147
00:58:11,638 --> 00:58:12,699
No, you guys are feds.

1148
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,700
They're feds!

1149
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:15,520
Michael, look, they came to me.

1150
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,952
I was just trying to help.

1151
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:18,327
It's not like I didn't know,
Sam.

1152
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,824
I've got two known associates
in miami... You and Lucy...

1153
00:58:20,825 --> 00:58:23,137
And amazingly, you're
both willing to help me?

1154
00:58:23,138 --> 00:58:24,980
I know
how the game is played, Sam.

1155
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:26,764
I was on the other side,
remember?

1156
00:58:26,765 --> 00:58:27,975
So. I'm Michael Westen.

1157
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:29,890
You are...

1158
00:58:31,703 --> 00:58:32,703
Agent harris.

1159
00:58:32,952 --> 00:58:33,764
This is agent lane.

1160
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:35,922
Do you even know
why you're following me?

1161
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,160
Don't know, don't care.

1162
00:58:37,766 --> 00:58:38,951
Higher up the food chain.

1163
00:58:38,952 --> 00:58:41,012
Great. Let's call your boss.
Maybe he can tell me.

1164
00:58:41,014 --> 00:58:43,795
Those aren't our orders.
Our orders are to keep tabs on you.

1165
00:58:43,874 --> 00:58:45,701
Then you give him a message.
You tell him...

1166
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:46,702
Sorry.

1167
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,470
I do have a message for you, though.

1168
00:58:49,628 --> 00:58:51,501
Don't go thinking
you got nothing to lose.

1169
00:58:51,578 --> 00:58:52,578
You got friends.

1170
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,700
You got family.

1171
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:56,333
Is that a threat,
agent harris?

1172
00:58:57,139 --> 00:58:58,139
It's the truth.

1173
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,701
Coffee's on me.

1174
00:59:06,138 --> 00:59:07,763
Mike, they got
my pension tied up.

1175
00:59:07,764 --> 00:59:08,764
Sam, Sam.

1176
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:11,209
Look, they said
it would be better for you.

1177
00:59:11,245 --> 00:59:12,835
You can do anything you want, basically,

1178
00:59:12,856 --> 00:59:14,537
as long as you stay
where they can see you

1179
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,764
and you don't cause any trouble.

1180
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:18,765
Sam, don't sprinkle sugar on
this bull and call it candy.

1181
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:19,575
I'm sorry, Mike.

1182
00:59:19,576 --> 00:59:21,049
I- I don't know what to say.

1183
00:59:21,202 --> 00:59:23,306
If I couldn't handle
my friends informing on me,

1184
00:59:23,327 --> 00:59:25,197
I wouldn't be in the business.
The way I see it,

1185
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:26,958
better a friend
than someone I don't know.

1186
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:31,048
The way I see it,
a friend would tell them

1187
00:59:31,964 --> 00:59:34,279
just enough to make them happy
but keep them

1188
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:35,902
out of my business.

1189
00:59:36,529 --> 00:59:38,055
Hell, yeah, Mike,
absolutely.

1190
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:39,279
Good. Good.

1191
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:41,402
I got to go.

1192
00:59:42,153 --> 00:59:43,463
I got to go take care of Pyne.

1193
00:59:43,464 --> 00:59:45,664
You want me to come along?
It's the least I can do.

1194
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,768
No, I can handle it.

1195
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,153
Good luck, Mike.

1196
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:02,334
When you work solo,
it's about prepping the ground.

1197
01:00:03,025 --> 01:00:05,025
Home-court advantage
counts for a lot.

1198
01:00:05,529 --> 01:00:07,465
You never know
what's going to happen.

1199
01:00:07,466 --> 01:00:08,887
You prepare for everything.

1200
01:00:20,401 --> 01:00:22,462
Most bad guys expect you
to just sit there

1201
01:00:22,463 --> 01:00:24,673
and wait for them
like those are the rules

1202
01:00:24,715 --> 01:00:25,715
or something.

1203
01:00:48,027 --> 01:00:49,027
Hello? Who's this?

1204
01:00:51,153 --> 01:00:52,153
He's there.

1205
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:06,089
Hi, there.

1206
01:01:07,277 --> 01:01:08,155
Where is he?

1207
01:01:08,156 --> 01:01:09,524
Uh, Javier? He's not here.

1208
01:01:09,775 --> 01:01:11,038
Listen, we need to talk.

1209
01:01:11,529 --> 01:01:12,463
I'm not screwing around.

1210
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:13,569
Where the hell is he?

1211
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:14,651
He's not here.

1212
01:01:16,029 --> 01:01:18,086
Anything you need to say to him,
you can say to me.

1213
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:19,613
I'm done talking, mr. Westen.

1214
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,837
I don't know how in the hell
you got in my safe,

1215
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:23,416
but I want to make it clear...

1216
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,208
I will not be intimidated.

1217
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,320
Well, neither will I.

1218
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:28,946
By the way,
you're gonna have a hard time

1219
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,819
blowing my brains out
with the safety on.

1220
01:01:35,653 --> 01:01:37,151
Whoa, hey, the safety was off!

1221
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:38,783
What do you know... My mistake.

1222
01:01:49,154 --> 01:01:50,259
Vince, what the hell?

1223
01:02:09,403 --> 01:02:11,027
If you're going to put prints
on a gun,

1224
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:13,589
sticking it into somebody's
hand isn't going to do it.

1225
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:16,011
Any decent lawyer
can explain prints on a gun.

1226
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,994
But try explaining
prints on the inside

1227
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:20,953
of the trigger assembly.

1228
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,500
Who...

1229
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:25,757
Who was doing
all the shooting?

1230
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:27,829
We have a special guest.

1231
01:02:27,939 --> 01:02:28,939
This bad boy!

1232
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:34,193
.357 magnum loaded with blanks,
duct-taped to a flare.

1233
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:37,653
Sounded like the real thing,
didn't it?

1234
01:02:39,226 --> 01:02:40,226
I need a hospital.

1235
01:02:40,228 --> 01:02:40,787
In a sec.

1236
01:02:40,788 --> 01:02:41,412
We're talking.

1237
01:02:41,413 --> 01:02:43,255
You shot your buddy here,
mr. Pyne.

1238
01:02:43,914 --> 01:02:44,914
And this...

1239
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:46,728
This...

1240
01:02:46,991 --> 01:02:48,938
This here is
a crime lab's wet dream.

1241
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:52,478
What do you want?

1242
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:55,625
In a second. I'm not done
with my show-and-tell.

1243
01:02:58,413 --> 01:03:00,663
Vincent, you're gonna have
to go over and take the kid.

1244
01:03:00,664 --> 01:03:02,664
I don't know
what the hell else to do.

1245
01:03:02,914 --> 01:03:04,703
That is you
plotting a kidnapping.

1246
01:03:04,912 --> 01:03:05,724
That's hard time...

1247
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:06,473
Federal time.

1248
01:03:06,474 --> 01:03:08,000
That's the rest
of your life.

1249
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:09,256
Tell me what you want.

1250
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:11,285
Vince here confesses
to the robbery,

1251
01:03:11,286 --> 01:03:12,759
Javier gets severance pay...

1252
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:15,276
Five years,
with benefits and dental...

1253
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:18,429
That's very important...
And never sees your mug again.

1254
01:03:19,176 --> 01:03:20,726
And you know what,
for christmas,

1255
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:23,727
throw in a college fund for
david... How does that sound?

1256
01:03:24,293 --> 01:03:25,723
Well, let's get you out of here.

1257
01:03:25,852 --> 01:03:27,599
This will be a murder weapon
in 20 minutes

1258
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,225
if Vince doesn't get
to the hospital.

1259
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,278
And the documents...

1260
01:03:31,852 --> 01:03:33,220
The financial information?

1261
01:03:33,538 --> 01:03:35,432
We'll see
how good of a boy you are.

1262
01:03:36,037 --> 01:03:37,300
'Cause I'll be watching.

1263
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:47,850
I cleaned up your place pretty well,

1264
01:03:47,885 --> 01:03:49,776
but you're gonna have
to replace the carpet.

1265
01:03:49,873 --> 01:03:52,461
But no one's gonna bother you
or your family again.

1266
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:54,527
You can go home.

1267
01:03:58,215 --> 01:03:59,215
Thank you.

1268
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:01,709
I don't... I don't know
how to say it, but...

1269
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:04,320
Don't worry about it.

1270
01:04:33,466 --> 01:04:34,466
Yeah?

1271
01:04:34,652 --> 01:04:36,178
Can I borrow your binoculars?

1272
01:04:37,926 --> 01:04:40,239
No, I know you got some in
there, and you're not using them

1273
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,292
because you need them to see me,
and I'm right here. So...

1274
01:04:45,176 --> 01:04:46,176
Please?

1275
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:47,865
Fight! Fight!

1276
01:04:47,866 --> 01:04:48,866
Fight! Fight!

1277
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,762
As a spy, it doesn't matter
if you're helping rebel forces

1278
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:55,980
fight off a dictator
or giving combat tips to a third-grader.

1279
01:04:56,834 --> 01:05:00,307
There's nothing like helping
the little guy kick some bully's ass.

1280
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,456
There's nothing worse
for a spook

1281
01:05:13,457 --> 01:05:15,144
than knowing
you're being played...

1282
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,566
Someone is pulling strings.

1283
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,456
Who?

1284
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:30,246
Not some intelligence-agency
bureaucrat in a cubicle.

1285
01:05:30,272 --> 01:05:31,956
This is someone
with more style.

1286
01:05:33,623 --> 01:05:34,667
Not fbi, either.

1287
01:05:34,696 --> 01:05:37,897
They're not this creative, and they
don't do surveillance on their own guys.

1288
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,730
This is someone
who knows what he's doing,

1289
01:05:41,272 --> 01:05:43,166
someone who wants to send
a message.

1290
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,148
"WELCOME TO MIAMI."

1291
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:49,342
