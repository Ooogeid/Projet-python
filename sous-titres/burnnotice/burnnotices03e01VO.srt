1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:01,834
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,263
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,835
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:09,902
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,209
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,855
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,223
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:19,124
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,531
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,524
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:28,402
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,780
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,199
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,409
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,037
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:39,914
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,462
Give us the man who killed
our operatives,

18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,548
and you and I can have
a little chat about your future.

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,343
When Carla finds out you hid me,
your questions will be resolved

20
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,175
- with headshot for both of us.
- What does it have to do with me?

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,167
It's all a way to get to Mike.
Get your bag, we'll go.

22
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:00,935
Crap.
We got to create a distraction.

23
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,273
It's not a goodbye.
It's just in case.

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,901
Management's on the way.

25
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,655
Any story I tell them has to begin
with Victor's dead body.

26
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:15,157
Finally.

27
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,243
They get me alive,
they'll take me apart.

28
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,011
Get out while you can.

29
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,750
I want you people out of my life!

30
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,329
All your old enemies,
did they just forget about you?

31
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,923
Or has someone been keeping them at bay?
You want out?

32
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,972
You've no idea
what hell will rain down

33
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:36,095
if we stop watching out for you!

34
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,722
I'll take my chances.

35
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:47,834
<i>As an operative,</i>

36
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,011
<i>you get used to being
in uncomfortable situations.</i>

37
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:53,209
<i>Whether it's resisting interrogation</i>

38
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:57,198
<i>in a foreign prison, fighting
guerilla forces in a tropical jungle,</i>

39
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,911
<i>or swimming five miles to
Miami beach in your suit pants,</i>

40
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,205
<i>it's just part of the job.</i>

41
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:06,298
<i>What's harder to get used to</i>

42
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:09,409
<i>is going into a situation
you don't know anything about.</i>

43
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,930
<i>Just because you're exhausted
and disoriented</i>

44
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:14,479
<i>doesn't mean you can stop
looking out for trouble.</i>

45
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:18,008
<i>Danger isn't always obvious.</i>

46
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:21,008
<i>It can be as subtle as a glance
from a friendly-seeming tourist,</i>

47
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:23,275
<i>a car that slows down
at an odd time,</i>

48
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:26,721
<i>or a cop that suddenly seems
a little too interested in you.</i>

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,646
Sir.

50
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:31,754
Get back here.

51
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:50,085
I think he ran into the hotel.
Send all available units.

52
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:59,491
<i>The backbone
of most hotel phone systems</i>

53
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:02,639
<i>is secured by nothing more
than a door and a cheap lock...</i>

54
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:05,596
<i>which makes them convenient
for people</i>

55
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:08,270
<i>who need to make quick,
untraceable phone calls.</i>

56
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,495
- <i>You're all right?</i>
- More or less.

57
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,043
<i>Your helicopter ride was not
as long as I expected.</i>

58
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:34,175
- How'd it go?
- It was interesting.

59
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,183
It looks like the people
who burned me

60
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:38,476
are gonna leave me alone
for now, anyway.

61
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,746
Thanks for saving my life.

62
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,557
It's always a treat to get you
out of trouble.

63
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,016
I appreciate it.

64
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:49,242
I checked the police radio
for news of our adventure.

65
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,242
There was a call about a mystery man
washing up on the beach.

66
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,608
A going-away present
from your helicopter friends?

67
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:55,972
How bad?

68
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:58,743
<i>You wouldn't happen to be
at the McAlpin hotel.</i>

69
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:01,342
<i>The police think you're armed
and dangerous.</i>

70
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:03,659
I'll have to find another way out.

71
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,338
Now is not the time to blast
your way out of a building.

72
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,890
<i>Talk to the cops now,
or get ready for a citywide manhunt.</i>

73
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,442
Fine, can you call Sam,

74
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,585
see what he can figure out
about my situation?

75
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:13,925
Of course.

76
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:17,455
And, Michael?

77
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:19,300
<i>I'm glad you're alive.</i>

78
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,172
Try to keep it that way.

79
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:33,065
<i>Just because you can escape
from a situation</i>

80
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:35,149
<i>doesn't mean you should.</i>

81
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,330
<i>It's a risk/reward thing.</i>

82
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,278
<i>Sometimes you have
to take your chances.</i>

83
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,906
Down on your knees!
Hands behind your head!

84
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,818
<i>Sometimes you have to remember</i>

85
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:46,702
<i>it's easier to dodge questions
than bullets.</i>

86
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,874
<i>Yogurt team</i>

87
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:09,224
Thanks for coming, Sam.
What do we know?

88
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,646
The bad news is
you're still as burned as ever.

89
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:15,865
You're still the top of
the travel watch lists,

90
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,881
and your assets are frozen
like popsicles.

91
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:21,226
- And the good news?
- The good news is that,

92
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:22,863
your status has changed.

93
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:24,682
Whatever magic they were working

94
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:27,159
to keep you out of the police
computers, they stopped.

95
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,871
You're back on the radar
of foreign agencies, too.

96
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,813
The good news is I'm being
investigated by the cops

97
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:36,209
and the foreign
intelligence agencies.

98
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,711
Yeah, it's a change.

99
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:41,715
- It's progress... of a sort.
- Any luck getting me out of here?

100
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,506
Until they charge you with something,
there's not much I can do.

101
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:47,414
They're stalling. I guess somebody
hasn't been talking much.

102
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,640
Memory loss.
You know how that is.

103
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,347
The cops, they love that one.

104
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:54,553
And, you know,
the whole,"no ID, no bank account"

105
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,118
that's not helping.
So I had to be in touch with your mom,

106
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:59,358
trying to dig up
a driver's license or something.

107
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,522
- My mom, is she okay?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,307
She's just a little upset
about the...

109
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:07,783
You know, the house blowing up.
It's not the whole house.

110
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:10,369
It's just the...
the sun-room.

111
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,375
It came out okay,
but the bottom line

112
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,040
is you're better off in here
until your ma cools off.

113
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,751
Just sit tight, Mike.
Oh, one more thing...

114
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,064
Your shades got delivered
to the loft,

115
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,666
along with this.

116
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,080
<i>As a spy,</i>

117
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,865
<i>you expect to get locked up
from time to time.</i>

118
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,009
<i>If you're on the job,
you just keep busy</i>

119
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,209
<i>until someone
negotiates your release.</i>

120
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:45,929
<i>If you're working alone,</i>

121
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:49,349
<i>you may have to get used
to steel bars and baked beans.</i>

122
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:51,980
All right, you, let's go.

123
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:55,122
- Go where?
- You've been released.

124
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:57,525
- Why? Has something changed?
- I don't know.

125
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,163
You want me to check
to see if you can stick around?

126
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:10,804
Now, where can I get myself
a pretty shirt like that?

127
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:12,918
Harlan.

128
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:16,299
- Harlan, what are you doing here?
- That's it?

129
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:18,838
I haven't seen you since,
what, Lebanon, Bosnia?

130
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:21,732
- Don't I get a, "Hey, old buddy"?
- Hey, old buddy.

131
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,916
I heard through the grapevine
that you were in the clink,

132
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,076
so I called Sam Axe
and offered my help.

133
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:33,333
One of my security clients
is a big lawyer,

134
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,346
and he accused them of holding you
as a political prisoner.

135
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,441
I got a big laugh out of that one.

136
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:41,126
- Michael Westen and Nelson Mandela.
- Thanks, Harlan.

137
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,146
I just got you out of jail, bud.

138
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:45,966
Don't I get some love here?

139
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:49,888
Look at you.

140
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:54,605
I track you down for ages, and suddenly,
you're popping out computer databases?

141
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,485
Poof!
Right out of the blue.

142
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,216
There's stuff on there about you
going rogue, selling secrets.

143
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:02,205
Someone wanted to use me.
Make sure I'd no other options,

144
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,024
they fabricated a bunch of stuff
and used it to burn me.

145
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,854
Axe told me.
Anyway, I got my ass on down here.

146
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,229
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

147
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:22,858
Look who's here!
It's good to see you, Michael.

148
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:25,084
- Mom.
- So glad you're not dead.

149
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,507
I did a little remodeling with Sam.
You like it?

150
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:31,718
- I'm so sorry, mom.
- Who's your friend?

151
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:33,121
This is Harlan.

152
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,348
We did some work together
in some other countries a while back.

153
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,535
It's very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Westen.

154
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:41,979
It's always nice to meet
Michael's mysterious acquaintances.

155
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:45,945
- Mom, he's a friend.
- When we were in those other countries,

156
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,463
Mike always used to say
how much he missed his mom.

157
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:51,405
You're a bad liar, Harlan.
I like that about you. You want a beer?

158
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:53,657
Sure. Sounds good.

159
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:56,778
Sam and Fi are in the back,
drawing up plans to fix this mess.

160
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,846
I imagine they could use some help.

161
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,264
Harlan, tell me about yourself.
What do you do?

162
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:03,167
You destroy houses, too?

163
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,613
I'm telling you,

164
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:07,805
It's harder rebuilding a sun-room
than blowing the damn thing up.

165
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,085
You have no one to blame but yourself.
If you blow something up correctly,

166
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,076
you have nothing left to fix.

167
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,905
- Look who came home from jail.
- It's nice to be home.

168
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,959
Hey, I hate to rain on the whole
homecoming-lovey thing,

169
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,325
but we got problems.

170
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,516
Carla's people were the only thing
keeping the cops off our backs,

171
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:27,748
Not to mention
12 countries' worth of guys

172
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:29,809
who are looking to put
a bullet in you.

173
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,508
Third-degree burns prevent acne.

174
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,725
It doesn't mean you set
your head on fire.

175
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,280
The point is, we got
a whole new set of worries.

176
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:37,951
We need all the help we can get.

177
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:41,417
- I was talking to Harlan earlier and...
- You talking about the gig?

178
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:42,542
The gig?

179
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,167
- You told him?
- I was about to.

180
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,331
We're helping a girl that he met.
Pays top dollar.

181
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:50,363
Axe volunteered you and Fi for duty.

182
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:52,741
Sorry, didn't mean to just
spring this on you.

183
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,509
No worries.
He does this for fun.

184
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:03,227
2 weeks ago, some men came to
my family's farm and told us to move.

185
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,773
They said that it belonged
to an American company now.

186
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,065
I was doing security
for a company down there.

187
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:10,676
These corporations are bribing
officials down south

188
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:12,871
to steal land,
and it's all run in Miami.

189
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:15,441
They paid a judge
to put my father in prison.

190
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,733
It's only a matter of time
before he dies.

191
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,089
I checked it out.

192
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:21,518
The guy who runs the scam
is Rufino Cortez.

193
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:24,289
He's wanted in Venezuela
as part of a corruption probe.

194
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,376
He'll spook if they try to extradite
him, we gotta grab him off the books.

195
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,754
He goes down,
we take a few corrupt judges with him.

196
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,450
Sunshine's a great disinfectant.

197
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:33,909
If we do this,
it's not just for Marta's family.

198
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,168
Rufino's been going after
all kinds of folks down there.

199
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:42,401
Marta, let's go get something to drink.
Ever had a mango mojito?

200
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:47,479
What's going on?

201
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:50,009
And don't tell me it was coincidence

202
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:51,642
that you bailed me out of jail

203
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,042
and then you just happen
to have a job for me.

204
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,167
No, I...

205
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,566
Listen, I'm sorry.
It's just...

206
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,352
I've been seeing her,
when I heard this thing,

207
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:06,172
you needing help, I figured that I'd

208
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:09,090
- Kill two birds with one stone.
- This Rufino,

209
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:10,467
he's evil.

210
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,247
He's had people come after him,
so he's guarded like the Pope.

211
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,840
But I think I've got an angle.

212
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,883
- I need some help.
- My help?

213
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:20,095
You always were the smart one,
and I was the pretty one, right?

214
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,810
Listen, I looked her in the eye,
and I told her I would help.

215
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,335
Please, Mike.

216
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:28,695
I'll see what I can do.

217
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,808
When I scouted this place,

218
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:57,937
I thought,
"Michael's gonna love this".

219
00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:00,344
- Get to play dress-up.
- What's your plan?

220
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:03,442
This is Rufino's club.
He's here every night.

221
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:05,832
I figured we'd have a better time
separating him

222
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:08,404
from his security team
in here than outside.

223
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,783
Is that what you figured?

224
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,814
He's back there. Private booth.

225
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,025
You know, he's the boss.

226
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,027
I forget how they say it in spanish.

227
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:25,810
He's a real charmer.

228
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:29,289
That scumbag next to him is Falcone,

229
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,333
Rufino's main man here in Miami.

230
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,168
You see, the guy almost always
has a security detail,

231
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:36,009
even taking a leak.

232
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:37,210
Almost always?

233
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:40,847
Except for when he takes his nightly
skirt to the back. Private room.

234
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:44,775
<i>In the highest security places,
uniforms are for show.</i>

235
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,210
<i>The real security
doesn't announce itself</i>

236
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:50,686
<i>with anything but wary looks
and shirts loose enough to hide a gun.</i>

237
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,839
Come on.

238
00:12:57,518 --> 00:13:01,206
The old perv does his thing in there,
that door there goes out to the alley.

239
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:03,909
We just grab Rufino
and hustle him out.

240
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,942
I conned a key from
the storage company.

241
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,412
You'd have been proud of me.
Classic Mike Westen.

242
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,693
- Harlan, hold on.
- Now we just hang tight.

243
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:15,206
You think a guy like Rufino would allow
the most sensitive part of his club

244
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:17,838
- to be beaten with a storage key?
- What else do we need?

245
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,091
How about the alarm's code?

246
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,472
Break that. I need a pry bar.

247
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:31,287
<i>Security devices
are generally one-way.</i>

248
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,285
<i>They keep people in,
or keep them out.</i>

249
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,023
<i>Most high-security locks</i>

250
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,761
<i>are a lot less secure
if you come at them backwards.</i>

251
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,603
- What are you doing? Open up!
- Just like old times.

252
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:44,271
- Just like old times.
- Open this door!

253
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:56,999
My God!

254
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,713
- Men with guns? Are you alright?
- It was fine.

255
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,674
- It's gonna take longer to grab Rufino.
- How much longer?

256
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,180
- My father's not well. We can't do...
- We're working on it, okay?

257
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,448
We're just gonna use
a different plan next time.

258
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:12,851
Yeah, can you give us a minute, babe?
I need to talk with Mike.

259
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:17,147
Hey, I got careless, man. I'm sorry.
You know, it just...

260
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,965
- It seemed like it was the right play.
- It's all right.

261
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,270
No, you know, it's like
how you always used to say.

262
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,795
Don't get personally involved.
But...

263
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,970
I'm involved.
And I got sloppy.

264
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,923
Kind of proves my point, though.
I needed your help, right?

265
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:32,078
Anytime, Harlan.

266
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,250
So what happened to you, man?
You just disappeared for all that time.

267
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,896
Whoever burned me
wanted me out of sight,

268
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,973
they were powerful enough
to make it happen.

269
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,548
Now you're just a burned spy
tossed out into the cold, huh?

270
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,440
Might as well tattoo
a bull's-eye on your forehead.

271
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:48,230
That's one way of looking at it.

272
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,855
Well, now you're helping me
with Marta.

273
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Listen.

274
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:55,769
No matter what happens from here on out,
I got your back, brother.

275
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:58,665
Thanks, Harlan.
And I'll do the planning next time.

276
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:00,895
You got it.

277
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:06,065
Hey. Sam. Feeling thirsty?

278
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:09,360
Rufino Cortez? Are you serious?

279
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,785
You want to grab Rufino Cortez?

280
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:15,080
I'm gonna need another mojito.

281
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,249
Have as many as you want.
Just tell me about him.

282
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:20,840
He's a bagman for this land-grab thing
down in Venezuela.

283
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:23,880
It's a lot of money, a lot of guns.
Not my style.

284
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,411
I'm more of your
"friendly neighborhood

285
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,526
hide your cash from the tax man"
kind of guy.

286
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:29,511
And Rufino?

287
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:33,005
Rufino is a "rob and kill for hire

288
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,933
and call it an investment"
kind of guy.

289
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,716
We need you
to put together a package,

290
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:39,311
make Mike look like somebody
Rufino would want to talk to...

291
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,981
Business records, bank accounts.

292
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:47,487
Just promise me you'll have Rufino
out of Miami before tax season.

293
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,081
Can do.

294
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,499
You know, when your father was alive,
he used to do all the repairs himself.

295
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:00,827
Yeah, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

296
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,295
The walls were made
with four different kinds of lumber.

297
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:06,517
Frank used to just go out
and find stuff.

298
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:10,330
I wouldn't call tearing wiring out
of your neighbor's air conditioner

299
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:11,455
"finding".

300
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,615
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, look!

301
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,930
There's the guy
who blew up my house!

302
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,518
Nice to see you're having
such a sunshiny day, Sam.

303
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:21,396
- Sam, whose car is that? The buick?
- Maddy's neighbor.

304
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,525
I took it over there to drop it off,
and, well, we got a little friendly.

305
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:27,652
So she's letting me
hang on to the car.

306
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,220
Mrs. Reynolds? You're romancing
an 80-year-old woman for a car?

307
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,365
I'm talking about her daughter,
Miss Reynolds.

308
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,076
She's 39, going on 22.

309
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:36,580
Great lady. Great car.

310
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,570
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Good. Mikey's all set.

311
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:42,160
He's got a meeting with Rufino's guy,
Falcone, later today.

312
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,710
Awesome! That's great.

313
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,170
Mike, your new cover ID.

314
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,839
You're Tom Wellington, esquire.

315
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,091
Lawyer for a shady
international investment group.

316
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:53,785
Hey, you wanna pick the names,
you gotta go to the meeting,

317
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,415
and listen to Barry talk
about his skin-care regimen.

318
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:04,520
<i>High-status cover Ids
are rarely effective.</i>

319
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:07,380
<i>Claim to be a big shot,
and people get suspicious.</i>

320
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:11,355
<i>Claim to be a big shot's errand boy,
people don't think twice.</i>

321
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:14,960
<i>Act like you don't want to be there
because you're tired,</i>

322
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:17,430
<i>you're underappreciated,
or you're sick,</i>

323
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:20,055
<i>and people tend
to trust you even more.</i>

324
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,875
Mr. Falcone.

325
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:25,335
- Mr. Wellington.
- Thank you for coming.

326
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,503
Word is...

327
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:31,257
If I wanted a meeting with Mr. Cortez,
you are the man to talk to.

328
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:34,335
I am, indeed. You can think of me
as the gatekeeper.

329
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:41,535
Now, I had a look
at your proposal, Mr. Wellington.

330
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:43,687
Very attractive.

331
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,125
Tell me, why is it
that your investors

332
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,650
are so interested in land
in South America?

333
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,100
Listen, I'm just a lawyer
on the deal.

334
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:53,950
My job is to set up a meeting
with Cortez and my clients.

335
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:57,367
These clients of yours...
Tell me a little more about them.

336
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,580
They're people who want
to meet with Mr. Cortez.

337
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,225
People with security concerns.
That's all I can say.

338
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,630
I'll wait for your call.

339
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:06,044
I don't mean to be rude,

340
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,129
but, you know, Mr. Cortez
has security concerns of his own.

341
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:13,258
I'm just here to set up the meeting.
I have attorney-client privileges.

342
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,155
I understand and respect

343
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,328
the importance you attach
to your professional ethics,

344
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:22,232
but, you see, in my profession,
we have our own code,

345
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:24,790
a code that compels me
to break your arm

346
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:27,365
if you don't answer my question.
Do you understand?

347
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,645
I don't know their names, okay?

348
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:35,179
They chose me because I had
no connection to them, all right?

349
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:36,885
I see.

350
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:39,570
Now, Mr. Wellington,

351
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:43,595
sometimes people try and steal from us,
or they talk to the police.

352
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:47,270
Do you wanna know what happens to them?
Does that interest you at all?

353
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:49,753
Nope. No, I just want
to make the deal, okay, man?

354
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,087
Would you...

355
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,207
Please let go of my arm.

356
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,385
Please.

357
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:03,175
Well, I think
we understand each other.

358
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:07,020
Be at the train yard in Kendall
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

359
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,870
<i>Like a wedding,</i>

360
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:28,900
<i>an armed extraction
requires a lot of planning,</i>

361
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:30,640
<i>if you want it to go well.</i>

362
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:33,797
<i>And like a wedding, it's not
the sort of thing you want to do twice,</i>

363
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:36,549
<i>which is why you hold
a rehearsal before the big day.</i>

364
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:43,140
Seriously, Michael, you just let him
dislocate your shoulder?

365
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,790
It was either that
or lose my cover ID.

366
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,685
Couldn't you have just, you know,
accidentally snapped his neck?

367
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,410
Make it look innocent?

368
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,233
I like her style.
You should listen to her more.

369
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,652
Thank you, Harlan.
It's nice to be appreciated.

370
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,675
Okay, let's do this.

371
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,716
This guy knows what he's doing.

372
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:01,991
I couldn't have picked
a better location myself.

373
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,410
They'll come in from over there.
It's the best visibility.

374
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,048
I think our only play
is to create a distraction over there.

375
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,193
How distracting?

376
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,610
More than a firecracker,
less than a neutron bomb.

377
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:11,735
Anyway....

378
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,670
They'll fall back to there.

379
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,430
We go in heavy as a son of a bitch
and shoot their car to pieces.

380
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:20,426
His security holds us off so the Vips
can escape behind those containers.

381
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,244
Where I'll handle Falcone
and grab Rufino.

382
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,639
What could be easier?

383
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,329
Easy on the explosives, Fi.

384
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:35,500
We're trying to nail this guy
on corruption charges.

385
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,650
It could be tough
if he's in little pieces.

386
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:39,425
It'll save on shipping.

387
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:42,165
Fine.

388
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:47,585
What do you think Michael's gonna do,
now that he's just a...

389
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:49,575
Miami resident?

390
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:53,535
Well, he's still burned,
and he's still Mike, so...

391
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,588
- I wouldn't say he's a Miami resident.
- You know what I mean.

392
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,215
You think he's ready to leave it behind
and just live?

393
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,723
I think it's a little tricky.
Can you help me with this?

394
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:03,598
Answer the question, Sam.

395
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:07,307
I think he'll try and get back in.

396
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,575
Why? When he's got so much here?

397
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:12,384
He might be able
to make money, finally.

398
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,647
And look at Harlan.
He might be getting friends.

399
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,965
He did his government work,
as you call it, for a reason.

400
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:20,403
For what? His country?

401
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,099
What have they done for him lately,
other than betray him,

402
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:24,824
leave him for dead, ruin his life?

403
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,077
The fact that you have to ask
means you're never gonna get it, Fi.

404
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,450
Hey, sister, don't be throwing
explosives at me

405
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:36,961
just 'cause you can't take
the cold, hard truth!

406
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,356
<i>Any ambush depends on knowing</i>

407
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:49,831
<i>where your target
is going to be and when.</i>

408
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:52,265
<i>Unfortunately, there are times
when the only way to put</i>

409
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,647
<i>your target in the line of fire
is to be there yourself.</i>

410
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:59,025
- You see anything, Hercules?
- Nothing yet, boss.

411
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:02,654
<i>Those are the times you just have
to trust your team,</i>

412
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,238
<i>and hope everything goes right.</i>

413
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,839
Where's Mr. Cortez?

414
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:24,345
Unfortunately,
he couldn't be with us today.

415
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,135
I'm authorized to discuss any terms.

416
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:27,460
What?

417
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:29,389
We agreed Mr. Cortez would be...

418
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:33,125
I find it best to keep
agreements flexible, Mr. Wellington.

419
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,581
Where is Rufino?

420
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:37,906
My job is to meet
with Mr. Cortez, not you.

421
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:41,090
If he finds out that my clients
are doing a deal with someone else,

422
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:42,415
it's your ass.

423
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:46,698
Yeah, just pull the arm out again.
Feels good.

424
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:49,867
I don't get to go back to my client

425
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,787
without anything short
of a meeting with Rufino.

426
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:57,208
I said you can discuss this with me.

427
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,753
And I said I can do it with Rufino.
You don't like it, shoot me.

428
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,471
- Let's go in.
- No.

429
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:05,049
Fi starts the show when she sees Rufino.
We move then.

430
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,640
Why are you waving me off?

431
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,495
Is this supposed to scare me?

432
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,925
Is that what this is?

433
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:25,055
Let me be clear. You can shoot at me
as many times as you want,

434
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:28,375
but unless I get a face-to-face
meeting with Rufino,

435
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,410
I cannot give you what you want!

436
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,537
You're a determined man,
Mr. Wellington.

437
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:37,816
I'll tell you what...

438
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:40,251
I'll call you with a place and time.
We'll pick you up.

439
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:42,503
You'll meet Mr. Cortez in the car.

440
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,465
If he likes what you have to say,
we'll see about this deal.

441
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,424
If not...

442
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,825
And I meet with Mr. Cortez
on the way.

443
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:05,775
I'll be there.

444
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,800
Now, I assume I'll be meeting
with the actual Mr. Cortez this time.

445
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:20,075
That's a nice combo.

446
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:22,355
What? It's good this way.

447
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,180
- You get the pickup location, Mikey?
- Train tracks on 10th Street.

448
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:29,125
Looks like the meeting is gonna be
on the move so no one can hit it.

449
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,100
Have to hit it on the move, then.

450
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:35,475
<i>Security levels vary widely
for different kinds of vehicles.</i>

451
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:38,385
So, do you guys do
this sort of thing a lot?

452
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:41,625
More than most...

453
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:43,665
I suppose.

454
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,470
<i>Garbage trucks, for example,
are expensive,</i>

455
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:49,400
<i>but the fact that they're hard to hide
and harder to sell</i>

456
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:52,866
<i>means that you don't find a lot
of garbage-truck alarm systems.</i>

457
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,921
How long did you and Michael
work together?

458
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:56,046
About a year.

459
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:59,130
You know, he's a pretty damn good guy
to have around when things get rough.

460
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:01,005
Yeah. He has his moments.

461
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:06,762
Listen, thanks for helping out
with this, seriously.

462
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:09,835
You want to pay me back?

463
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:13,616
Take Michael for a beer.
Tell him life is worth living

464
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:16,841
when you're not sneaking around
for the government.

465
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,025
Will do.

466
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:31,485
Go.

467
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:38,915
So, I'm thinking,
they're gonna follow the tracks,

468
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,997
Make sure nobody's after them.

469
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:43,627
When they get to dollars to doughnuts,
they turn around,

470
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,470
come back down this way
to drop you off when they're done.

471
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:49,046
And we hit them right there.

472
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,298
Sounds good, Sam.

473
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,557
Harlan's got some Venezuelan
commando types coming to take Rufino.

474
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:56,082
So I poked around.

475
00:25:56,395 --> 00:25:59,470
Sounds like these guys are frothing
at the mouth to get this guy down there.

476
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:02,268
Murder, corruption, conspiracy.

477
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,065
Nice leather briefcase.
Shame to ruin it.

478
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,006
Guess it's for a good cause.

479
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:12,570
<i>In close spaces, a knife's often
more effective than a gun.</i>

480
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:17,158
<i>Easier to handle, easier to hide,</i>

481
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,869
<i>and in the right hands, scarier.</i>

482
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,792
When you asked to borrow
your father's old briefcase,

483
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,890
you didn't mention you were
planning on stabbing someone.

484
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:35,760
- This is more of a "just in case".
- In case what?

485
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:39,255
I'm gonna get a beer.
A fresh one, from the garage.

486
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:41,895
Mom...

487
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:44,500
- Forget it. I don't wanna know.
- It's probably better.

488
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:47,104
I do wanna know if you've given
any thought at all

489
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:50,109
to what you might be getting
your friend Harlan into.

490
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:52,443
He's nice, but he's not exactly
a rocket scientist.

491
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,761
Hanging out with you
isn't the safest thing to do.

492
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:57,031
- Mom, he's special forces.
- Whatever.

493
00:26:57,715 --> 00:27:00,819
He's got a lot to prove with you.
It's written all over his face.

494
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:01,994
That's dangerous.

495
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,704
You know, he's your friend,

496
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,749
but if something happens to him,
I'm just warning you.

497
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,590
Are you through here?

498
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:12,257
I've one more thing to do.

499
00:27:22,555 --> 00:27:25,145
<i>The rolling meeting
is a popular security measure</i>

500
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,878
<i>among high-end criminals.</i>

501
00:27:27,675 --> 00:27:29,780
<i>It's hard for law enforcement
to bug,</i>

502
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:32,710
<i>and it's a lot easier
to detect any surveillance.</i>

503
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:35,611
<i>Do it in an armored car
with an armed team,</i>

504
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:39,655
<i>it's not just a secure place,
it's a fortress on wheels.</i>

505
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,575
I love these SUVs. They're roomy.

506
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:44,820
<i>If you're going to take on
that fortress,</i>

507
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:46,789
<i>you'd better have an army.</i>

508
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:57,133
Mr. Wellington, meet Mr. Cortez.

509
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:00,720
It's an honor to get a meeting
with someone so shy.

510
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,265
Let's focus on the matter at hand.

511
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,729
Your clients want to buy a lot of land
in my country, Mr. Wellington.

512
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:13,232
Coffee plantations,
soybeans, corn...

513
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,971
- These are men of great appetite.
- I just do the paperwork.

514
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,572
I ask myself,
"Who needs so much land?"

515
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,567
Farm importers dodging taxes?

516
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,472
Chemical companies dumping waste?

517
00:28:24,597 --> 00:28:25,647
Or perhaps,

518
00:28:26,477 --> 00:28:28,372
an american law-enforcement agency?

519
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:31,125
You think I'm a cop?
You're joking!

520
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:35,181
You think I'm wearing a wire?
You wanna check? Look. Nothing there.

521
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:37,548
- Nothing there. You wanna see this?
- That's enough!

522
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,051
Can we do this, please?

523
00:28:45,046 --> 00:28:48,017
A deal like is...
means many enemies.

524
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,394
There will be officials to bribe,

525
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,604
judges...

526
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,469
Lives... will end.

527
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:56,448
Tell me why I should do
a deal with ghosts

528
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:59,612
who hide behind numbered
bank accounts and lawyers?

529
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,448
I don't like this.
Stop the car.

530
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:03,866
Wait a second, here.

531
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:07,661
What the hell?

532
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:11,123
Come on, Mikey.
Something's wrong. They stopped.

533
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:13,759
Do you think that I don't want
to tell you?

534
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:15,294
Get out. You're done.

535
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:19,131
<i>When an operation depends on
clockwork timing and position,</i>

536
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:22,635
<i>you have to do whatever it takes
to make sure it comes together.</i>

537
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:26,223
I can't go back empty-handed. Please.
You don't know who I'm dealing with.

538
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,682
These guys are serious.
It's a billion dollars.

539
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,811
The way these people work,
if I don't close the deal,

540
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:35,356
they'll put a bullet back of my head,
and they'll find another guy to do it.

541
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,344
I cannot go back to these guys

542
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:40,519
and say, "Sorry, men,
the deal didn't go through".

543
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,031
Just hear me out, please.

544
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:51,293
Fine.

545
00:29:52,461 --> 00:29:53,666
Tell me more.

546
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:02,716
Okay, we're back in business.
You guys ready to go?

547
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,386
- Do you have to ask?
- Ready, ready.

548
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,307
And... Fiona.

549
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:19,316
<i>The principles behind a snatch-and-grab
are straightforward,</i>

550
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,028
<i>Separate the target from security,</i>

551
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,629
<i>then keep the security occupied
while the target is acquired.</i>

552
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:30,314
<i>Simple enough, but like anything,
it's all in the execution.</i>

553
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,698
- What the hell?
- Get down!

554
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:13,204
<i>There's a reason it's called
bullet-resistant glass, not bulletproof.</i>

555
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,466
<i>The right bullet will take out
any glass.</i>

556
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:22,755
Put the gun down.
Gun down, gun down!

557
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,551
You've a slug in your engine block,
your team is pinned down,

558
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,178
and I'm leaving with your boss.

559
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:34,058
If I were you, I'd think about another
line of work other than security.

560
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:43,901
Nice work, Jefe!

561
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:57,270
That was a beautiful thing, Mike.
Just like the old days, buddy.

562
00:31:57,395 --> 00:32:00,388
It'll be a beautiful thing when we get
Rufino on a boat to Venezuela.

563
00:32:00,513 --> 00:32:03,216
Everything's taken care of.
The team's gonna pick him up at dawn.

564
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:04,838
Man, I'm sorry.

565
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:07,758
I forgot to tell you.
There's one change in the plan.

566
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:13,222
They're not coming for Rufino.

567
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:16,661
They're coming for you.

568
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:22,048
It's Sam, again.

569
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,712
It's been a while. We're just worried
about you. Call me when you get this.

570
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,562
Think we should order him
another couple of drinks?

571
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:33,433
You've ordered four beers
and two coffees. You stop ordering,

572
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:35,847
when someone doesn't show up
after three hours.

573
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,914
Right, but he was so specific.
We ditch the truck,

574
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,071
they ship off Rufino,
we meet them here.

575
00:32:41,257 --> 00:32:45,129
- They should have at least checked in.
- How well did you know Harlan?

576
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,841
I don't know.
We did four or five missions.

577
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:51,589
Always had your back.

578
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,767
- You think?
- I think sometimes people change.

579
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,858
Jesus, what a beautiful night.
Smell that ocean air.

580
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:08,360
You sure this is
the smart play here, Harlan?

581
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,489
- Don't you talk to me about smart play.
- How long have we known each other?

582
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,992
Not long enough for you
to show me a little respect.

583
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:19,067
Is this how you get respect?
You betray a friend and kill a man?

584
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,717
As a matter of fact, yes.
I spent a lot of time

585
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:25,753
carrying the bags, kicking down doors,
getting the guns ready.

586
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,285
I need a change.

587
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:36,401
Please don't do this.
You're making a mistake.

588
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:39,949
I disagree. I got to say,
I'm pretty proud of this.

589
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:43,687
Rufino's partners back home
are getting a little nervous

590
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,818
about this anti-corruption thing.

591
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:49,067
They knew the federales want to bag him,
start a big probe,

592
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:52,787
so they asked me for help.
Yeah, they asked me.

593
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:57,451
I went the white knight with Marta,
and I got myself the gig to grab.

594
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:01,141
And when you showed up on the radar,
it was perfect.

595
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,778
I get someone to help me out
with the old man.

596
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:08,253
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- No problem.

597
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,994
Of course, we needed somebody
to blame for smoking Rufino.

598
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,497
I'm gonna give the federales
Mike Westen.

599
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:16,470
The dirty spy who denied them
their chance for justice.

600
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,972
You were the cherry on top
of the whole thing.

601
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:21,201
- And Marta?
- Marta...

602
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:24,721
Rufino stole every farm
within 50 miles.

603
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:27,815
It's not too hard to find
some desperate chica who needed my help.

604
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,158
She's very grateful.

605
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,001
You should think about that while
you stand in front of the firing squad.

606
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:36,886
It might help you feel better.

607
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:39,410
You know,
Fiona wanted me to talk to you.

608
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:42,913
She wanted me to tell you that there's
a life after you're done being a spy.

609
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:45,165
Not very long, in your case.

610
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:47,376
Listen.

611
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,782
How do you know you can trust
Rufino's partners?

612
00:34:49,907 --> 00:34:52,800
What's stopping them from turning on you
the way they turned on him?

613
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,259
Man, don't you dare patronize me!

614
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:58,971
I'm not patronizing you.
You won, you beat me.

615
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:02,670
You're smarter than me.
I'm just asking you to think about it.

616
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,769
You're better than this.
I know you.

617
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:07,981
You're a patriot.
We served together.

618
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,841
You sure this is who you wanna be,

619
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:13,110
a mercenary, betraying his friend
for blood money?

620
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:20,576
- I'm sure.
- That's all I needed to know.

621
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:35,200
Pretty clever, Mike!
But I still can kick your ass!

622
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:28,744
<i>When you're trying to hide in the water,
fire is your friend.</i>

623
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:31,799
<i>The light turns the surface
of the water into a mirror.</i>

624
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:34,400
<i>Then it's just a matter of finding
a place to surface</i>

625
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,944
<i>where the fire isn't consuming
all the oxygen.</i>

626
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:09,754
You think you're gonna run,

627
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,145
make it out to the road?

628
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:15,800
Give it a shot, buddy.

629
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:32,860
Come on, Mike.

630
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:35,466
Let's do this.

631
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:38,463
Just you and me.

632
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,022
Right now, man to man, buddy.

633
00:37:43,147 --> 00:37:45,727
<i>One of the things covert
operatives have to give up</i>

634
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:48,169
<i>is the idea of a fair fight.</i>

635
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:52,586
<i>Spies aren't trained to fight fair.</i>

636
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:54,813
<i>Spies are trained to win.</i>

637
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:06,533
I'm sorry.

638
00:38:43,737 --> 00:38:45,322
Yes.
Who is this?

639
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,268
The man on the docks there,

640
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,119
<i>the one who you wanted to get
Rufino Cortez for you,</i>

641
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,067
<i>he works with Rufino's partners.</i>

642
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,749
They wanted to make sure
he was dead before the trial.

643
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:59,110
<i>You want to put someone on trial,
Harlan's the best you're gonna do.</i>

644
00:39:20,116 --> 00:39:21,985
Mike, this is not good.

645
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:25,210
You've been swimming away from bad guys
a little too often these days.

646
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:26,335
I know.

647
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,629
I'm not saying you're not popular,

648
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:32,202
but you're a guy who's had
a lot of disagreements over the years.

649
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,098
- You can't even trust your buddies.
- It's nothing we can't handle.

650
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:37,050
Michael, you really need stitches.

651
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,496
I'm fine. The cuts are shallow.

652
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:41,920
I know. I made them.

653
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,506
You know, I never liked that Harlan.

654
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,293
Do you remember? I told you...

655
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,011
You told me I was going
to get him killed.

656
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:51,712
No, you misunderstood.
That's not what I meant.

657
00:39:51,837 --> 00:39:54,182
It doesn't matter.
The point is...

658
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:57,686
You three...
need to stick together.

659
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:15,964
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Yes. I'm going home tonight.

660
00:40:16,687 --> 00:40:19,338
The newspapers are already saying
that the land will be returned.

661
00:40:19,463 --> 00:40:21,418
My father will be released
from prison soon.

662
00:40:21,896 --> 00:40:23,549
That's good. I'm glad.

663
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:26,224
Sorry about Harlan.
He seemed so nice...

664
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,892
Like a good man.

665
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:31,406
He was a good man... once.

666
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:34,796
- I didn't mean to bring you to trouble.
- It's not your fault.

667
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:37,059
Trouble seems to find me
without any help.

668
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:39,728
Good luck.

669
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,426
- How you doing there, brother?
- I'm fine, Sam.

670
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:50,021
- I could have done this meeting alone.
- I know.

671
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,780
Just wanted to get some air,

672
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:54,117
go for a ride with my pal
in sunny Miami.

673
00:40:56,923 --> 00:40:58,663
Sunshine, you know?

674
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:02,651
What the hell am I gonna do?
You got a target on your back.

675
00:41:03,198 --> 00:41:06,151
- There's nobody else protecting you.
- I don't need a bodyguard.

676
00:41:06,276 --> 00:41:07,746
I need an agency.

677
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:11,276
It's time for me to get my old job back,
my real job.

678
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:15,327
We went through this. Just because
folks that burned you are laying off

679
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:17,571
doesn't change the fact
that you're radioactive.

680
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:20,685
Government types aren't gonna touch you.
You're still out.

681
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:23,271
Then I'll find a way to get back in.

682
00:41:28,562 --> 00:41:29,569
Simple as that?

683
00:41:31,295 --> 00:41:32,295
Alright.

684
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:35,283
You're buying the mojitos.
