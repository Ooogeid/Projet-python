1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,834
<i>My name is Michael Western.</i>

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,262
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,834
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,697 --> 00:00:09,901
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,219
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,854
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,223
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,123
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,563
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,524
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,402
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,780
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,199
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,409
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,037
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:39,914
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:49,269
<i>In the intelligence community,</i>

18
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:52,510
<i>an invitation to meet at a hotel pool
is an olive branch.</i>

19
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:56,514
<i>The person you're meeting
is offering you multiple escape routes,</i>

20
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,140
<i>a crowd to mix in with,</i>

21
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:01,268
<i>and the virtual certainty
that nobody is concealing</i>

22
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:03,339
<i>a weapon in their bathing suit.</i>

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,058
<i>But if you're meeting
the kind of guy who arranges</i>

24
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,797
<i>coup d'etats for a living,
it's still a good idea to bring backup.</i>

25
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:10,922
Champagne?

26
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,994
Why don't we ever come to these places
for anything other than surveillance?

27
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:23,089
I'm not seeing anyone
who's obviously here for a meeting.

28
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,467
I don't know why you're willing
to meet Gilroy.

29
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,518
He sounds as bad as the people
who burned you.

30
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:28,643
He's worse.

31
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,203
As far as I know,
they weren't selling nuclear secrets

32
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:32,883
to anyone who can write a check.

33
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:36,053
If the price is right,
Gilroy will put anything on the table.

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,069
Which makes this little <i>rendez-vous</i>
not a very good idea, in my opinion.

35
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:42,181
If he's in Miami,
he's planning something big.

36
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:45,629
- I need to find out what.
- Gilroy already killed your CIA contact.

37
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:47,704
That's exactly the point, Fi.

38
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:51,193
This man is a freelance psychopath.

39
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,286
And I'm the only one in a position
who can do anything about it.

40
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:57,199
Keep an eye out.

41
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,070
Western.

42
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,215
They say eyes are the windows
to the soul,

43
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:25,895
but I think hands...

44
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:27,730
tell you so much more.

45
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:28,898
And you...

46
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,733
You have a workingman's hands.

47
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:33,909
I've never been afraid
to get them dirty.

48
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,034
I've heard.

49
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:37,996
The company man gone bad.

50
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:40,868
I have to say,
I find you quite fascinating.

51
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,788
- I bet you say that to all the girls.
- Only the ones I like.

52
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,623
- I'm flattered.
- You should be.

53
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,282
Most people bore me,
especially Americans.

54
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:51,524
Always some structure to report to,
some memo to file.

55
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:53,088
Everything in its proper box.

56
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:55,630
For all your talk
of rugged individualism,

57
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:58,274
in my experience,
this is a nation of sheep,

58
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,763
present company excepted, of course.

59
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,804
Of course.

60
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:03,808
And you?
How do you like to operate?

61
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,811
I see opportunities, and I take them.
It's much simpler, much more fun.

62
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,395
Sounds like we're a lot alike.

63
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,353
An associate once told me that.

64
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:11,482
Tom Strickler.

65
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,948
You know him, don't you?

66
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,373
That's right.

67
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:15,569
You shot him.

68
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,571
I'm curious.

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,030
What led to the actual...

70
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,360
I did the work.
He banked the cash.

71
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,454
I just figured
I'd eliminate the middleman.

72
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,222
Eliminate him you did.

73
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,079
Unfortunately,
it made a certain CIA agent

74
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:32,315
take an interest
in Strickler's business.

75
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,713
And since
I was Strickler's business...

76
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:37,466
You arranged to have him
fall out of a fourth-story window.

77
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:42,471
It wasn't lost on me that you showed up
at the scene. Why was that?

78
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,562
He wasn't just your problem.
I was Strickler's business, too.

79
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:48,060
We have a lot in common.
Why don't we work together?

80
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,228
Tempting.

81
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,227
But you were quite
the boy scout once.

82
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:53,899
And the project I'm working on
is definitely not for boy scouts.

83
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,839
I've been there and done that,
and I see where it gets you.

84
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:58,939
That's why I live by a new code.

85
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,739
50% up front.

86
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,996
I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.
I'm still getting to know you,

87
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,290
getting to know all about you...

88
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,500
And your little girlfriend up there.

89
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,455
Champagne's on me.

90
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:43,843
What's going on here?

91
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,095
I'm moving.

92
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:46,910
- You found a place.
- Sorta.

93
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,829
I'm staying with Miss Reynolds
and her mom.

94
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,873
Isn't she a little angry about...

95
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,077
The "car getting wrecked" thing?
Yeah, sure, but,

96
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,420
sometimes a loss
can bring people together.

97
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,136
Anyway, I wish your mom
would let me keep some of this crap.

98
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:01,782
It's gonna have to go into storage.

99
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:03,886
I was thinking you might want
some of this stuff.

100
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:05,012
Look at that.

101
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,947
That would go great at your place.

102
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,808
Or not.

103
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,559
How'd your meeting go?

104
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,228
Gilroy won't deal with me
until he's convinced I'm his guy.

105
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:15,914
You got a whole burn notice file
that says you are.

106
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,597
He's careful.
He's checking me out.

107
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:20,542
He'll look into the burn file,
keep an eye on me.

108
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,488
I have to make sure
he likes what he sees.

109
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,618
Playing the rogue operative

110
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:27,117
after everything you've done
to clear your name... Are you sure?

111
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,390
I'm already out.
And if this is what I have to do

112
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:32,040
to get in with Gilroy,
I don't have much choice.

113
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:35,334
You got a visitor.
Says he's an old friend of yours.

114
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,429
Mack.

115
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Hey, man.

116
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,612
Been a long time.

117
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:54,436


118
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,889
That's okay.

119
00:05:58,657 --> 00:05:59,751
I deserved that.

120
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:02,736


121
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,403
Easy. Sam.

122
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:08,951
That one, too, I suppose.

123
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,661
All right, look...

124
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,915
I know you and I have had problems,
but I need your help.

125
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:17,626
Can I buy you a beer?

126
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:19,641
Please.

127
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,767
I'm not in a drinking mood.

128
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:29,244
Who is this guy?

129
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:32,496
We served together
during my SEAL days.

130
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:35,978
- You don't look excited to see him.
- We had a bit of a falling-out.

131
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,356
Anything you want to talk about?

132
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,574
I'm sorry, Mike. I...

133
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,882
Maybe I'll just let him
buy me that beer.

134
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,539
I'll be all right.

135
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:01,128
You ever talk to any of the boys
from the old unit?

136
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,213
The SEALs have come a long way.

137
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,632
Skip the small talk.
Why are you here?

138
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:10,705
All right.

139
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,821
Here's the deal.

140
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,991
After the Navy,
I took a job at the Houston PD.

141
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:19,146
I work child-abduction cases.

142
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,315
Most of the time,
it's the same old thing.

143
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,649
Some mixed-up relative snatches a kid
'cause of some stupid argument.

144
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,793
Every once in a while,

145
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,285
you get a true predator.
And this one's the worst I ever seen.

146
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:34,995
His name's Rincon.

147
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,041
I built a whole case against him,
enough to put him away for 3 lifetimes.

148
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,617
We went to the house to get him,
busted down the door,

149
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:43,712
and the whole goddamn place
exploded.

150
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:46,715
I lost a couple of my best men
that day.

151
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,093
Sorry.

152
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,804
There was a report on the incident.

153
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,807
That I hadn't supervised the assault
team properly. But that wasn't true.

154
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,350
They still suspended me.

155
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,019
- What happened to him?
- They found some remains in the house.

156
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,588
Nothing conclusive.

157
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,373
And the brass couldn't admit

158
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,900
that the bad guy walked away,
so they closed the case.

159
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:07,569
- And you think he's still alive?
- I know he is.

160
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,243
Rincon knew he was going down,
so he faked his death,

161
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:12,241
and I traced the son of a bitch
to Miami.

162
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,827
You catch this guy, you clear your name.
Is that the idea?

163
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:21,126
If I go down,
all my other cases go up in smoke,

164
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,127
and a lot of bad guys could walk.

165
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:29,675
Sorry.

166
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,136
Shouldn't have asked.

167
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,556
You figure this is a two-man job?

168
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:39,143
Could use a third man
if you know anyone.

169
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,770
I do, but I wouldn't call her
"the third man" to her face.

170
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:43,324
Thank you.

171
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,003
- About our dustup...
- Let's not get into it.

172
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,362
We do this, you go home.

173
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,364
- That's it.
- You got it.

174
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,207
- What can I do for you?
- You all right?

175
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,836
That was some cheap shot.

176
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,422
He deserved a lot more than that,
believe me.

177
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:09,840
What happened with you two?

178
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:11,550
Nothing that concerns you.

179
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,057
It does concern me

180
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:16,741
because I've never seen you
like this before.

181
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:19,766
And now you're doing some job with him.
How do you know you can trust him?

182
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,297
My issues with him are not professional,
they are personal,

183
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,688
which is why I would prefer
if you'd just stay out of it.

184
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,505
So, how do you know
Rincon's gonna show up here?

185
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,780
Rincon was importing drugs
from Mexico,

186
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:56,531
and I've been keeping track
of his old contacts.

187
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:58,528
I intercepted a call,

188
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,228
and the word is
he's doing a meeting here today.

189
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,018
So, you can't take that to the DA?

190
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,604
They're smart enough
not to use the guy's name.

191
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,322
Plus the phone tap
wasn't exactly legal.

192
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:11,963
<i>Our guest has arrived.</i>

193
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,697
<i>Somehow he looks even more
like a child predator</i>

194
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,181
<i>and cop killer
than he did in the picture.</i>

195
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:21,328


196
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,770
All right.

197
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:28,574
You sit tight.

198
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,045
We can't spook this guy.

199
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:39,054
<i>Neighborhood watch is just a nice idea
in most suburbs.</i>

200
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:42,391
<i>But where you really see it in action
is the inner city.</i>

201
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,768
<i>Only there,
it doesn't protect against crime.</i>

202
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:47,521
<i>It protects against cops.</i>

203
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,357
<i>Just like cops
have drug-detecting dogs,</i>

204
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:54,069
<i>some neighborhoods
have cop-detecting kids.</i>

205
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:56,280
<i>Once the alarm goes out,</i>

206
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,074
<i>criminal activity shuts down
like a picnic when it rains.</i>

207
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,620
<i>And any fugitives
run like jackrabbits.</i>

208
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,519
Chicle?

209
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,212
Policia?

210
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,320
- They think we're police.
- This is bad.

211
00:11:17,445 --> 00:11:19,761
If Rincon thinks
the cops know he's here, he's gone.

212
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:23,934
Then we'll just have to show everyone
that we're not cops.

213
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,523
What are you looking at?

214
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,526
Want to hurry up, sister?

215
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,194
You want to stop distracting me?

216
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,998
- So, you stole this car?
- What did you want us to do?

217
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:51,626
We had to prove to them
that we weren't cops. You saw the place.

218
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,544
It's a no-fly zone for gringos.

219
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,444
I know you're a little preoccupied
with this whole Gilroy business.

220
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,469
He's going to be a handful.

221
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:03,513
I think if Michael has time for Gilroy,
then he has time for a child predator.

222
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,707
Okay, what's the problem?

223
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:10,812
We didn't exactly blend in to
the neighborhood where Rincon's hiding.

224
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,691
The second we made our move, the locals
sounded the cop alarm, and he ran.

225
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,399
Once you get off the side streets...

226
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:19,446
You set one foot on the main boulevard,
it's like having a spotlight on you.

227
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,468
Any chance that Rincon
will pop up again?

228
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:23,075
No, this is our only chance.

229
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,660
- This is over unless...
- He's probably still in the area.

230
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,288
If we can't go looking for him...

231
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,498
Someone in the neighborhood
will have to look for us,

232
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:32,949
someone with an ear to the ground,
someone Rincon won't see coming.

233
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:36,046
Mike's right. The local gang will know
the neighborhood better than anyone.

234
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,758
Someone at the top was smart enough
to set up a network of eyes and ears.

235
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,899
- He'll be able to find Rincon.
- Wait, you saying

236
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:44,013
that we're gonna get
the local gang leader to help?

237
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:45,597
You got a better idea?

238
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:58,568
So, a buddy of mine pulled
some police files on this area.

239
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,363
Local gang leader's
name is Omar Hernandez.

240
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,205
His crew controls this neighborhood.

241
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,757
He started out doing
the normal gangbanger stuff.

242
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,786
Boosting cars, running guns.

243
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,663
What's his business now?

244
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:12,791
Must be dealing drugs.
He got guys looking out for the police.

245
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,875
He's dealing drugs,
but not the normal kind.

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,700
We got aspirin, cold medicine,
throw in some baby formula, too.

247
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:22,829
Omar's the lead suspect in a bunch
of chain-store-warehouse break-ins.

248
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:24,928
See,
the bodegas are fencing the stuff.

249
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,222
Got ourselves a regular Robin Hood.

250
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,055
He knows
how to take care of business.

251
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,146
Omar's last arrest was for beating
the bejesus out of some guy

252
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,104
who was smacking
his girlfriend around.

253
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,662
What, you defending this guy?

254
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:38,650
You think this neighborhood
gets a lot of protection from the cops?

255
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,903
The guy's a thug.
He won't find Rincon for us easily.

256
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:44,367
I'll have to be extra convincing.

257
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:50,941
In an army,

258
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:54,474
a chain of command
gets activated by unusual events.

259
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:56,501
Tanks amassing on a border,

260
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,489
a hacking attack
on a central computer,

261
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:01,714
assassinations of key personnel.

262
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:05,117
A street gang's chain of command
is no different.

263
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:06,845
Showing up in a stolen car

264
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:10,432
and making a splashy entrance
will get a message sent up the ladder.

265
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,785
I'm looking for Omar.

266
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:15,312
We've been looking for that car.

267
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,190
You found it.

268
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,195
Sorry.
We don't know no Omar.

269
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,805
I'll be waiting for Omar in there.

270
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,090
Here comes the king of the barrio.

271
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:56,413


272
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:09,977
Nice suit.

273
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:13,078
What are you, the devil?

274
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,746
Call me whatever you like,

275
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,464
but my name is Louis.

276
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,609
Let's beat his ass, Omar.

277
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:24,965
What is it you want, Louis?

278
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:28,321
A man named Rincon
is hiding in your neighborhood.

279
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:30,303
You're going to find him.

280
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:31,514
Why would I do that?

281
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:35,797
Because his business is hurting children
and your business is protecting them.

282
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,187
You seem to know a lot about me.

283
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,773
I don't know nothing about you.

284
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:42,649
You know all you need to know.

285
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,776
<i>You got a funny way of talking.
You use words but don't say nothing.</i>

286
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,365
<i>I say what I mean.</i>

287
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,411
Let me say what I mean.
Yeah, I protect my people.

288
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,913
I provide for them.
If it wasn't for me and my crew,

289
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,292
gangbangers one block over
would be doing drive-bys in the street,

290
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,711
and little babies
would be going hungry.

291
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,214
I don't got time to play with no devil
or whatever you think you are.

292
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:08,925
The devil wants Rincon's soul.

293
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,136
I just want the man.

294
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,931
The faster you give him to me,
the faster I go away.

295
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:15,974
Or what?

296
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:18,032
Or this.

297
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:32,117
He's gone!

298
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:40,752
Is that the bad guy?

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,517
It's more like the guy

300
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:44,628
who's supposed to go looking
for the bad guy.

301
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,671
Put a tracker and a bug in his car.

302
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,414
How come you're not out with Sam?

303
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:53,639
Your boy and Sam
got a peculiar way of doing things.

304
00:16:53,892 --> 00:16:57,557
Sam thought it would be best
if I kept a watch on things from here.

305
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,018
What happened with you two?

306
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:03,063
With all due respect, ma'am,
that's really none of your business.

307
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,587
Well, I'm making it my business.

308
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,903
He's my son's best friend.

309
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,490
And come to think about it,
he's mine, too.

310
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:17,263
The point is, I'm worried about him.

311
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:18,738
He's not himself.

312
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,540
With the drinking...

313
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,750
No, Sam's always liked his beer.

314
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:26,002
He's not drinking,
is what I'm saying.

315
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:30,924
Here it is.

316
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:32,425
You know he was married.

317
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,681
You screwed around with his wife.

318
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:39,766
It wasn't that simple.

319
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:42,811
It never is.

320
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:55,031
What do we have?

321
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,516
Omar's been talking a lot
about some crazy

322
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,953
who wants him to find Rincon,
but he hasn't made a move yet.

323
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:07,464
Who's Mr. Personality there?

324
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,426
That's Felipe Vega.

325
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,550
- They work together?
- No, Vega runs a bigger gang,

326
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,760
Northside 13.

327
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,761
They've been inching in
on Omar's neighborhood.

328
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,947
He's careful.

329
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:19,347
Yeah, and ruthless.

330
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,143
His crew's been busy collecting scalps,
mostly rival gangbangers, it looks like.

331
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:27,480


332
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,027
<i>I like your neighborhood.</i>

333
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,489
It's nice and clean.

334
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:33,519
Everybody seems so happy.

335
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,698
- Is that a new car?
- It's new enough.

336
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:40,148
Don't try to play me, Omar.

337
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,539
I know you're doing all right.

338
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:44,952
Pretty busy inside there.

339
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:46,666
You got my shipment?

340
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,754
Everything I have,
I got people counting on it.

341
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,672
I told you
I was gonna be by every week.

342
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:54,174
And I told you I don't got it.

343
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,843
- <i>You can keep what you took last week.</i>
- <i>What I took?</i>

344
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,762
<i>It sounds like I stole something.</i>

345
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,638
<i>Let's get something straight.</i>

346
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,266
That was payment for protection.

347
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:06,322
You never know who come in here
and start trouble for you.

348
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:11,543
See what I mean?

349
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,035
<i>Me and you got a beef?</i>

350
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,404
You'll get your shipment.
Just get out of here.

351
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:26,664
Get out of here?

352
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,208
You're pushing it, Omar.

353
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,719
Now, you pack my stuff
up in the van.

354
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:33,254
The good stuff,
the prescription stuff.

355
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,256
My boys will pick it up
at your warehouse

356
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,574
over on 26th.

357
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:38,718
And, Omar...

358
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,347
Don't try and burn me again.

359
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:46,518
Looks like he's got
bigger problems than you.

360
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,937
Guess I'll have to become
a bigger problem, then.

361
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,122
- What are you thinking?
- If that van Vega wants goes missing,

362
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,567
Omar will have to deal
with whoever took it.

363
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,735
And that's you.

364
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,447
Okay, I guess we'll have to get over
to Omar's warehouse.

365
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,879
<i>Because warehouses store bulk items</i>

366
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,870
<i> and not people,
they're usually built</i>

367
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,872
<i>cheaply.
Most of the time, the roofs</i>

368
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,500
<i>are just plywood and asphalt tiles.</i>

369
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:11,960
<i>Attach a hole-saw bit</i>

370
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,796
<i>to a silenced drill,
and you can bore</i>

371
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,334
<i>through the roof
without attracting attention.</i>

372
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:33,314
<i>If you want a bigger opening,</i>

373
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,649
<i>a few ounces of C-4</i>

374
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,798
<i>on the brackets holding
the door in place will do the trick.</i>

375
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:45,965
All set, Mike.

376
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,993
You'll be able to stroll right in.

377
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:51,967
<i>We got a visitor.</i>

378
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:53,501
It's Gilroy

379
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:55,545
in a Maserati up the block.

380
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:57,964
What is he doing here?

381
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,327
Getting to know me.

382
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:01,634
I guess I'll have to
put on a good show.

383
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,361
<i>Dominance in the battlefield
isn't always</i>

384
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,484
<i>about the use of a lethal force.</i>

385
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,743
<i>Sometimes it's more effective to leave
a few targets around to spread the word.</i>

386
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,294
<i>Rubber-composite bullets
fired from a suppressed rifle</i>

387
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,046
<i>won't kill your enemy.</i>

388
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,889
<i>But it will make them think twice
about staying in the fight.</i>

389
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:51,476
What do you want?

390
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,645
- I'm here for the van.
- What van?

391
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,241
That one.

392
00:22:30,814 --> 00:22:34,435
Selling yourself to an adversary
is a bit like getting drafted

393
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,104
on a sports team.
You may look

394
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,816
good on paper, but, eventually,
they'll want to see you on the field.

395
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,199
Why the hell are you following me?

396
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,015
Just curious about where
that van of yours is headed.

397
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,782
I told you,
I have to get to know you.

398
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,621
You can do that without compromising

399
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,748
- my operations.
- I had to see you in action.

400
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:58,489
And I have to say,
you've lived up to your reputation.

401
00:22:58,614 --> 00:22:59,503
Such panache.

402
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:02,171
I love the suit.
Who are you wearing?

403
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,660
You're awfully confident
I won't shoot you right here.

404
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:05,785
Don't be.

405
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,110
I'm just not that afraid
of rubber bullets.

406
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:10,596
You were awfully gentle
with those chaps at the warehouse.

407
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,503
I was as gentle as I had to be.

408
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,686
I can't have a homicide detective
poking around.

409
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,354
Fair enough.

410
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,010
Is that why you were following me?
To compliment me on my suit

411
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:22,817
and ask me stupid questions?

412
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,192
I came to see if you're the person
I'd like to work with,

413
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:26,779
and it appears that you are.

414
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,865
I'm glad you like what you saw.

415
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:32,096
I have a little project
that may interest you.

416
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:33,325
I'll be in touch.

417
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:38,082
By the way,

418
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,848
- who is the van for?
- I don't kiss and tell.

419
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,320
Good to know.

420
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,760
Jesus, I've been calling you.

421
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,178
I threw my phone away.

422
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,306
I think Gilroy used my phone
to triangulate my position.

423
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:54,570
He's good.

424
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,350
I got that phone two days ago.

425
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,810
What did he want?

426
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,054
To see if I was the same
kind of monster he is.

427
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,897
Apparently, I am.

428
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,104
No, you're not.

429
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:06,069
But if you fake it long enough...

430
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,905
You don't have to worry about me.

431
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,561
Look, I know you want to stop
whatever he's planning,

432
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:13,785
but can't we just shoot him
and get on with our lives?

433
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,753
Gilroy does work for hire.

434
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,123
He's the tip of a very nasty iceberg.
It doesn't end with him.

435
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,377
- <i>Is Mikey there?</i>
- He's here.

436
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,111
He was looking for you, too.

437
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:33,726
<i>I've been monitoring the fallout
from your warehouse stunt.</i>

438
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:36,077
<i>Omar's pretty freaked
about his missing van.</i>

439
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:38,810
I guess it's time to see
if he's ready to help us find Rincon.

440
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:41,434
<i>He's at the botanica on 17th.</i>

441
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:45,936
Omar.

442
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:51,197
I want the van! Now!
Where is it?

443
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,006
I can tell you where it will be.

444
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:55,660
In your driveway
when you give me Rincon.

445
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,119
I'm not afraid of you, man.

446
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,370
You may have some fancy little tricks,
but you're still flesh and blood.

447
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,542
And believe me,
I know how to make you bleed.

448
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:05,061
You touch me,
and your whole world comes apart.

449
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:06,587
I'm not talking about your car.

450
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,591
Your house on East 18th Street,
your stores on River Drive,

451
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,759
you.

452
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:14,888
There won't be a place
on this Earth that you can hide.

453
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:17,385
You give me Rincon,

454
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,642
and I'll disappear.

455
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:22,023
I need a few hours.

456
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:36,171
You're not packing my ice babies,
are you?

457
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:38,184
No, Maddy.
Those are staying behind.

458
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,164
Good, 'cause you destroyed half
my winter wonderland collection

459
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,540
when you blew my house.

460
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,375
Come on,
I thought we were past that.

461
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,919
We are.
I was just pulling your chain.

462
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,462
The truth is,

463
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:50,457
I was thinking
about replacing them anyway,

464
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,717
so it really didn't matter
what you did with them.

465
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:54,552
I mean, seriously,

466
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,470
why would I hold this against you?

467
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:57,972
You talked to Mack?

468
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:06,355
Your marriage had been over for years
before he ever said a word to your wife.

469
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,887
There's a code, Madeline.

470
00:26:08,012 --> 00:26:10,359
You don't sit
in another man's canoe, period.

471
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,361
We're not talking about a boat, Sam.

472
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,448
And I'm not talking about some creepy
ice-skating figurine, either.

473
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,824
You let her go.

474
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:20,745
Was she supposed to be miserable the rest
of her life? He took very good care of her.

475
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:26,707
And I told you to stay out of it.

476
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:29,503
You want to be like that? Fine.

477
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,221
You still owe me
an ice-skating snowman.

478
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,008
<i>The best defense isn't always
a show of force.</i>

479
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:41,326
<i>Keep an adversary in the dark
about what you're capable of,</i>

480
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:43,642
<i>and he has to assume the worst.</i>

481
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:44,817
Jesus! Man!

482
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:49,649
We looked for your guy.

483
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,167
You found Rincon.

484
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,735
I found him.
You know how protected he is?

485
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:56,355
You had three hours
to give me Rincon,

486
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:57,990
not give me excuses.

487
00:26:58,355 --> 00:26:59,997
You thought
you were so smart, right?

488
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:01,977
Stealing that van that Vega wanted?

489
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:03,325
Guess what.

490
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,331
That's who's protecting Rincon.

491
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,874
They're business partners.

492
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,293
Rincon's been supplying Vega
with drugs for years.

493
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,213
- He's gonna give up that connection?
- Let me worry about that.

494
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,970
I got to worry about it.

495
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:16,175
Me and Vega are this close
to going to war already.

496
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,593
If he founds out, man...

497
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,887
Look, I ain't afraid to die, okay?

498
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:21,681
But my people...

499
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,771
Vega will go after everybody.

500
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:24,976
If you don't give me

501
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,276
what I want,

502
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:29,063
Vega will be the least
of your worries.

503
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,699
Rincon's hiding in an abandoned
housing project on West 15th, unit 402.

504
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:42,125
He's got some of Vega's guys
with him.

505
00:27:43,514 --> 00:27:44,537
You better hurry.

506
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:48,499
And you better pray
Vega doesn't find out!

507
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,647
<i>When you're extracting
a heavily guarded target,</i>

508
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:08,185
<i>it's important to choose
the right entry point.</i>

509
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,563
<i>Guards watch windows and doors.</i>

510
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,068
<i>So if you come in through the common
wall of a neighboring apartment,</i>

511
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,945
<i>you've got surprise on your side,</i>

512
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,449
<i>not to mention a shower
of shattered concrete.</i>

513
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,788
- What is it?
- It's a little too quiet in there.

514
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:33,458
And a little too quiet
out there, too.

515
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:35,379
<i>Of course,</i>

516
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,197
<i>surprise doesn't count for much
if you're walking into a trap.</i>

517
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,552
Looks like Vega decided
to crash the party.

518
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,601
We got guys
coming up the stairs.

519
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,978
I hope you brought enough rope, Sam.

520
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,106
<i>Traditional rappelling requires
holding a rope with both hands,</i>

521
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,443
<i>which is inconvenient
if you're being shot at.</i>

522
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:01,364
<i>That's why special forces are trained
to rappel in unconventional ways.</i>

523
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:24,720
Get down!

524
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,980
It was a goddamn setup.

525
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:54,154
- Your boy Omar almost got us killed.
- That doesn't make any sense.

526
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,700
He hates Vega.
Just calm down.

527
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,837
The hell I will.
Omar sold us out.

528
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,605
That's funny,
you talking about betrayal.

529
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:02,758
Fight and get it over with

530
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,386
or put a sock in it.
You're gonna want to hear this.

531
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,022
I've been listening to the bug in Omar's
car. Vega Tried to kill him, too.

532
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,017
<i>God damn it!</i>

533
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:12,952
<i>Get down!</i>

534
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,520
<i>Jesus, Omar, you're bleeding!</i>

535
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,938
<i>Drive, man! Go!</i>

536
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:18,941
He got clipped in the arm.
I hope I screamed less last time.

537
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,861
Vega found out
Omar was looking for Rincon.

538
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,570
He nearly got killed because of us.

539
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:26,407
And Vega's probably not gonna stop
until he finishes the job.

540
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,326
I can't believe I'm saying this
about a gangbanger,

541
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,832
but we ought to do something
to help Omar.

542
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,971
Man, you got some balls coming here.

543
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:51,515
You shouldn't point guns at friends.

544
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,642
- Now you my friend?
- I can be.

545
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,644
Man, we almost got killed
because of you!

546
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,855
Vega's got guys
looking all over for us!

547
00:30:58,054 --> 00:30:59,982
He's gonna tear up
the whole neighborhood.

548
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:01,734
I should have shot you
while I could.

549
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,358
You shoot me,
you'll still have a problem with Vega.

550
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:07,323
You don't,
Vega will have a problem with me.

551
00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:09,409
You don't know
what you're talking about.

552
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,740
Vega and Rincon...

553
00:31:10,865 --> 00:31:13,162
They're gonna take Miami apart
until they find you.

554
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,665
Why don't I save them the trouble?
I want you to take me to them.

555
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,001
I will finish this for both of us.

556
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,419
Man, you crazy.

557
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:21,885
Hear me out.

558
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,255
Inside.

559
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:27,009
- Now.
- Wait, wait, wait.

560
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:31,875
All right.

561
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:34,808
Just don't do nothing.

562
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,851
I give him you. That's not enough?

563
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:46,946
I gotta give him
my whole damn neighborhood?

564
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,064
Vega has to believe he's won.

565
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:51,180
I don't know about this, man.

566
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:54,328
He's gonna want to meet on my territory,
make a big show.

567
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,796
You want him to.

568
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:58,209
He just has a few guys
with guns on his side.

569
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,292
You have a whole neighborhood
on yours.

570
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,669
And when we get inside?

571
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,089
Vega's gonna lock down that place tight.
He won't let any of my boys in with us.

572
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,383
It's just you and me.

573
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,169
If everything goes right,

574
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,011
you and me is all we need.

575
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:12,687
I leave with Rincon.

576
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:14,265
You leave with Vega.

577
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,392
Are you ready to end this or not?

578
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,437
I'm ready.

579
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:24,325
<i>Camouflage is commonly associated
with jungle warfare.</i>

580
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,960
<i>But the truth is that it's just
as important in urban settings.</i>

581
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:29,460
<i>You're bound to draw attention</i>

582
00:32:29,585 --> 00:32:31,740
<i>setting up a bulletproof barricade
on the sidewalk</i>

583
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:34,915
<i>or toting a concussion charge
down the street.</i>

584
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,664
<i>But fruit stands reinforced
with strips of steel-belted tires</i>

585
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,959
<i>and ice-cream carts
packed with explosives</i>

586
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:43,735
<i>blend right in.</i>

587
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:47,821
<i>Of course, the ultimate trojan horse
is a shackled prisoner.</i>

588
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:49,800
Where have you been hiding these?

589
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,251
<i>A paranoid enemy might go so far
as frisking a hostage</i>

590
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:07,076
<i>who's wearing handcuffs,</i>

591
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,870
<i>but people tend not to check
if one of the handcuff links</i>

592
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:12,573
<i>is made of polystyrene...</i>

593
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,734
<i>Or if there's a listening device
in the pinlock.</i>

594
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,306
He's clean.

595
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,266
Welcome to my neighborhood, Omar.

596
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,484
Now, everyone said
the people in your neighborhood

597
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:44,156
were so loyal.

598
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:46,148
I don't see them here.

599
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:47,804
You know,

600
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:50,610
when you started sticking your nose
in my business,

601
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,365
I figured you were up to something.

602
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,448
So I grabbed one of your guys.

603
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,266
One hour with my knife,

604
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:59,370
he started spilling everything.

605
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,588
That's all you get for loyalty.

606
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,290
One hour.

607
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:06,126
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- You disappoint me.

608
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,535
Everyone said,

609
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:10,585
"Omar will go down
in a blaze of glory!"

610
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:14,051
One little scratch on your arm,

611
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,178
and you come crying to me
like a bitch

612
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,638
to kiss my ring.

613
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:20,933
I think we just had a misunderstanding,
that's all.

614
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,451
Misunderstanding?

615
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:25,035
I like that.

616
00:34:26,115 --> 00:34:28,421
Let's get this misunderstanding
cleared up right now.

617
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:29,775
Show me your mystery man!

618
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:34,015
Vamanos.

619
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,720
So, we cool?

620
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:43,215
Cool?

621
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:46,475
Cool?
You think one freak in a suit

622
00:34:47,175 --> 00:34:48,644
is gonna make things even?

623
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:50,212
Let me tell you something.

624
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,798
In my kingdom,
peace don't come cheap.

625
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:53,966
Today,

626
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:55,902
I'll take your neighborhood.

627
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:56,927
Tomorrow,

628
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,345
I'll take your woman.

629
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,125
It's a new world, Omar.
Get used to it.

630
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,933
Get these putos inside.

631
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,101
Come on.

632
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:06,478
The rest of you stay out here.
If they want some,

633
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:08,037
shoot them.

634
00:35:24,025 --> 00:35:25,025
So...

635
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:26,855
Who are you?

636
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,379
I asked you a question.

637
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,756
Who are you?

638
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,115
You'll find out soon enough.

639
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,391
Are you a cop?

640
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:46,615
A cop?

641
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:48,270
You're not that lucky.

642
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:54,785
Answers.

643
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:56,445
Tell me,

644
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:59,531
what kind of man comes looking for me
dressed in a suit like that?

645
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,074
What kind of man?

646
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:03,708
What kind of man preys on children?

647
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:09,806
Did that bitch who brought
those charges against me send you?

648
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:14,922
She was always whining
about her kid.

649
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,000
Tell me who you are,

650
00:36:21,905 --> 00:36:23,905
or I will make this so painful

651
00:36:24,735 --> 00:36:26,768
that you will beg for mercy,

652
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,228
and it will not come.

653
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,296
You don't know what pain is.

654
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:35,485
But you will,

655
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,194
I promise.

656
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:40,955
Don't look at them.

657
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,257
They'll see what you really are.

658
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:47,275
Coward.

659
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:51,585
Go to hell.

660
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:52,985
Come with me.

661
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:30,525
Welcome to my neighborhood.

662
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,672
I made you a promise.

663
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,175
It's time.

664
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,129
Miami PD is transporting Rincon
back to Houston.

665
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:50,335
He's lucky he's not going back
in a body bag.

666
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:54,320
You know, you and your friends
got a strange way of doing things,

667
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:56,395
but I guess I can't complain.

668
00:37:57,785 --> 00:37:59,035
Thank you, Sam.

669
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:07,435
About Amanda.

670
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:09,703
Just wanted to say...

671
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,525
Thanks for taking care of her.

672
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,837
I was never real good about doing that.
I guess...

673
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:21,214
the mission always came first.

674
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:25,552
For what it's worth,
she left me, too.

675
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,514
Don't think she ever got over you.

676
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:31,685
Who could?

677
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,897
- You ever need anything...
- I'll let you know.

678
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:45,739
You feel like having a beer?

679
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,240
Come on.

680
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:52,745
So, a lot of people are asking
about the guy in the suit.

681
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:55,403
I don't know what to tell them.

682
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:59,145
I'm just the guy that helped you
get back on top, that's all.

683
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:03,191
Still can't figure you out, man.

684
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:05,215
Honestly, Omar...

685
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:07,655
Don't try.

686
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:28,271
- Thanks for coming.
- Shut up.

687
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:29,992
There's something
that I have to say.

688
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,934
You want me backing you up
on more of these little Gilroy meetings,

689
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,664
then you're gonna hear me out,
right here, right now,

690
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,052
in another one
of these little wasted hotel rooms.

691
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:40,377
You are gonna get yourself killed.

692
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,595
You're gonna wind up dead.

693
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:47,052
I'm not dead yet.

694
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:50,746
You know, I have more ammunition
in this case than I need.

695
00:39:51,295 --> 00:39:54,224
You want to be quiet,
or you want me to start using it?

696
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,321
Sam doesn't agree with me.

697
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,910
And I didn't want
to worry your mother.

698
00:40:03,035 --> 00:40:06,135
Otherwise, this would be
a full-scale intervention.

699
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:08,675
You...

700
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,700
work...

701
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,116
too hard.

702
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:16,121
I appreciate what you did
finding Rincon.

703
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:20,042
There's a part of me that understands
what you're doing with Gilroy.

704
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,360
But that cannot be
what you do all day, every day.

705
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:26,548
You cannot keep burning the candle
at both ends, Michael!

706
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:30,514
How do you expect to stay focused
when you exhaust yourself like this?

707
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:32,835
You need a life...

708
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:37,095
Or you're gonna wind up dead.
It's just basic operational sense.

709
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:38,602
Are you finished?

710
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:41,795
Sure.

711
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,065
Fine.

712
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:00,040
Where do you want me?

713
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:06,625
How about right here?

714
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,591
Gilroy...

715
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:12,570
said he would call here...

716
00:41:15,315 --> 00:41:17,965
for the place and the time
of our meeting.

717
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,371
He said he would call here

718
00:41:21,475 --> 00:41:22,825
tomorrow morning.

719
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,985
- Did you ask me here to...
- Like I said,

720
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:31,196
I'm not dead yet.

721
00:41:55,605 --> 00:41:56,605
Hello?

722
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:58,475
<i>Good morning, Westen.</i>

723
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,010
Gilroy, you're up early.

724
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:03,135
<i>As are you.</i>

725
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,986
<i>Surprising, given what a busy boy
you've been lately.</i>

726
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:07,904
No need to be coy.

727
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:09,982
I hear there was
a certain transfer of power

728
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,936
in a certain section
of little Dominica

729
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:14,640
that a certain someone
had a role in facilitating.

730
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,145
I wouldn't know about that.

731
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,451
<i>You really don't kiss and tell,
do you?</i>

732
00:42:18,576 --> 00:42:20,453
Since you're up,
any chance we can have a chat?

733
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,071
I'd love to, but...

734
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,215
<i>But you have
a more pressing engagement?</i>

735
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:27,395
You could say that.

736
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:29,081
<i>Don't keep me waiting.</i>

737
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:31,089
- So we're in business?
- <i>Yes, we are.</i>

738
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,557
And there's lots of work to be done.
