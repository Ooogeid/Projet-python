1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:03,896
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:07,177
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:12,265
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,812
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,269
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:19,314
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,609
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:25,570
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,448
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

10
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,825
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,035
Family, too...

12
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,244
Is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:34,329
If you're desperate.

14
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,455
Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,458
Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,045
you're not going anywhere.

17
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:47,914
<i>One of the reasons
surveillance is done in teams</i>

18
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,515
<i>is that it's exhausting.</i>

19
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:52,869
<i>Sitting in a car, remaining constantly
alert while you watch a mailbox</i>

20
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,016
<i>will knock you out
like a handful of sleeping pills.</i>

21
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:59,521
<i>Doing it in shifts is the only way
to make sure you don't miss something.</i>

22
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,191
- Your turn.
- What?

23
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:09,731
Five minutes?

24
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,325
Five minutes, your eyeballs are tired?

25
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,994
You should be happy I'm still here.

26
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:17,414
Four hours parked in a hot car,

27
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:19,940
'cause this may be
the post office box used

28
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,710
by one of the people who burned you?

29
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,562
Carla's not just
one of the people who burned me.

30
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:26,005
She's all I've got.

31
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,633
Are you sure the manager said today?

32
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:32,589
He said the mail for this box
is picked up every wednesday.

33
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:37,997
Did I tell you that
I despise surveillance?

34
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:42,141
Only every time we do it.

35
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:53,867
Here we go.

36
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,960
If that's Carla,
that's one hell of a disguise.

37
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,513
Carla's not the type
to collect her own mail.

38
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,429
<i>Tailing a trained operative</i>

39
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,053
<i>requires a number of
time-consuming preparations...</i>

40
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:18,300
<i>everything from acquiring a vehicle
they can't recognize or trace</i>

41
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:22,185
<i>to familiarizing yourself
with all the local traffic patterns.</i>

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,970
Go ahead, turn the car on.

43
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:29,356
Turn it on.

44
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:32,888
There you go.
Now put it in drive.

45
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:34,065
Drive!

46
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:39,032
<i>Of course, since you can never
be sure who's a trained op,</i>

47
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:41,832
<i>there's always the chance
you'll take all those precautions</i>

48
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:44,549
<i>just to follow a secretary
back to her cubicle.</i>

49
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:02,100
That's Carla's building?

50
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:03,811
No guards, no camera?

51
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:08,274
You really think Carla
would work out of there?

52
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,204
Security comes
in all shapes and sizes, babe

53
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,583
Hungry?

54
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:23,566
<i>Covert security
is designed to blend in.</i>

55
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:26,792
<i>People you never notice...
until you see them in action.</i>

56
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,064
<i>That means you have two choices.</i>

57
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:31,745
<i>You can sit and wait
for an incident to occur,</i>

58
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,975
<i>or you can create your own incident.</i>

59
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:37,966
- Hello?
- <i>Yo, bro, got your grub. I'm out front.</i>

60
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:41,015
I'll come down and meet you
in the lobby, but you can't park there.

61
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:43,426
- <i>This okay?</i>

62
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:45,353
No, man. That's even worse.

63
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:47,788
<i>Oh, man. You got to be kidding me.</i>

64
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,484
Whoa! Where you going?
Go back.

65
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:55,864
Dude! Dude, you are just asking
for a ticket parking there.

66
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,535
<i>You know what, buddy.
I really don't have time for this.</i>

67
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:03,086
Sorry, man, I'm just trying to help.
You know what?

68
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:05,915
Just pull around the back and go down
the alley. I'll meet you there.

69
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,408
All right. Just make it quick.

70
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,481
I think we found Carla.

71
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:15,507
<i>Subbers in Black</i>

00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:16,467

74
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:24,571
Hey, Mikey.

75
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,580
Look at that. That looks good.

76
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:33,529
So, I pulled the building records and
lease docs for that address you gave me

77
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,644
for Carla's little
irrigation consulting company.

78
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:39,013
- Anything good?
- Mm-Hmm.

79
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,700
Office is right there.

80
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,021
Second floor, east end. But it's gonna
be tough getting in there unseen.

81
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,373
Need to find if security has a routine.
Maybe there's a chink in the armor.

82
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,387
Wireless webcam
might get what you need,

83
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:51,438
but you got to figure out
how to get it in place.

84
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,838
You think you could find a setup
with a strong enough signal?

85
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:56,049
I don't know. Maybe later today
if I have time.

86
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,384
- Nice watch.
- Thank you. It's a Panerai.

87
00:04:58,727 --> 00:04:59,975
Ferrari version.

88
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,672
I think they prefer
to call them "timepieces."

89
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:06,321
Anyway, Veronica got us his-and-hers
for our anniversary.

90
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:09,210
Apparently, it's been a whole month
since we both said "I love you."

91
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,267
For that, you get an $8,000 watch?

92
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:12,937
And some other things.

93
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,791
You Michael?

94
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:26,986
No.

95
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:29,103
They said this guy Michael
lives around here.

96
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:32,085
- A lot of people live around here.
- They say he drives a black car, too.

97
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,251
Dodge.

98
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:37,105
Who's "they"?

99
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:40,404
Look, man, I'm not trying to bother you.
It's just that...

100
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:42,110
All right, here's the deal.

101
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,097
I just got out of prison
a couple months ago.

102
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:45,487
I had a cellmate in there,

103
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:48,065
he had a pretty sweet scam going on.
Cops couldn't touch him.

104
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:50,728
This guy Michael comes along,
blows his whole operation up.

105
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:53,136
That's the kind of friend
I need.

106
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,190
Name's Trevor.

107
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,113
You got the wrong guy.

108
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,384
- At least hear my problem.
- Sorry.

109
00:05:58,504 --> 00:05:59,454
Wait, man.

110
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:03,741
Go home.

111
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:17,767
Please.

112
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,310
60 seconds. Go.

113
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:23,621
Okay, all right.

114
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,056
I got a... I got a reputation
in certain circles as a...

115
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,010
expediter of getaways.

116
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,936
- Wheelman.
- I do more than that.

117
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:34,431
I find the right car,
modify it as necessary,

118
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,034
get rid of it clean,
plus I plan the escape route.

119
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:38,949
You're an expediter.
No, I used to be.

120
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,115
See, last time I was in prison,
I saw the light, man.

121
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,360
I decided to turn my life around.

122
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,515
I got my G.E.D.,
I got certified as a mechanic,

123
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:46,574
and now I'm trying to stay clean,
no matter what.

124
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:47,519
30 seconds.

125
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,287
Problem is,
I got this boss named Timo.

126
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,993
He runs this crew that I used
to work with a few times.

127
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,041
- Pick it up.
- They're planning a jewel heist.

128
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:57,064
It's going down during this
trade show that's coming up.

129
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,588
Tell them you can't do it.

130
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,035
I did. I even offered
to find them a replacement.

131
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:04,455
Timo likes to work with the same people
he knows, especially during big jobs.

132
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,711
He told me he would feel
personally betrayed

133
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,245
- if I didn't come through with this.
- Sure he'll get over it.

134
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:11,780
You don't know Timo.
That's his way of saying "Do it or die."

135
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,329
Can you leave town for a while?
Not without violating my parole.

136
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:17,599
I got to stay in the state
for the next five months.

137
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:18,574
Time's up.

138
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:21,744
You have two options. Go to the police,
tell them everything you just told me...

139
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:23,029
Timo'll kill my family.

140
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,367
- They have witness protection.
- Yeah, right.

141
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,258
Or you do the job.
Don't get caught.

142
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:29,328
Either way,
I can't help you.

143
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:31,719
I got emeralds, man.
These are real.

144
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:33,998
You can get 15 grand easy,
and it's clean.

145
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:37,293
- I got a 2-carat diamond ring.
- Trevor, I heard you out.

146
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,046
- Now you need to walk away.
- I got a son, man.

147
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,454
He was born while I was locked up.

148
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,185
- Sorry to hear that.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

149
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:51,627
I just want you to understand
where I'm coming from.

150
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:54,644
I made a promise to my boy
that I was done with that life.

151
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:57,187
And I ain't breaking that promise.

152
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:04,904
Come on.

153
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,965
<i>Criminal hideouts
tend to be pretty nondescript.</i>

154
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:14,497
<i>Underground caves and
spooky, old mansions are dramatic,</i>

155
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:17,430
<i>but a boathouse on the Keys
is easier to find.</i>

156
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,772
Well, your boy Trevor...

157
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:21,589
he's running with some pretty
impressive company. I mean,...

158
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,116
every name he gave you...

159
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,829
first-round pick if you were
drafting your own crew.

160
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,218
- What'd he say the job was?
- He didn't.

161
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,680
He knows it's jewels, but
he doesn't know where or when.

162
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,391
This guy Timo likes
to keep details to himself.

163
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:36,822
Here we go.

164
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:42,640
C.J.
Mr. Slickster from Jersey.

165
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,737
Arrested up and down the East Coast.

166
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,112
Fraud, embezzlement.

167
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,864
Nothing recent.

168
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:53,300
Now, this big guy's the safecracker.

169
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,570
Gilbert Kessler,
one of the best.

170
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:56,933
Any record?

171
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,611
He rung up three DUIs
in the last two years,

172
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:02,044
so, technically, he's not even
supposed to be driving.

173
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,589
Okay, here's a doozy.

174
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,636
Kandi, originally from California.

175
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:12,236
Assault and battery,

176
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,681
assault and battery,

177
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,394
assault with a deadly weapon.

178
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:19,770
Her and Fiona would have a good time
or, you know, kill each other.

179
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:23,524
Oh, and this must be Timo.

180
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:27,834
Suspect in most of the bigger unsolved
heists in the Greater Miami area.

181
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:31,032
Only arrested once.

182
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,618
- And...
- The only witness was murdered.

183
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:35,536
So, you got a plan yet?

184
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,748
The best way to help Trevor
is to get the job called off.

185
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,527
But you don't even know
what it is.

186
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,579
- I'm hoping that won't matter.
- How's that?

187
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,545
Crew like this runs like
a well-oiled machine.

188
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:47,548
Somebody gets in trouble with the police
and the machine stops working.

189
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,718
I'm telling you, I think the safecracker
Gilbert could be your guy.

190
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,333
His probation has
a no-drinking restriction,

191
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:56,265
so you get him pulled over
after one beer, it's jail time.

192
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:00,519
Fi, would you like
to make a new friend?

193
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:01,998
He's a safearacker.

194
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,311
I'm hoping you can convince him
to have a drink with you.

195
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:05,781
Good-looking guy.

196
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,183
Is this seat taken?

197
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:23,167
No, uh, sit down.

198
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,543
Bring us your best champagne.

199
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,550
Fifi.

200
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,349
Gilbert.

201
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:35,679
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

202
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:40,724
Somebody has to toast with me.

203
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,214
What are you celebrating?

204
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,184
Why, you and me,
of course.

205
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:50,679
I get it.

206
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,324
This is a sales speech.

207
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,895
You're an escort.

208
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:59,213
I don't drink,
and I don't pay to play either.

209
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,736
Enjoy the champagne.

210
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:03,419
<i>When you're looking
to get somebody arrested,</i>

211
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,702
<i>bad guys can't always
be counted on</i>

212
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:08,072
<i>to commit crimes
on your schedule.</i>

213
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:15,101
<i>Sometimes you have to give them
a little push.</i>

214
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:20,308
What the hell are you doing?
That's my table.

215
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,935
I've been waiting for an hour
for my special table.

216
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:24,603
What?!
Don't you "what" me.

217
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:26,769
Get your ass out of here.

218
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:28,899
- Don't touch me, buddy.
- I just did.

219
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:31,819
There I go again
and again and ag...

220
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:35,698
<i>Once you've got a crime in progress,
you can let the authorities take over.</i>

221
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,873
<i>That assumes, of course, that
the authorities are paying attention.</i>

222
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:46,959
Is that the best you got?

223
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:49,045
Come on!
Come on, big guy.

224
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:50,629
So you want a lot more, huh?

225
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,392
Come on!
You fight like a girl!

226
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,436
- Really?
- Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey!

227
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,988
Police! Somebody!
He's killing that guy!

228
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:33,249
Timo called.

229
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:36,019
Gilbert's in jail,
but the job's still on.

230
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,845
You said if Timo lost his safecracker,
the job would be off.

231
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:42,064
I know. Any other time,
he would have called it off.

232
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:43,170
What did he say?

233
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,579
he said he'd been working
this angle for the last two years,

234
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,671
and it was too big a score
to let Gilbert ruin it.

235
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,727
He's trying to track down
some guy from Georgia.

236
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:53,389
Here, I'm thinking, if I try to do the
right thing, I might just catch a break.

237
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,859
Who was I fooling?

238
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:58,093
There's another way
we can get the job called off.

239
00:12:58,213 --> 00:13:00,181
- How?
- Find out the target, tip them off.

240
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,420
Timo's already on edge.
I start asking questions now...

241
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,539
No, no, no, no.

242
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,543
You stay focused on making Timo
think you're a team player.

243
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:09,041
- I'll ask the questions.
- Wait. What?

244
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:13,290
Taking Gilbert out
didn't get the job called off,

245
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,944
but it did create
a job opening.

246
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,163
Now, you call Timo.

247
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,060
You tell him that you found
a safecracker who's local.

248
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,613
- Who, you?
- Yeah.

249
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,447
You crack safes? 'Cause Timo's
not gonna take my word for it.

250
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,290
Just... just make the call.

251
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,519
Tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.
I've got some things to do tonight.

252
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,274
<i>You can't stop a door alarm
from going off,</i>

253
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:39,748
<i>but you can explain it.</i>

254
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:42,783
<i>Leave a few cigarette butts
on the ground and anybody coming by</i>

255
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,217
<i>will assume someone was just
sneaking a smoke break.</i>

256
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,977
I'm on the roof across
from Carla's building, Sam.

257
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,708
- <i>Are you ready?</i>
- Give me one second here.

258
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:54,168
<i>24/7 surveillance on a location</i>

259
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:56,592
<i>used to require
a full team of operatives.</i>

260
00:13:56,712 --> 00:14:00,626
<i>These days, you can get by with
a webcam and wireless signal booster</i>

261
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:02,804
<i>from your local electronics store.</i>

262
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:07,049
<i>Ideally, you'd drill holes
and mount it on brackets,</i>

263
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:08,826
<i>but when time is an issue,</i>

264
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,738
<i>I prefer dental putty.</i>

265
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:13,239
<i>Easy to mix, easy to apply,</i>

266
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,483
<i>and strong as cement when it hardens.</i>

267
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,100
<i>But it hardens quick...</i>

268
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,585
How's it looking, Sam?

269
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:21,355
<i>... so you better aim right
the first time.</i>

270
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,068
Hello, Carla!

271
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,441
We're in business, Mikey.

272
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:26,701
You getting out clean?

273
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:35,123
Sounds like building security's
getting curious. Call you back.

274
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:46,276
<i>Making yourself invisible
when you need to</i>

275
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,850
<i>is a crucial skill
for a covert operative.</i>

276
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,070
<i>It sounds exotic, but it's not
like there's a supersecret move</i>

277
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,701
<i>they teach you at spy school</i>

278
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:55,949
<i>that allows you to vanish
into think air.</i>

279
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:58,970
<i>Often it's just a matter
of quick thinking, fast feet,</i>

280
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:00,815
<i>and strong fingers.</i>

281
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:04,258
Hey, Mikey.

282
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,578
Hurry up.
I got good news.

283
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:09,157
Good news?
I could use some good news.

284
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:12,557
I think I found a gap in the
security at Carla's building.

285
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:16,185
I'm telling you, Mikey, sometimes
I surprise myself. It's beautiful.

286
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:18,440
I did a little editing
on the surveillance tape.

287
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,672
Check this out.

288
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,429
I time-lapsed the footage here,

289
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:23,551
just to see if there's
any kind of a routine,

290
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:26,336
But the maintenance man and the
gardener don't really have one.

291
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:29,396
They patrol in random intervals,
so the best you could do is guess.

292
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:31,308
- Waiting for the good part, Sam.
- Coming.

293
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:34,606
Okay, about 3:45,
night security gets there.

294
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:38,087
And before they switch over, everyone
goes around back for about five minutes,

295
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:40,234
I'm guessing, for some kind of debrief.

296
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:41,904
During that time,

297
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:44,392
the only guy watching the front

298
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:46,445
is the old man at the coffee shop.

299
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:48,117
Still waiting for the good news.

300
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,900
Because grandpa can't walk
the place like he works there,

301
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,336
any time somebody heads down
that side alley,

302
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:56,542
he takes a little stroll
and that is our window.

303
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,799
- Nice work, Sam.
- Thanks, Mike.

304
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,817
I'd love to bask in the glory,
but I got my big

305
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,552
"One month since we said
'I love you'" celebration.

306
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,426
Sammy's gettin'
some hammy tonight.

307
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,630
I keep pinching myself

308
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,085
to make sure I'm not dreaming.

309
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,236
I just can't believe how happy I am.

310
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:20,138
We are on a nice
little roll here.

311
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:21,308
It's like...

312
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,443
I've waited for you
to show up for my entire life,

313
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:26,936
and now I finally...

314
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:30,868
I sound like such a teenager.

315
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:34,429
Well, you've got the body
of a teenager. You...

316
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:36,699
You might as well sound like one.

317
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,765
You are so sweet...

318
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,587
And you make me feel so good.

319
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:44,089
Hey, pumpkin, you know
this isn't just a one-way street.

320
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,924
Look, I've been
all over the world.

321
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,054
I've known a lot of women.

322
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,706
So when I tell you,

323
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,351
without a doubt,

324
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,571
you are one in a million...

325
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:00,313
... you can believe it, Roni.

326
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:06,253
Marry me.

327
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,056
How about that, huh?

328
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:13,626
There's a question.

329
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,422
<i>Safecracking skills are a basic part
of espionage training.</i>

330
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:23,214
<i>Spies steal secrets,
and people keep their secrets in safes.</i>

331
00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:25,670
<i>But staying current with safearacking</i>

332
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,727
<i>is a little like staying current
with computers.</i>

333
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,300
<i>New model every year.</i>

334
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:31,945
<i>Bottom line... </i>

335
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,765
<i>If you want to breach a safe,
you have to practice.</i>

336
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:48,495
Fi...

337
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,157
I was one number away
from the combination.

338
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:54,952
The last one's
always the same. C4.

339
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,057
Always easier
to just blow it.

340
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,601
You really think
he's gonna test you?

341
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:04,211
Probably.
He's a control freak.

342
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:07,886
At the very least,
I need to make it sound good.

343
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:10,130
Oh, you've been out of the game
a while, Michael.

344
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,800
There are all kinds
of new toys nowadays.

345
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:15,764
That looks like
it would leave a mess.

346
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:20,459
You're such a snob when it comes
to manipulation techniques.

347
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,329
On a real heist,

348
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:24,523
they're overrated and impractical.

349
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,175
You don't like it
because it takes patience.

350
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:29,577
I won't deny that I prefer...

351
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:32,531
a power tool.

352
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:37,578
Hello?

353
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:39,128
Yeah, Trev?

354
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:41,176
Just let me know when.

355
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:44,835
Timo is ready to meet.

356
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:52,486
<i>A criminal cover I.D.</i>

357
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:54,900
<i>isn't just about a new name
and phone number.</i>

358
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,016
<i>It's about fitting into a culture
with its own rules and hierarchies.</i>

359
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,769
<i>It's a world where bank robbers
are the rock stars,</i>

360
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:04,137
<i>con artists are the snobs,</i>

361
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,024
<i>car thieves are the blue-collar guys,</i>

362
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,507
<i>and safecrackers are the artists.</i>

363
00:19:09,627 --> 00:19:12,250
I usually work
for safe companies, you know,

364
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,281
when grandma forgets the combination

365
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:17,251
or the bank manager
forgets the security code.

366
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,320
They call the best.

367
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,752
How often do you freelance?

368
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:23,499
Two or three jobs a year,
based on timing and pay.

369
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:25,519
I'm surprised I haven't
heard of you.

370
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,419
I take great pains
not to be heard of.

371
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:31,381
So, what's this safe
we're looking to compromise?

372
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,078
You'll have to bear
with me, Joe.

373
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:33,926
Joseph.

374
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:35,761
Oh, excuse me. Joseph.

375
00:19:36,154 --> 00:19:39,194
Now, I'm sure you have questions,
and you'll get answers, but not yet.

376
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,371
I don't usually work with people
I don't know.

377
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:43,675
So, how about we get to know
each other, huh?

378
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:44,645
Come on.

379
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,428
You just quit.

380
00:19:58,465 --> 00:19:59,910
No cameras to worry about.

381
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,170
Crack it.

382
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:10,777
No.

383
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,123
Excuse me.

384
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:16,802
If you're looking for a guy to crack
a liquor-store safe, I'm not your man.

385
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:18,428
Indulge me.

386
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:22,910
You're gonna shoot me?

387
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:26,603
Last time I checked,
you needed a safecracker.

388
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,072
You know what?

389
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:31,672
Trevor vouched for you.

390
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,673
Crack it now, or he dies.

391
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:37,714
Come on.

392
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:42,202
I want us all to be friends.
Crack the safe... now.

393
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:45,497
You want to see a show,
I need a cup.

394
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:01,444
<i>Anytime you recommend
a friend for a job,</i>

395
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,452
<i>you're on the hook
if things don't work out.</i>

396
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:05,737
<i>In the retail-sales business,
for example,</i>

397
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:08,607
<i>make a bad referral,
and you might get fired.</i>

398
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:11,572
<i>In the armed-robbery business,
on the other hand,</i>

399
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,998
<i>make a bad referral,
and you might get killed.</i>

400
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:17,069
Look a little jumpy, Trevor,
you're not nervous, are you?

401
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:18,604
No.

402
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:21,128
<i>So you really, really have to hope</i>

403
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:23,993
<i>that the new guy knows what he's doing.</i>

404
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,913
Happy?

405
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,230
Nice.

406
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,319
Be at this address. 3:00.

407
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:44,181
Don't touch that.

408
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,892
Don't touch anything.

409
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:54,039
You know Trevor. You already
met Kandi. This is C.J.

410
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,209
Welcome to the family, Joseph.

411
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:01,810
Answer by the third ring,
no matter what.

412
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,654
No excuses.

413
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:07,076
I don't care if you're
in the shower, you answer.

414
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:09,956
Now, sit down. We're gonna
go over a few things.

415
00:22:10,424 --> 00:22:12,584
- We'll be coming in from here.
- Are we breaking in?

416
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:14,378
No, man, it's sweeter than that.

417
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,968
Your concern for secrecy
is admirable, but...

418
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:22,968
I need to know
if there will be people there.

419
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:24,338
We'll handle it.

420
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,234
And where will this affair
be taking place?

421
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:29,610
- You'll find out soon enough.
- Let me put it another way.

422
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,364
If someone screams, will they be heard?

423
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,091
Let me put it this way.

424
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:37,067
I've covered every aspect of this plan,
down to the smallest detail.

425
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,028
All you need to worry about
is cracking the safe.

426
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,990
Fine. Tell me about the safe.

427
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,720
Madison AK series,
class II, composite...

428
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,090
Composite hardplate. And the lock?

429
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:49,778
Ilco 693.

430
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:51,415
Manual combination. That's good.

431
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,709
You'll have 19 minutes.

432
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,126
19 minutes? Hmm.

433
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,388
Oh, it's doable. I'll need
to know other variables, though.

434
00:22:58,508 --> 00:23:00,058
I already told you...

435
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:01,469
We'll cover it!

436
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:03,207
- Let's move on.
- Not so fast.

437
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:04,677
- Question.
- No!

438
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:06,648
No more questions.

439
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:09,306
You know what you need to know.
Now, shut up and listen.

440
00:23:09,426 --> 00:23:12,060
Really, smart guy?
Then, when was it installed?

441
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:15,782
'cause, as you know, Ilco implements
countermeasures every year

442
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:17,508
to stop people like me.

443
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:21,028
So, if I have 19 minutes, I will need
to know what version I'm dealing with.

444
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,531
It was put in two years ago.

445
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:29,401
Great.

446
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,299
Now we can move on.

447
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,999
This meeting is over. Everybody out.

448
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:41,671
Trevor?

449
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,044
You can stay.

450
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:55,319
- Trevor.
- What's up?

451
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,178
You're not answering your phone.

452
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:58,148
Damn it!

453
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:00,118
Oh, I hope Timo didn't call.

454
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,142
I forgot to turn it back on.

455
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:03,542
Why'd he hold you back?

456
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:06,848
I thought I was in trouble. He just
wanted to give me a scatter point.

457
00:24:06,968 --> 00:24:08,297
Timo gives me the location.

458
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,403
I park the vehicles for the crew nearby.

459
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:13,230
Anything goes wrong, we take
separate routes back to the boathouse.

460
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,874
So the heist must be close by.

461
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:18,177
Three jobs I've done with Timo,
he's always given me the location

462
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:21,247
within a half a mile
of the place we're hitting.

463
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:23,116
This might be all the info we need.

464
00:24:23,236 --> 00:24:24,716
- To find the target?
- Maybe.

465
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,367
The vault Timo wants to hit
is very high-end.

466
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:30,003
Outside of banks, there's not
a lot of buildings that would have one.

467
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:32,458
Those things are near indestructible,
so the city makes you get

468
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:34,002
a special permit to put one in.

469
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:36,389
Knowing when it was installed
would narrow it way down.

470
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,383
We can get it down
to about a half-mile radius.

471
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:41,316
- I can give you something by tomorrow.
- You'll know who to tip off by tomorrow

472
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:43,800
so I don't have to get
the backup vehicles.

473
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,806
You need to act "business as usual"
until it's over.

474
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:49,476
- Come on. I better get back there.
- Go.

475
00:24:54,607 --> 00:24:57,340
So, Mikey, uh, you never
asked me about my date.

476
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,121
Oh, how'd your date go?

477
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:00,194
Not real good.

478
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:01,545
I'm sorry to hear that.

479
00:25:02,187 --> 00:25:04,237
She popped the question, buddy.

480
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,142
The marriage question?

481
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:08,301
Yeah, you know it.

482
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:09,719
And you said?

483
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:11,860
I didn't. That's part of the problem.

484
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,723
She's freaking out,
waiting for an answer.

485
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:15,128
So give her one.

486
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,357
Well, I'd love to, Mike, but, uh,

487
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:19,685
there's some issues here.

488
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,910
Do you love her?

489
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,017
She could be the one.

490
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:25,869
Then say yes.

491
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:27,154
But it's complicated.

492
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,114
Then say no.

493
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:32,356
You're a true friend, Mikey.

494
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:44,716
- You're finished placing the cars?
- Yeah.

495
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:47,386
Dropped Timo's car off
around the corner.

496
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:50,327
Is that the target?

497
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,884
So now we tip them off.

498
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:53,287
We have a little snag.

499
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:55,257
- What?
- See for yourself.

500
00:25:56,731 --> 00:25:57,482
C.J.?

501
00:25:57,926 --> 00:26:00,604
Apparently, he's obtained
gainful employment.

502
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:04,217
He's Timo's inside man
at the jewelry exchange.

503
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,841
Oh, man.

504
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:08,903
If we're not careful about
who we talk to and how...

505
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:10,655
Timo's gonna know that he has a leak.

506
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,631
His first guess is gonna be me or you.
Either way, it's bad for you.

507
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,079
So, that's it.
I'm screwed.

508
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,044
No, we're still gonna tip off the store.

509
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:19,623
We just have to find a way
to do it without C.J. knowing.

510
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:22,830
I'll deal with this.
I'll let you know when it's done.

511
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,900
Go ahead.

512
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:34,917
Thank you, sir.

513
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:36,396
Five bucks, buddy.

514
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:38,896
Are you kidding me?

515
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,999
- All set?
- Yeah.

516
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,560
Told him to make the block
once and head down the alley.

517
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,630
Then Mike can make his move
on Carla's building.

518
00:26:59,108 --> 00:27:00,758
Fi, I need some advice.

519
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:03,469
I'm trying to come up with a gift.

520
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,729
Something that says, "I love you,"

521
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:07,468
but I can't marry you."

522
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,669
And not too expensive.

523
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:11,932
There's no such thing, Sam.

524
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:13,702
Why can't you marry her?

525
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:15,929
- Well, there's stuff involved.
- "Stuff"?

526
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:18,681
Grownup stuff, okay?
You wouldn't understand.

527
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:21,632
It's obvious how much you care for her.

528
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:23,928
- I'm not saying I don't.
- Then why can't you marry her?

529
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:26,272
'cause it's against the law, all right?

530
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:28,806
I'm already married, technically.

531
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:31,045
You're gonna get flies in there.

532
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:33,356
Look, it was the '70s.
I did it on a whim.

533
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:36,015
We both knew the next day
it was a big mistake, but

534
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:37,781
we never got around to getting divorced.

535
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,556
That's not something you get around to.

536
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:41,871
Look, Fi, the truth is,
I didn't think any of it mattered,

537
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:44,341
'cause I wasn't the marrying type...

538
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:46,084
until now.

539
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:51,510
Forget about the gift, Sam.
Just tell Veronica the truth.

540
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,375
She'll understand.
We all have skeletons.

541
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:55,412
Terrible, terrible skeletons.

542
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:00,205
Here comes our boy.

543
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:12,413
And the old guy gets up...

544
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,780
goes to check on the alley...

545
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,617
and in you go, Mikey.

546
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:27,935
I'm in the shower.

547
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:30,142
You have 30 minutes to get here.

548
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,634
Where's he going? He's gonna blow it.

549
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:43,911
Mike, what happened? You were clear.

550
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:46,144
<i>Timo called.
He wants me at the boathouse.</i>

551
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:48,069
<i>We'll deal with Carla's building later.</i>

552
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:50,724
Sam, I think I'm gonna need some backup.

553
00:28:57,429 --> 00:28:58,573
What's going on?

554
00:28:58,693 --> 00:28:59,843
Put those on.

555
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:02,959
No more questions.

556
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:05,673
Get dressed, get your gear,
get in the van.

557
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:10,752
- I'm not doing this.
- Calm down.

558
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:12,212
- I'm out of here.
- You can't run.

559
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:13,976
- The hell I can't!
- Don't be stupid.

560
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:15,913
You'll go back to prison
for violating your parole.

561
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,048
I made a promise.

562
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:20,095
You know what your boy needs more
than a promise? He needs his dad.

563
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:21,888
Now, let me handle this.

564
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,141
And when I'm done, you'll never
have to worry about Timo again.

565
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:35,337
You need to get rid of those.

566
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,899
Where you going?

567
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,610
To relieve myself.
Why? You want to watch?

568
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,429
You better give me your phone.

569
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:43,299
What?

570
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:45,702
We'll take nothing traceable.

571
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:04,189
<i>Sending messages
in the middle of an operation</i>

572
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:07,009
<i>is among the most dangerous
things you can do.</i>

573
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:09,008
<i>Sometimes you just have to drop a note</i>

574
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:11,978
<i>and hope your backup team
is paying attention.</i>

575
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:41,117
They're doing the heist now.

576
00:30:41,237 --> 00:30:42,573
We don't have much time.

577
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:44,512
I was wondering
when the fun would start.

578
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:58,736
Yeah?

579
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,783
Monteiro heating & air?

580
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:06,093
Finally. Tell them to hurry up.

581
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:33,304
Took you long enough.

582
00:31:47,516 --> 00:31:48,345
Where to?

583
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:49,915
It's right this way.

584
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,487
Move it! Get going!

585
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,530
Let's go! Move it!

586
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:05,138
Come on! Let's go.

587
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,408
Get in there!

588
00:32:07,197 --> 00:32:08,846
Get your ass down here! Move!

589
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:11,740
Get in there! Come on!

590
00:32:16,357 --> 00:32:17,468
Let's go.

591
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:25,119
19 minutes.

592
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,034
- What's going on?!
- Are we in?

593
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:40,200
Five more minutes.

594
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,817
We don't have five minutes!
All right, pack up!

595
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,787
We're getting out of here!

596
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:48,946
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Everybody out!

597
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:52,072
I want back to base!
Everybody back to base!

598
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:53,719
Do not be late! You got 33 minutes!

599
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,694
I want the place cleaned out
of your clothes.

600
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,872
I got RDX. I can blow the lock.

601
00:33:58,032 --> 00:33:59,628
Like you said,
it's the score of a lifetime.

602
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:03,002
It's too late. Two more minutes,
and we all go to jail. Now, let's go!

603
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:07,817
You missed something! You had to!

604
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:10,234
Whoa, this is not on me!
My information was good!

605
00:35:10,354 --> 00:35:12,629
You said that there was no panic button
and no alarm on the safe!

606
00:35:12,749 --> 00:35:13,826
And I was right!

607
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,908
Then how did the alarm go off?

608
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:17,145
I don't know!

609
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:18,115
Exactly!

610
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,339
Hey, what's going on?

611
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:23,439
Why are you guys so serious?
What's going on?

612
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,540
We put too much time and work
into this job to walk away with nothing.

613
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,732
What do you mean, nothing?
I got the stuff.

614
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:30,672
It was in the bag. I gave it to Timo.

615
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,175
The jewels were in that bag?

616
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:33,785
Yeah. Where's Timo?

617
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:35,921
Trevor?

618
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:37,617
He should be here.
I gave him the quickest route.

619
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:39,367
<i>A certain kind of leader insists</i>

620
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:42,166
<i>on controlling
every aspect of an operation...</i>

621
00:35:45,264 --> 00:35:47,727
<i>... so that nothing
can possibly go wrong.</i>

622
00:35:56,969 --> 00:36:00,058
<i>The downside to insisting on
controlling everything</i>

623
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:02,744
<i>is that when something bad happens,</i>

624
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,500
<i>people tend to think
it was all part of your plan.</i>

625
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:18,404
He set us up.

626
00:36:18,765 --> 00:36:19,972
Son of a...

627
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:21,487
What did you get me into?

628
00:36:21,607 --> 00:36:23,960
I'm gonna find Timo,
and I'm gonna kill him!

629
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,530
I'm gonna kill him!

630
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,458
Oh, he'll be dead
long before you find him.

631
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:39,625
- Where you headed?
- Geez!

632
00:36:39,745 --> 00:36:40,495
Kandi.

633
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:42,074
What happened?

634
00:36:42,887 --> 00:36:43,937
You tell me.

635
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:46,110
I don't know.

636
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,537
Maybe somebody got onto us.
Maybe C.J. screwed it up.

637
00:36:48,657 --> 00:36:49,510
What are you doing here?

638
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,312
We can't be seen together
when a job is blown.

639
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:53,213
I had to make sure you were okay.

640
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:57,668
No, you get somewhere, and you stay
there until you hear from me.

641
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:06,054
What about the jewels?

642
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:09,924
What jewels? What are you talking about?
We didn't get anything.

643
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:12,059
Whoa, what are you, crazy?!

644
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:13,529
I will count to 3.

645
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:15,513
1...

646
00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:17,166
What's wrong, baby?

647
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:18,018
2...

648
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:19,332
No.

649
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:20,224
No!

650
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:21,384
3.

651
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:47,167
Sorry about the shiner.
I had to sell it.

652
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:48,737
Small price to pay.

653
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:51,939
Think I'm really done hearing from Timo?

654
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:55,078
You know Kandi better than I do.

655
00:37:57,764 --> 00:37:59,739
Thanks for everything, Michael.

656
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:01,949
And I'm gonna be back
tomorrow with that...

657
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,119
bracelet and some jewels
for your friends, too.

658
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,312
- That is not necessary.
- Hey, I'll be back tomorrow.

659
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:08,282
Trevor,

660
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,332
we didn't actually steal anything.

661
00:38:10,962 --> 00:38:12,912
So the promise that you made...

662
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:13,805
Yeah.

663
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:18,087
Thanks, man.

664
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,240
Let's go.

665
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:30,994
Almost done.

666
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,663
Why the rush, Michael?

667
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:35,853
Your little window for
getting into Carla's building

668
00:38:35,973 --> 00:38:37,777
doesn't open for over an hour.

669
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:39,729
I don't want to take any chances.

670
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,098
You really think you're gonna
find something in that office?

671
00:38:42,218 --> 00:38:43,699
No idea. Maybe I'll hit the jackpot

672
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:46,369
and find out her real name
and social security number.

673
00:38:46,899 --> 00:38:48,664
Or might find out

674
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:50,498
what kind of staples she likes.

675
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:52,585
Either way, it's more
than what I have now.

676
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,729
You mean, nothing.

677
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:54,926
Exactly. Let's go.

678
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:57,296
Five more minutes, they'll be dry.

679
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,799
Now you're gonna have to do them
all over again. Let's go.

680
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,565
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Sam.

681
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:04,726
Uh, what's with the bags?

682
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,514
Oh, well, uh,

683
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,648
my little confession to Veronica
didn't go over so well.

684
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:11,418
She kicked me out, Mike.

685
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,051
Out of her place

686
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,530
and out of her life.

687
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,148
Thanks for the advice, Fi.

688
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:19,571
That's really sad, Sam.

689
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:25,653
We can't talk about it right now.
We're in such a rush, right, Michael?

690
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,080
Who wants a beer?

691
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,228
Carla's boys out of sight?

692
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:41,673
Everybody but the guy
in the coffee shop.

693
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,141
That's your decoy.

694
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,723
He thinks we're having
a rendezvous in the alley.

695
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:03,471
Back in a few, Fi.

696
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:25,384
<i>Michael, nice try.</i>

697
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:29,031
<i>Your day job does get
in the way, doesn't it?</i>

698
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:30,810
<i>When you work in intelligence,</i>

699
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,638
<i>there's no bigger slap in the face</i>

700
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:35,211
<i>than a picture of yourself
in the middle of an operation.</i>

701
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:36,729
<i>It sends a clear message...</i>

702
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:38,834
<i>"we're one step ahead of you.</i>

703
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:40,128
<i>"We're in control.</i>

704
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:41,278
<i>We own you."</i>

705
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:50,689
<i>Mylar balloons
and a bottle of champagne?</i>

706
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:52,954
<i>That's just twisting the knife.</i>
