1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,100
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,700
We got a burn notice
On you. You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,800
<i>when you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,400
<i>no cash, no credit,
no job history.</i>

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,100
<i>you're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,600
Where am I?
Miami.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>you do whatever work
comes your way.</i>

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>you rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...</i>

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,500
<i>a trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend...</i>

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,700
Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,200
<i>... An old friend who's
informing on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,600
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>family, too...
Is that your mom again?</i>

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
<i>... If you're desperate.
I'm gonna need your help.</i>

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
<i>bottom line... Until you
figure out who burned you...</i>

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,200
<i>... You're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,600
<i>a surveillance photo</i>

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
<i>can tell you a lot
about the photographer.</i>

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,300
<i>surveillance takes planning.
you have to scout the area.</i>

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,400
<i>you need a place to sit</i>

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,200
<i>and wait for the target
for an hour... Or 10.</i>

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,000
<i>you need to take a leak
now and then.</i>

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,100
<i>lots of chances to get seen.</i>

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,000
Michael, good to see you.

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
<i>you can't choose
your intelligence sources.</i>

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,900
<i>might be a heroin smuggler,
a dictator, or your mom.</i>

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,600
I was beginning to wonder
If you were gonna be standing

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,700
In the road all day
Or come in for a visit.

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,100
I need to ask
You something.

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
Anyone unknown to you

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,200
Been around the house
Last few months,

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,700
Any unfamiliar faces
On the street,

33
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,100
Maybe a repair truck
That just seemed to sit there?

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,400
I don't know.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,300
I really don't notice
What my neighbors do.

36
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm not interested in them.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
You'd notice if the neighbor
Hasn't vacuumed his car,

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
If the postman isn't
Wearing his wedding ring.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,100
Just tell me.

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,600
As a matter of fact,

41
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,500
A few months ago, there were
Two men here taking pictures.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
They were very nice.

43
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
You met them?

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,500
Mm-hmm.
They came in for coffee.

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,700
I made them
Deviled-egg sandwiches.

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,400
They were in some sort of,

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't know,
Some government something.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Wait, wait, wait.
Government something?

49
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,500
Who exactly do they work for?
How should I know?

50
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,300
All these years, I don't know
Who in the hell you work for.

51
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,600
Travel all over the world

52
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,700
Saying,
"oh, can't talk about it."

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Well, I don't have
A job anymore,

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,300
So there's nothing
You have to worry about.

55
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,400
What did they talk to you about?
What did they ask?

56
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,600
I don't know, but I did show
One of them the garden.

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,700
Wait, you left one
Alone in here? How long?

58
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,900
Hmm, I don't remember.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,600
The doctor says
What's wrong with me

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
Could be affecting my memory.

61
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,000
Your memory's fine.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,600
If there's anyone who could use
A little memory loss, it's you.

63
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,800
<i>my mother's understanding
of my career</i>

64
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
<i>changes with
what she wants from me.</i>

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,500
<i>one day, she can name everyone on
the national security council,</i>

66
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,200
<i>the next day, she thinks
I work for the post office.</i>

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,900
Well, my friend donna
In my bridge group,

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,500
She's had memory problems.

69
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,600
Which reminds me,

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
I want to talk to you
About a friend of mine.

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
In a sec.

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,700
Michael,
What are you doing?

73
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,700
<i>not all bugs are the same.</i>

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,500
<i>if it's got a battery,
it's disposable, short-term.</i>

75
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,900
<i>if it's wired
into the house power,</i>

76
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>it's a longer-term thing.</i>

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,300
<i>if it has a transmitter,</i>

78
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,600
<i>you can figure out
how close the listener is.</i>

79
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,500
Mom, are there any empty houses
In the neighborhood

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,800
Within, say,
Hmm, 350 meters?

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,100
Across the street,
Two doors down.

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,500
<i>once your surveillance
knows you're onto them,</i>

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,100
<i>the clock starts ticking.</i>

84
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,200
<i>they know you're coming,
so the question for them</i>

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
<i>is whether they
can destroy their equipment</i>

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,300
<i>and get out of there in time.</i>

87
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,100
<i>the question for you
is whether you can find them</i>

88
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,100
<i>before every bit
of useful information</i>

89
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,500
<i>is turned into
a pile of burning slag.</i>

90
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,800
What happened to you?
You smell like burnt plastic.

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Yeah, I think
There's a fire down the road,

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,500
Um, and the smoke
Had drifted.

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Mom, we need to talk about
The men who came to the house.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,200
I need to know what they
Asked you, what you told them.

95
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,100
It's important for my job.

96
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,100
I thought
You didn't have a job.

97
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Yeah, you know,
It's... It's hard to explain.

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,700
Yeah, well,
I don't remember.

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
This thing about my friend
Has me very upset.

100
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,000
It's hard to think
About anything else.

101
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,400
Fine, mother.
Let's talk about your friend.

102
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,200
Well, it's
My neighbor Laura.

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,800
All right,

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,200
These people came over to her
House with some kind of a scam.

105
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
They got
All of her bank-account numbers.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They took everything
That she has.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And they beat her up, Michael.
She's terrified.

108
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,700
Well, what am I
Supposed to do?

109
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,800
Well, you'll think
Of something.

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
She lives
Right across the street.

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,600
You could go there now.

112
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,000
I talk to your friend,

113
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
And then we talk about
The men who came to the house.

114
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,900
Thank you so much
For coming.

115
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,400
when madeline
Said you could help me,

116
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,100
I was so relieved.

117
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,300
Well, what happened,
Exactly?

118
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,700
I got a letter
About a month ago,

119
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,400
Uh, said I'd won a prize,
One of those magazine things.

120
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,200
I called,
And they congratulated me,

121
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,500
Said they had to send
Some people over

122
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,600
To fill out some tax forms.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,400
And they came over and...

124
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,100
There were
Two men and a woman.

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
They were in such a hurry
To get my information...

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,100
Credit cards,
Bank accounts.

127
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,200
I got nervous,
And I asked them to leave.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,700
I tried to call the police,
And they hit me, broke my arm.

129
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,100
I checked my bank account.
It's all gone.

130
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,000
It's all I had.

131
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Uh, do you...
Do you have anything that, uh...

132
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,600
Do you have
A description of them?

133
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,800
Oh, I'm not very good
At that sort of thing.

134
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,800
The main one...
He was good-looking, blond.

135
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,500
The other two were
Just regular with brown hair.

136
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,300
Regular-looking
With brown hair?

137
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
I have the prize letter.

138
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,600
My son wants to put me
In a home now.

139
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Thinks I can't be trusted.

140
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,300
Uh, I'll see what I can do.

141
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,100
I'm gonna need
To borrow this, okay?

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
I should go.

143
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm gonna go.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,100
So, you're helping
Old ladies now?

145
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,900
Good for you, Mike.

146
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Hey, I saw a kitten up a tree
On my way over here.

147
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,200
They beat her up,
Took her life savings.

148
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
You in or not?

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,900
Well, you put it that way,
What can I say?

150
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,600
What's the plan?

151
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,800
The address
And phone number are fake,

152
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
But the printing,
The foil embossing...

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
There can't be
More than one place in miami

154
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
That does that kind of work.

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,600
Sounds good.

156
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Uh, listen, the money on
This one will be a little thin.

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,300
Well, it's a public service.
Hey, how about a trade?

158
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,800
I had a little disagreement

159
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
With the lady friend
I was staying with,

160
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,500
And I could use
A place to crash.

161
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,800
Three days. I was thinking
More like a week.

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,900
Mike, look,
I can sweeten the pot on this.

163
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
If I'm staying with you,
The feds will be off your back.

164
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,100
I'll just tell them
That I'm babysitting you.

165
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,400
Five days,
You bring a sleeping bag,

166
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
And you're out
By the weekend?

167
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,900
Done.

168
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Hello, Michael.

169
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,400
Fi, you're here.

170
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
I came by for a visit.

171
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,800
The door was locked,
So I broke in.

172
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
New accent.

173
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,700
New... Style.

174
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,600
Well, I'm in Miami now.

175
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I can't very well be talking

176
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,700
Like a freakin' leprechaun,
Now, can i?

177
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,100
This is the new me, Michael...

178
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,300
For now.

179
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,600
So you're staying in town, then.
That's great.

180
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
Listen, fi. Now's not a really
Good time for you to be...

181
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,500
Oh, Jesus, Mike. You didn't
Tell me she was gonna be here.

182
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,200
You cost me a lot of money,
You son of a bitch.

183
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,100
I've been waiting
To talk to you.????

184
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,300
I cost you?

185
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,400
Okay, for starters,

186
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,600
What you're talking about
Never officially happened.all right

187
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,400
But unofficially,
Even if it had,

188
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,600
You deserved a hell of a lot
Worse than what you got, lady.

189
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,400
Sam!

190
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,200
<i>there's a reason spies
don't have a lot of parties.</i>

191
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
<i>everybody's got a history
with everyone else.</i>

192
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,200
That was
A legitimate purchase!

193
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,800
The u.s. Government
Has no business...

194
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Yeah? Legitimate?
A libyan arms dealer?

195
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,500
How do you figure that?

196
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

197
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,700
Fi, I'm thrilled
That you've come by,

198
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,400
But Sam and I need to talk
About a job, so you need...

199
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,600
A job? Hmm.

200
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,300
That sounds like fun.

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm in.

202
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,300
Yeah.

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,700
Man:
I do work like that, yeah.

204
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,800
I don't remember this piece,
But we do a lot of volume.

205
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,500
You need more like this,
With the foil embossing?

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,400
Yeah, I mean, I don't know
A lot about printing,

207
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,300
But something like that.

208
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,400
You got some big machines.

209
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,200
Oh, just upgraded.
State-of-the-art.

210
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
Want me to show you around?
Mm-hmm.

211
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,000
<i>often, the best way
to get intel</i>

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,600
<i>is to provoke action,
set people in motion.</i>

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
<i>pros know better,</i>

214
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,500
<i>but they usually have to work
with a few amateurs,</i>

215
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,300
<i>and they panic.</i>

216
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,000
<i>so you beat the bushes a little
and see what flies out.</i>

217
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,500
<i>once your frightened amateur
leads you to the pros,</i>

218
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,100
<i>the work begins.</i>

219
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,200
<i>con artists and spies
are both professional liars.</i>

220
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,900
<i>cons do it for the money,
and spies do it for the flag,</i>

221
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,400
<i>but it's mostly the same gig.</i>

222
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,300
<i>they run operations, they
follow security procedures,</i>

223
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,200
<i>they recruit support staff
and issue orders.</i>

224
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,300
Hey, so this guy Quentin,
Your con artist,

225
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,400
Hangs out at a club
Down in south beach called onyx.

226
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
It's nice.

227
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,400
Want me to go down there
And do some surveillance?

228
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,700
No, I think we're fine.

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
I got a cover i.d. For you,
Mikey.

230
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,600
How do you like the name
Peter Jordan?

231
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,900
Would you put some pants on?

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
What? I work better
When I can breathe down there.

233
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,900
I mean, do you want to hear
About this guy or no?

234
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,600
Yeah, tell me
About Peter Jordan.

235
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,400
He was cell mates
With an ex-partner of Quentin's.

236
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,400
He jumped parole
About a month ago.

237
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,200
They caught him.

238
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,700
He's in
A phoenix holding cell,

239
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,000
But they haven't put him
Back through the system yet.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,500
He kind of looks like you, too,
You know, more or less.

241
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,700
Not bad
For a man in his underwear.

242
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,900
Hey, you think that's good,
You should see me without them.

243
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,800
<i>when you go after a spy,
you send another spy.</i>

244
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,700
<i>the same goes for con artists.</i>

245
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,600
<i>to catch one, you've got
to beat him at his own game,</i>

246
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
<i>be a better liar than he is.</i>

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Excuse me,
Can I help you?

248
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Quentin king, right?

249
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Yeah.

250
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,300
We have a mutual friend up
In new york... Paco.

251
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,000
Few weeks ago,

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm at a dog track in newark
Freezing my nuts off

253
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,400
When I remember that paco said
If I ever got down to miami,

254
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,700
I should look you up.

255
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
So I'm thinking, "hell,
Anywhere's nicer than newark."???

256
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,200
So I got my ass down to miami.
Peter Jordan, hey.

257
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,000
Peter,
You got the wrong guy.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,700
No, no, I don't think so.

259
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,800
See, I was roommates
With your buddy paco for a year.

260
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,200
He told me about that job
You pulled off up in tampa...

261
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,000
Real nice.

262
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,600
I have a business opportunity
I want to discuss with you.

263
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,400
<i>no matter how good
your cover identity is,</i>

264
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,000
<i>you've got to sell it,
and that's not always easy.</i>

265
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,800
Like I said,
You got the wrong guy.

266
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
I don't know you.
I don't know this paco.

267
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,900
Hey, I went to a lot of trouble
To find you.

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I got a warrant on my ass.
Will you hear me out?

269
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
I'm in water-filter sales.

270
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Now, you want a water filter,
I can help you out.

271
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,700
I don't want to argue
With you,

272
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,500
But what's
A water-filter salesman

273
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Doing with a .45
Inside a shoulder holster?

274
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,700
That's my business, but you know
What is your business?

275
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,500
There's a couple of cops

276
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,500
That are sitting
Over there by the bar.???

277
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,900
Been there a while,
Probably liquor license.

278
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,000
How about
I bring them over here

279
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,200
And we talk about
The terms of your parole?

280
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,900
<i>sometimes you have to decide
just how committed you are</i>

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,700
<i>to pretending you are
who you say you are.</i>

282
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,000
Anyone ever tell you
You're hard at making friends?

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,100
Paco said you had some issues,

284
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,700
But I like to give people
A chance... It's just how I am.

285
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,100
This is what happens...
You're gonna get us out of here

286
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,800
Because I like miami,
And I'm not going back to jail.

287
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,900
<i>So if those cops
Even look at me,</i>

288
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,800
We'll see how many slugs
I can put through your liver

289
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,200
Before they take me down.

290
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,900
I got 20 bucks on 4. You want
To take the over or the under?

291
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,700
All right,
Let's go out back.

292
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Smile. Stand up.

293
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,900
Put your arm around me

294
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,000
And act like the friends
I wanted us to be.

295
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,800
All right, here we are.

296
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,700
You want to take that thing
Out of my ribs now?

297
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,400
Oh, and then you send the cops
Right after me? Uh-huh.

298
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,700
<i>I don't like running from cops,
but it has its advantages.</i>

299
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,900
???

300
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,200
<i>when you flee a crime scene.</i>

301
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,900
I'll be in touch.

302
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,700
<i>eavesdropping and fieldwork
go hand in hand.</i>

303
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
<i>you want to know
what your target is saying</i>

304
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,600
<i>and what he's typing
into his computer,</i>

305
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,100
<i>but technology
can't work miracles.</i>

306
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,000
<i>bugs don't plant themselves.</i>

307
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,200
<i>the fact is,
even the fanciest equipment</i>

308
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,200
<i>usually needs help from
a good, old-fashioned crowbar.</i>

309
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,500
Get onto the boat,
Plant the bugs, get out quick.

310
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,800
Yep, gotcha.
Okay, what's that for?

311
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I could think of something.

312
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
It's for the lock,
If you have trouble, Sam.

313
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,300
Mike, give me some credit.
I mean, I can handle a lock.

314
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,600
Quentin had a colt .45

315
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,900
With extended controls
And a beveled mag well.

316
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,100
He's serious.
Be careful, Sam.

317
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,800
Yeah, Fi, I want you
To fix Quentin's car

318
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,500
So we can disable it
If anything happens.

319
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,400
You think
You can handle that?

320
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,700
I'm not gonna answer that.

321
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,200
I'm off to make friends.

322
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
It's me again.

323
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Do me a favor, babe,
Take a swim.

324
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Water's great.

325
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,200
You want a drink?

326
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,400
It depends.

327
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,000
Am I talking to Quentin king
Or some water-filter salesman?

328
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,200
???.you could be a cop, you could
Be a fed, you could be anyone.

329
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm not just anyone.

330
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,600
Well, you can handle yourself.
I'll give you that.

331
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,900
So, you have something.

332
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,100
If you burn me...

333
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,500
Let's hear your proposal.

334
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,200
You'll meet my team,
We'll see.

335
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
There's your gun back.

336
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,400
<i>it's always useful to be able
to disable a car remotely.</i>

337
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,000
<i>a cellphone, some wire...</i>

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,100
<i>you can ground the circuit
on the electrical system</i>

339
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
<i>with a phone call.</i>

340
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,600
Are you just about done
Down there?

341
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,100
In a second.

342
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,900
This... Is an art.

343
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,200
No. Wiring crap into a car
Is not an art.

344
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
It's about as subtle
As hitting someone with a brick.

345
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,400
Hitting someone with a brick
Takes a lot of skill.

346
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
You should try it sometime.
It's all in the wrist.

347
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,300
Sorry, not my style.

348
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,900
I know.
That's right, I forgot.

349
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,800
You only do
What the suits tell you.

350
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,000
You know,
That was a cheap shot.

351
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
<i>a good cover identity keeps
the target feeling in control.</i>

352
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
<i>you talk too much,
drink too much</i>

353
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,600
<i>just to let him know
he's got the edge.</i>

354
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,100
I respect what you're doing...

355
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,700
Going after checking accounts,
Consumer credit.

356
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,600
I mean, it's easy.

357
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,700
It's like picking up coconuts
On the beach.

358
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,600
I like coconuts
As much as the next guy,

359
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
But I'm talking about
Something bigger than coconuts.

360
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,700
Enough with the coconuts.
What's the scam?

361
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Annuities.

362
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,900
You sell someone an annuity,
And they dig deep...

363
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,500
Home equity, major assets,

364
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,400
The money they're saving up
For their grandkids.

365
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
You give them
A piece of paper,

366
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,100
And you walk away
With everything they own.

367
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Why do you need us?

368
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,500
You've got leads.

369
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,700
What was your hit rate
On your last scam, 1 in 50?

370
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,000
You go back to every one you
Missed, you nail one in five.

371
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
50, 100 grand.

372
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,700
I got tax documents,
Marketing stuff,

373
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,300
And a bottle
Of johnnie walker blue,

374
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,100
And we're done.

375
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,200
Well, you know,
We're making money.

376
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
And this forge crap...
Feds are all over that.

377
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,100
But 100 grand per mark...
Dude, that's millions.

378
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,300
Greg, take a walk.

379
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,100
Okay?

380
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Listen, you don't want this,
I don't want this.

381
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,900
In fact, I don't need this.
No, no, no, I'll walk away.

382
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,400
I want to talk about this.
Come on, let's talk.

383
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,300
Let's talk about it.

384
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,000
You boys and your computers.

385
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,700
If you've got a better way

386
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,200
To find encrypted passwords
And account information,

387
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,500
I'm all ears, baby.

388
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,200
Here you go. Stick that up there
And hurry up about it.

389
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,500
We'd have been
Out of here 10 minutes ago

390
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
If you didn't argue
About every little thing.

391
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,300
I've heard surveillance
Through these things.

392
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,600
It sounds
Like everyone's underwater.

393
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,800
Hey, if you have a way

394
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,400
To put a recording studio in a
Light fixture, love to hear it.???

395
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,900
Millions of dollars.

396
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
Quentin acts like I'm a goddamn
Kid and tells me to go home.

397
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,700
Uh-oh.

398
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,200
What the hell
Are you doing here?

399
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,700
What are you doing here?

400
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,800
We live here.

401
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,900
Wha...

402
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,200
You...

403
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You live here?

404
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh, god, you liar.
You liar!

405
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,100
You son of a bitch!

406
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,400
I can explain, baby.

407
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,200
Explain what?

408
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,700
That you told me you had a yacht
So you could get in my pants?

409
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,100
Is that about right?

410
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm sorry, baby.
Oh!

411
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't believe this.

412
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
This is our third date.

413
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
He said this was his boat.

414
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,700
Get out.

415
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,100
Where's my shoe?

416
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,400
Here.
Oh.

417
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,900
You are taking me home
Right now.

418
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,700
We are leaving.
We are leaving!

419
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,500
Okay, jesus, ow.

420
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,300
We're so sorry
About this.

421
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,500
Let's go.

422
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,700
And eventually
We got out of there.

423
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,900
Anyway, it's all good.

424
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,200
It was just a little painful
In the end.

425
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,700
Of course, it wouldn't have been
A problem if I didn't have

426
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,000
Someone second-guessing me and
Slowing the whole thing down.

427
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,500
It was fine, Michael.
Next time I'll check my phone.

428
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,900
Hey, how'd it go?
Is Quentin your new best buddy?

429
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,600
Hardly. I've cracked ex-kgb
Officers easier than this guy.

430
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,600
We're gonna have to push
These guys,

431
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,000
Drive his little team apart.

432
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,500
Old school...
You know I like that.

433
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,300
Do you want the full-on
Disinformation campaign?

434
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,600
No, keep it small... Just enough
To nudge him in my direction.

435
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,300
Can do.
Who wants another beer?

436
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,100
Me.

437
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Fi...

438
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,500
Yes?

439
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,600
I need a favor.

440
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,100
I need some information
From my mom.

441
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,900
She's not gonna talk about it
Unless we...

442
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,700
Go to dinner.

443
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,000
I talked to her yesterday.

444
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
You talked to her.
Of course you did.

445
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,100
And I accepted.
Bringing a vegetable.

446
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,200
I can't wait.

447
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
<i>go after
a group of people directly,</i>

448
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,500
<i>and they pull together,
they get stronger.</i>

449
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,600
<i>taking out a tight-knit group</i>

450
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,700
<i>is about making them
turn on each other.</i>

451
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,500
<i>plant the seeds of distrust
and watch them grow.</i>

452
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,300
I'm still thinking about it.

453
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,900
I talked to Greg and Bonnie.

454
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,400
Enough about Greg and Bonnie.
They're not in charge here.

455
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Fine, I'm just saying,
We can't delay this much longer.

456
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,700
Tax season is coming up.

457
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,100
If people buy in,
They do it just before april.

458
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,900
So you and paco...

459
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,500
You were cell mates,
What, a year?

460
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,600
I could think of worse ways
To do time.

461
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,900
Paco, man.
He still make that pruno?

462
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,200
I did a couple months
With him in county,

463
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,500
And, man,
He made the best prison wine.

464
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,900
<i>of course,
sowing seeds of distrust</i>

465
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,800
<i>is harder
when nobody trusts you.</i>

466
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,000
Paco doesn't drink.
What are you trying to pull?

467
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,300
Yeah...

468
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,500
Of course.
I forgot.

469
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,100
What, so you just guessed?

470
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,000
Either he drank or he didn't.

471
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,100
50/50 shot,
And I guessed right.

472
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,800
Good thing.

473
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,600
I think he was planning on
Shooting me if I got it wrong.

474
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
Ah, nice work, Mike.

475
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
How's the betrayal
Paper trail coming?

476
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,500
Oh, great. It's actually
Some of my best work.

477
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,000
I got plane tickets
For Greg and Bonnie

478
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
And a couple
Of offshore bank accounts.

479
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,500
I'll get it over there tonight
And plant it.

480
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,900
Now, are you seriously taking
Fiona to your mom's?

481
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,000
Not like I have a choice.

482
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Good luck with that,
Brother.

483
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,700
Fi, just do me a favor.

484
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,900
Just go easy tonight.

485
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,400
It is such a pleasure
To finally meet you.

486
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,100
Oh, welcome.
Please come in, come in.

487
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
This is my friend Laura.

488
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,200
She just came by to say hi,
See how things were going.

489
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,100
Madeline said she was sure
You could take care of it.

490
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
Why don't you
Let me take that?

491
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,500
Everything's
Going to be fine.

492
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,600
He used to be
A secret agent.

493
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,900
Well...

494
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,500
I-I don't want to intrude
On your supper.

495
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,200
I brought a peach cobbler
For dessert.

496
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,900
Yum.

497
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,100
So, are you two
Getting married?

498
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,600
I'm thinking about it.

499
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,000
I'd like to be a june bride.

500
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,400
Mmm...
That was delicious.

501
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Thank you.

502
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,300
So, um, Fiona,
Do you live in Miami now?

503
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,000
Well, we'll see.
I like it here.

504
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,100
Do you have a job?

505
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,200
I'm in between jobs,
A bit like Michael.

506
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,100
I'll...
I'll get the dishes.

507
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Thank you.

508
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,300
Michael.

509
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,900
Thank you, Fiona.

510
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,700
Mom, we had an agreement.

511
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,800
Tell me about the men
Who came to the house.

512
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,900
Um, they asked about you,
How often you come to miami,

513
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,600
Whether you have
Any friends here,

514
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,700
And they asked
If we were close.

515
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,700
You and me?
What did you tell them?

516
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,100
I told them
That you were the perfect son,

517
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,600
That you always wrote me,
And you called me all the time

518
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
And that the most important
Thing to you was family.

519
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,200
I told them that,
And they wrote it down.

520
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,100
Why did you tell them that?

521
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,300
I don't know, Michael.

522
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,700
It just seemed nicer
Than the truth.

523
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,000
Excuse me.
I got a phone call.

524
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Were you in on this?
Answer me!

525
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,400
Calm down.
What are you talking about?

526
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Answer me!

527
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,600
I don't know...

528
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,100
I got bank statements,
Plane tickets, huh?

529
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,600
Greg and Bonnie
Had some plans.

530
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,100
<i>sometimes a great plan</i>

531
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,400
<i>comes together
just a little bit too early.</i>

532
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,000
What, you thought
You could go around me?

533
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,100
Is that
What you thought, huh?

534
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,000
Why would I do that?
Yeah, you think about it.

535
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,100
I need your leads.
Without that, I got nothing.

536
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,300
Greg and Bonnie, two stupid kids
I'd have to share my score with?

537
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
You know what I'm saying?

538
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,700
I swear to god, if I find out
You're lying to me...

539
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,000
I tell u the truth ???

540
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,100
This might not be
What it looks like.

541
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,400
They got a goddamn bottle
Of champagne.

542
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,300
They were gonna rip me off

543
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,100
And go to the caymans
Or the seychelles.

544
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,200
????

545
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,500
Just don't do anything
Without me.

546
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,300
This will be over tonight.

547
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,900
<i>you've been in the business
way too long</i>

548
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,600
<i>when you recognize the sound
of a .45 caliber over a phone.</i>

549
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,300
Don't do anything stupid.

550
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,000
Okay, Mike, I'm here.
I'm at the marina.

551
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
If Quentin leaves the boat,

552
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,100
Our plan
Is in serious trouble.

553
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah he's here. I can see him
Walking around on the boat.

554
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,300
You've got to make sure
He doesn't go anywhere.

555
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,700
Don't worry about it.
I'll keep an eye on him.

556
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,300
He's planning to kill
Greg and Bonnie,

557
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,800
Then blow out of town
With the money.

558
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Hang on.
What do you see?

559
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,700
He's coming out right now.

560
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,700
I'll use Fiona's gizmo.
I'll just zap the car.

561
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,900
Call me when it's done.
All right.

562
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,000
<i>that's what happens
when you wire a cellphone</i>

563
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
<i>to a blasting cap
in the gas tank</i>

564
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,700
<i>instead
of to the electrical system.</i>

565
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,400
Son of a bitch!

566
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,200
Fiona, you were supposed
To stop the car,

567
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,500
Not blow it
Into the everglades.

568
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
What happened
To shorting the ignition?

569
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, you said, "disable."
It's not going anywhere.

570
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,300
You know what I meant.

571
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,500
<i>I almost had him.
I was this close.</i>

572
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,400
The FBI is back, I see.
I'm under surveillance again.

573
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,300
Sam, I thought you were supposed
To handle that.

574
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,100
Mike, there's only so much
I can do.

575
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I got to tell the suits
Why we're down at the marina

576
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,400
To keep them off our back,

577
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
But if somebody starts blowing
Up cars down at the marina...

578
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,300
You're friends with someone
Who put the FBI back onto you.

579
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,700
That is so unfair.

580
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,500
Sam, what about Quentin?

581
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,700
You were supposed
To nudge him,

582
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,500
Not send him
Into a homicidal frenzy.

583
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,000
Look, you guys were off
Doing your thing,

584
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,900
So I signed up Greg and Bonnie
Through this medallion airways

585
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,700
Executive service
To the cayman islands,

586
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,000
You know,
As part of the setup.

587
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,200
Well, they got this new thing

588
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,300
Where they overnight a bottle
Of champagne to the new members.

589
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,800
Quentin started sniffing around,

590
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,600
And in less than an hour,
He found everything that I did.

591
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,200
It was little stuff,
But he put it all together.

592
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,500
Turn him around.
Make him trust you.

593
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,100
He's not
In a trusting mood, Fi.

594
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I know you're angry, Michael.

595
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,200
But I know
That an exploding car

596
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,000
Can throw a man off-balance.

597
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,600
You'll thank me.

598
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,400
He won't even talk to me.
He won't even answer my calls.

599
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,400
Well, you'll have to be
Extra charming.

600
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,191
<i>whether you're in moscow,
tehran, or miami,</i>

601
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:06,001
<i>club girls are
a good source of information.</i>

602
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:08,235
<i>men say things
to a beautiful woman.</i>

603
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,723
<i>they give out phone numbers,
hotel keys.</i>

604
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:11,861
<i>they let down their guard.</i>

605
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:15,087
<i>getting information from a
club girl means buying drinks.</i>

606
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:17,321
<i>it's no problem with
an operational slush fund.</i>

607
00:32:17,897 --> 00:32:19,172
<i>it's a big problem

608
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:21,488
<i>cash scrounged

609
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,323
You have to help me out,
Please, please.

610
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:28,405
We're doing this night at a club
In hollywood beach... Amazing.

611
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:30,572
I mean, I'm flying in
A d.j. From berlin.

612
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:32,171
<i>It's gonna be crazy.</i>

613
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:35,872
Quentin reserves a V.I.P. Table
For 4,000 bucks,

614
00:32:35,905 --> 00:32:37,405
And I can't get in touch
With him

615
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:38,928
To tell him the date changed.

616
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,499
???He's gonna be pissed,
And you know how angry he gets.

617
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:44,029
So how about us?
Are we on the list?

618
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,371
Oh, 100%.
You're all in.

619
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:49,605
Just please,
Please help me out, please.

620
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:52,488
Well, I think he only uses
This number for girls, but...

621
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,036
You're a hard man to reach.

622
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,438
Yeah, well, things
Have been a little bit busy.

623
00:33:02,472 --> 00:33:02,939
What do you want?

624
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,344
Same thing as before...
Make some money.

625
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:07,772
Where are you?
I'm laying low.

626
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:09,338
When can we get together?

627
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:12,071
I don't think that's
A very good idea right now.

628
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:15,205
Quentin, buddy, I'm the only guy
You can trust right now.

629
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,138
Your partners
Just tried to kill you.

630
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:18,114
You need a friend.

631
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:21,572
Quentin, you need to learn
To reach out.

632
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:24,071
We can help each other.

633
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:25,572
Quentin...

634
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:26,715
Fine. Where?

635
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:41,511
Whoa, whoa, buddy.
It's me.

636
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:44,259
I've been waiting
Here, man.

637
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:46,805
You said 2:00.
It's 2:00.

638
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:49,472
You know
They're back on my yacht?

639
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,038
I'm gonna go down there,
I swear to god.

640
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,338
Listen...

641
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:55,071
Two bodies, a murder weapon,
And you're suspect number one.

642
00:33:55,104 --> 00:33:56,572
I mean, you know my style.

643
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:58,772
I'm not afraid to pull a trigger
If that's what has to happen.

644
00:33:58,805 --> 00:33:59,648
Let's be smart about this.

645
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:02,581
You got a better idea?
Yeah.

646
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:06,405
I know a guy...
Know what I'm saying...

647
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:08,338
Someone who can deal
With this.

648
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:09,805
It'll cost some money,

649
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,038
But he'll make this go away...
Quiet, no connection to you.

650
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,638
One wire transfer...
It's done,

651
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:17,472
And then we can go on
With our business.

652
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:21,004
<i>a hit man is like a plumber,
a dentist, or a mechanic...</i>

653
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:23,104
<i>everybody's always looking
for a good one.</i>

654
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:26,205
All right, let's set that up.
He'll do both of them?

655
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,685
How much?

656
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:29,987
$50,000.

657
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:32,705
They'll both be dead,
No connection to me?

658
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:36,030
Okay.

659
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:37,350
I'll be in touch.

660
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:39,261
Okay.

661
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:46,672
Sam, Quentin bit.

662
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:49,004
I need you and Fiona
To deal with Bonnie and Greg.

663
00:34:49,038 --> 00:34:50,538
It's time
They got out of town.

664
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:51,839
Can do, Mike.

665
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:54,104
You know you're out
Of orange juice? Sam...

666
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:00,572
What am I supposed to do?

667
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:02,905
His car blew up.
He's gone.

668
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:04,367
Maybe he's got enemies
He didn't tell us about.

669
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:07,230
It's that couple
That broke into the boat.

670
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:11,705
Good afternoon.
Miami P.D.

671
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:14,438
I'm detective Cagney.
This is detective Lacey.

672
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:16,572
We'd like to talk to you.

673
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:22,872
I'm not gonna lie to you.
You two are in a lot of trouble.

674
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:24,772
We'd like to know
Where your partner is.

675
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:26,678
You tell me.

676
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:30,472
You know, you might want to be
More cooperative.

677
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:33,939
We've been monitoring you two
For quite a while.

678
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:37,405
You might recall walking in
On us as we were planting this.

679
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:40,438
We have all the financial
Transactions off your computer.

680
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,038
So, your partner?

681
00:35:42,071 --> 00:35:44,805
We don't know, okay?
He's just gone.

682
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:46,305
Too bad.

683
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,171
There's no deal for you
If he doesn't show up.

684
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:49,572
You go down
For the whole show.

685
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,438
Miami juries...

686
00:35:51,472 --> 00:35:53,905
They don't like people who rob
Retirees and beat up grandmas.

687
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:56,371
That wasn't us.
That was Quentin.

688
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,971
We never touched them.

689
00:35:58,004 --> 00:36:00,271
Quentin was the one
Smacking them around.

690
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:01,971
We don't even have the money.

691
00:36:02,004 --> 00:36:04,499
Quentin transferred it all
To his own account. Shut up!

692
00:36:05,702 --> 00:36:07,438
Of course,
You could help us find him,

693
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:09,138
Testify for a reduced sentence,

694
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:11,805
And only get,
I don't know, 5 to 10.

695
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,071
I want to talk to a lawyer.

696
00:36:16,104 --> 00:36:17,405
Go ahead.

697
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:20,738
Don't take too long
And don't go anywhere.

698
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:41,071
You know, for all your
Antigovernment speechifying,

699
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,024
You do lady cop
Pretty well.

700
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,355
Thanks.

701
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:48,854
Okay, so you bet
They would be gone by 4:00.

702
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,672
Well, another couple minutes.
After that, I'm 20 bucks richer.

703
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:52,605
I'll win.

704
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:55,768
Greg comes on strong when you
Can tell he's scared of prison.

705
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:58,472
He's selling her on the sandy
Beaches of canc right now.

706
00:36:58,505 --> 00:36:59,493
Mexico, you think?

707
00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:01,900
Or the caribbean.

708
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:06,104
Uh-oh.

709
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:12,338
Okay, there they go.

710
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:16,944
Don't look so smug.

711
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:25,715
<i>I don't much like dealing
with paranoids.</i>

712
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:28,298
<i>they get erratic,
make bad decisions.</i>

713
00:37:28,472 --> 00:37:29,672
<i>that could be a help</i>

714
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,975
<i>when you need them
to make a bad decision.</i>

715
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:33,472
Whoa, jesus christ!

716
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:35,905
What the
Hell do you think you're doing?

717
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:37,371
I'm going to the bank
Like we said.

718
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:38,488
With the FBI watching you?

719
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:39,986
FBI?
What are you talking about?

720
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,263
Right there, look.

721
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:44,472
FBI? How?

722
00:37:44,505 --> 00:37:47,004
I don't know.
You tell me, Quentin.

723
00:37:47,038 --> 00:37:48,205
Greg and Bonnie.

724
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:50,405
I took the cash.
They must have gone to the feds.

725
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:51,705
You're careless.

726
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:54,038
You're gonna get us caught.
I am not going back to prison.

727
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,271
Okay, shut up for a second
And let me think.

728
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:57,738
No, there is no time for that.

729
00:37:57,772 --> 00:37:59,905
You need Greg and Bonnie dead
More than ever.

730
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:02,104
They're your only witnesses.
They know me.

731
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:03,705
This is a disaster, Quentin.

732
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:05,338
Fine, we'll go to the bank.

733
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:07,271
I'll wire the money to your guy
Like we talked about.

734
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:09,405
Wire the money?
With an FBI tail?

735
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:12,484
Are you stupid, or are you
Just trying to get us caught?

736
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:15,205
You know what?
Have a nice life.

737
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:16,905
Wait, wait, wait,
Wait, wait.

738
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:20,205
Maybe we could get somebody else
To make the transfer.

739
00:38:20,238 --> 00:38:22,238
It has to happen right now.

740
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:24,138
What are you gonna do,
Find some guy on the street,

741
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:26,104
Say, "can you wire money
To aruba?" nice try.

742
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,438
No, you do it.

743
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,772
No. I'm not cleaning up
Your mess.

744
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:31,805
They don't know you.

745
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,171
I'll give you
My account numbers,

746
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:34,905
You send the money,
And we'll meet up later.

747
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,805
No, I take all the risk,
And I save your ass.

748
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,066
No, I'm telling you.
It's gonna work.???

749
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:43,271
And then we make some money?

750
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:44,231
Then we make some money.

751
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:46,505
Fine.

752
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,538
But you make sure
The feds follow you.

753
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:49,905
'Cause if they follow me,

754
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:52,205
You'll wish I put a bullet
In your head right here.

755
00:39:15,171 --> 00:39:17,705
<i>truth is,
identity theft isn't hard.</i>

756
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:21,805
<i>a number and an i.d. Is all you
need to drain a bank account</i>

757
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,004
<i>and return a lot of money to
some very surprised retirees,</i>

758
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:26,738
<i>but why stop there?</i>

759
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:29,227
<i>as long as you're stealing
someone's identity,</i>

760
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:32,505
<i>why not use it to contact some
known terrorist organizations</i>

761
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,638
<i>on unsecure phone lines?</i>

762
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,171
<i>why not use it to threaten
some federal judges</i>

763
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:38,237
<i>and insult
the local drug cartel?</i>

764
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:42,429
<i>most fun I've had in miami.</i>

765
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:50,232
???I looked at my bank statement,
And there it was...

766
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:51,239
All the money.

767
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:52,479
I'm glad it could work out.

768
00:39:53,055 --> 00:39:54,367
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?

769
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:58,159
How did you do it?
How did you get it all back?

770
00:39:58,518 --> 00:39:59,818
You don't want to know.

771
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:02,751
No, really,
You don't want to know.

772
00:40:02,785 --> 00:40:06,418
Oh. Well,
How much do I owe you?

773
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:08,685
Well, I didn't do it
For the money.

774
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:11,818
Let's call it
$500 for expenses.

775
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:15,184
Call it $300,

776
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:17,487
And you promise
Not to enter any more contests?

777
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,177
I promise.

778
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:23,989
Michael!

779
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:26,016
Yeah, ma?

780
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:27,959
Thank you.

781
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:35,052
Wait.

782
00:40:38,952 --> 00:40:40,369
There's one more thing.

783
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:44,485
Those men who came to the house
Asking me questions...

784
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:46,150
They gave me this.

785
00:40:48,151 --> 00:40:49,525
They asked me to call them

786
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:52,311
If you should ever come to miami
Or try to contact me.

787
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,434
Did you contact them?

788
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:57,031
No, Michael, I did not.

789
00:40:58,384 --> 00:40:59,638
Family comes first.

790
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:21,158
You've beeen
A busy boy, Michael.

791
00:41:21,785 --> 00:41:22,622
Very impressive.

792
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:26,699
Glad to be appreciated.
Who is this?

793
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,365
Oh, just a friend.

794
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:31,516
Who is this?

795
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:34,757
Stay out of trouble, Michael.
We'll be in touch.
