1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,791
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:03,978
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,088
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,676
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing.</i>

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,093
<i>No cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,548
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,181
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,142
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:22,521
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:25,482
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI.</i>

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,737
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,156
- <i>Family, too...</i>
- Hey, is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,367
- <i>If you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,911
<i>Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,</i>

16
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,449
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:47,152
<i>As a spy, you have a lot of ways
to get information.</i>

18
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:50,758
<i>You can get it with a gun, a lockpick.
You can get it with a listening device.</i>

19
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,927
<i>But most often,
more than all the other</i>

20
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,845
<i>information-gathering
techniques combined,</i>

21
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:57,765
<i>you get information
with a free lunch.</i>

22
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,348
How come you never invite me to lunch
at places like this?

23
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:03,384
There's no need, Sam.
You'll do almost anything for a $3 beer.

24
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:04,287
Yeah, sure.

25
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,708
Barry tracks down a Cayman Island
bank-account number,

26
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,268
and he gets lunch at the Chadwick?

27
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:11,068
That number leads to whoever
was trying to kill me,

28
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,270
so, yes, the Chadwick.

29
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:15,203
He's been complaining
about the job for days.

30
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:18,231
Yeah, and the squeaky wheel gets
the surf and turf. I see how this works.

31
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,645
Well, at least I can get
a good mojito here.

32
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:22,790
- We're on a budget, Sam.
- Okay, Mike, you know,

33
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,210
this cancels out one of the times
you saved my life, maybe two.

34
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:34,381
So, Michael...

35
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:40,025
How did you get
this mysterious bank-account number?

36
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,242
You probably don't want to know.

37
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:44,645
I do.
We don't have a lot of information.

38
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,897
That's why I'm coming to you.
I just need a name.

39
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:48,715
Yeah, no...

40
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:52,305
I understand why you hired me,
Michael Westen.

41
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,824
But you're having me break a lot of laws
with this job I'm doing for you.

42
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,778
<i>When someone starts acting like</i>

43
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,017
<i>there's an extra person
in the conversation,</i>

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,124
<i>it's a pretty good bet
that they're wearing a wire.</i>

45
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,999
This job you're doing for me?

46
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,543
<i>The question, then,
is who's taping you...</i>

47
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,462
<i>The police, the Feds...</i>

48
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:12,695
I think we should talk later,
maybe some place louder.

49
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:16,970
Michael, Michael, I missed you.

50
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,234
Or a government agent

51
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:20,697
you blackmailed a while back

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,030
and were hoping to never see again?

53
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:29,482
Sam Axe, you're living well
off a government pension, I see.

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,233
- Not that good. This is iced tea.
- Remember the file I have on you, Bly?

55
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:37,581
I think the idea was, you were never
to set foot in Miami again.

56
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,991
I know, I know,
but the sunshine, the beaches,

57
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,472
those little Cuban pastries...
Come on.

58
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:46,123
I just couldn't let a blackmail threat
keep me out of...

59
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:48,095
Paradise. Hi.

60
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,621
Actually, at this point,
blackmail ceases to be a threat.

61
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:54,799
At this point, I believe
I ruin your life.

62
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,167
How about I give your boss a call?

63
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:59,605
I'll be honest, Michael.
That file?

64
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:02,501
It kept me up nights,

65
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:05,794
so imagine my joy
when your friend showed up on my radar

66
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:09,939
investigating some highly suspicious
accounts for my old pal Michael Westen.

67
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,583
Barry is the brick

68
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:14,354
that I will tie around your neck

69
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:17,029
before I throw you into
that beautiful blue ocean over there.

70
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,950
Now, how deep you sink depends on
how quickly I get that blackmail file.

71
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:25,885
Welcome to Miami.

72
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,790
Season 2, Episode 13:
Bad Breaks.

73
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:31,126
Synchro VO: S@lomon

74
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,962
<i>www.subbers-in-black.com</i>

75
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:39,555
So, pull the trigger.

76
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:42,522
There's enough in that file
to reduce Bly's career

77
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,016
to a smoldering crater.

78
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,200
He can link me to Barry,

79
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:50,513
and Barry's broken a law library's
worth of financial regulations

80
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,492
looking into this account number.

81
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:54,492
If Bly goes after me with that,

82
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:57,069
I can throw the rest of my life
into that crater, too.

83
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,992
<i>Government agents
have to stay within the law,</i>

84
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,592
<i>but they still have plenty of options
to hit you below the belt.</i>

85
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:10,475
<i>Sometimes, a bullet to the head
is a lot easier than a slow death</i>

86
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,251
<i>drowning in red tape.</i>

87
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:19,300
- Sorry. For your own safety.
- Don't touch me, for your own safety.

88
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:24,165
According to the board of health,
this loft is unfit for human habitation.

89
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:26,932
And here I thought
it was just a dump.

90
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:30,477
Fiona Glenanne, you're wearing
more clothes than usual.

91
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:33,349
You know, I was on the fence
about that chair.

92
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:35,024
Thanks for making up my mind for me.

93
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,464
I hope you're on the fence
about everything that you own,

94
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,472
because toxic mold
could be anywhere.

95
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:43,705
There's been reports of spores spreading
to places you wouldn't believe.

96
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,993
Nope. No mold in that one.

97
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,611
Try the lamp.
I was always iffy on it.

98
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,850
You know what?
Thanks for watching out for me, Bly.

99
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,762
I'm gonna grab some clothes.
Call me when you're done.

100
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:56,896
Michael, don't worry.
I packed you a bag...

101
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:59,145
with some clothes to wear.

102
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:03,260
I have to say, for a tough guy,
you sure dress like an easter egg.

103
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,684
I hope you're not bringing
toxic mold into my house.

104
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,019
Ma, there's no mold.

105
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,563
I'm glad you're out of there.
The place didn't sound healthy.

106
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:17,483
My friend Paula is here.

107
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,693
She heard you were coming,
and she wanted to talk.

108
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,561
You advised her last week
about the guy she met on the internet.

109
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,865
Michael.

110
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:33,374
I am so sorry to bother you again.

111
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,167
This guy, Prescott...

112
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,125
I did what you said,
ignored his e-mails.

113
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,435
Then he called my house.

114
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,962
I think he's a stalker.

115
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:44,702
He's asking all these
personal questions. It's...

116
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:46,220
like he's obsessed with me.

117
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,542
Would it make you feel better
if I talked to him?

118
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,432
Really?
You could do that?

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,442
- Sure. Let me put my bag away.
- All right.

120
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:54,052
I'll put it in the guest room.

121
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:55,938
Michael will take care
of everything.

122
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:01,485
He lives at the Del Mar apartments.
I have his online dating profile.

123
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:03,862
I'm sure it'll be fine.

124
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:11,935
No Prescott in this building.

125
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:13,375
How about yours?

126
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:16,855
Not unless he's disguised
as an 80-year-old retiree.

127
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:19,502
I mean, this little manhunt
could take a while, Mike.

128
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:23,042
Whatever. Better this than sitting
in my mom's kitchen watching her smoke.

129
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,002
Likes fixing up old cars.
He's a mechanic, maybe?

130
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,879
I mean, I can check
his ASE certifications,

131
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:31,022
but, of course, that's if anything
on this page is true.

132
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:34,179
Check out the IP address
on his dating-service account,

133
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,942
- see what we're dealing with.
- Speaking of love, I got to get going.

134
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:40,242
I have a very big date.
She made millions as a beer distributor.

135
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:43,132
- The woman of my dreams.
- You have many women in your dreams.

136
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:44,994
So, I'm a romantic,
but this one, Mike...

137
00:06:45,077 --> 00:06:47,832
I mean, she's got a beach house
in Antigua with a quad kegerator.

138
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:50,457
That's four kegs of beer
at 33 degrees, baby.

139
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,852
Sounds like love.

140
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:52,692
Hello.

141
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,279
<i>Michael, it's Paula.
Prescott's outside my work.</i>

142
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:56,665
I'll be right there.

143
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,227
I saw his car drive
past three times.

144
00:07:01,615 --> 00:07:03,365
He walked by, looking in.

145
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:07,372
I'm the assistant manager.
I can't have him in here making a scene.

146
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:08,682
This is a private bank.

147
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:12,392
We're an appointment-only
private bank and safe-deposit company.

148
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,805
Very exclusive, very private.

149
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:17,102
You can understand
why I can't have him...

150
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,189
Has Prescott been asking you
about your work,

151
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,815
your schedule?

152
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,816
All of it.

153
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,527
I'm just afraid
he's some kind of maniac.

154
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,555
- Who's that?
- Just an old friend.

155
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,709
Did you get bored
redecorating my place?

156
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,913
I'll redecorate your life
if I have to.

157
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,499
- You find that file?
- Not yet. Let's talk later.

158
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,872
Actually, later is bad for me.
Now is good.

159
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:43,003
I want every piece of paper you own
that mentions me.

160
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,421
Files, phone records,

161
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,800
the page in your diary where you drew
little hearts around my name.

162
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:49,285
All of it.

163
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:53,412
You wanna do this, Bly?
You really wanna go nuclear?

164
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:54,595
I'd love to.

165
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:57,226
You really think
you have nothing to lose?

166
00:07:58,325 --> 00:07:59,325
He's here.

167
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,705
The stalker.

168
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:06,360
He's not a stalker.

169
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,275
This is a robbery.

170
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:09,855
Stay quiet,

171
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,615
follow our orders,

172
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:13,155
or people die.

173
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:25,796
You'll find your cellphones
are now useless.

174
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,555
We've blocked them,

175
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,357
so leave them on the floor
and head into the conference room.

176
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:39,017
Now!

177
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,535
Go! Go! Go!
Conference room!

178
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:55,534
<i>There are a number of different choices
when you take over a building by force.</i>

179
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,226
Up! Move into the conference room.

180
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,343
<i>Do you keep the hostages
facedown on the floor,</i>

181
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:02,026
<i>or do you move them
into a room together?</i>

182
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,002
Let me see your hands.
Move. Move.

183
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,270
<i>How do you cut all the lines
of communication out?</i>

184
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:08,964
Give me that cellphone!

185
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:13,132
Get in that conference room.

186
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,415
<i>And how do you deal
with the place's security method?</i>

187
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:23,562
<i>Whatever your style,
hostile takeovers are about one thing...</i>

188
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,899
- <i>Total dominance.</i>
- Silent alarm is dead.

189
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,360
Now get into the conference room
or you will be, too.

190
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,715
<i>We got the bank manager.</i>

191
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:35,449
If we both grab guns,
we can level the playing field.

192
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,521
The playing field
is covered with hostages.

193
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:39,453
Make a move now,
and somebody could get shot.

194
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,663
If we don't make a move,
we may not get a chance.

195
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,381
Just wait, all right?

196
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:46,915
Shut up. Move back with the others.

197
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:51,924
It's all right. Just stay calm.
Stay calm. It's gonna be all r...

198
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,092
Bly.

199
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,715
That's quite enough of that.

200
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:06,021
Welcome to my retirement party.

201
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:08,562
I want you all
to have a good time, so...

202
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:11,026
let's down a few ground rules,
shall we?

203
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,633
No attacking the hosts.

204
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,005
No leaving early.

205
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:17,855
No calling the police.

206
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:20,485
I see one cop, I kill three of you.

207
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:23,262
I see two cops, six people die.

208
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:25,666
You can do the math.

209
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,834
Now, mess up my party
by breaking one of my rules, and...

210
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:32,405
You can expect me to overreact.

211
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:48,645
<i>A wounded hostage is a good measure
of how far a criminal's willing to go.</i>

212
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,233
<i>They either want to keep
the hostage alive...</i>

213
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,375
Get away from him.

214
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:58,198
I'm a doctor.
If I don't stop the bleeding, he'll die.

215
00:10:58,645 --> 00:10:59,741
Then let him die.

216
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:03,557
<i>Or they don't, which means
more people are getting hurt.</i>

217
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,362
You have 20 hostages
in an unstable psychological state.

218
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:09,002
If they think they're going to die,

219
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,232
they will panic,
and they will fight back.

220
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:13,597
I'm just trying to make sure
that you get what you want

221
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,048
and these people stay alive.

222
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,467
Will you please allow me
to attend to this man's wound?

223
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,346
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

224
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:26,205
Let's go take a tour of the vault.
Come on.

225
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:30,772
You son of a bitch.

226
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:37,245
I only need one person alive
to get me the vault-access cards.

227
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:39,323
Please don't make me choose.

228
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,570
Told you someone would get shot.

229
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:50,112
Yeah, I overestimated you.
I figured you'd back me up.

230
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:53,345
You know, it's not a good idea
to insult your doctor.

231
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,612
Okay, this wound doesn't look good.
I'm going to need to...

232
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,008
- Remove the round?
- Yeah.

233
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,677
- Go ahead.
- Come here.

234
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:06,120
I need you to apply direct,
steady pressure to this.

235
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:08,632
Hold this up. Hold it up.
There you go.

236
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:14,873
<i>In a hostage situation, any idiot
can steal a gun and start shooting.</i>

237
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,702
<i>It's a great way to get
a bunch of innocent people killed.</i>

238
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:21,213
<i>Keeping people alive
means fighting like a spy.</i>

239
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,671
Where is your data server?

240
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:26,461
It's by the elevator, but they cut
the power to the computers, so...

241
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:28,644
I'm using it for something else.

242
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,728
We need to cut through there
and get into the next room.

243
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,152
From there, we can get out.

244
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,130
There's no way out.
That's just an office.

245
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,065
There'll be a way out.

246
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,012
I'm working on that part.

247
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,887
You don't think the guards outside
will see us going through a wall?

248
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:47,167
- I'll take care of the guards.
- Yeah. No. Wait. You heard him.

249
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,646
If you attack his guys,
he's gonna start shooting people.

250
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,679
I'm not going to attack them.

251
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,147
They're just gonna have
some very bad luck.

252
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:56,642
Where are you going?

253
00:12:56,725 --> 00:13:00,175
- I need medical supplies.
- Wait. Wait. Stop right there.

254
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:03,924
- No one leaves the conference room.
- Your boss said stop the bleeding.

255
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:06,709
- He didn't say you could leave.
- You wanna go downstairs and ask him?

256
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:09,955
The man in there is going to die
unless I remove the bullet from his arm.

257
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,873
To do that, I need tools, so...

258
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,460
help me find tweezers and propoxyphene
or shoot me in the face. Your call.

259
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,331
- You've got two minutes.
- We got less than that.

260
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:22,259
<i>Fighting like a spy means
disguising attacks as attempts to help.</i>

261
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,512
<i>It means making acts of man
seem like acts of god.</i>

262
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,140
- We have to go through here?
- That's the plan.

263
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,602
Does anybody have a razor
or a letter opener?

264
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,561
Here. I grabbed these.

265
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:34,764
Good. Here.

266
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,728
We're gonna trust your friend?

267
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,479
He is not my friend, but he might
be able to get us out of here.

268
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:41,695
- Sir, watch the door.
- Start cutting at the outlet.

269
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,532
<i>Cutting through a wall with scissors
isn't as hard as it sounds.</i>

270
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:51,763
<i>Start at an electrical socket</i>

271
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:54,082
<i>and saw through the hard surface
of the drywall,</i>

272
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:56,832
<i>and the lower layers
are a lot easier.</i>

273
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:58,555
Gauze,

274
00:13:58,795 --> 00:13:59,795
aspirin.

275
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:01,615
This kit is terrible.

276
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:05,902
We're gonna need to search desks
and purses for some real pain meds.

277
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,825
You can do it with that.

278
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,565
With gauze?

279
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:11,675
Right.

280
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,725
Where'd you get your medical degree?

281
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:16,895
Wait for the water.

282
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:22,255
I'll look through these desks and
meet you back at the conference room.

283
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,422
What?

284
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,152
You got armed guards
at the only exit.

285
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,745
You think I'm gonna fight my way out
with a stapler?

286
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,455
Water's ready.

287
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,165
And look around for some towels.

288
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:06,642
<i>In an enclosed space,</i>

289
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:10,942
<i>getting around a cellphone jammer is
a game of who's got the stronger signal.</i>

290
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:14,242
<i>A cellphone jammer broadcasts
a powerful signal</i>

291
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,585
<i>over a range of frequencies,
but it can't compete</i>

292
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:20,769
<i>with an entire ethernet
wired to serve as one big antenna.</i>

293
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:23,198
So, I said no more stress,
no more work,

294
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:26,535
and no more getting married.

295
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:28,092
Life is too short.

296
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,803
How many beach houses
do I even need?

297
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:32,264
- How many do you have?
- Six.

298
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:37,006
Seven? It doesn't matter.
I'm always on vacation.

299
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:39,688
To me, true relaxation
is a state of mind.

300
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,915
- Do you have to get that?
- No. No.

301
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:48,863
You know, I like to relax, too.

302
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:55,161
You would love my place in Antigua.
Hammock on the white sand beach.

303
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,289
Clothes are optional.

304
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:02,035
Excuse me.

305
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:06,705
This better be good, Mikey.

306
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:10,145
<i>I'm at Broward Private Trust
trapped in a bank heist.</i>

307
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,132
It's Prescott. He's a pro.

308
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:15,557
His guys have killed the landlines
and brought a cell jammer.

309
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:18,268
Any cops, any resistance,
and it gets bloody.

310
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,812
- Just tell me what you need, Mike.
- <i>I need you and Fi</i>

311
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,412
to blast a door to the outside.

312
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:25,734
Alleyside wall,
20 feet in from the north.

313
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,695
Alleyside wall, 20 feet in.
You got it. I'm on my way.

314
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:31,925
Is everything okay?

315
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:34,927
Yeah. Well, not really, no.

316
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:38,913
My buddy's being held hostage at a bank,
and I got to bust him out.

317
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:41,668
- It's true.
- We should call the police.

318
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,701
No. No. No. You can't do that.

319
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:47,297
It's complicated,
but there's nothing to worry about,

320
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,165
and I'll call you later.

321
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,705
- These are for the doc.
- Where is he?

322
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:57,765
Go find him.

323
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:08,003
<i>The massive air pressure
that makes air hammers effective</i>

324
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:09,527
<i>also makes them dangerous.</i>

325
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,909
<i>Tamper in any way
with the locking collar</i>

326
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,578
<i>that holds the bit in place,
and the air hammer</i>

327
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:22,374
<i>becomes a very inaccurate gun
with a single bullet.</i>

328
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:26,425
Not here.

329
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,795
Keep looking.

330
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,829
<i>Mixing medications
is always a bad idea,</i>

331
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,244
<i>especially when one's an upper
and one's a downer.</i>

332
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:45,744
<i>Anxiety and allergy meds together</i>

333
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,399
<i>are a scary combination,</i>

334
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,444
<i>and that's before you add the caffeine
of an energy drink.</i>

335
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:54,197
There you are.
What took you so long?

336
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,515
I was just...

337
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,859
This is for the pain.

338
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:26,521
- Who said I was in pain?
- If you're not now, you will be.

339
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,566
By the way, that green chair in my loft,
it was my favorite.

340
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:32,555
Let's go, Fi.

341
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:36,602
You're just annoyed 'cause
Mike called me first and not you.

342
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,264
He's in the middle of a bank heist.

343
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:40,773
- He's not thinking clearly.
- I'm the one who should be annoyed.

344
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:43,926
I was having lunch with the woman
of my dreams and had to leave.

345
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:45,170
What are you gonna do?

346
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:47,524
You know, being Mike's first call
is a big responsibility.

347
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,902
In case you're wondering,
you'd be my 19th call.

348
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:52,435
I'd call Madeline
before I called you.

349
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:56,528
<i>Experience with battlefield medicine</i>

350
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,436
<i>may not make you as precise
as an ER surgeon...</i>

351
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,388
Oh, come on.

352
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,558
<i>But after you've stitched up
a few people under artillery fire,</i>

353
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:05,268
<i>you can handle outside pressure.</i>

354
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,270
Almost.

355
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:10,345
Got it.

356
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,655
Oh, god.

357
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:23,661
We're making some progress on the wall,
but they're checking on us.

358
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,206
- We need maybe 20 minutes.
- You've got to go faster.

359
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:27,511
Keep working.

360
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:31,753
They're emptying
the vault downstairs.

361
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,339
- They're taking everything.
- How long before they clear it all out?

362
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,257
I don't know. There's hundreds
of safe-deposit boxes down there.

363
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:41,182
And he wasn't lying
about the silent alarm.

364
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,615
No call went out.

365
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:45,266
- No help is coming.
- Hide the hole.

366
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,649
Prescott wants you downstairs.
Let's go.

367
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,295
Thanks.

368
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,735
Michael said 20 feet in
from the street?

369
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:12,385
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

370
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:15,172
Well, what's the signal?
How are we timing this?

371
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,455
He didn't say.

372
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,509
- He didn't say?
- He's Mike. He's improvising.

373
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:23,052
Michael called you to tell you
to blow a hole in the wall of a bank,

374
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:26,242
- and you didn't think to ask when?
- Look, it was a brief conversation.

375
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,812
We didn't talk about shoes
or movies either.

376
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,645
Could you just place
the explosives already?

377
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,491
- Fix him.
- What happened?

378
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:46,327
The air hammer broke,
and the piston came off in his leg.

379
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,354
Keep him alive.

380
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:52,335
I'm gonna give you
something for the pain.

381
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,712
<i>People are too trusting
when it comes to pills.</i>

382
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,005
<i>They'll take whatever
a doctor hands them.</i>

383
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:00,425
I need to cauterize the wound.
I need to use your liquid-nitrogen gun.

384
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,772
You need to use something else.

385
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:05,305
Like what? Did you bring
an electrosurgical generator?

386
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:16,150
<i>Liquid nitrogen can cool
a wound to 150 below,</i>

387
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,083
<i>freezing the cells
and cutting off blood flow.</i>

388
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:21,505
Tie this around his leg, tight.

389
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:24,585
Either help me
or get me someone who will.

390
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:27,855
Up here?

391
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:33,082
<i>Supercooling also damages metal.</i>

392
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:36,412
<i>Freeze the inside of a gun,
and the next time it gets hot,</i>

393
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,005
<i>it'll rip apart as if it's loaded
with the wrong ammo.</i>

394
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,102
<i>Prescott, get up here.</i>

395
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:43,760
<i>We've got trouble
in the conference room.</i>

396
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:47,402
- Where's the knife?
- There's no knife. There isn't a knife.

397
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:49,682
This guy was trying to cut
into the office next door.

398
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:55,939
Come here.

399
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:59,662
What did I tell you
about the rules, huh?

400
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:00,845
Please, I...

401
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:02,852
I have a wife. I have kids.

402
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:04,926
They need their father.
I'm begging you.

403
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:08,785
Look, if I make an exception, I mean,
what kind of message does it send?

404
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,545
Wait. Wait.
You got the wrong guy.

405
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:15,166
It was me.

406
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,064
Just can't stop causing trouble,
can you, huh?

407
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,719
Should've done this the first time.

408
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:31,795
God!

409
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:33,142
Shoot him!

410
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,397
Move!

411
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,908
You got shards in your hand.
You're gushing arterial blood.

412
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,528
I'm the only guy here who can save
your hand, probably your life.

413
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:46,745
Tell your man to back off
or find another doctor.

414
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:50,118
Come with me.
Get the rest of them downstairs.

415
00:22:56,405 --> 00:22:57,905
Four more. Let's go.

416
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:03,605
We're running about 20 minutes late.
Should I call the boat?

417
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:04,996
Get downstairs.

418
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,529
- I still need to...
- Get downstairs.

419
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:13,192
How's your plan going?

420
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:15,176
We're not getting out.
I'm working on plan B.

421
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:17,902
- I need your help. Do you trust me?
- Yeah, what do you need?

422
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:21,535
I need you to collapse in that doorway.
Sell it. Buy me time.

423
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,199
- What's going on?
- I think he's going into shock.

424
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:28,272
I can't move him.
I'll need a couple of minutes.

425
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:29,455
You got one.

426
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:34,437
Mike, let's get this done.

427
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,702
I got a beer-drinking angel
to get back to.

428
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:39,222
- You ready to rock?
- <i>Forget the escape plan.</i>

429
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:41,335
<i>Prescott's moving
everybody downstairs.</i>

430
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:44,005
These guys are calling
a getaway boat on walkies.

431
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,467
<i>If you can listen in, locate the signal.
Maybe we can get some leverage.</i>

432
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:49,886
I'll try to keep people
from getting hurt in here.

433
00:23:59,794 --> 00:24:01,962
Come on. Downstairs.
Let's go. Now.

434
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:05,106
- All right.
- <i>Elevators have so many safety devices</i>

435
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:06,944
<i>that they're easy to sabotage.</i>

436
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,162
<i>Disable any part,
and the entire system shuts down.</i>

437
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,055
Hurry up. Move it!

438
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:18,182
Locate the getaway boat.
That's our plan.

439
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:19,382
This is Miami.

440
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:22,852
Look, we just need to find the frequency
that Prescott's walkies are on.

441
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,657
I think we should
set off the charges,

442
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,890
blow a hole in the wall, rush in.

443
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:29,242
- Beats waiting out here.
- Yeah, that's great.

444
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:30,973
Let's get Mike
and the hostages killed

445
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:34,263
because you have
the attention span of a 3-year-old.

446
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:46,692
Elevator's busted.

447
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:48,765
You're lucky.

448
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:51,165
I don't see any shrapnel,

449
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:53,714
and no bones look damaged.

450
00:24:54,455 --> 00:24:58,105
Use the word lucky again,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

451
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:00,289
Hold still.
I need to sterilize the wound.

452
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,359
This bank!

453
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:07,795
It's cursed.

454
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:10,216
That's it, isn't it?

455
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,076
It's cursed.

456
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:13,612
My gun,

457
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,645
the air hammer, the elevator.

458
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:19,722
- What's wrong with this place?
- I'm gonna need more tape

459
00:25:19,805 --> 00:25:21,607
and a splint.

460
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,490
I think there's something
I can use upstairs.

461
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:26,605
Do you need any meds?

462
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:28,895
What do you think, huh?

463
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:32,260
Let me blow your hand off and find out
if you need something for the pain.

464
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,664
Angela, hey, it's Sam.
How you doing?

465
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:43,585
Is your friend okay?

466
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:46,744
Well, he's still trapped inside,
but it's kind of a quiet time,

467
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:50,387
so I thought I would just call
and say hi. So...

468
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:52,455
Hi.

469
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:53,512
Hi?

470
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,842
I was thinking later,
we could get some drinks.

471
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:59,262
I know this quiet spot
that makes great a mojito.

472
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:02,782
Well, I was meeting a friend, but...

473
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,165
Playtime's over.

474
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:08,732
Angela, I got to run. Hey, don't make
any plans. I'll call you back.

475
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,241
Sounds encrypted.

476
00:26:12,324 --> 00:26:15,656
So I was wasting my time
while you were buttering up your bimbo?

477
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:17,392
Look, we got the frequency.

478
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,244
There can't be that many marinas
around here in range of their walkies.

479
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:25,302
Okay, that's not good.

480
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:27,969
Those cops start asking questions
about that truck out front,

481
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:29,702
hostages are gonna die.

482
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,280
One of us needs to distract the cop,

483
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:34,508
and the other one needs
to track down the getaway boat.

484
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:36,344
And here I forgot to shave my legs.

485
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,635
Delivery trucks.

486
00:26:45,815 --> 00:26:47,965
- Hey, stop! Give me that!
- No!

487
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:49,815
She is stealing my tip jar!

488
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:52,782
This is compensation
for you leering at me.

489
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:54,987
You should arrest her.
<i>Es una ladrona!</i>

490
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,865
- Arrest him for sexual harassment.
- We're not arresting anyone.

491
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,034
You're gonna stand there
while I'm objectified?

492
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,746
I say we go to the station,
hash this out... You, me... him.

493
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,715
- What do you say?
- <i>Unit 204, dispatch.</i>

494
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:08,292
<i>Got a domestic disturbance
at Ocean and 4th. You close?</i>

495
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,627
10-4. I'm on my way.

496
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:12,272
If you'd like to file a report,

497
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:15,255
you should go down
to the police station, okay?

498
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:20,263
<i>Una cortadito, por favor.</i>

499
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,125
We win yet?

500
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:26,342
I'm working on it.
I need some meds.

501
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:28,852
- Things okay?
- Yeah, hey, it's Miami.

502
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:30,485
The sun, the girls...

503
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:32,755
What's not to love?

504
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:36,279
If something bad starts happening,
make your move.

505
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:41,165
These should do the trick.

506
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:45,451
<i>Life with a hypochondriac mother</i>

507
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:48,320
<i>gives you a useful knowledge
of pharmaceuticals.</i>

508
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:49,472
Those are for pain?

509
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:53,282
<i>In low doses,
pilocarpine cures dry mouth.</i>

510
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:56,705
I'll take them after you do.

511
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:03,654
<i>In high doses,
it has roughly the same effect</i>

512
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:06,088
<i>as a sarin gas attack.</i>

513
00:28:07,705 --> 00:28:08,705
Satisfied?

514
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:12,648
See what happens to you first.

515
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,475
- Still want that splint for your hand?
- Sure.

516
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:19,032
We're going upstairs.

517
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,265
You, keep an eye on the hostages.

518
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:30,185
Back in a minute.

519
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,182
What's it mean
if my fingers are feeling numb

520
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:36,252
and I'm getting sort of nauseous?

521
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:38,531
Do you have a headache,
any palpitations,

522
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:41,010
any tingling,
been drinking caffeine?

523
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,382
Yeah. Why?
Is that bad?

524
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:44,772
Sounds pretty serious.
I should check you out.

525
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,682
I'm just gonna take your pulse.

526
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:50,595
I'm just taking your pulse.
That's it. I'm just taking it.

527
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:55,691
<i>In a weakened state, you want to avoid
pressure on your carotid artery.</i>

528
00:28:56,495 --> 00:29:00,545
<i>Block the blood flow to your brain,
and you black out in four seconds.</i>

529
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,262
<i>The coating on tablets and medicine</i>

530
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:12,063
<i>keeps them from dissolving
in your stomach right away,</i>

531
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:14,560
<i>which buys you a little time
to find some privacy</i>

532
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:17,713
<i>and do the only safe thing.
Get them out of your system.</i>

533
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:26,665
Hey, buddy.

534
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:29,125
I'm supposed to repair a radio
in a guy's boat,

535
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,073
but I'm late,
and I forgot the slip number.

536
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:33,062
Is there somebody hanging around
looking pissed?

537
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,530
End of the pier.

538
00:29:34,835 --> 00:29:36,785
Thanks.
You have a good one.

539
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,105
Prescott.

540
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:58,342
- Vault's cleared out.
- It's about time.

541
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:01,272
Let's put everyone in the vault
and get the hell out of here.

542
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:05,134
Everyone in the vault now.
They've seen our face. They die.

543
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:11,185
Let's go.
Everybody into the vault.

544
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:13,852
There isn't much air in the vault.
We're all gonna suffocate.

545
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:15,771
- Should we attack them?
- No, not yet.

546
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:19,004
- I don't know how long we can wait.
- Just trust me.

547
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:39,044
Hey, Mike, I'm at the marina
looking at the getaway boat.

548
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:42,062
We got any moves here?

549
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:44,129
Prescott's shoving
everyone into the fault,

550
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:45,562
and no one's walking out.

551
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:49,648
You want to ask Prescott if he'll trade
his hostages for the boat driver?

552
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:50,925
Not likely.

553
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:57,112
- What about an operation Quicksilver?
- Quicksilver. You mean like WW II?

554
00:30:57,195 --> 00:31:00,065
You're talking about a bunch of tanks
and the whole Normandy invasion force.

555
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:02,458
Yeah, but instead
of the Normandy invasion force,

556
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:05,602
I have a Walther with one bullet.
You got to sell this, Sam.

557
00:31:05,685 --> 00:31:07,942
You got to sell it
like you've never sold it before.

558
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:10,875
That's the kind of pep talk I like.
I'm on it.

559
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:27,801
Angela, hi.

560
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:31,665
Hi. I was calling
to leave a message.

561
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:36,011
I think your life is...
is a little too...

562
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,310
fast-paced for me.

563
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:41,148
No, no, no.
That's not true at all.

564
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:43,435
Why are you whispering?

565
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,361
Are you still outside the bank?

566
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:48,425
No, I'm at a marina.

567
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,475
Just taking a stress-free walk
along the ocean,

568
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,302
<i>the breeze blowing in my hair.</i>

569
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:54,870
I might even get a tropical drink.

570
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,018
Hands in the air.

571
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:03,342
A stress-free walk.

572
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:06,642
Well, as much as I hate to admit it,
Angela, you're probably right.

573
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,575
We're just not meant to be.

574
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:11,011
Enjoy one of those beers
in Antigua for me.

575
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,348
You bastard.
You ruined something special.

576
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,128
<i>If you have one bullet</i>

577
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:31,131
<i>and you need to take down
three armed guys in close quarters,</i>

578
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:33,512
<i>you're betting your life
on a lot of lucky breaks.</i>

579
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:35,972
<i>It's the kind of bet
you don't want to make</i>

580
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,162
<i>unless you have to.</i>

581
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:40,175
There you are.

582
00:32:40,285 --> 00:32:42,352
Your guy had a stroke
in the kitchen.

583
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,712
He needs immediate
medical attention.

584
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:48,090
You want me to put him in the vault
or just take care of him right here?

585
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,792
You're not listening to me.

586
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,972
Either you get your friend
into an ambulance with the proper meds,

587
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,872
- or he's not gonna make it.
- Well, I guess he's not gonna make it,

588
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:57,405
and neither are you.

589
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:01,267
<i>Prescott.</i>

590
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:05,357
- What's going on?
- <i>Prescott,</i>

591
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:07,215
they're at the boat.

592
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:09,062
They shot me.
Why didn't you tell us?

593
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:11,447
- Why didn't I tell you what?
- Who we were robbing.

594
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:14,332
<i>Why didn't you tell us
who owned the bank?</i>

595
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:15,242
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

596
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,052
<i>You didn't know, did you?</i>

597
00:33:17,135 --> 00:33:18,185
<i>We're dead.</i>

598
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:19,565
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

599
00:33:20,155 --> 00:33:21,655
<i>They're coming back.</i>

600
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:22,972
<i>They're coming back.</i>

601
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:24,001
<i>We're all dead!</i>

602
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:25,645
We're all dead!

603
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,025
Tom Prescott?

604
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,594
Was it dumb luck
that you chose my bank,

605
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:37,514
or did you and your buddies decide
that today was a good day

606
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,725
<i>to make the worst mistake
of your lives?</i>

607
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:43,065
- Who is this?
- That's not important.

608
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:46,717
What's important is that you
and your friends are robbing my bank,

609
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:49,895
<i>and no one, I mean no one,
does that to me.</i>

610
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:54,365
<i>You think you got yourself a good plan
with your getaway truck and your boat?</i>

611
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,991
<i>Well, I got a plan, too.</i>

612
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,965
If there is a scratch
on anyone in my bank,

613
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,845
<i>you will all die.</i>

614
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:04,347
<i>If there is a single dollar
missing from my vault,</i>

615
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:06,722
<i>you all die.</i>

616
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:07,794
You hearing this?

617
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:10,756
<i>If there is a single hostage taken,
you will all die.</i>

618
00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:17,478
<i>In fact, if you do anything</i>

619
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:20,961
<i>other than walking
out of my bank alone right now,</i>

620
00:34:21,044 --> 00:34:24,625
<i>you will all know such pain
as you have never imagined.</i>

621
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:28,775
So, who the hell is that guy?

622
00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:30,317
He owns this bank?

623
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:33,904
He's lying.
I looked up everything about this bank.

624
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,615
Well, you obviously
didn't look up enough.

625
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:39,827
What did you get us into?

626
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,788
How does he even know we're here?

627
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,486
Shut up.

628
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:46,712
It's not important!

629
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:50,838
One evening, a patient was brought into
my clinic in the middle of the night.

630
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:54,042
He was tortured so badly I couldn't
believe he was still breathing.

631
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,575
A man was with him.

632
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,301
It was the man on your radio.

633
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:59,096
I'll never forget the voice.

634
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:03,517
He put a gun to my head and explained
that my patient had robbed him

635
00:35:03,855 --> 00:35:05,878
and that he wanted me to save him

636
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:08,605
so the pain would last longer.

637
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:10,539
I did what I could.

638
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:13,672
He said to come here for my money,
my blood money.

639
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:15,781
There's a place
between life and death.

640
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:18,282
Amazing how long a man
can linger there.

641
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:20,604
That's enough, all right?

642
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:25,914
Bring everything upstairs.
We're getting out of here.

643
00:35:28,155 --> 00:35:29,155
Tony?

644
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,187
Tony, can you hear me?

645
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:34,840
What the hell is going on?

646
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:36,550
I know this guy.

647
00:35:36,795 --> 00:35:40,929
He'll have people outside the bank,
in your truck, and on your boat.

648
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:43,639
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

649
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:45,588
Shut your mouth.

650
00:35:45,671 --> 00:35:47,872
We've got the money.
That's just some voice on the radio.

651
00:35:47,955 --> 00:35:51,809
Yeah, but he's a voice on our radio.
He's on our boat!

652
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,392
How does that happen?

653
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:56,362
I mean, what happened
to the guys in the vault, huh?

654
00:35:56,445 --> 00:36:00,242
- He's talking about our truck!
- There's nothing wrong with our truck!

655
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,992
Let's just get outta here.

656
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:20,427
Nothing's wrong with the truck?
Does that look like nothing?

657
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,304
Pick up the bag.

658
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:24,473
No way. I am gonna...

659
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:34,733
Unbelievable.

660
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,193
Just not your day, I guess.

661
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:54,753
Drop it! Drop it!

662
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,371
Hands on your head!

663
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:19,862
So, where were we?

664
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:25,158
I think we were deciding whether
we were going to destroy each other.

665
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:29,538
Well, you've already had
enough opportunities to let me die.

666
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,415
Maybe I just like the challenge.

667
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:42,292
I'm gonna go pass out at the local ER,
and when I wake up,

668
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:45,475
I'll take care of the loft
and the thing with Barry.

669
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:50,755
As long as you're in a helpful mood,

670
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:54,801
you think I could add
one more favor to the list?

671
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:00,092
And then they moved us
into the vault.

672
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:01,721
We knew there wasn't much time.

673
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:04,152
I mean, I really thought
it was the end,

674
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:07,420
but your son and Mr. Bly
were so brave, Madeline.

675
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:12,705
- Michael, what are you doing?
- I left something in here.

676
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:14,936
You just assumed
I was never gonna broil anything?

677
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,969
Well, so far I've been right.

678
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:19,338
Prescott will be leaving you alone
from now on.

679
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:23,452
You might want to select your dates
a little more carefully in the future.

680
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:24,535
I will.

681
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,052
Thank you so much.

682
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:27,429
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

683
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:30,325
I'm off, too.

684
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:34,342
What? You... you're going?
You didn't even spend the night.

685
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:36,563
I resolved my toxic-mold issue.

686
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,316
Board of health says
my place is safe again.

687
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:44,845
I was thinking of ordering takeout,
but if you're going...

688
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:50,369
Actually, I don't have
to leave right away.

689
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:53,145
Takeout sounds good.

690
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:04,365
Bly says you're off the hook.

691
00:39:04,554 --> 00:39:07,562
He was just using you
to get under my skin anyway.

692
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,562
Listen, Michael, I feel really bad about
the whole tacky business with the wire.

693
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:14,512
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love how I look with a shaved chest,

694
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:17,061
- but rolling over on you...
- I ask you to take risks.

695
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:20,282
It comes with the territory.
But next time, we'll have a signal.

696
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:23,688
If you're wired, tip me off
by offering to pay for lunch.

697
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:24,771
Perfect.

698
00:39:24,985 --> 00:39:27,990
You know, I think I'm gonna get out
of town for a bit. I got to decompress.

699
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:30,499
- Sounds good. Stay safe.
- All right, man.

700
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:32,792
I had to take the guy
on the boat down,

701
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,512
get him to say the right things
at the right time.

702
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:37,089
While you were putting on a show,

703
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:39,928
I got rid of the cops,
and I wired a truck to blow.

704
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,003
Mike, back me up.

705
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:42,469
I think it's pretty clear

706
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,840
my tactical maneuverings
pretty much saved the day here.

707
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:48,882
- You feeling underappreciated?
- Oh, no. He appreciates himself plenty.

708
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:52,292
He's been insufferable ever since
you called him first yesterday.

709
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,172
Fi, look, don't be insulted.

710
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:56,032
You're good with the hands-on stuff.

711
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:57,936
- The simple mechanical things.
- Simple?

712
00:39:58,265 --> 00:39:59,604
Like wiring a truck to blow?

713
00:39:59,995 --> 00:40:01,462
An important task, yes,

714
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:03,942
but one a very intelligent monkey
could perform.

715
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,237
I'm just saying there's a reason why
I'm number one on the speed dial.

716
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:09,614
Sam, for your information,
I called Fi first.

717
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,068
You didn't pick up,

718
00:40:14,035 --> 00:40:15,871
so in the future,
I'm gonna call Sam first.

719
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:26,002
It's all the originals,
everything I had on you.

720
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:28,482
I love your attention
to detail, Michael.

721
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:30,469
This would have been quite
the career-ender.

722
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,722
Well, I know
a little something about that...

723
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,626
Although I wasn't expecting you
to counter with even better leverage.

724
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:36,842
Well-played.

725
00:40:36,925 --> 00:40:38,977
This would be a good
Michael Westen story

726
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,395
if people were allowed
to tell Michael Westen stories.

727
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:49,832
- So.
- So...

728
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,139
Any luck trucking down
that Cayman Islands account?

729
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:54,373
I don't have to tell you,
we have ways of investigating

730
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:57,078
that most people don't know about.
No one has the reach that we do,

731
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:58,211
but this...

732
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:03,001
I found the bank
and I even found the banker,

733
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,735
but the account...

734
00:41:05,845 --> 00:41:07,295
It's just a number.

735
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:11,185
- No name? No organization?
- Nothing.

736
00:41:11,915 --> 00:41:14,399
It gets worse.
That account was being monitored.

737
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:16,681
An electronic trip wire of sorts.

738
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:18,433
And you think you tripped it?

739
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,412
Might have been me.
It might have been Barry.

740
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:24,945
Look, whoever you're looking for,
they know you're coming.

741
00:41:31,745 --> 00:41:32,745
Good luck.
