1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,900
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,000
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,700
We got a burn notice.
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,900
<i>when you're burned,
You've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,300
<i>no cash, no credit,
No job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,900
<i>you're stuck in whatever city
They decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,400
Where am I?
Miami.

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>you do whatever work
Comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>you rely on anyone
Who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,900
<i>a trigger-happy
Ex-girlfriend...</i>

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,800
Should we shoot them?

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,300
<i>...an old friend who's
Informing on you to the FBI...</i>

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,900
You know spies --
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,900
<i>...family, too...</i>

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,100
Is that your mom again?

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,500
<i>...if you're desperate.
Someone needs your help.</i>

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,200
<i>bottom line... until
You figure out who burned you,</i>

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,100
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
<i>for most people,
A night out at the Miami clubs</i>

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,000
<i>is a chance to see and be seen.</i>

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,600
<i>when you're under
Government surveillance,</i>

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,900
<i>it's a different story.</i>

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>you still want to know
Who's watching you,</i>

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,900
<i>but the reasons are
A little different.</i>

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,000
Looks like
You've had visitors.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
Took them long enough.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,200
<i>sprinkle a mixture of flour
And dayglo powder on your floor</i>

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
<i>before you go out,</i>

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,000
<i>and you'll know whether
You've had any visitors</i>

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,400
<i>and what they were after.</i>

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
A three-man team?

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Sounds about right...
Two sneakers and a loafer.

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
They're not terribly careful,
Your surveillance.

34
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>you don't always have
To get that clever, though.</i>

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,200
<i>sometimes they want you to know
What they're up to.</i>

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,700
They weren't hiding.

37
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,600
I miss your FBI detail.
They were really kind of sweet.

38
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,500
The feds were errand boys.

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,000
But these guys,
On the other hand,

40
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,000
Might actually know
Something useful.

41
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,100
Honestly, I don't know
Why they bother.

42
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,100
They should just put a bullet in
Your head and be done with it.

43
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,700
Apparently, I'm more valuable
Alive than dead.

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
But I'm sure they'll take it
Under advisement.

45
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,400
You think
They're listening?

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,800
Yeah, mom.

47
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,600
Michael, there are men here
Outside the house with guns!

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
What?
What men?

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,100
I don't know.
They've been watching.

50
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,800
They're coming inside.
Call the cops.
Call them right now.

51
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,200
Take the van
And cover the street.

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Not a problem.

53
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,900
Stop right there.

54
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,000
It's okay.
It's okay.

55
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,700
Mom?

56
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,800
Mom!

57
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,200
14 minutes?
Aw, I figured you for 12.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,900
It's probably
Those causeways, though.

59
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,200
You'll have to forgive
My sketchy Miami geography.

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm new in town.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,100
We nearly got lost
Coming from your place.

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,400
Mom, you okay?

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,200
They cut the phone lines.
I couldn't call the police.

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,900
They broke in...

65
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,300
It's okay.
It's okay.

66
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,900
You want to tell me
Who you are?

67
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm the new man
In your life.

68
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,000
It's okay.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
You pissed off
A lot of people,

70
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,100
Getting your hands on
The homeland-security directive

71
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,700
Authorizing
Your burn notice.

72
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,500
You're
A private citizen now.

73
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,200
You're not supposed
To touch that kind of thing.

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
I asked nicely.

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,300
You wanted attention
From someone

76
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,000
A little higher up
On the food chain.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,600
That's about right.

78
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,800
It's your lucky day.
Here I am.

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
And here I will stay...

80
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Until you back off.

81
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,600
Michael,
Why are they doing this?

82
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you in some kind
Of trouble?

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,300
Not now.
Not now, mom.

84
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,700
Your problem is with me,
Not with her.

85
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,000
You have no business
Coming here.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, no, but we do.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,300
See, you're a major
Security risk.

88
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,200
You just assaulted
Two federal agents.

89
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,500
Go ahead. Arrest me.

90
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,100
I'd like to take a look
At the indictment.

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,900
Wouldn't you, now?
Yeah.

92
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,800
Listen, you be a good boy,
And I'll get out of your hair.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Until then,
I'll need to keep looking.

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
God!

95
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
Sorry.
You can't be too careful.

96
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,600
<i>there are two kinds
Of government surveillance...</i>

97
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,500
<i>the kind that's there
To look for something</i>

98
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,300
<i>and the kind that's just there
To make your life difficult.</i>

99

100
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,800
Mike, you get problems
Like that, call me.

101
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,400
I still got pull
In that department.

102
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Maybe I can get them
To go home.

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,500
I don't want them to go home.
I need this guy in town.

104
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,400
I need to know who he is
And what he knows.

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,800
I can help you
With that, then.

106
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,700
I tried.
I got your voice mail.

107
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,400
Yeah, sorry about that.

108
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
It's the new lady friend.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,300
She puts a lot of demands on my
Time, if you know what I mean.

110
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
I don't, and I don't
Want to know.

111
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, at least
I'm off your couch.

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,300
So, who do you think
Was at your mom's?

113
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,400
They sound like charmers.

114
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,900
You tell me. What are
Your FBI friends telling you?

115
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,700
Nothing.

116
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,100
They'd be pissed
If they found out

117
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,600
Somebody pulled rank
On them.

118
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,900
These intelligence outfits...
They're springing up

119
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,000
Faster than frickin' starbucks
These days.

120
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,900
Let me know
If you hear anything.

121
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,300
Mmm, where are you going?

122
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,700
I got to scrounge up a job.

123
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,800
My mom's house
Needs remodeling.

124
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
I might have to call lucy.

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
What about
My s.e.a.l. Buddy,

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
That thing
I was telling you about?

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Is that a job or a favor?

128
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,300
No, it's a job.
It's real money.

129
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,100
He's a great guy, Mike.
He saved my ass several times.

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,900
He's a boat-repo guy.

131
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,200
It's a tough job.
He just needs some muscle.

132
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,700
Muscle? Great.

133
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,700
Hmm.

134
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,600
There she is.

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,300
There you go, Sammy.
Thank you, doll.

136
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Plant one right there.

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You sure I can't
Get you anything?

138
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,100
No, thank you.

139
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,300
I have out-of-town guests
I need to attend to.

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
You have fun.

141
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,600
Mike, call me, now.

142
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,700
<i>you can tie up
A lot of resources</i>

143
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
<i>by keeping
A bugged phone line open.</i>

144
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,200
<i>as long as it's open,</i>

145
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,100
<i>they're supposed
To keep listening.</i>

146
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,800
<i>you have reached the consulate
Of the commonwealth of belize.</i>

147
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,900
<i>leave your message
After the tone.</i>

148
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,100
D-d-7-2-4-7-8.

149
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,400
<i>say a few cryptic
Things now and then</i>

150
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,900
<i>and they'll be stuck
In their little van,</i>

151
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,800
<i>trying to figure out
What the hell you're doing.</i>

152
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,700
5:00 p.m., march 15th, 20%.

153
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,600
<i>they can't go home,
Can't grab a bite to eat,</i>

154
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
<i>can't take a leak.</i>

155
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,000
<i>...and a limited number
Of viewers</i>

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
<i>who are also gonna be
Lucky enough to buy...</i>

157
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,200
<i>and the longer they're stuck in
A van with a set of headphones,</i>

158
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,900
<i>the more you can find out
About them.</i>

159
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,800
<i>just look at that round
Cut... Brilliant.</i>

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Appreciate you coming, Mike.

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,000
Sam's told me a good deal
About you.

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,900
Really?

163
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,300
Come on, Mike,
Don't be like that.

164
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,500
Virg is one of us.

165
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,000
S.e.a.l. Teams,
Panama, iraq, china.

166
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,100
Last time I checked,
I had top-secret clearance.

167
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,900
But I haven't checked
In a while.

168
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,900
Sam tells me
You're some kind of spy...

169
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,200
...or used to be.

170
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Y'all want a beer?

171
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Yeah, I'll take one.

172
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,500
I knew you'd want one, Sam.
What about you, Mike?

173
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,900
It might be hot
In that jacket.

174
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,400
No, I'm good.
What's the job?

175
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,300
Pain in my ass.

176
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,400
I was supposed to repo
A donzi 27 zr

177
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,600
For a guy who's done me
A few favors.

178
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,900
But I went
To pick the thing up,

179
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,200
And a couple of jamaicans
Tuned me up but good.

180
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,700
Damn embarrassing.

181
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,500
Oh, come on, they had 30 years
On you and a baseball bat.

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,300
Well, I am
On blood thinners.

183
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Goddamn pills
Make me light-headed.

184
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, hell, that's no excuse.
Anyway, now I'm in a bind.

185
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,800
Word gets out I can't hack it...
Ffft!... I'm done.

186
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm not one to ask for help,
But there it is.

187
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,800
That's a fast boat.

188
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,000
Smuggling?

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,400
It's a high-performance
Speedboat

190
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,100
In a crappy, little hellhole
Of a marina.

191
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,600
What the hell else
Is it gonna be?

192
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,000
Maybe cuban cigars,
Maybe grass...

193
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,200
Problem is,
These guys have guns,

194
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,800
And they like
To wave them around.

195
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,800
Listen,
Just pick the thing up,

196
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,600
Point "a" to point "b,"
Ffft!

197
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Oh, is that all?
Point "a" to point "b"?

198
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,900
Well, when you put it
That way...

199
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,700
All right, look, I'd go
Down there with you guys,

200
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,900
But these guys know me.

201
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
2 grand each,
Cash on delivery.

202
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,100
My buddy mason
Is gonna be waiting for it

203
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,200
At a repair warehouse
Up on 23rd.

204
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,100
Mike, we get Fi involved,
We got a three-man team.

205
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
Do it just like that personnel
Carrier in bulgaria.

206
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,600
I mean, look, I got to get my
New lady friend something nice,

207
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,200
And you sure as hell
Need the cash.

208
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,700
Free gator steaks in it
For you...

209
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,200
Best in the everglades.

210
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
I'll think about it.

211
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,500
You're towing my car.

212
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
Hey! Yeah.
There might be evidence in here.

213
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Evidence?

214
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,200
There's a busted 8-track
And one of my mom's lamps

215
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm trying
To piece back together.

216
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,300
Well, I guess
We'll find out, won't we?

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, by the way,
We noticed suspicious activity

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
On your phone line,
So we took care of it for you.

219
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,200
Oh, thanks.

220
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Alas, you won't have
Phone service for a while.

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,500
Hey, you want a stick
Of gum?

222
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Yeah, thanks.
I didn't catch your name.

223
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
No, you didn't.

224
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,600
Yeah, Sam, about that job...
I'm in.

225
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,700
Oh, oh, and tell virgil
I need to borrow his truck.

226
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,600
Mmm, he's cute.

227
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,100
We're gonna take his boat.

228
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,000
I doubt he's gonna
Give you his phone number.

229
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,800
Who knows?
I've had stranger dates.

230
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,700
So, what's
Your cover i.d., Mikey?

231
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,100
I think I'm gonna go with...

232
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,100
Devoted employee.

233
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,000
How's...homer?

234
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
Homer.
I like it.

235
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,100
<i>as a rule, spies don't like
Dealing with cops.</i>

236
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,000
<i>covert ops are illegal
By definition.</i>

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,500
<i>if they were legal, they
Wouldn't need to be covert.</i>

238
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,000
Want me to set up
That one, Mike?

239
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,200
The sailboat?

240
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Yeah, that's good.

241
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,900
<i>still, the police
Can be useful</i>

242
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,700
<i>if you need a little insurance
Against people shooting.</i>

243
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Yeah, hi.

244
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,100
Um, boy, I don't know
If this is the sort of thing

245
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,000
I should be calling
The police about, but...

246
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,500
Oh, I'm at the marina
Down on waverly street.

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,900
Yeah, I saw some men

248
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,200
Loading bags full
Of white powder into a sailboat.

249
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,000
Kind of creeped me out, you know?

250
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,400
Hey, there!

251
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,700
Can I help you?

252
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Yes, sir.
I'm here for that boat.

253
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,300
Oh, you're with
The repo man, huh?

254
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,800
My boss, hell of a guy.

255
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,300
He's like a father to me.
You beat him up pretty good.

256
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,500
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

257
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,900
I tried to explain
The situation to him, you know?

258
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,100
But he forced me
To clarify my position.

259
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,500
This is my property.

260
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,300
We've got paperwork
That says otherwise.

261
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,500
Hmm, well,
That paperwork is misinformed.

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hmm. Why don't we ask the police
To sort this out?

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
I mean,
They're right over there.

264
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
I could holler over to them
Right now

265
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,100
And ask them
To come sort this out.

266
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,100
That's a nice piece.
You gonna shoot me with it?

267
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,600
Probably gonna have to
Shoot her, too.

268
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
It might be tough to explain
To the cops.

269
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,700
Or I could just
Start screaming.

270
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,100
The way I see it,
If this is your boat,

271
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,300
These guns are registered,
And you're 100% squeaky clean...

272
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,200
You have nothing
To worry about.

273
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,300
But if not...

274
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,800
All right.

275
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,700
You're making
A serious mistake, man.

276
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,200
You do this...

277
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,700
There's no
Turning back, you know?

278
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,500
I can't leave
Without the boat.

279
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,200
So, if you're gonna shoot us,
Get it done.

280
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,900
Otherwise,
We got places to be.

281
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,600
You know, we'll deal with this
Another time,

282
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
When I got a little bit
More privacy.

283
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,100
Ooh, leather seats.

284
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
I can see why
You're so attached to it.

285
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Pretty lady,
Don't get too comfortable.

286
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,700
I'll see you soon, huh?

287
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,300
I promise.

288
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,900
Easy now.

289
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,100
Whoa!

290
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,700
What you looking for
Back there?

291
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,200
He was confident
He was getting his boat back.

292
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,100
I want to make sure
There's no surprises.

293
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, people get attached
To their vehicles.

294
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,300
I had a cadillac eldorado once.

295
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
That thing was part
Of the family.

296
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,900
Gps tracker.

297
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,200
That's how our jamaican friend
Was gonna find us.

298
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,300
Son of a bitch.

299
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,100
Sam, how well
Do you know virgil?

300
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,000
You trust him?

301
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,800
He's like a brother, Mike.

302
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,400
I mean,
The guy saved my life.

303
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,900
<i>when you're going
Into a meeting cold</i>

304
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,500
<i>with people
You know nothing about,</i>

305
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,400
<i>you have to be extra careful.</i>

306
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,500
<i>pay attention to every detail.</i>

307
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,200
<i>map out an escape route or two
Just in case.</i>

308
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,000
<i>and never, ever show up
As yourself.</i>

309
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,500
You mason?

310
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Yeah.
Who the hell are you?

311
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
You waiting
On a boat delivery?

312
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Yeah, where's virgil?

313
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Oh, he can't make it.
He sent me instead.

314
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,200
I'm one of virgil's drivers.
My name's homer.

315
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,700
Hold on, homer.
Not coming?

316
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,100
What do you mean?
He's supposed to be here.

317
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
You know how he is.

318
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,200
Well, I got your boat outside
With my team.

319
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,500
Team?

320
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,900
You got other guys outside?

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,100
<i>another thing you look for</i>

322
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
<i>is people who seem overly upset
That things have changed,</i>

323
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,400
<i>details that shouldn't
Matter so much.</i>

324
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,500
Damn! Wow! That is
A twin supercharged sterling.

325
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Whoo-wee! I got a 400 horsepower
Back at home.

326
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,900
I work on it a little bit.

327
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,100
<i>some tip-offs aren't so subtle,</i>

328
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
<i>like a detonator
Sitting on enough chloride</i>

329
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,400
<i>to incinerate a city block.</i>

330
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,100
Why don't we move this along?
What do you say?

331
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,700
All right,
Let me go get your boat.

332
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,600
Well, we're all gonna
Go get the boat.

333
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,900
No need to get gun happy.

334
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,100
Calm down.

335
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,700
Put it out!

336
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
It's clear.

337
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,100
I don't think
They followed you.

338
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
It got pretty hairy
Back there.

339
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,800
How well do you know
These clients of yours?

340
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,200
You mean mason?

341
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,000
Like I said,
He did me a few favors.

342
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,200
He had all the paperwork.

343
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
It seemed
Like a simple delivery.

344
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,800
Mason and his friends are cops,
Dirty cops.

345
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,200
What are you
Talking about?

346
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,400
Oh, I wouldn't lie to me
Again, virgil.

347
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,900
They had department-issue glocks
On hip holsters,

348
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,100
A late-model crown vic
In the parking lot.

349
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,600
In fact,
I think they knew you.

350
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
You know what it sounded like
To me?!

351
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,300
<i>they do know me!</i>

352
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
From some boat repos
That went bad.

353
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,800
They came to me!
I got a daughter in tampa!

354
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,600
They took pictures!

355
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,400
They said they'd hurt her
If I didn't help!

356
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,900
Why do they want that boat
So bad?

357
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,300
How the hell do I know?
It's a donzi 27 zr.

358
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,700
They were ready
To incinerate it and you.

359
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,200
I mean, it's a nice boat,
But it's not worth

360
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,100
Killing the four of us
And blowing up a boatyard.

361
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,400
Sam, you know I wouldn't
Do this to you.

362
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,700
I may be a son of a bitch
For dragging you into this,

363
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,600
But if I had
Any other choice... Come on!

364
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Please. Please.

365
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,500
Hey, Mike.

366
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,000
You know how I told you virgil
Saved my life and all that?

367
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,500
The truth is it's...
It's more complicated.

368
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,200
Back in '84,
I was in east germany.

369
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,900
I made some mistakes,
Mike...

370
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,100
Did some stuff
I shouldn't have.

371
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Virgil gave me
A second chance

372
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,800
When I sure as hell
Didn't deserve it.

373
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,700
I owe him, Mike.

374
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,300
Sam...
It's his daughter.

375
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,700
Look, if you're not in on this,
I got to handle it myself.

376
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,500
You can't handle this
By yourself, Sam.

377
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,400
Yeah, I know.

378
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,400
We need a place
To stash him.

379
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,900
And my third tour,
I was laid up for six months

380
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,300
With infected feet and some kind
Of agent orange disease.

381
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,100
Oh, that's horrible.

382
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,400
Hurt all over,
Kind of achy.

383
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
They thought
I was after disability.

384
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,800
I know tone  they don't bel

385
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Exactly.

386
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,700
So, when I got back,
I got into boat repo,

387
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,400
And that was fine
For a while.

388
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,000
Till, of course,
My wife passed away,

389
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,500
And then things
Went downhill.

390
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,300
I think we can skip
The life story.

391
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,900
Virgil's only going to be here
A night, maybe two.

392
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Where's the hatchet, mom?

393
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,900
Try the utility drawer.

394
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
I don't want to be
An imposition.

395
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,100
I can sleep out in the back
If you need.

396
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,800
Oh, no, I don't mind,
Really.

397
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,000
I'd never see Michael
At all

398
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,500
If he didn't bring
His friends over.

399
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,100
I know what that's like.

400
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,700
I don't get to see my daughter
Trudy very much, either.

401
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,600
Oh, yeah.

402
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
If was worse
After he went overseas,

403
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,400
And Michael's father died
In '98.

404
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,500
How did you lose your wife?

405
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,300
Cancer.
She was a nurse at the v.a.

406
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,700
Of course,
That's how we met.

407
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,500
Find anything?

408
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,300
No.
Tore the seats out.

409
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,400
I'm working on the carpeting.
Nothing yet.

410
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,600
Check under the subfloor.

411
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Mike, I got a hatchet
And a vise grip.

412
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,900
Okay.
I'll work something out.

413
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,000
Call me
If you find anything.

414
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,900
My surveillance has had
A good 14 hours

415
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,200
To get into my place again.

416
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,500
I got to get back there.

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Say "hi" for me!

418
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,700
<i>you can turn an old tv
Into an oscilloscope</i>

419
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,900
<i>with about $150 worth
Of hardware.</i>

420
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
<i>it'll electrocute you
If you're not careful,</i>

421
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
<i>but it makes a decent
Bug detector.</i>

422
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,100
<i>if you don't want to tip off
Anyone who might be listening,</i>

423
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,700
<i>you have to be prepared to keep
Talking for a few hours.</i>

424
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,700
Oh, another "no confidence" vote
In the italian parliament.

425
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Any thoughts?

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,800
As interested as I am
In european politics,

427
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
I was thinking
This would be a good opportunity

428
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,300
For us to discuss
Why exactly you left me.

429
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
<i>of course,
When you have to keep talking,</i>

430
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,400
<i>it's an opportunity for someone
To hijack the conversation</i>

431
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
<i>for their own purposes.</i>

432
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,300
Oh, I think now
Is the perfect time.

433
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
It was a difficult time.

434
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,900
There was an important reason.
It was years ago.

435
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
We should...
Let me gather my thoughts,

436
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
And we can talk about this
Another time.

437
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,700
Not even a goodbye,
Michael?

438
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,200
If you remember,
I made you dinner that night.

439
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, had I known
It was the last supper,

440
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,500
I would have chewed slower.

441
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,300
If you recall,
My cover was blown.

442
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,300
You could have left a note.

443
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,900
Leaving notes
Is bad tradecraft.

444
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,400
It could have put you
In danger.

445
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,300
<i>you ran away in the middle
Of the night for my benefit?</i>

446
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,300
<i>believe it or not, Fi,
Yeah, it was for your benefit.</i>

447
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,200
And yours.

448
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,500
Yes, Fi, and mine.

449
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,100
Thanks, Michael.

450
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
A little honesty is...

451
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,600
Refreshing

452
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,200
Let us take some pictures
To celebrate this special night.

453
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,500
What a great idea.

454
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,500
<i>the optical bug
Is a high-tech toy</i>

455
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,300
<i>that shoots a light beam
In a window.</i>

456
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,600
<i>it picks up vibrations
From the glass</i>

457
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
<i>and translates it into speech.</i>

458
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,000
How's that one?
Can I see it?

459
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Yeah.

460
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
<i>you can't see the beam
With the naked eye,</i>

461
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,200
<i>but take the infrared filter
Off a digital camera,</i>

462
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,800
<i>and it shows up nicely.</i>

463
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,200
<i>as high-tech as a laser Mike
Is, they're not hard to defeat.</i>

464
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,300
<i>they pick up vibrations
On the glass,</i>

465
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,800
<i>so you supply
Your own vibrations.</i>

466
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,400
You had to do that now?

467
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,500
I didn't say
I'd help you for free.

468
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,000
You found the eavesdropper.

469
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,100
I'll go over
To his little listening post,

470
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Wait till he leaves,
See where he scurries to.

471
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,900
You think he's the one
Who burned you?

472
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,400
No, but he came here
To show me who's boss.

473
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,800
He's one step closer.

474
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,900
We should do this
More often.

475
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,700
Yeah, Sam.

476
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,200
Mikey, I've been calling
All night.

477
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,300
Yeah, it wasn't safe
To talk earlier.

478
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,700
What's up?

479
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,800
You better get over here... Now.

480
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,000
Mom, where's virgil?
We need to talk.

481
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
He's still asleep.

482
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,700
Have you been up all night?

483
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,200
Yeah. Virgil!

484
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,600
Where is he?

485
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
He's in my bedroom.

486
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,300
Ugh.

487
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,200
He's lonely, Michael...

488
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
And so am i!

489
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,400
It's been a long time
Since your father died.

490
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,200
And sometimes
I think it would be good

491
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,600
For us to have more
Of a family.

492
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,700
Oh, with virgil?

493
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,600
He lives
In a beat-up trailer.

494
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Half of his meals
Come from roadkill.

495
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,100
Stop being so judgmental,
Michael!

496
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,700
All right, your father
Had problems, too.

497
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,600
Wake him up!

498
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,100
Have him meet me
Out in the backyard.

499
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,200
It's important.

500
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
I ripped her open,
And there it was.

501
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,800
I'm guessing about $10 million,
Give or take.

502
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,100
But nobody ever thinks
Of packing it

503
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,900
In something
With a goddamn handle.

504
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,400
Is this money real?

505
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,200
Oh, yeah.

506
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,400
It's probably headed
Toward aruba or anguilla...

507
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
One of those caribbean
Money holes.

508
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,800
10 million reasons
To want us dead.

509
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,500
Come on, Mike.

510
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,500
That's a glass-half-empty way
Of looking at it.

511
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,400
Mason probably stumbled upon
The money-smuggling operation,

512
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Didn't want to risk
Pulling the heist himself,

513
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
You were the cutout,

514
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,300
You deliver the boat,
He shoots you,

515
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,000
And 300 gallons
Of burning methyl chloride

516
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,100
Cleans up the mess.

517
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,000
Jesus.

518
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What do I do?

519
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,100
Well, for now...

520
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,000
Dump the boat.

521
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,600
You have any way
Of reaching these cops?

522
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,000
I got a number.

523
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Naw, this ain't virgil.

524
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,000
This is your buddy homer.
Remember me?

525
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,100
No, he ain't around.
Y'all have to deal with me now.

526
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,300
And I want a meeting.

527
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,800
<i>when working a cover identity,</i>

528
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,600
<i>the safest thing is to let
The target take the lead.</i>

529
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
<i>you've got more information
Than he does.</i>

530
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,100
<i>you want to keep that edge.</i>

531
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,600
Hey, you brought
Your friends.

532
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
We got a little party
Going on here, don't we?

533
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,400
You want some fries?

534
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,300
How would you like
To die choking on them?

535
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
Oh, they're good.

536
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Not that good,
But they're good.

537
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Now, see,
That is just unfriendly.

538
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,800
Where's virgil?

539
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,000
Seems a shame
Just to dump it.

540
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,100
It is a nice boat.

541
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,500
Yeah, it's a nice boat.

542
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,700
It's a nice boat with a great
Big hole in the deck

543
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,600
And a bunch of guys with guns
Looking for it.

544
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,400
Oh, yeah.

545
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Thank you, Sam.

546
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,600
Yeah, virg,
When this is over,

547
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,800
If we're not dead,
Thank me then.

548
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,400
All right, Sam.

549
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,100
I don't know where he is.
He's holed up somewhere.

550
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Listen, we got
A real problem here.

551
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,900
Well, that's right.

552
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,000
We want out of this.

553
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,900
But those guys
We took the boat from...

554
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,300
They're coming after us.

555
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
If you could see your way
To helping us...

556
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,500
That's your problem.

557
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,000
Well, seeing how
We have your $10 million,

558
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,900
I guess that makes it
Your problem, too.

559
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,200
Now, I know you guys didn't
Want to get involved in this.

560
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,100
You wanted us to do
Your dirty work for you.

561
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,100
It's $10 million.

562
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,100
I know you must
Have big plans for it.

563
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
All right, fine.

564
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,400
You give us a time
And a place,

565
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,200
Put the jamaicans there
With my money,

566
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
And we'll handle it.

567
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,400
And then we walk away?

568
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
'Cause if I see
Another barrel of chemicals

569
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,700
With my name on it...

570
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Let me put it this way...
You bring me my money,

571
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,500
And you got nothing
To worry about.

572
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Then you can disappear.

573
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,400
Talk to the jamaicans.

574
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,700
I'll see you tomorrow.

575
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,000
Virg, get down!

576
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,200
Virgil: how the hell
Did they find us?!

577
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,500
Must have had
A backup gps tracker.

578
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,300
What happened?
You look awful!

579
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,600
Trust me, sweet thing,
You'd rather not know.

580
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,200
I can't believe we didn't find
That other tracking device.

581
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,400
Andre's good.
And that's bad.

582
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,500
Do you want
Something to drink?

583
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,200
Yeah. That sounds good.
Maybe a scotch.

584
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,800
I wouldn't mind a little
Something if you're gonna...

585
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,500
Sam! Not now.

586
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,300
We need to talk alone, mom.

587
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,900
We need to set up a meeting
With andre and the jamaicans.

588
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,400
Hey, mason just showed me
The boat.

589
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,600
I don't know those guys.

590
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,300
Yeah, and when we saw them,

591
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,000
There wasn't a lot of time
For conversation.

592
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,800
Call the marina,
Leave my number.

593
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Andre knows
What he's doing.

594
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,500
He'll have everyone
From the harbormaster

595
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,900
To the guy emptying trash cans
Looking for us.

596
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,800
I'll see
If I can stall mason.

597
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,600
Right on time.
Yep.

598
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,000
Fear brings out the best
In people.

599
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Look, I brought you some fries
Now that we're friends.

600
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,100
I haven't had time to talk
To the jamaicans yet.

601
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
That's not good, homer.
That's not good at all.

602
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,400
I repo'ed their boat.

603
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,700
It's not like I can go down
To the crab shack

604
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,600
And have a beer with them.

605
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,100
I don't give a damn
About the Jamaicans.

606
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,400
That's your problem.
I just want the money!

607
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,300
I'm doing the best I can!

608
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,300
I just need a little more time,
That's all.

609
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,500
Well, here's a little incentive
For virgil.

610
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,200
His daughter got picked up on
A traffic warrant this morning.

611
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,900
They haven't
Searched her car yet,

612
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,300
But if they do,

613
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,100
They just might find drugs
Under the backseat.

614
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,800
Pretty girls don't
Do very well in jail.

615
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,300
The other girls tend
To ugly them up real quick.

616
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,500
Don't know how long
The poor thing would last.

617
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,300
You'll have your money
Tomorrow.

618
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
So, this is Sam's new ride.

619
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
His girlfriend loaned it to him.
He loaned it to me.

620
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Love is a beautiful thing.

621
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,800
Anyway, are you sure

622
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,000
These guys aren't gonna show up
And surprise me?

623
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
You probably
Have a few hours.

624
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,400
They're setting up surveillance
Cameras at your place.

625
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,300
Which room is his?

626
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,300
215.

627
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,600
I followed him here
Last night.

628
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,300
The guy looked
A little pissed.

629
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,100
After that business
With the personal massaging,

630
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
You sure you want
To upset him?

631
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,200
He's here
To make me behave.

632
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,900
I do that... He goes home,
I never find out anything.

633
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,500
I need him here.

634
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,300
If I can't
Make him a friend...

635
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,800
...the next best thing
Is an enemy.

636
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,100
<i>anyone with a security
Clearance is going to know</i>

637
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,400
<i>not to leave anything
In a hotel room.</i>

638
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,000
<i>they'll keep the important
Stuff with them.</i>

639
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,100
<i>usually it'll be
In a secure laptop</i>

640
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,900
<i>with a few layers
Of encryption.</i>

641
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,200
<i>means you can't break into it.</i>

642
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,700
<i>but if you're just looking
To make somebody angry,</i>

643
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,100
<i>you don't need
To break into it.</i>

644
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,900
<i>put a big enough magnet where
That laptop's going to be,</i>

645
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,400
<i>and you can turn it
Into an expensive paperweight.</i>

646
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,700
Hello?

647
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,800
Andre, it's good
To hear from you.

648
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,300
<i>doctors are well-known
To be the worst patients.</i>

649
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,700
<i>similarly, anyone
With special-ops training</i>

650
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,900
<i>is tough to protect.</i>

651
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,100
<i>they think
They can handle anything.</i>

652
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,600
Wow.

653
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
That shirt
Looks so good on you.

654
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,100
You're the same size
My husband was.

655
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, I don't wear
This kind of thing much.

656
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,900
I'm glad you like it.
I do.

657
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,600
Thank you.

658
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,600
Are you sure
This is all right?

659
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
Michael said you weren't
Supposed to be out.

660
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,600
Don't worry.
I can handle myself.

661
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,400
It's fun sneaking out, though,
Isn't it?

662
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,000
It is.

663
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,400
Have a drink, man.
Relax yourself.

664
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,300
No, I'm relaxed.

665
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,500
You know, you caused me
Quite a lot of trouble.

666
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,700
At least do me the courtesy
And have a drink.

667
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,500
All right.

668
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Flo, let me get a rum punch
For my friend here.

669
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,300
So, the money you stole...

670
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,000
That was a payment
For a debt,

671
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,700
A large quantity
Of merchandise

672
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,500
Delivered from one very
Powerful man to another.

673
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
It's my job
To deliver this money.

674
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,100
Listen,
I don't want any...

675
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,000
I take my job
Very seriously.

676
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,700
I stay in business because,

677
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,600
When someone trusts me
With their funds,

678
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,100
I don't let nothing
Or no one

679
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,600
Come in the way
Of a safe delivery.

680
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,800
I make a promise
To my clients...

681
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I would sooner cut my own throat
Than leave a debt unpaid.

682
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,300
Do you think I would hesitate
To cut yours?

683
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,600
I just wanted to know
What Michael was doing

684
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,500
Or where he was
All those years.

685
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,300
Take it from me, sweetheart.
I've been there.

686
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,100
Half that classified crap
Is so boring

687
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
You'd tear your hair out,

688
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,700
And the other half,
You don't want to know.

689
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,000
I think I could handle it.

690
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,900
I put up with his father
For 30 years.

691
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,300
Don't be too hard on him.

692
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,200
You get into that line
Of work...

693
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,300
Sweetheart, something real bad
Is about to happen.

694
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,600
I need you
To keep your head down

695
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,000
And pretend
You don't know me.

696
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,700
What?

697
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,500
I don't want you to get hurt.
Do that for me, please.

698
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,500
So, now that we understand
Each other, where's my money?

699
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,300
We want to give you
Your money back.

700
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,500
We just need to arrange
A time and a place.

701
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,900
So, we come and get it,

702
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,300
And what else is waiting
For us when we get there?

703
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,200
Now, andre, you're just
Gonna have to trust us.

704
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,800
Stop!

705
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,900
You come with us now!

706
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,100
Excuse me.

707
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,300
Yeah, mon.

708
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
Good. Good.

709
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,200
Put him on the phone.

710
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
It's for you.

711
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,000
For me?

712
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,700
Hello?

713
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
It's virgil.

714
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,200
I was out to dinner
With Madeline. I'm sorry.

715
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,400
They must have had eyes
On the street.

716
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,800
So, we do this tomorrow at noon,
9th street bridge.

717
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,600
We'll exchange virgil
For the $10 million.

718
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,400
Everything go well, you'll both
Get to go home alive.

719
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,200
If not...

720
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,100
Enjoy your drink.

721
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,000
I calmed your mother down.

722
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,100
I gave her enough sedatives
To knock out a trucker.

723
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,700
Did you ask her what the hell
She was doing out?

724
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,100
I told her
To keep him inside.

725
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,600
Oh, go easy on them,
Michael.

726
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,400
They snuck out.

727
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,100
A woman needs
A little danger.

728
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,200
So, what do we do about the cops
And mason, huh?

729
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,700
Well, I expect they're gonna be
Very disappointed

730
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,500
When they find out we're giving
The money to the jamaicans.

731
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,400
But we don't have
Any leverage.

732
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,900
They got virgil's daughter,
Mike.

733
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,200
One problem
At a time, Sam.

734
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,500
First virgil,
Then his daughter.

735
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,800
We could take
Some of the money...

736
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,400
Hire her a lawyer.

737
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,200
That could take care of it.

738
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,300
That could take care
Of us, too.

739
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
I doubt
They'll miss it, Mike.

740
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Hello?

741
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
You think you can play with me,
You son of a bitch?

742
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,500
You destroyed all my files!

743
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,700
Oh, it's good to hear
From you, too.

744
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,500
I'm right in the middle
Of something.

745
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,700
You broke into my room.

746
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,600
Well, I just wanted
To get to know you better.

747
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,200
Now then, I'm Michael Westen.
And you are?

748
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,400
You don't need my name.

749
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,200
I came down here to bring you
A message... Back off.

750
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,400
People get fired all the time.
Leave it alone.

751
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,900
Oh, good.
A message from who?

752
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,700
I just wanted to send him
A thank-you note.

753
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400
Dream on, pal.

754
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
Fi.
Yes.

755
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,500
My new friend just discovered
I paid him a little visit.

756
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,000
He'll be moving hotels.

757
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,200
I'll stay on him.

758
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
<i>when something serious
Is going down,</i>

759
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,500
<i>it's a good idea
To show up nice and early</i>

760
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,700
<i>so you can see the ground
And assess the situation.</i>

761
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,200
Mike, I should go.

762
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,900
Virgil's my buddy.
You don't owe him anything.

763
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,000
They know me and Fi.

764
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,700
If you show up, they'll think
Something is wrong.

765
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
Just cover us
And keep an eye out.

766
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,600
All right.
Good luck.

767
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,300
It's cute...
This loyalty of Sam's.

768
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,300
I really like
This side of him.

769
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,000
Thanks for doing this, Fi.

770
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,200
Oh, I'm not doing this
For you.

771
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,900
I promised your mom
I'd bring virgil back alive.

772
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Hey, they're right
On time.

773
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Let's make this trade,
Make it quick,

774
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,100
And get out of here
Before things get...

775
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,700
...interesting.

776
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,200
Yeah, Sam.

777
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,900
Your hunch about mason
Was right

778
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,500
'Cause he and the boys
Just showed up.

779
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,300
Yeah, okay,
I'm ready for them.

780
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,300
The cops are coming.

781
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,500
All righty, then.

782
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,800
<i>when enough people hate you,</i>

783
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,500
<i>sometimes the only move
Is to just stand in the middle</i>

784
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,500
<i>and hope they kill each other
Before they kill you.</i>

785
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,500
Hey!
What you doing, man?

786
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,900
What are you doing?!

787
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,200
I said stop it!

788
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,700
Stop it!

789
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,700
<i>anyone who's ever handled large
Amounts of cash can tell you,</i>

790
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,100
<i>it's one of the toughest things
In the world to move.</i>

791
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,700
<i>it's heavy and dense...
Dead weight.</i>

792
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,600
<i>if it's on fire, of course,</i>

793
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,900
<i>that complicates things
Further.</i>

794
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,100
Freeze! Drop it!

795
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,900
Hey, you get back!

796
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,400
You calm down! Calm down!

797
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,000
Boys, boys, boys,
Calm down.

798
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,800
We have a little bit
Of business first.

799
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,100
Andre, let virgil go.

800
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,500
Andre, let virgil go!

801
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,300
I'm gonna find you, boy,
And I'm gonna kill you.

802
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,600
And then you'll cut my throat.
I know, I know. Let him go.

803
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,900
Andre, it's the fumes
That ignite.

804
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,000
I don't even
Have to touch it.

805
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,300
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Okay! Okay.

806
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,600
Have you two guys met?

807
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,500
You have a lot
To talk about.

808
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,700
Andre, detective mason.
Detective mason, andre.

809
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Get down on the ground!
You ain't a cop!
You a thief!

810
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,100
Okay, on the ground.

811
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,900
You ain't no cop.
Get on the ground!

812
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,000
Go on, call for backup!

813
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,700
You call for backup!

814
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,300
Go! Go! Go!

815
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,000
Come on, Mike,
You'd think we'd be able

816
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,400
To keep a little more
Than this.

817
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,200
We took what we needed.

818
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,700
My daughter called.
She's pissed at me, as usual.

819
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,800
But she's home.
They dropped the charges.

820
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
They had to
With the jamaicans dead

821
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,700
And the cops in jail.

822
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,800
But unfortunately,

823
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,500
You're going to have to get out
Of town for a while.

824
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,900
With this all over the papers,

825
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,200
There are still a few people
Out there

826
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,500
Who want to put a bullet
In you.

827
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,800
Well, I'll just
Get the boat fixed up

828
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,700
And go down to the bahamas
For a while.

829
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,800
Great.

830
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,000
You sure
You're not just trying

831
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,600
To keep me away
From your sweet mama?

832
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,600
Hey, virg?

833
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
Don't push it.

834
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,800
Okay.

835
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,700
I'll go make my goodbyes.

836
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,600
Gentlemen.

837
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,800
I think you're even, Sam.

838
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah.

839
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,400
Whew.

840
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,700
Oh, by the way,
I made some calls,

841
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,000
Talked to a buddy of mine
At the FBI.

842
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,800
Looks like
I got the charger back.

843
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,200
Let's just call it
A thank-you gift.

844
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,900
You're welcome, Sam.

845
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,900
Okay, I need a beer.

846
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,600
<i>getting information
Out of someone</i>

847
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,500
<i>who doesn't want to give it up</i>

848

<i>is all about upsetting
The target's emotional balance,</i>

849
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,000
<i>impairing their judgment.</i>

850
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,700
<i>fear's good for that.
Anger's not bad either.</i>

851
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,300
Hey, buddy.

852
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,100
I thought we could spend
Some more time together.

853
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,200
You really don't understand
The situation here, do you?

854
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,200
You're out, man.
That's it.

855
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,400
You should be in jail.

856
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Jail?! That's interesting.
Why jail?

857
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,800
I don't remember ever
Doing anything jail worthy.

858
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,600
Hey, hey, hey.

859
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,500
Hey, don't get cute.

860
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,700
I want to know
Why I got burned.

861
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,200
Show me the burn notice.
Tell me why.

862
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
You know damn well why.
I've seen the dossier.

863
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,800
I'd like a look at that dossier.
You have it?

864
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,800
Get off!
Take your hands off me!

865
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,400
Okay, all right.
All right. All right.

866
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Fine.

867
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,400
<i>sometimes,
Intelligence gathering</i>

868
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,200
<i>involves sophisticated
Techniques</i>

869
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,400
<i>and a lot
Of high-tech equipment.</i>

870
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,800
<i>but sometimes it's as simple
As picking someone's pocket.</i>

871
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,000
How'd we do?

872
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,200
Good to meet you,
Agent bly.
