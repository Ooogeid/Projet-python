1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,834
<i>My name is Michael Western.</i>

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,262
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,834
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,697 --> 00:00:09,901
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,219
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,854
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,223
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,123
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,563
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,524
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,402
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,780
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,199
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,409
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,037
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:39,914
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,834
<i>It's never fun to be the guy</i>

18
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,830
<i>who clears a location for a meet.</i>

19
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:50,811
<i>In the best case,
you waste your time</i>

20
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:53,052
<i>looking for dangers
that aren't there.</i>

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,708
<i>In the worst case, of course,</i>

22
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,283
<i>you miss something.</i>

23
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:00,087
Your buddy went in 10 minutes ago,

24
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:00,912
alone.

25
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:02,645
You didn't
have to scout this for me.

26
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:05,939
I am not gonna let you meet a guy
like Gilroy without backup.

27
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,940
If he was planning on killing me,
I doubt he'd pick such a nice place.

28
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:10,653
{\You know how hard
it is to get a reservation in there?}It's hard to get a reservation there.

29
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,579
I know what they serve in there, too.

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,732
<i>Foie gras</i>...

31
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:15,032
<i>lap-in.</i>

32
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:17,201
<i>Lapin?</i>

33
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,953
It's still French for "bunny rabbit."

34
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,732
I'm all for bringing Gilroy down,

35
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:23,244
Isn't there a way to wrap this guy up
without working with him?

36
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,101
I went to a lot of trouble
to convince him

37
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:26,969
I'm as much of a psychopath
as he is.

38
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:28,740
Might as well hear
what he has planned.

39
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,291
Odds are he's not gonna ask you
to walk his dog for him.

40
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,430
I don't have much choice.
Whatever he is planning,

41
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:35,845
The only way to stop it
Is to be right in the middle of it.

42
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,097
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

43
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:40,766
That's French for
watch your back, <i>amigo</i>.

44
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,730
<i>Even routine meetings can be risky</i>

45
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,203
<i>If you're sitting down
with someone you don't trust.</i>

46
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:48,256
<i>You have to be alert
to any subtle clue</i>

47
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:50,208
<i>that tells you
what you're walking into.</i>

48
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,141


49
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,633
<i>Are they armed?</i>
<i>Did they bring backup?</i>

50
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,225
<i>There are also
not-so-subtle clues...</i>

51
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,589
Glad you could make it.

52
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:02,852
I hope you don't mind.

53
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:04,957
I took the liberty
of ordering an appetizer.

54
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:08,461
<i>Like a third place setting
at a lunch for two.</i>

55
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,962
- We expecting someone else?
- I didn't tell you?

56
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,811
- Claude should be here.
- Claude?

57
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,009
Wonderful chap.
Excellent conversation.

58
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,510
Has great fashion sense,

59
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,798
And he's the best thief
in the Westen hemisphere.

60
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:21,432
Useful skill in this phase
of our little project.

61
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,590
I don't mind
sharing a meal with him,

62
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:24,893
I prefer to work alone.

63
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,094
Don't be so hasty, Michael.
You'll like Claude.

64
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,427
His resume is almost
as nasty as yours.

65
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,210
Working with someone you don't know
is stupid and dangerous.

66
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,736
Look who's full of theories.

67
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,135
I'm afraid
you'll have to make an exception,

68
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,907
learn the value of teamwork.

69
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,258
No thanks.

70
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,706
So this is your local boy?

71
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,711
Actually, Michael's not sure
he can stay for lunch.

72
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:52,508
Decision time.

73
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,306
Splendid.

74
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,600
Let's get some wine, shall we?
To celebrate.

75
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,826
Something old, French, and...

76
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,062
expensive.

77
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,692


78
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,529
What exactly is this Gilroy job?

79
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,066
I have to break in
to the Chilean consulate with Claude,

80
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,454
get our hands on a file.

81
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,679
Invading foreign territory and stealing
files with someone you've never met...

82
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:29,724
Sounds great.

83
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,669
Working with Claude
is not in the cards.

84
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:34,657
That I like the sound of.
Are you walking away?

85
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,175
I'll find a way to take Claude out
without making Gilroy suspicious.

86
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,494
You know, if he is a thief
working internationally...

87
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,932
You're thinking we might have mutual
acquaintances. I'll make some calls.

88
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:46,225
But seriously,

89
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,811
how far are you willing to go
with this Gilroy thing?

90
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:50,604
As far as I have to.

91
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,523
That's easy to say now, but...

92
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:01,699
There's the man I need to see.

93
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:04,158
I come in peace.

94
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,079
- Friend of yours, Michael?
- You remember Sugar,

95
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,248
the drug dealer
who used to live beneath my place.

96
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,250
That's right,
the man you shot in the leg.

97
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,493
Your boy capped me through a wall.
Did something with duct tape.

98
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:18,192


99
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,482
I thought I made it clear.
We should never see each other again.

100
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,652
You think,
I wanted to come back here?

101
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:25,931
I came to hire you.

102
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,266
- My cousin's in trouble.
- Don't waste your time.

103
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:29,977
I didn't come here empty-handed.

104
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,365
<i>In covert ops,</i>

105
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,398
<i>you get used to seeing old enemies.</i>

106
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,816
<i>Sometimes
they're looking for intelligence.</i>

107
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,693
<i>Sometimes
they're looking for revenge.</i>

108
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,968
What are you gonna do,
shoot me again?

109
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,582
If that's what it takes
to get you to help my cousin,

110
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:43,574
Go for it.

111
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,526
<i>And sometimes
they're looking for a friend.</i>

112
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,614
<i>Yogurt Team</i>

113
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:56,795
My cousin is messing
with shady dudes right now.

114
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,671
Shady?
Shady like drug dealers?

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,716
I don't bring my business
around Dougie. Never.

116
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:02,884
It's this jacker named Lynch.

117
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,762
Punkass runs a crew
that does robberies.

118
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,296
Every time they do a job,
somebody gets hurt...

119
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,421
or worse.

120
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,142
- They're working an angle on Dougie.
- What makes you say that?

121
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,437
They're not hanging out with him
because he's cool.

122
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:16,815
Dougie's slow.

123
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,533
I told him to stay away from Lynch,
but they keep taking him to parties.

124
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:23,072
He thinks they're friends.

125
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,033
I talked to Lynch, man-to-man,
told him to leave Dougie alone.

126
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,768
- I can see that went well.
- His whole crew jumped me.

127
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:31,497
There wasn't much talking
after that.

128
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,348
These guys are strapped.

129
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:35,552
I need a guy like you,
with the tricks and everything.

130
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:36,803
Five grand.

131
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,296
I'm figuring we mount up
and ride on these jokers.

132
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,924
- How's that sound?
- Like a good way to get killed.

133
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,968
You don't need a hit man, Sugar.

134
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,680
You need to move your cousin,
get him off of Lynch.

135
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,889
{\You know how long it took Dougie
to get on his own two feet?}It took ages
to get him on his own feet.

136
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,871
He's got his own place now, a job.

137
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:52,616
I can't make him start over.

138
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:54,228
I'm not gonna let Lynch do that.

139
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:57,147
If you don't want the money,
fine, I'll do it myself.

140
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,401
I'm sure he would rather start over
than have to bury his cousin.

141
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,611
What happened to the bad ass
that used to live here?

142
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,863
When he comes back,
give him my number.

143
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,027
You're just gonna let him go?

144
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,834
Are you okay?

145
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,919
I'm coming right over.

146
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,337
It's Ma. It's important.

147
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,306
You're getting
the Take a Bite Out of Crime award?

148
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,574
It's for citizen crime fighters.

149
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:35,580
This just happened out of the blue?

150
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,314
You know that I'm the neighborhood-watch
captain for my block,

151
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,069
and it didn't hurt that I called in
3 stolen cars in the last two months.

152
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,738
You mean the cars I asked you
to call in, the ones I stole?

153
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:48,758
They're giving me a plaque!

154
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,461
I'm allowed to have
one guest at the reception,

155
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:55,247
But you have to dress up, the chief
of police is gonna be there.

156
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,129
I can't be in a room full of cops
giving you an award for reporting crimes

157
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,212
I committed!

158
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,630
I'm being honored.

159
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,084
Do you want me to be
the only person there with no family?

160
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,594
It's not like I can ask Nate
to fly in from Vegas.

161
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,822
Noon on Saturday.

162
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:15,752
Maddy, you got some Sugar?

163
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,562
Ms. Reynolds wants to make me
some caramelized strawberries.

164
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:22,608
You saw about the award.
Pretty cool?

165
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,234
Sam nominated me.

166
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,154
More like I signed the paperwork
that she already filled out.

167
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:29,490
Fi gonna check into Claude?

168
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,115
She's asking around.

169
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,702
Good because I ran his name through
some channels. I got nothing.

170
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:37,329
Thanks, Maddy.
I'll bring some over later.

171
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,309
Did you get a chance
to make any calls?

172
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:01,684
You mean about Claude?
I sure did.

173
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,988
Heard some disturbing things, too.

174
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:07,594
I wrote it down on a piece of paper,
but I can't remember where I put it.

175
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,177
I'm very distracted.

176
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:11,697
I keep thinking
about Sugar and his cousin.

177
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,538
You were there.
I told him what he needed to do.

178
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:17,246
If he doesn't want to listen,
that's not my problem.

179
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,790
What about Dougie?
Are we gonna let Sugar

180
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,003
make a bad decision
for his cousin, too?

181
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,170
Fine.

182
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:27,237
Forget it.

183
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:29,519
Claude...

184
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:32,600
is former Australian S.I.S.

185
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,556
Real name, Tomas Smalling,

186
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,391
which is why Sam hit a dead end.

187
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,980
You say Sugar's not your problem?

188
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:44,690
Did you ever stop and think

189
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,441
Gilroy's not your problem, either?

190
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:58,857
My man!

191
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:06,920
Guns and duct tape.

192
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,383
When do we go?

193
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,008
We don't go ever.

194
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:14,158
- You said you would help.
- I will, but my way,

195
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:16,387
so no mounting up,
no riding on people.

196
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,466
How's your way?
Go through the roof?

197
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,058
Go <i>Mission Impossible</i> on his ass?

198
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,519
That would fall
into the riding category, so, no.

199
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,397
First, I check into Lynch, see why
he's so interested in your cousin.

200
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,774
What about me?

201
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,001
You're gonna leave town.

202
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,188
I ride the pine
while you handle this?

203
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:36,533
That punk sent guys looking for me
at a club I work out of. I've to answer.

204
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,442
That's the kind of thinking
we don't need.

205
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,913
You want to help your cousin?
You want me to help?

206
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:42,414
Then leave town.

207
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,833
You will take a trip,
and you will wait for my call.

208
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:47,731
Fine.

209
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:50,881


210
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:52,204
Great.

211
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,176
Now, where can I find Lynch?

212
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:59,014
<i>Whether it's a drug compound
in the mountains of Colombia</i>

213
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,255
<i>or a tropical estate in Miami,</i>

214
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,727
<i>Nothing says success
like a lot of land.</i>

215
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,113
<i>Of course,
the more land someone has,</i>

216
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,592
<i>the easier it is to hide out
and do surveillance.</i>

217
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,739
<i>Lush landscaping may be beautiful,</i>

218
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,324
<i>but it's hardly secure.</i>

219
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,971
I see two on the deck,
including Lynch.

220
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,865
Let me guess...
the one with the pinky ring.

221
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,159
How's it going, Fi?

222
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,788
Single-latch sliding window
on the side of the house.

223
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,041
Getting in shouldn't be
a problem once they leave.

224
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,354
Lynch and his crew stay plenty busy.

225
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,930
They've hit everything
from banks to car washes.

226
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:32,640
How is it they don't get arrested?

227
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,460
Lynch is pretty thorough
about covering his tracks.

228
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:38,887
They don't leave anybody around.
That guy's a public health hazard.

229
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,332
{\LYNCH
PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD}

230
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,853
Could be game time.
Fi, don't forget to plant that bug.

231
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,485
A minivan.

232
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:55,654
Lynch doesn't strike me
as the soccer-dad type.

233
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,522
Let's find out where they're headed.

234
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,913
Can you two handle the house
while I follow Lynch?

235
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:04,182
So, we're gonna take the bus home?
Okay, fine. Save gas. Help the planet.

236
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm as green as the next guy,
you know.

237
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:11,630
<i>Finding the best place in a house
to hide a bug can be tough,</i>

238
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,111
<i>but if you can't wire
every room for sound,</i>

239
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:17,165
<i>the TV remote
is a good all-purpose choice.</i>

240
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,555
<i>It's got a power source,</i>

241
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,722
<i>It's kept in areas where people gather,
and it's usually in the hand</i>

242
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,290
<i>Of the most powerful guy
in the room.</i>

243
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,519
- Bug's in place, Sam.
- Look around, but make it quick.

244
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:50,873
- <i>I found something.</i>
- What are you seeing?

245
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:54,471
Lynch have something special planned,
Something very special.

246
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,756
Special?
How do you mean?

247
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,770
He's got enough firepower
for a full-scale amphibious assault...

248
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,745
Machine guns, mini oxygen tanks,
dive watches.

249
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,267
Maybe he's planning
some sort of water heist.

250
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,895
Either that or he likes to snorkel.

251
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,937
Get your pictures
and get out of there.

252
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:24,385
<i>You can often tell
when a team of guys</i>

253
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,420
<i>is going out to kill someone.</i>

254
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,409
<i>There's something
about the way they drive...</i>

255
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:31,833
<i>Always below the speed limit,
always careful at stop signs.</i>

256
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,837
<i>There's something
about the way they move...</i>

257
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:39,174
<i>A little strut,
a hard set to the jaw.</i>

258
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:41,999
<i>See it enough times,
you don't even need clues</i>

259
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:44,388
<i>like the target's car
sitting in the driveway.</i>

260
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:51,087
- <i>Time to get busy?</i>
- Sugar, tell me you left town.

261
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:54,019
No, man, don't worry.
Dug in at my stash house.

262
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:57,364
- Nobody knows where it is.
- Lynch knows. He's out front.

263
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,735
Go out back right now.

264
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,903
What?

265
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:03,492
He wants to go "tombstone"?
Fine! I'm strapped to the nines!

266
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,908
We can settle this now!

267
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,078
No, Sugar. There's too many.
Get out now. Get out now!

268
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:11,503
No go, bro. I'm not letting him
run me out of my house!

269
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,025
<i>Microwaves are one of the most
dangerous appliances</i>

270
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,854
<i>In the home to repair or modify.</i>
<i>But in a pinch,</i>

271
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:53,415
<i>you can use their extremely
high voltage to your advantage.</i>

272
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,917
Did he go down? I don't know.
I can't see.

273
00:13:57,726 --> 00:14:00,130
<i>Remove a microwave's
surge inhibitor,</i>

274
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,174
<i>Mix in some reactive
household cleaning supplies</i>

275
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,470
<i>and pressurized cans
and a fistful of silverware...</i>

276
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,732
- I think we got him.
- Let's make sure.

277
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:24,279
<i>Make sure the door is sealed tight.</i>

278
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:26,907
Now you want to use duct tape.

279
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:33,700
<i>... And to save time,
just press "popcorn."</i>

280
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:39,878
<i>Do it right</i>

281
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:43,298
<i>and you have
the makings of a very big...</i>

282
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,080
Sorry, bro.
I'm staining your leather.

283
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,681
You better stay alive,

284
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:57,938
'cause I'm gonna make you
clean that later.

285
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:13,912
Four shots from assault rifles,
and somehow Sugar is still breathing.

286
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:17,264
The doctor is touch-and-go,
but if you hadn't been there,

287
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:19,191
he would have just been go.

288
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,918
Police say anything?

289
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,781
Drug dealer gunned down
in a stash house

290
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,437
doesn't exactly get you...
front-burner status.

291
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,343
The car they were using was torched,
So there's no evidence there.

292
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,679
- We need to get Dougie out of town.
- No.

293
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,535
We pull Sugar's cousin out now,
Lynch just moves on to a new heist.

294
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,945
Someone else winds up in his crosshairs.
I want this to be his last job.

295
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,853
I'm glad to see you so fired up.

296
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,189
But is this about taking Lynch down
or helping Dougie?

297
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:45,151
Both. As long as Lynch needs Dougie
for a job, he's safe until it goes down.

298
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:46,152
That's great,

299
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,905
except we know nothing
about this job.

300
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,698
We have some work to do, don't we?

301
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,264
Guys, how about this...

302
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:53,827
You still have your meeting
with Gilroy and Claude, right?

303
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,845
Focus on that. I'll talk to Dougie.
He's been hanging out with Lynch.

304
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,788
Maybe he heard something. And if we have
to move him on short notice,

305
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:03,013
- I'm a familiar face.
- Great.

306
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:07,966
Maybe I could borrow your car?

307
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,896
The charger's a little stained.

308
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,548
Gentlemen.

309
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:24,635
I can't stay for long.

310
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:27,687
I just wanted to make sure
that our first strategy session

311
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,112
gets off on the right foot.

312
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,236
Team building is a process,
so I thought I'd help speed it up.

313
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:35,194
Matching watches,
perfectly synchronized...

314
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:36,737
with mine.

315
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,789
- If you look like a team, act like one.
- We should get jerseys.

316
00:16:41,054 --> 00:16:44,336
Feast your eyes on the third-floor
window, second from the left.

317
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:47,628
My file arrives in that room
on Friday evening.

318
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,866
On Sunday morning,
it's headed for processing.

319
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:51,731
You two will get it Saturday.

320
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:55,586
Since Claude has the expertise
in the getting-things field,

321
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:58,266
he will take the lead.
You don't mind, do you?

322
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,184
- Go, team.
- Excellent.

323
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,623
Did you know that your resting pulse
tends to synchronize with your watch?

324
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:05,544
That means, by the end of today,

325
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:08,109
our hearts will beat as one.

326
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:10,820
I'll leave you both
to ponder the possibilities.

327
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:18,827
You just create a diversion.
Cover the alley.

328
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,247
I get the file.

329
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:22,576
That's it?

330
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:23,667
You need more?

331
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,057
- How are you getting in?
- From the outside. Not your problem.

332
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,756
It is if you want me to stage
an effective diversion.

333
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,557
Look, just make certain
no one on the street

334
00:17:33,682 --> 00:17:35,845
is looking down that alley
when the time comes.

335
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,808
What about the security
on the third floor?

336
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:38,988
One guard?

337
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:40,728
If he sees me,

338
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,970
it'll be the last thing
he ever sees.

339
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,384
Usually,
I get some kind of advance notice

340
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,916
- before somebody pays a visit.
- It's weird how that goes.

341
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,914
If you're with the independent-living
program, what happened to Ms. Lee?

342
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,739
Who? Berta?
No, no, she's county. I'm city.

343
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,899
State's gonna send somebody
in a month or two.

344
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:07,489
A tri-joint panel will do their review.
It's a whole big deal.

345
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:10,380
Well, Dougie's a big help
around here.

346
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,264
We love him.
You'll see.

347
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:17,762


348
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,722
Somebody from the program
wants to see you.

349
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,390
Héow you doing?
Chuck Finley.

350
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,844
I'm fine, sir.
Thanks.

351
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,438
Tell him what you do.

352
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,222
I have to make sure that
the door to the storage room

353
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:32,586
is shut real tight
before we open the big door

354
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:34,487
so the bad air
doesn't get the flowers

355
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,158
when the cars drive out,
and then, when the deliveries come in,

356
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:41,244
I have to do the same thing,
except backwards.

357
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,881
- Sounds like a lot to remember.
- I'm good at it.

358
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,457
Mr. Autry says I'm vigilant.

359
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:47,959
It's cold in here.

360
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,839
It's good for the flowers.

361
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,964
Were you in the navy?
A lot of people in the navy wear those.

362
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,382
They're called luminox.

363
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,676
Yeah. Good catch.
I was in the navy.

364
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:59,244
Yeah, I tried out to be in the army,

365
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:00,972
but I didn't pass the test.

366
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,809
My friend, Mr. Lynch...
He's a marine.

367
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,937
He still goes on missions sometimes.
He said maybe I could help out on one.

368
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,647
That's cool.
When is it?

369
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,442
I don't know.
I'm on alert status.

370
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,986
Did he say what you'd be doing?

371
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:18,948
- He just said to be ready.
- Mr Lynch sounds like a cool friend.

372
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,493
You want to meet him?
He's having a party today.

373
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,887
That sounds fun,
but I got a lot of work to do,

374
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:26,456
so you go do your thing,
and I'll catch up with you in a bit.

375
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:29,334
- See you later.
- Thanks.

376
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,840
Fi, are you in a partying mood?

377
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:48,317
<i>Infiltrating hostile territory
is all about blending in,</i>

378
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:51,975
<i>which means, if you're a sniper
in the bush, you wear a ghillie suit,</i>

379
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,920
<i>and if you're a beautiful woman
at a Miami house party,</i>

380
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,745
<i>you wear a slinky dress.</i>

381
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,950
Retard's looking bored.

382
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,537
Watch this.
Dougie, have a little shot with me.

383
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,805
Cheers, pal.

384
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:10,875
It's good?

385
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,040
Show us some moves.

386
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:19,661
There it is.

387
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:25,761
Fantastic.

388
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:31,465
Excuse me, folks.

389
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,897
Thank you. Enjoy the party.

390
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,901
Lynch just called a meeting.

391
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,611
That's great. Stay close.

392
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:40,738
Looks like it's members only.

393
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,908
Then, you got to join the club, Fi.
We got to get ears on those guys.

394
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,750
<i>A bug is only as good
as what it hears,</i>

395
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,360
<i>so if the discussion
you want to be part of</i>

396
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:52,208
<i>isn't taking place
around your listening device,</i>

397
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,090
<i>you have two choices.
You can move the discussion,</i>

398
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:56,915
<i>or you can move the bug.</i>

399
00:20:57,953 --> 00:21:00,852
Excuse me. Excuse me.
This room's off-limits now.

400
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:05,220
My car keys were in my pocket...

401
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:07,639
Your keys, honey, we can help you
find them later, all right?

402
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,934
- <i>They're in here.</i>
- <i>We'll help you find them later.</i>

403
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,210
If we can't find them, I'll give you
a ride myself, personally, all right?

404
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:15,335
- Call me.
- Enjoy the party.

405
00:21:18,115 --> 00:21:19,944
I just got off the phone with Bolo.

406
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:23,300
He found us a thief who can get us
the last piece of hardware we need.

407
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:25,290
Sweet. How soon can we get it?

408
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:27,326
He's making the intro tomorrow
with La Covacha.

409
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:28,495
Way to go, Fi.

410
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,789
<i>We got the retard. We'll get
the hardware and be good to go.</i>

411
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:38,165
Those are some grade-A
sons of bitches in there.

412
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,968
- Where's your gun, Sam?
- I moved it, Fi,

413
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:45,765
for your own good.

414
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,432
If it'll make you feel better,
your trick gave something we could use.

415
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,395
If we can use it
to bludgeon Lynch to death,

416
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,225
- I'll feel better.
- One step at a time.

417
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,300
Lynch is meeting with a thief.
Good news is he's never seen the guy.

418
00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:59,692
I know somebody else
he's never seen.

419
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:08,990
You'll know Bolo when you see him?

420
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:12,760
Yeah, I figured if he's pimping thieves,
he must be a fence, so I called Barry.

421
00:22:12,885 --> 00:22:15,666
He knew him, gave me a description
of the guy and his car.

422
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:18,115
And there it is.

423
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:24,490
- Got the cooperation juice ready?
- Yeah, it's ready.

424
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:25,797
Let's do this, doc.

425
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,140
Bolo, right?
Hey, somebody left a note for you.

426
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:42,770
- A note?
- Yeah, right back here.

427
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,260
<i>Everyone knows
about the placebo effect.</i>

428
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:48,261
<i>People get healed by sugar water
because they think it's medicine.</i>

429
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:50,785
- You can't just bring it to me?
- It's right around the corner.

430
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,600
<i>Of course, the placebo
doesn't just work for medicine.</i>

431
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:55,957
- Man! What the hell?
- You're gonna want to hold still.

432
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,700
<i>It turns out fake poisons
work pretty well, too,</i>

433
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:03,120
<i>which is useful when you need someone
terrified enough to do whatever you say.</i>

434
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:07,100
You've just been injected with 3 cc's
of methyl chlorate benzamide.

435
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:10,768
That's science talk for "You got 5 hours
to live, unless you find an antidote".

436
00:23:10,893 --> 00:23:14,183
-  Who are you guys? Man, what do you...
- Shut up and focus.

437
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,240
Now, you'll get the antidote
if and only if you do exactly as say.

438
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,523
- Do you understand?
- I understand! I understand!

439
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,000
You are going to call whoever
you're introducing to Lynch.

440
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,265
You will tell him to go back home.

441
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,988
- I am him today.
- Right.

442
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,674
Try to stay calm.

443
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,537
The faster your heart beats, the faster
the poison gets into your bloodstream.

444
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:38,374
Man, I'm feeling a little,
a little...

445
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:40,007
- Feverish?
- Yeah.

446
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,015
That's what happens
when the chlorate kicks in.

447
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,006
Your hands will shake. Then you'll have
difficulty controlling your bowels.

448
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,578
- Oh, god. Why'd you do this to me, man?
- You'll be fine with the antidote.

449
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:51,254
Now pull yourself together
and make sure Lynch likes me.

450
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:53,848
Lynch

451
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,175
Been a long time, man. How you been?

452
00:23:57,775 --> 00:24:00,396
- You been good? You look good.
- Let's get to the introductions, Bolo.

453
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,482
Sure.

454
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,607
This is D.J.

455
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:04,983
This is the one man
who can get you what you want.

456
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,820
Familiar with heavy equipment?

457
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,425
Yeah, he knows heavy equipment
like I know hot stones, man.

458
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,860
- Let's make a deal.
- You need to stop talking for a minute.

459
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,118
Let me talk to D.J.

460
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:15,953
Cool. Do your thing, man.

461
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,748
You know what this is?

462
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,211
That there's a hydraulic
cutter/spreader on steroids.

463
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,130
Some people call it
the jaws of life.

464
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:28,508
- Can you get one for me?
- Are you kidding?

465
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:30,618
D.J. hot-wired a front loader

466
00:24:30,743 --> 00:24:33,460
and drove it off a construction site.
You think he can't get one of those?

467
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,515
- He can get anything you need.
- Won't be easy,

468
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:39,602
seeing how only emergency-response
agencies are allowed to have that kind.

469
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:42,150
Well, if I could get it at Walmart,

470
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:43,898
I wouldn't need you, would I?

471
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,455
You sure you can't use
the step-down version?

472
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,640
Still cuts through metal,
just takes a little longer.

473
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:52,051
What are you cutting on?

474
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:54,075
There's a can of tuna
I'm having trouble with.

475
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,443
Yeah, where is this can of tuna?
Do you have a power source?

476
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,997
The more details I know,
the better job I do.

477
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:05,017
You don't get details. You get pieces
of green paper called money,

478
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:07,922
when I get my equipment.
You want the gig or not?

479
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,508
He wants it!

480
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,360
I know a match when I see a match,
and this is a match.

481
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,001
Can we shake on this, please?

482
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:17,890
It's gonna take a few days
for your little dream to come true.

483
00:25:18,795 --> 00:25:21,769
You get one day.
Otherwise, I find somebody else.

484
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,436
No. No, no, you can't do that.

485
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,635
Tell him it's a deal.

486
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,425
<i>Working undercover
is all about judgment calls.</i>

487
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,802
<i>Give the bad guy too little help,
and you can't do your job.</i>

488
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:32,947
Say it's a deal.

489
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,608
<i>Give the bad guy too much help,
and you become part of the problem.</i>

490
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,452
- Deal.
- <i>It's a tough call,</i>

491
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,270
<i>but sometimes things have to get worse
before they get better.</i>

492
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:52,489
I don't like this.

493
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:54,853
We got all these pieces
and still no answer.

494
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:56,448
Dougie's flapping in the breeze,

495
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:58,389
and we have less than a day
to pull him in?

496
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,740
There has to be a connection
to the flower mart.

497
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:02,143
Or they wouldn't need him.

498
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,730
No, thing is, there's not enough
cash there to justify a major heist.

499
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,024
And Lynch isn't doing this
to steal a dozen roses.

500
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,150
Those flowers have to go somewhere.

501
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:13,069
Lynch might be using a delivery
to get access to a target.

502
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:17,074
Makes sense. He uses Doug
to sneak his crew onto one of the vans.

503
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, now you're cooking with gas.

504
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:22,079
You order a bunch of tulips, and you get
a full-scale heist to go with it.

505
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,955
I'll circle back to the flower mart,

506
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,514
try and get my hands
on the delivery schedule.

507
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,739
Fi, when Sam gets that schedule...

508
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:31,422
He's gonna need help
scouting locations Lynch might hit.

509
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,966
Consider it covered.

510
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:38,303
I got word
on your friend Claude's preferred MO.

511
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,050
I don't know if this helps any,

512
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:43,476
but he's made a habit of scaling
the sides of buildings. Free climbing.

513
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:46,015
Helps a lot, Fi. Thanks.

514
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,030
Your ears must have been burning!
I was just calling you!

515
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:55,030
Listen, about the reception...
I was wondering...

516
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,164
Mom, where's
that city-inspector shirt

517
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:59,970
dad used to wear
when he was stealing equipment?

518
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:02,195
- You mean "borrowing".
- Sure.

519
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,596
Where is it?

520
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:04,721
Move.

521
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:11,015
A false wall?

522
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,950
I'm surprised
you never found it before.

523
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:17,475
Your dad liked to have a place
to keep his private stuff.

524
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:19,515
You should find
what you want in there.

525
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,265
Anyway, so, I needed
a new outfit for Saturday,

526
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,143
and while I was out,
I got something for you.

527
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,062
You like it?

528
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:33,526
I know it's not exactly your style,
but it goes great with my skirt.

529
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:37,238
About Saturday...
Something's kind of come up.

530
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:41,335
- So, put it back down.
- I can't. It's complicated.

531
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:43,286
People could get hurt.

532
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,247
We certainly
wouldn't want that to happen.

533
00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:48,885
So, by all means,

534
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,580
do what it is you have to do.

535
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:52,970
I bought it on clearance.
I can't return it,

536
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,330
so you might as well keep it.

537
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,230
Mr. Autry, I know it's a pain,
but I need your whole delivery schedule.

538
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:05,582
I'm a little busy right now.
Can't I just fax it later?

539
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:08,360
Look, I'm sorry to rush you, Mr. Autry,
but I got to have it now.

540
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:11,830
I had to turn my report in yesterday,
but the supe won't take it without it.

541
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,733
- I'll be right back.
- Appreciate it.

542
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,570
- That's a pretty bouquet, Doug.
- Thanks.

543
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:24,328
Mr. Autry said I could
take flowers to my cousin.

544
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,453
He got shot.

545
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:29,040
Well, I'll tell you, getting flowers
helped me when I got shot.

546
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:31,833
You got shot?
In action?

547
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:34,700
We were pulling some civilian workers
out of a hot spot in Kuwait.

548
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,395
I caught a bullet on the way out.

549
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,633
After those flowers came,
I got better like lickety-split.

550
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:41,927
That's cool.
I hope these work.

551
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,145
Mr. Finley.

552
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:45,215
Our deliveries
for the next two weeks.

553
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,840
That is great.
Boy, have you bailed me out. Thanks.

554
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:49,265
See you, Dougie.

555
00:28:52,385 --> 00:28:54,160
<i>Even the most skilled operative</i>

556
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:56,817
<i>knows a good plan is 10% execution,</i>

557
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,277
<i>90% preparation.</i>

558
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,698
<i>Advance work is crucial if you want
an operation to be successful.</i>

559
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,786
<i>Advance work is also crucial
if you want an operation to fail.</i>

560
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,748
<i>For example, for someone who likes</i>

561
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,666
<i>to break into buildings
by free climbing,</i>

562
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,776
<i>tampering with potential handholds
could be a very serious problem.</i>

563
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:22,610
Sam get the schedule?

564
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:25,930
<i>Yeah, any progress getting
the hydraulic cutters Lynch wants?</i>

565
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,265
I'm just on my way.

566
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:32,350
<i>Jaws of life are standard equipment
for emergency-rescue outfits.</i>

567
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:34,730
<i>If you'd rather not take a set
that might be needed,</i>

568
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:37,455
<i>you don't steal them
from a fire station.</i>

569
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,340
<i>A fire training center,
on the other hand,</i>

570
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:42,487
<i>can probably miss theirs
for a few days</i>

571
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,657
<i>without risking anyone's life.</i>

572
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,677
- Who sent you to get our cutters?
- HQ routine maintenance.

573
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:50,690
- Have them back to you in a few days.
- A heads-up would have been nice.

574
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:53,275
Why don't you come back on Monday?
We'll have them ready.

575
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,064
No can do. HQ's already breathing
down our ass for falling behind.

576
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:58,320
I got you and three other firehouses
I got to hit today.

577
00:29:58,445 --> 00:29:59,661
I don't know what to say.

578
00:29:59,786 --> 00:30:01,950
It's my job to get recruits
ready to fight fires.

579
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:05,094
I got a class training on those cutters
today and tomorrow,

580
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,203
You have HQ call me
if they've got a problem.

581
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:09,390
What? You're using them right now?

582
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,311
Shut it off! Shut it off!
Shut it down!

583
00:30:17,264 --> 00:30:19,058
- What are you doing?
- You see those lines?

584
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:21,206
One wrong twist,
and that goes "snap, crackle, pop!"

585
00:30:21,331 --> 00:30:23,529
That will start flipping around
like a rattlesnake on PCP!

586
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,156
You know what you can do then?

587
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,783
You take your right hand.
You wave goodbye to your left.

588
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:33,247
Hold on.

589
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:36,760
Somebody want to help him
load them onto his truck?

590
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:38,711
- Yeah, that's heavy.
- Come on. Let's go.

591
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,674
Act like you got some sense here.

592
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:52,180
We got the location
on Lynch's heist.

593
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:54,197
Hotel Milano.
It's the only one that fits.

594
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:56,978
They're hosting an international
art auction, so there's loot.

595
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:59,355
Back of the place lets out
onto the Miami river.

596
00:30:59,715 --> 00:31:01,816
Easy water getaway
if you've got mini O2 tanks.

597
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,486
How do hydraulic cutters fit in?

598
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,280
You ever seen those steel crates
they ship priceless paintings in?

599
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,710
You couldn't use torches on those
without burning the paintings.

600
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:12,010
I'm telling you, Mike,
it's got to be this one.

601
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:13,800
It's got to be the hotel Milano.

602
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:16,289
Best part is, flower mart
is not delivering till next week.

603
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:18,430
- We're off the clock.
- That's right.

604
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,455
You get those cutters
to Lynch tomorrow,

605
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,547
we'll have plenty of time to make sure
he's walking into a bear trap.

606
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:25,945
Nice.

607
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,470
Get it in the van.

608
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:31,430
Listen, I sprinkled a little extra cash
in here since you beat the clock.

609
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,597
I aim to please.

610
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:35,935
You ever want to put in some time
with a real crew, give me a call.

611
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,325
Just might do that.

612
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:45,053
Call the retard.
Make sure he's at work.

613
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:47,488
- I called him this morning.
- Call him again!

614
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:54,400
- Fi, get Sam.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

615
00:31:54,525 --> 00:31:56,747
Lynch is on the move.
We missed something.

616
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,258
I've checked.
They can't be headed to the flower mart.

617
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:01,335
Then why would Lynch make sure
Dougie's at work?

618
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,419
Check again.

619
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,523
<i>There's nothing worse
than the feeling you get</i>

620
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:07,507
<i>when you know you've made
a serious tactical mistake,</i>

621
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:10,310
<i>when you thought you had
two days to deal with a problem</i>

622
00:32:10,435 --> 00:32:12,614
<i>and you realize you may not
even have two hours.</i>

623
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:13,639
Oh, damn it.

624
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:15,933
How did I miss that?

625
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,228
<i>Because when you make
mistakes like that, people die.</i>

626
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,229
Miss what?

627
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,661
There's a pickup this afternoon
that's listed as "Anderson".

628
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:24,417
I figured
it was a guy named Anderson,

629
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,819
but it's gotta be Anderson Couriers,
an armored truck.

630
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:30,071
Today's Friday, so they're probably
doing end-of-the-week pickups.

631
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:33,350
This late in the day,
that truck's gonna be loaded with cash.

632
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:36,875
We got to get to the flower mart.
Lynch's heist is going on right now.

633
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,310
<i>When you make a mistake
in the field,</i>

634
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:46,408
<i>the key is to focus on solutions,
not regrets.</i>

635
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:49,775
<i>Being sorry doesn't mean much
in combat situations.</i>

636
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:52,325
<i>You can't apologize to a corpse.</i>

637
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,110
They're gonna hit the armored truck
in the loading bay.

638
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:57,725
They needed Dougie to let them in.

639
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:00,686
They got a guy on the roof.

640
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:05,080
They're gonna gas the loading bay.
It's sealed to keep the flowers fresh.

641
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:07,651
They'll kill everyone and cut open
the truck with the jaws of life.

642
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,135
And they use the oxygen tanks
to breathe, the bastards.

643
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,780
- How much time do we have?
- Armored truck is due any minute.

644
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,657
Can you make sure
it leaves in a hurry?

645
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,203
You take the guy on the roof.
I'll get Dougie out.

646
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,706
No, Mike, he knows me.
I'll get him out.

647
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,374
Seriously, I got it.

648
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:29,375
Hey, big guy, just came by
to take a look at the flowers.

649
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:33,262
The bank truck is supposed to be here
in a minute. I got to go get the door.

650
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:36,477
That's okay, pal.
We'll make sure to stay out of your way.

651
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,118
The last thing you wanna do in Miami
is fool with people's air-conditioning.

652
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:09,833
You can't stay!
That's where the trucks come in.

653
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,174
No, I just gotta talk to you
outside real quick, all right?

654
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,572
Come on.
I gotta get you out of here.

655
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,447
Dougie, what the hell's going on?

656
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,865
What are you doing?

657
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,867
- Mr. Lynch, what are you...
- Go! Run!

658
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:44,123
I said get out of here!

659
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:02,835
Keep going, Dougie!

660
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,087
Go on! Go, go, go!

661
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:14,225
Get in the car, Dougie!

662
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:16,425
Go!

663
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,248
Hello?

664
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,792
Tyler, the doors are locked!
You got to get us out of here now!

665
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:32,670
Sorry.
Tyler can't talk right now.

666
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,506
<i>But, hey, the cops are on their way,</i>

667
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,051
and I hope that they can get in there
before your oxygen tanks run out.

668
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,013
The gas! Get the masks!
Get the masks!

669
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:46,560
Whoever you are, you are dead.
Do you hear me? You are dead!

670
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,728
Good luck.

671
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:56,366
I don't know how many times
I have to get shot

672
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:58,250
before I start listening to you.

673
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,240
Hopefully, this one did the trick.

674
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:02,785
It was for a good cause, anyway.

675
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,829
Dougie's safe. Lynch and his crew
are going away for a long time.

676
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:07,435
Thank you.

677
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,225
When we were kids...

678
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:15,465
No one was meaner to Dougie than me.

679
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:18,467
I wouldn't even let him
hang around me.

680
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:22,126
One day, I ran into some trouble
in the neighborhood.

681
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:23,680
I was getting my ass kicked.

682
00:36:24,135 --> 00:36:25,435
All of a sudden,

683
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,284
here comes big Dougie,

684
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:29,145
backing me up.

685
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,305
I asked him why later.

686
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:34,885
You know what he said?

687
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:38,905
"I love you, Raymond."

688
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:42,725
"We're family."

689
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,915
Like it was just that simple.

690
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:11,352
<i>A good diversion
draws people's attention,</i>

691
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:13,560
<i>but doesn't make them
run for their lives.</i>

692
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:15,617
<i>If you're using a parked vehicle,</i>

693
00:37:15,742 --> 00:37:19,403
<i>that means you want smoke and fire
without the risk of an explosion.</i>

694
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,948
<i>Olive oil starts to smoke
at 375 degrees.</i>

695
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:27,051
<i>Mix it in the right amount of cheap
motor oil with a low flash point...</i>

696
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:31,957
<i>Apply it to the inside
of the exhaust pipe...</i>

697
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:41,725
<i>And you should have enough time
to walk away before the fun starts.</i>

698
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:58,645
- If anyone comes into the alley...
- I know, shoot them several times.

699
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,170
- Can we get this over with?
- Right.

700
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:08,243
<i>In free climbing,
the general rule is always to maintain</i>

701
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,204
<i>at least two points of contact
with the surface.</i>

702
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:20,710
<i>Challenging climbs always include
a point where the only way to continue</i>

703
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:23,926
<i>is to make a leap
from one point of support to the next.</i>

704
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:28,871
<i>For experienced climbers, it's a routine
technique with minimal risk.</i>

705
00:38:29,485 --> 00:38:32,017
<i>Unless, of course,
the handhold you're jumping to</i>

706
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:34,269
<i>is coated
with a silicon-based lubricant.</i>

707
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:42,903
Come on.
We got to get out of here.

708
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:50,120
The department needs more people
like you, citizens who care.

709
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,993
One thing I've learned
over the years...

710
00:38:52,118 --> 00:38:54,539
No city can be truly safe
unless the people,

711
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,750
ordinary men and women,
get involved.

712
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:59,502
Cops get the credit,
but you're the real heroes.

713
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:03,256
Well, you should meet my son Michael.
He's always getting involved.

714
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,051
Maybe someday you can introduce us.

715
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:07,905
He'd enjoy meet...

716
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,856
I thought you couldn't come.

717
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,079
Yeah. I was able to break free.

718
00:39:23,724 --> 00:39:24,778
Anybody get hurt?

719
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:30,735
- Is it over now?
- Not yet.

720
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,490
You know what?

721
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,390
Let's get you out of here.

722
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:42,765
- What about your award, ma?
- They can mail it to me.

723
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:49,115
- You can take your tie off now.
- Thank you.

724
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:55,943
Glad you could make lunch
after such a busy morning.

725
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,605
I heard drinking whiskey before dinner
was a sign of weakness.

726
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:03,920
Indulge me,
out of respect for Claude.

727
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:05,360
Dalmore was his favorite.

728
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:07,154
Was his favorite?

729
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,532
Unfortunately, our comrade
didn't survive his injuries.

730
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,243
- He broke his ankle.
- There were complications.

731
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:15,581
Luckily, we still have each other.

732
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,290
You wanted to work alone?
Bully.

733
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:22,794
The acquisition of those documents
is now solely your responsibility.

734
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:27,410
You know, I feel like

735
00:40:27,535 --> 00:40:30,385
we've moved on
to a new level of trust.

736
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:34,138
Maybe now you can tell me
where this relationship is headed.

737
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:37,350
If Claude's failure teaches us anything,
it's that we must live in the moment.

738
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:41,480
I suggest you honor his memory
by completing his mission.

739
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:43,915
Consider it...

740
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:45,413
A reason for living,

741
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
as it were.

742
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:52,605
To Claude.

743
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:56,205
And to living.
