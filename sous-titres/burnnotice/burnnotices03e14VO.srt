1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:01,751
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,769
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,751
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,818
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,136
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,771
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:16,140
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:19,040
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,441
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:28,319
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,696
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:33,115
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,326
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,953
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,830
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,336
<i>Previously on</i> Burn Notice.

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,336
I don't know why you're willing
to meet Gilroy.

19
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:48,324
He sounds as bad as
the people who burned you.

20
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,340
He's worse.

21
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,344
This man is a freelance psychopath.

22
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:52,510
Westen.

23
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:56,497
I have to say,
I find you quite fascinating.

24
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:58,015
You and I have a lot in common.

25
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,309
- What do you say we work together?
- Tempting.

26
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,475
The gist is this.

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,886
You're to steal flight data

28
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:06,273
for every private plane flying in and
out of Miami for the next six weeks.

29
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:08,401
- What are you doing?
- I'm offering you a job.

30
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,404
You do it, you get paid money.
That's all you need to know.

31
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,773
This is another moment of truth.

32
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:16,322
Do we have a future together or not?

33
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,451
Double my fee.

34
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,661
Fair enough.

35
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,194
I may lose my seat at the table

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,915
if I don't come up with six weeks'
worth of private flight records.

37
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,459
- I was thinking the coast guard.
- That's a good choice.

38
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,477
This is every flight today.

39
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,256
Every day is exactly like that

40
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,674
except one day.

41
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:32,940
The 22nd.

42
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:34,927
Somebody needs a wide berth.

43
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,679
This is some serious black flight.

44
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:40,599
Originating in Chile,
fuel stop in Miami, destination...

45
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,517
Poland.

46
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,314
This is what
Gilroy is interested in.

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,896
You're a tad overdressed
for the jacuzzi, don't you think?

48
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:47,876
It's your card?

49
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,940
It's blatantly not six weeks
of flight plans.

50
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:51,369
Just the one that you want.

51
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:53,128
I need to know
what's going to Poland.

52
00:01:53,253 --> 00:01:55,406
I suppose it's only natural
to be curious.

53
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,524
It's a weaponized plague
and a vaccine to match.

54
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:00,578
And they're worth a lot of money.

55
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,871
That wasn't so hard?

56
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:03,247
You're in?

57
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:06,834
I think you and I
have a bright future together.

58
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,210
- Learn anything?
- Only that he's a damn good liar.

59
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:19,054
<i>When you need to locate a foreign
spy office, it's all about the food.</i>

60
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,223
<i>Spies like home cooking
just like everyone else.</i>

61
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,561
<i>Find out who serves
their regional delicacies,</i>

62
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,603
<i>tip the bartenders
and delivery boys well,</i>

63
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,063
s<i>and they'll usually tell you
who placed the big orders</i>

64
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:30,333
<i>on the last national holiday.</i>

65
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,141
<i>If some of these orders
head to an office with tight security</i>

66
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,276
<i>and scowling workers
with short haircuts,</i>

67
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:36,627
<i>you're in business.</i>

68
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:37,516
You know,

69
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,841
some guys take girls to the beach,

70
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:41,317
concerts,

71
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,262
farmers' markets.

72
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:48,109
Ugly Polish
military-intelligence offices...

73
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,336
Not so much.

74
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,222
I'd rather be at a farmers' market

75
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:55,007
than bribing a bureaucrat
to tell me what's on a spy plane.

76
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,425
I have an idea.

77
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,527
Instead of working
with Gilroy the psychopath,

78
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:03,516
instead of sneaking around to figure out
what he wants from this plane, shoot him

79
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,820
- and be done with him.
- I've considered it.

80
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:07,365
But somebody hired Gilroy.

81
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,920
If I want to find out
what's going on and stop it,

82
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,191
I need him breathing,
and you know that.

83
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,766
There he is, right on time.

84
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,988
This guy Conrad
is the one to go after?

85
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,802
Low on the totem pole at work,

86
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,659
short on cash, bad divorce.

87
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:23,968
He's perfect.
We're meeting later today.

88
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,997


89
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:28,693
How's your Polish?

90
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:30,082
Rusty,

91
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,662
but his mom's from Moscow.

92
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,476
I approach him
as a Russian businessman,

93
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,756
buy him a few dinners,

94
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,803
and hopefully we end this quick.

95
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:46,630
<i>Playing on people's loyalties
is an art,</i>

96
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:49,788
<i>especially when those loyalties
can be murky and malleable.</i>

97
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:52,399
<i>Poke around too much
and you'll look suspicious.</i>

98
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,978
<i>Sometimes your best move
is just to commit.</i>

99
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:56,402
Thank you for meeting me.

100
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,290
It's better to do business
eye-to-eye.

101
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,490
What couldn't you discuss on e-mail?

102
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:03,876
Your office has information on...

103
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,369
covert flights

104
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:07,496
passing through Miami to Poland.

105
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,164
I need information on a flight.

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,208
- Why?
- I own planes.

107
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,335
I'm trying to get contract
on this flight.

108
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:16,998
It would be easier
if I knew what was on the plane.

109
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,133
It's a little thing
but worth a lot of money to me.

110
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:24,276


111
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,808


112
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,291
Russians.

113
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:32,790
Please let me get briefcase.

114
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,640


115
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,565
<i>Commit too hard to the wrong side,
and there's not much wiggle room.</i>

116
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,240
<i>Instead of an instant ally,</i>

117
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,450
<i>you've just made an instant enemy.</i>

118
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,495
Did you really think you could buy me,
that I would betray my country to you?

119
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:52,750
I was wondering why there is
extra security at office this week.

120
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,335
Easy, Conrad. Relax.

121
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,165
You sons of bitches
cost me everything.

122
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,362
My job in Poland,
my wife, my family.

123
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:02,051
Over there now.

124
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:08,413
You're going to tell me everything.

125
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:10,362
And then I'm going to cut out

126
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:13,493
your lying FSB tongue!

127
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,487
So much for an easy target.

128
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,221
You're seriously gonna try
to break into Conrad's office?

129
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,115
What else can I do?
I can't approach Conrad's co-workers.

130
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:47,513
What about a better angle on Conrad?

131
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,350
The guy who wanted
to interrogate me at gunpoint?

132
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,163
But we do know
that he can't stand the Russians.

133
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:55,646
That's our in.

134
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:58,774
Our in?
Are you volunteering?

135
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,966
I confess I am a little curious

136
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,114
about what a psycho like Gilroy
is so interested in stealing.

137
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,783
Probably best to approach
as American intelligence.

138
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:09,702
I'll need cash for this.

139
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,786
Deal.

140
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,224
Sam's has a job
he's been bugging me to take.

141
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,259
Fashion house that got robbed.
The lady who runs it needs some help.

142
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:18,380
- The pay is good.
- He talked to me about it, too,

143
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,504
but he sounded
more interested in the models.

144
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,473
Sam, you know that job,
the fashion gig?

145
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:25,342
So you're in?
Tell me that you're in.

146
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,341
- Is the money there?
- The money's there.

147
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:29,661
This lady is loaded.
You should see her fashion house.

148
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:32,433
It's in the Viceroy hotel,
and she is willing to pay.

149
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,480
All right, Sam, I'm in.

150
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,411
Thank you, Mike.

151
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,955
This covers Christmas,
my birthday present.

152
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,485
I'll swing by and pick you up.

153
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:50,659
<i>When you're conducting surveillance
from a dusty cave in Afghanistan,</i>

154
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,083
<i>you daydream about air-conditioning,
swimming pools, and iced tea.</i>

155
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,132
<i>But spend a little time
waiting for a socialite</i>

156
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:58,517
<i>to hand off her tiny dog
to a canine beautician,</i>

157
00:06:58,642 --> 00:07:00,893
<i>and that Afghan cave
looks a little better.</i>

158
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:02,349
His usual pedicure,

159
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:06,091
of course the oatmeal shampoo,
and don't forget to rub his belly.

160
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,802
Colonel Peabody just loves
when you do that.

161
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,305
- Who doesn't?
- You're funny...

162
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,252
And cute.

163
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:16,018
My girlfriend said
you were a man of many talents.

164
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,103

You should do your own research.

165
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,899
Sam said something about a job.

166
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,335
One of your employees is stealing?

167
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,821
His name is Tim Hastings,
and we've been fighting a lot lately.

168
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,990
Now the numbers don't add up,
which means

169
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,492
that money's disappearing.

170
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,285
You would like us to find the money.

171
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,787
I need you to be discreet.

172
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,580
We'll keep it quiet.

173
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:39,708
How much do you charge?
Is $30,000 enough?

174
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,462
- That's too much.
- Please.

175
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:46,511
This might take a couple of days.

176
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,585
You won't be disappointed.

177
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,599


178
00:07:56,707 --> 00:08:00,407
<i>Recruiting an asset is about making
your target feel important.</i>

179
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:03,273
<i>Everything from the clothes you wear
to the location of the meeting </i>

180
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,623
<i>should communicate
how vital the mission is.</i>

181
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,206
<i>Wear the right outfit,
pick the right deserted bar,</i>

182
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,197
<i>and your target will be
ready to engage</i>

183
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,815
<i>in some good,
old-fashioned espionage.</i>

184
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:16,036
We understand you were approached
by the Russians.

185
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,208
Are you from the Agency?

186
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:24,892
We have reason to believe there's
a Russian spy targeting your office.

187
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,382
He posed as businessman.

188
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,968
We need to figure out
who this spy is and what he's after.

189
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,580
Of course.

190
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,806
He asked me for information
about flight.

191
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,641
This flight is very important.

192
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,966
Security at my office has doubled.

193
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,522
We need to know.

194
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:46,358
I can't.

195
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,306
It's not my job to guard
this information.

196
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:54,449
It won't be easy.
You'll be taking a risk.

197
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,589
We know how important this is.

198
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,705
We will cover expenses.

199
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,206
Anything you need.

200
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,627
<i>Some assets work for money.
Others believe in a cause.</i>

201
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:09,423
<i>The most effective incentive, though,
is a combination of the two.</i>

202
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:18,891
All right.

203
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,351
Perhaps I can find this information.

204
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,187
But what about
this Russian cockroach?

205
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,392
I think we have a file on him.

206
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:26,273
Good.

207
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:30,206
Good news, Michael.

208
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,314
Conrad's enthusiastic.

209
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,031
I think we're gonna win
the Cold War.

210
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,016
He's in?

211
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,141
And then some.

212
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:39,369
Thing is,
I promised him the CIA file

213
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:41,944
on the Russian spy
he almost captured.

214
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,876
I think I'm gonna call your mom,
ask her for some pictures of you

215
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,486
<i>in your military days.</i>

216
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:50,005
Not my mom,
I don't want her involved in this.

217
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,423
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

218
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,642
- You okay there, Mikey?
- I'm fine.

219
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,557
What's up
with this easy-money job of yours?

220
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:01,536
Bad news.

221
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:03,919
I had my fingers crossed that Tim,

222
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,021
the thieving vice president,
had a police record,

223
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,273
but he's either clean or careful.

224
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,624
Owns a gun, but it's registered.

225
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:12,905
No parking tickets, even.

226
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,114
You're smiling.

227
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,991
The fashion house is having a party,
and everyone's gonna be in the atrium.

228
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:20,818
That means one of us
can sneak into Tim's office

229
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,640
while the other one
keeps an eye on him

230
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:23,830
at the party.

231
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,513
Let me guess which job you'd like.

232
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:29,336
I'm partial to Isabella, models,
and mojitos, but I play fair.

233
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,080
I figured we'd flip a coin.

234
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:32,669
Call it.

235
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:34,800
- Heads.
- Cheater.

236
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,115
Quite a party.

237
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,701
Sam don't come?

238
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:04,454
He's using your access codes
to go through Tim's office.

239
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,790
<i>If you're dealing with a operative,</i>

240
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,150
<i>there are hundreds of places
to hunt for documents.</i>

241
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:12,593
<i>If you're searching a jockey's office,
it's a far shorter list.</i>

242
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:15,718
<i>Before saying "in the cabinet", "behind
the bookshelf", "under the desk",</i>

243
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,028
<i>you've usually found
what you're looking for.</i>

244
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:26,100
Which one's Tim?
I want to keep an eye on him.

245
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:28,270
- He's standing right over there.
- Now! Go!

246
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:35,277
Act casual.

247
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,275
Of course.

248
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,200
<i>Let me have a word with you.</i>

249
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,076
- Who is he talking to now?
- That's my business partner, Damon.

250
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,829
He started out designing,
and I was modeling.

251
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,372
This company's our baby.

252
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,502
I'm supposed to be at home
looking at his designs.

253
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,208
- Okay.
- I really should go.

254
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,105
You should go.
Go home. Do some work.

255
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,505
I'll call you later.

256
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:00,990
<i>Spies are trained to keep track</i>

257
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:03,255
<i>of multiple conversations
at the same time.</i>

258
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,208
<i>Standing alone as you eavesdrop
is too obvious.</i>

259
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,603
<i>You need to engage in a cover
conversation near your target.</i>

260
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:11,735
Hi.

261
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:14,497
Who are you wearing?

262
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,660
Black suit.

263
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:20,280
Love that dress.
I've never seen anything quite like it.

264
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:23,241
No one has, darling.
It's an Alexander Deschuno.

265
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,371
- I bought...
- <i>Pure lip-reading</i>

266
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,272
- <i>takes years to master.</i>
- Of course.

267
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,081
<i>But confirming what you're hearing</i>

268
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,080
<i>by checking lips
is a much easier skill to pick up.</i>

269
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:34,211
Don't get upset at me.
She said it.

270
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,298
You know what?
I'm gonna go talk to her,

271
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,793
- 'cause this is ridiculous.
- Good. I think that's a good idea.

272
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:42,268
You must visit my shop
in the design district.

273
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:43,768
Vintage Couture.

274
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,443
I'm talking classics.

275
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:46,928
That's great.

276
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:49,606
How's it going?

277
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:52,160
Jackpot. Found the books in his office.
Sent you a photo.

278
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,188
Good. Tim's heading over
to talk to Isabella at her house.

279
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:57,956
- She'll want to see that picture.
- Okay, good. Head over there.

280
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,887
I'll leave Tim's office
how I found it.

281
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:01,072
Ugly.

282
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,419
You were at the party.

283
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,524
- What are you doing, following me?
- I'm Michael. I work for Isabella.

284
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,091
- I think we should talk.
- I got nothing to say.

285
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,593
Save it for inside.

286
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,137
We found her financial records
in your office.

287
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:28,363
You were in my office?
That's illegal.

288
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,396
I should have you arrested.

289
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,429
<i>It doesn't take long working</i>

290
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,488
<i>in combat situations before you start
paying attention</i>

291
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,357
- <i>to little things.</i>
- Isabella?

292
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,693
<i>Things that don't feel right,
like an open gate</i>

293
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,780
<i>or a pampered dog running around loose
often lead to much bigger things...</i>

294
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,888
Oh, my god!
Isabella?

295
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,143
Jesus Christ.
What the...

296
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:50,078
<i>... like a body in a swimming pool.</i>

297
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,622
- We have to call an ambulance.
- Yeah, it's too late.

298
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,990
Or the police.

299
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,586
- Somebody already called them.
- <i>Of course, knowing</i>

300
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,055
<i>something's wrong and being able to do
something are two different things.</i>

301
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,664
<i>Sometimes the damage
is already done.</i>

302
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,280
That's my gun.

303
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:07,048
What the hell is happening?

304
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:09,055
You've been framed.
Somebody set you up.

305
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:13,044
No, no, don't.
Don't touch it.

306
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:17,225
Believe me.
I didn't shoot her.

307
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,805
Yeah, obviously.

308
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,558
- We got to go out the backyard.
- The backyard won't work.

309
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:23,987
There's a wall.
We'll be trapped.

310
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,658
I vote the backyard.

311
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,997
I told you.
We're trapped.

312
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,374
Want to head back?
Be my guest. Otherwise,

313
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,868
step on my hands.

314
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:43,256
We have to go get my car. If
they find it, they'll know I was here.

315
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,455
- They'll think...
- I know you want to chat,

316
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,280
but now is not the time.

317
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,681
Grab this.

318
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,726
Wrap it around your wrist.
Fall. When you do,

319
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,354
you'll be pulling me up. Ready?
1, 2, 3.

320
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,823
Easy-money gig?

321
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,781
I've been checking the scanner
since you called.

322
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,530
The cops are sending more units
to Isabella's house.

323
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,030
They found Tim's car,
but they didn't see you.

324
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:20,811
Whoever pulled the trigger must
have escaped before we got there.

325
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:24,324
We got to call the cops.
I'm gonna explain everything right now.

326
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,546
You know I'm innocent.
So...

327
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:28,927
if we go to the police,

328
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,846
- we can even take a lie-detector test.
- I know you're innocent?

329
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,183
You said you knew I didn't shoot her
back at Isabella's place.

330
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:38,353
You didn't shoot her.
Doesn't mean you weren't involved, Tim.

331
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,605
You had her books.
She knew you were stealing.

332
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,965
No, no, no, no, no.
Guys, listen to me, please.

333
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,694
All right, Damon was the one
who was stealing, all right?

334
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:49,155
I was trying to convince Isabella,
but he had her fooled.

335
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,865
I needed to find proof.

336
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:54,030
However the hell Damon did it,
there's no evidence in those books.

337
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:57,855
Every large money transfer
was authorized by Isabella, all right?

338
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,416
She signed them herself.

339
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,002
I kept telling her.
I kept telling her. She just...

340
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,171
- She believed everything he said.
- You think Damon killed her?

341
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,424
- I don't know.
- If he's behind, he had help.

342
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:11,308
- He was at the party the whole time?
- Yeah, he had the perfect alibi.

343
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,025
He told me to go to her house.

344
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:14,314
He...

345
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,474
 said she was gonna fire me.

346
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:20,145
I've been fighting with her.
My car's outside her place.

347
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,196
The cops are matching ballistics
right now, even without your gun.

348
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:26,109
- He's got you pretty good.
- Pretty good? It's perfect!

349
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,235
I'm dead!

350
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,903
- It's over!
- It's not over.

351
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,579
If it was Damon,
someone pulled the trigger for him.

352
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,368
- We turn up the heat.
- Maybe find some evidence.

353
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,349
- We punch holes in their stories.
- You really think we can do that?

354
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,749
While I pay Damon a visit,

355
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,425
you're going to go pay cash

356
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,086
for a motel room,
and sit tight until we come get you.

357
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,567
I'll drop you in Hialeah.

358
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,146
We got snowed, Mike.

359
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,876
- We let Isabella down.
- She never saw it coming.

360
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:56,640
Whoever killed Isabella
sure did their homework.

361
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:03,739
<i>When dealing
with a pathological liar,</i>

362
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,857
<i>don't bother looking for
signs of guilt.</i>

363
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,140
<i>True deceivers enjoy the lie.</i>

364
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:13,027
<i>They know how to look you dead
in the eye and usually shed a few tears.</i>

365
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,659
<i>If you wanna know
when they're lying, look for</i>

366
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,875
<i>the little smile that comes
when deceiving a roomful of people.</i>

367
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,217
That bastard is giving quite
the performance.

368
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,930
He planned this whole thing.

369
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:28,920
Let's see how he does
when we mess with his script.

370
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:33,175
Thank you, officers,
so much for all the work you're doing.

371
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,146
Damon Belmont,
I'm Max, Isabella's Max.

372
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,956
- We need to talk.
- Excuse me?

373
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,403
We can talk in private or in public!

374
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,605
OK, we are on the clock.

375
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:48,452
We need to reroute all Italy shipments
through Paris.

376
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:51,111
Ministerial commission's
doing some search and seizures.

377
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,295
If you're planning on using
La Guardia...

378
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:55,463
Wait a minute, hold on.

379
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,909
First thing's first.
Who the hell are you?

380
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:01,572
She kept you in the dark.
I don't even know where to begin.

381
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,144
This is too big
to discuss this now.

382
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:06,543
Just suffice it to say I'm Max,
her other

383
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,420
business partner from L.A.

384
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:12,096
What the hell are you talking about?

385
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,428
I starch heroin
into Isabella's fabrics.

386
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,955
Production in Asia,
distro through Europe.

387
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,685
We're running about $4 million a week,
so we need to improve our communication

388
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,391
- here!
- <i>When you make an approach as a spy,</i>

389
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:29,251
<i>you need to choose a role that puts you
in the center of the action</i>

390
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,143
<i>and explains
why no one's ever heard of you before.</i>

391
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:35,539
<i>Claiming to be a criminal
can kill two birds with one stone.</i>

392
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:38,517
<i>You throw around some names
and places and dates to confuse them,</i>

393
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:40,629
<i>show them some account books
to make real,</i>

394
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:43,494
<i>and make the dollar figures big enough
to play to their greed.</i>

395
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,207
Did you say $4 million a week?

396
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,839
Now, about the cops
sniffing around outside...

397
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:50,762
If this little murder case

398
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,203
leads to a federal
narcotics investigation,

399
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:54,694
my new business partner

400
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:57,469
gets strangled to death
with his designer tie.

401
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:01,139
The police have this under control.
They already have a suspect.

402
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,557
One of our VPs.

403
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,726
He and Isabella
were fighting all the time.

404
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,228
- Did they arrest him?
- He's missing,

405
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:08,756
but they will find him.

406
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:10,940
They better.

407
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:14,584
Or they're gonna have another body
to investigate.

408
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,716
I shook the tree.
Let's see what falls out.

409
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:26,994
All right. I'll let you know
if Damon heads somewhere fun.

410
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,630
You want to look at
old pictures of Michael?

411
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:35,386
I realized just the other day

412
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:38,194
that I hadn't seen that many pictures
of Michael's past.

413
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,635
- Isn't that wild?
- It's wild.

414
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:43,835
So, have you kept any?

415
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:45,045
Sure.

416
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:48,528
Collecting dust in the garage.
Where's Michael?

417
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,005
You know, he's...

418
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,730
He's helping a friend.

419
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:58,055
But he was hoping
that we could borrow an album or two.

420
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:01,430
So, that's all there is to this?
You have so much time on your hands

421
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,653
that you want to just sit
and look at photos?

422
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,037
Sometimes, you got to take a break.

423
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:07,465
You hang on.

424
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:09,615
I'll go get them.

425
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:25,260
They've been in the back for a bit.

426
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:27,592
Couple of photos,
we get ears in that conversation.

427
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:29,585
And the cops will have
some new suspects.

428
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,820
Cover the front.

429
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,195
Like a blanket.

430
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:40,989
<i>Contact microphones pick up
sound vibrations through walls,</i>

431
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:44,158

432
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:49,175
<i>Pair one
with a wireless transmitter,</i>

433
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,506

434
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:53,660
<i>in the same room as your target.</i>

435
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,350
<i>We have got a serious problem.</i>

436
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:57,024
<i>Damon, calm down.</i>

437
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:59,209
<i>What happened to your plan?</i>

438
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,282
<i>We weren't supposed
to see each other for months.</i>

439
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,204
<i>We weren't supposed
to call each other.</i>

440
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,472
<i>That's because things have changed.
There's this new guy.</i>

441
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,391
<i>Damon, enough.
Stop freaking out.</i>

442
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:10,532
<i>Everything's going to be fine.</i>

443
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:11,995
<i>I promise.</i>

444
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,515
<i>No one's gonna find
anything anywhere.</i>

445
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:19,135
Christ.

446
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,905
- <i>What was that?</i>
- <i>Interference on the speakers.</i>

447
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,125
<i>Is your phone on?</i>

448
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,780
<i>No, I didn't bring my phone.
I think someone's here.</i>

449
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:27,962
<i>Of course,
bugging a room from the outside</i>

450
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,700
<i>makes it impossible
to see potential pitfalls.</i>

451
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:34,261
<i>Just as a cellphone reacts
when it's too close to your alarm clock,</i>

452
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,710
<i>a room full of speakers can create
radio-frequency interference</i>

453
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:40,090
<i>if you're spying on someone

454
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,841
- <i>You think someone's here?</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

455
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:45,929
Better get out of there, Mikey.
He's coming out the back.

456
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,405
{\RIC
DAMON'S PARTNER}

457
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:11,579
<i>What happened to your plan?</i>

458
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,934
<i>We weren't supposed
to see each other for months.</i>

459
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:16,563
<i>We weren't even supposed
to call each other.</i>

460
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,405
How's Tim?

461
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:22,540
Well, he's keeping his head down,
but he's a bit of a wreck, you know?

462
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:26,010
He's a boy scout, so he doesn't have
experience with this type of thing.

463
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:29,430
- We miss anything?
- No, just two guys having an argument.

464
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,598
Wonderful.

465
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:32,750
So, checked in
with my buddy at the station.

466
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,144
Cops are running
a full-fledged manhunt for Tim.

467
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,700
So, besides his car
at the crime scene,

468
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:40,975
they just found
half a box of bullets in his garage.

469
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,404
Predictably, perfect match
for the rounds that killed Isabella.

470
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,222
Damon and his partner
have been busy boys.

471
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,875
Speaking of partner,
here's the guy, Ric Pederson.

472
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,288
He's a club deejay.
He runs the shop during the day.

473
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:57,670
Nabbed a couple of times
for dealing ecstasy,

474
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:59,335
had an assault a while back.

475
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,390
Let me guess. No paper trail connecting
him to Damon or the fashion house?

476
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:03,631
Nothing I can find.

477
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,882
Today was probably
the last time they meet.

478
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:07,662
This is two guys
covering up a killing,

479
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:10,237
so they're not exactly itching
to break the law again.

480
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:13,495
Well, that is exactly
what we need them to do.

481
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>Law-enforcement cover IDs
are tRicy.</i>

482
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:22,939
<i>Pose as a lead detective,
and you'll have unlimited access,</i>

483
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:25,275
<i>but a single call to the station,
and you're caught.</i>

484
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,775
<i>You need to think smaller.</i>

485
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,775
<i>Nobody questions the credentials</i>

486
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,200
<i>of a lowly crime-scene investigator.</i>

487
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:33,640
Excuse me.

488
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:36,405
You guys are still here?
Detective Parks said you guys were done.

489
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,870
Yeah, we were, but, you know,
that's how it goes.

490
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:42,003
You get some detective with a theory,
and the whole department does a 180.

491
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,257
- What are you working on?
- Picking up some samples.

492
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,040
Look, I can't really get into it.

493
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:47,165
Wait.

494
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:48,176
Please.

495
00:23:48,935 --> 00:23:50,636
Isabella was a dear friend of mine.

496
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,711
Well, look, it's not like
I get the big picture.

497
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm just a lab tech, but...

498
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:57,435
sounds like they're talking about
two guys working together.

499
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,860
- What?
- You didn't hear it from me.

500
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:02,956
I'll probably be back tomorrow
with a whole new assignment.

501
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:05,085
Looks like murder...

502
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,125
is in style this season.

503
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,886
- Who is this?
- It's your business partner, Max.

504
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,580
You said the investigation
was almost over.

505
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,497
You lied to me!

506
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,683
I did not. It was.

507
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:20,708
It is.

508
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,795
Then explain why the cops
are crawling around the fashion house.

509
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,619
<i>Do I have to burn that place down?</i>

510
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,800
It is not my fault
that the cops are idiots, okay?

511
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,385
This is an easy case.
They have Tim's car.

512
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,108
<i>Everybody here knows he did it.</i>

513
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,840
Well, I might be able
to find out some more.

514
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm down in the parking lot.
Get out here now.

515
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:41,646
- Merry Christmas.
- My god. What are you doing?

516
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,314
I'm being proactive.

517
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,390
The cops questioned
Tim's neighbors, too.

518
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:47,527
Turns out
Tim has a little girlfriend.

519
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,329
She lives down in Homestead,

520
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,073
and she's going to tell me
everything we need to know.

521
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,658
Where is Tim hiding?

522
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,201
I haven't seen him in days.

523
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:59,122
I swear. We weren't even dating.
He was just helping me with my book.

524
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,580
- I told this to the police.
- Honey, I am not the police.

525
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:03,793
And you sure as hell
don't want me to get upset.

526
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:04,836
Where's Tim?

527
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,550
He made a deal

528
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,506
with some guy at the docks.

529
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,535
They're gonna smuggle Tim
to the Bahamas.

530
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,260
- Where's the dock?
- On 64th Street.

531
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:15,972
They're leaving at noon tomorrow.

532
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:19,851
He said something about calling the cops
on some designer who killed Isabella.

533
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:23,396
Don't shut me in, please! No!

534
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:27,585
- You killed her and didn't tell me.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

535
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:29,926
There is no evidence
that leads back to us.

536
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:32,851
I don't care what Tim says.
I used a partner.

537
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:34,866
There is no connection to me at all.

538
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:37,414
- It was the perfect crime.
- Perfect crime?

539
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,295
Except for one little thing...
Tim got away!

540
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,130
Don't worry. You're gonna just
black out in about 15 seconds.

541
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:47,170
Wait a minute.
We can get rid of Tim.

542
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,796
We can kill him tomorrow.

543
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:51,340
Now that you've found him,
we can end this.

544
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:55,850
We can make it look like he got killed
trying to escape the country.

545
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:58,181
The cops will close the case.
This whole thing goes away.

546
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:00,629
- You can pull that off?
- Yes.

547
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:04,390
All right, listen up.
I'm heading to the Everglades.

548
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:06,386
I'm gonna feed the scream queen
to the gators.

549
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,640
You're gonna follow Tim to his boat.

550
00:26:08,765 --> 00:26:11,903
- You put two in the back of his head.
- Okay, two in the back of his head.

551
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,363
You idiots will be tempted
to touch everything.

552
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:15,785
Don't!

553
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:18,000
Just steal all Tim's money
and leave.

554
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,945
It'll look like he met his ride
out of town,

555
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,163
- and they robbed him and shot him.
- Done.

556
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,373
You do this right,

557
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,417
and the cops
will stop investigating,

558
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,785
and my stylish new
business partner, Damon...

559
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,090
Gets to live.

560
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:34,884
You won't regret this.

561
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,857
So devious.

562
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:54,946
He infiltrates American defenses
and then slips away.

563
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:57,187
Did you track down
the flight information?

564
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,434
Please tell CIA...

565
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:04,930
File is locked
in steel safe at office

566
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:06,707
with guard night and day.

567
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,404
Whatever is on this flight
is a big secret.

568
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,713
It's very, very dangerous, so,

569
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,883
it is impossible for Russian to get.

570
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,513
I wasn't supposed to tell you this.

571
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:24,275
One of your co-workers
is working for the Russians.

572
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:26,455
There's a mole in your office.

573
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:28,315
What?

574
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,941
You must tell me.
I will find this traitor.

575
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,902
Not yet.

576
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,738
It'll compromise our operation,
and we're running out of time.

577
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:40,533
If this mole makes his move,
if we find out what's in that safe...

578
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,835
This will not happen.

579
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:45,300
I will find file immediately.

580
00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:47,974
<i>It's tough to get someone
to compromise their values</i>

581
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,545
<i>in only a couple of meetings.</i>

582
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,954
<i>The only way to do that is to compromise
a few values of your own.</i>

583
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:00,270
- How are you holding up?
- I was doing okay,

584
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:03,389
considering I've been sitting
in a motel room for three days,

585
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,057
but let me get this straight.

586
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:08,235
We're having
Damon and his partner...

587
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,600
- try to kill me.
- They won't actually succeed.

588
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:13,524
We just need them to get caught
by the cops looking guilty.

589
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,990
So we rented you a boat.

590
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:16,826
You walk in
through the parking lot here.

591
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:19,354
Mike and I are gonna be
covering you from the roof here.

592
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:20,906
When you get to the docks, hide.

593
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,992
The cops come in,
get Damon and Ric.

594
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:25,202
There are a lot of things
grieving co-workers do,

595
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,664
but hunting with guns for someone
on docks, not one of them.

596
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,416
Won't the cops arrest me, too?

597
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,957
And then you'll have the opening
to tell them the truth.

598
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:35,882
That plus your gun
dropped into Damon's trunk

599
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,507
is all you need
to blow their story apart.

600
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:40,509
Relax.

601
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,761
It's almost over.

602
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:02,948
There's Tim, Fi.
You got him?

603
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:07,703
<i>They're our guys.</i>

604
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:19,340
Time to call the cavalry.

605
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:22,676
Yes, hello, police.

606
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,097
I'm down on 64th, and I just saw
two guys taking guns out of their trunk.

607
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,808
I think they're headed
toward the docks.

608
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:31,127
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

609
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:37,191
They're not exactly heading
toward the docks.

610
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,276
And they're not pulling out guns.

611
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,988
- <i>Fi, what are they waiting for?</i>
- I don't know.

612
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:44,155
Something's wrong.

613
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:52,164
- That bench wasn't there this morning.
- They moved a bench?

614
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,128
Sam, we got a problem.

615
00:29:58,647 --> 00:29:59,547
<i>Guys,</i>

616
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,040
<i>they've got a detonator.</i>

617
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,758
They're not planning
on shooting Tim.

618
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,500
If we don't do something quick,
Tim is gonna be part of a big boom.

619
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:08,120
I'd say take it out,
but more than one shot gives us away.

620
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:09,348
Then I can't miss.

621
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,475
Mikey, do it.
He's getting close.

622
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:41,775
He's still alive.

623
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:45,968
- Fi, pick him up.
- I'm on it.

624
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,807
Get over here!
Let's go!

625
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,622
Fi, get out of there.
They're closing in.

626
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,203
Freeze!
Put your hands behind your head now!

627
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:19,972
- I tried to grab him.
- I know. We saw, Fi.

628
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:22,035
The guy panicked.
There was nothing you could do.

629
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,977
So, how far are we gonna take this?
Are we busting Tim out of prison?

630
00:31:25,906 --> 00:31:27,927
Are we letting them get away
with killing Isabella?

631
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:31,305
Damon and Rick
just screwed up the plan.

632
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:32,570
We can use that.

633
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:35,768
If that's screwing up the plan, how come
they got everything they wanted?

634
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,630
From where I'm standing, they won.

635
00:31:37,755 --> 00:31:39,730
They haven't won
until they know that they've won.

636
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,530
- Any chance they saw Tim get arrested?
- No, he went around the corner.

637
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:46,100
Sam, what's the time frame
on the cops announcing the bust?

638
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:48,656
Well, they're taking him in now,
processing him.

639
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,628
- I don't know, a couple hours, max.
- Then we have a couple of hours.

640
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:54,790
We drive Damon away from Rick,
get them to turn on each other.

641
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:57,015
We give the cops another killer.

642
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:01,085
Max? No, we shouldn't be talking.

643
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,254
What the hell happened down there?

644
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,359
Everything is handled.
Don't worry.

645
00:32:05,484 --> 00:32:08,551
Listen, I'm gonna lay low for a while,
so don't call.

646
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,833
Everything is handled?
Everything is not handled.

647
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:14,020
- What the hell was that? We talked...
- Everything's fine.

648
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:16,809
The cops showed up.
There's no way he escaped.

649
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,103
No, he did escape,
for the second time!

650
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,188
No. That's not possible.

651
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,289
You know, I'm starting to think
that he is the only one around here

652
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:26,151
who knows what the hell he's doing!

653
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:29,113
You meet me at your office immediately,
or you're a dead man.

654
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,122
Wait.

655
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:41,670
- What are you still doing here?
- I can't talk to you. Police business.

656
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,615
It's okay.
We talked the other day, remember?

657
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,300
Look, I told you, buddy,
my higher-ups never tell me much.

658
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:47,631
There they are now.

659
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:54,896
- Yeah, this is Finley.
- <i>Does Damon know Tim got caught?</i>

660
00:32:55,245 --> 00:32:57,940
I don't think so,
but I'm following up on your leads.

661
00:32:58,065 --> 00:33:00,640
Looks like that tip you got
was a good one.

662
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:02,223
<i>He's listening in, isn't he?</i>

663
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:03,715
Yes, sir.

664
00:33:03,935 --> 00:33:05,587
I'll be right back down there.

665
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:11,395
- Were you listening to my call?
- I'm sorry.

666
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,460
I just really want them to find
whoever killed Isabella.

667
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:18,884
- She was a dear friend of mine.
- Shouldn't be too long to wrap this up.

668
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,015
It looks like our killer's plan

669
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:25,419
is coming apart at the seams.

670
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,041
No one comes in here.

671
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,549
I said two in the back
of the head, Damon.

672
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,924
I tried to follow the plan
just like we talked about,

673
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,959
but Rick said using a bomb
was safer.

674
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,886
You feel safe now?
Tim's probably talking to the Feds!

675
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:42,811
I know.

676
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:46,285
I just found out he called the cops.

677
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:48,484
What's our next move?

678
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:52,052
Besides you and I and Rick,
who else knows all about this?

679
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,114
No one else. Trust me.

680
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:57,201
That's good, real good.

681
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,497
We just have one little thing
to close the loop.

682
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,792
Do not kill me!
Look, I know we messed up.

683
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:07,044
That was unfortunate.
I have an idea.

684
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,046
- Of course.
- We put this on someone else.

685
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,215
- You tried that.
- Another someone else.

686
00:34:12,235 --> 00:34:13,285
My partner.

687
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,203
He's the one who killed her.


688
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:18,138
No, Rick will talk.
He'll blame you.

689
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,615
He'll take you down, too.

690
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,309
That gets messy, and I don't want
anything getting back on me.

691
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,312
- We could kill him.
- The cops will investigate his murder.

692
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:27,850
We'll make it look like
he killed himself.

693
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:29,675
Now, that's interesting.

694
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,030
How would you do that?

695
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,550
I'll write a suicide note
confessing to everything.

696
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:37,533
I'll even scatter some of
Isabella's files around his office.

697
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,410
- You can shoot him.
- Nope.

698
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,321
I'll get you a gun.

699
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:52,923
<i>One of the many weapons
in the spy arsenal is sabotage.</i>

700
00:34:53,146 --> 00:34:55,660
<i>Your enemy can't fight back
when their vehicles won't drive</i>

701
00:34:55,785 --> 00:34:57,511
<i>and their weapons won't fire.</i>

702
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:01,849
<i>If you're handing a bad guy a gun
and you need it to jam accidentally,</i>

703
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:05,025
<i>fatiguing the trigger assembly
to break under pressure</i>

704
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,729
<i>is probably your best move.</i>

705
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,272
<i>It's undetectable,</i>

706
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,340
<i>so nobody gets suspicious
and nobody gets hurt.</i>

707
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,805
Here you go.

708
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,075
It was stolen.

709
00:35:28,405 --> 00:35:30,555
Serial number has been filed off.

710
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,672
- Which means it's untraceable?
- Completely untraceable.

711
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,888
Keep the car running.

712
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,897
- How we looking, Sam?
- Cops are on their way, Mikey.

713
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,907
What are you doing here?

714
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,450
Do you remember in the club when
you said everything would go perfectly?

715
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:06,075
You said everything
would go perfectly.

716
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:07,855
Calm down.

717
00:36:08,915 --> 00:36:10,501
Everything is fine.

718
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,336
Everything is not okay!

719
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,962
Tim keeps getting away.

720
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,870
- Did you want me to get caught?
- What are you talking about?

721
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:18,845
Nobody is gonna get caught.

722
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:20,955
I can't go down for this.

723
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:22,703
There's no other choice now.

724
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,806
You son of a bitch!

725
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,365
I hope he's okay.

726
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,036
That's gonna bruise.

727
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,025
Police! Stop!

728
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,714
He shot my friend!

729
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,131
Arrest him! He's the killer!

730
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:05,189
Well, it took
a couple of days of explaing,

731
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:07,523
and my lawyer's trying
to get his head around the details,

732
00:37:07,648 --> 00:37:10,018
but once Damon confessed,
the truth was out.

733
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:11,940
That's all you needed.

734
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:15,100
We're selling the fashion house
to a label in Milan.

735
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:18,825
Isabella hosted benefits
for a local pet-rescue center, so...

736
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:21,660
- We're donating the proceeds to them.
- Sounds good.

737
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:24,120
- Take good care of Colonel Peabody.
- Yeah, I will.

738
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:26,195
Hey, thank you for your help.

739
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:29,885
- Yeah, Fi?
- <i>Hi, Michael.</i>

740
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:33,278
- Any progress with Conrad?
- <i>I just got a message from him.</i>

741
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:35,420
<i>He's bringing me
the flight information today.</i>

742
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,579
- <i>And your mother's been calling.</i>
- I'll head over there now.

743
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:46,835
Fiona returned the albums.

744
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:51,060
But some of the pictures are missing
from when you joined the military.

745
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,250
I think someone
must have stolen them.

746
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:54,575
So mysterious.

747
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:56,781
We'll bring them back, mom.

748
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:01,945
I thought we agreed that from now on,
you'd tell me the truth.

749
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,675
This was a small job.

750
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:07,985
Fiona had to put together a dossier
to prove that I was a...

751
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:10,565
A Russian spy.

752
00:38:10,885 --> 00:38:12,164
Just a small job.

753
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,999
It's kind of a long story...

754
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:17,155
Which I'll tell.

755
00:38:18,315 --> 00:38:19,755
It wasn't anything dangerous.

756
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,915
Look, the last time you and I
went through this, it was hard.

757
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,802
I just don't like
seeing you get hurt.

758
00:38:26,945 --> 00:38:29,340
So, what, you kept me in the dark
to protect me?

759
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:32,225
You know how it goes.
These things aren't so predictable.

760
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:37,965
Well, she left one behind...

761
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:39,942
because it was special to you?

762
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:46,031
No, it's probably 'cause
there's writing on the back.

763
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,145
It was special to me.

764
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:52,704
It's one of the few times you sent me
anything to tell me where you were.

765
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:56,315
Well, actually,
I had already left the country.

766
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,418
I wrote that so that
you didn't know where I was.

767
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:05,085
Well, then, in the...

768
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:07,625
grand scheme of things,

769
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,097
I suppose
we're making some progress.

770
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,186
- You want some iced tea?
- That'd be great.

771
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,723
This information
Russian spy is after

772
00:39:38,705 --> 00:39:40,836
is much worse than I thought.

773
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,587
You found out what's on that flight.

774
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,964
Not what, it's who.

775
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,133
Who's on the flight?

776
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,610
There's no names,

777
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:50,034
but he is maximum-security prisoner.

778
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,056
This document is instruction
on how to deal with him.

779
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,684
I'd translate it for you, but...

780
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:59,521
If Russian pig gets his hands
on this envelope...

781
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,689
He'll never get it, my friend.

782
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,780
Thank you.

783
00:40:25,855 --> 00:40:27,055
We were right.

784
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:28,685
It's bad.

785
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:36,134
It's a rendition
to a black site in Poland.

786
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:38,977
Somebody's high-risk enough
to be flown alone.

787
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:44,309
"Do not engage in conversation
with prisoner under any circumstance."

788
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:45,650
Sounds like a sweetheart.

789
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,945
This kind of treatment is reserved
for world-class bad guys, Michael.

790
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,617
I know,

791
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,492
and somebody wants my help
to break him out.
