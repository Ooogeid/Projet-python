1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:03,896
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:07,177
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:12,265
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,812
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,269
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:19,314
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,609
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:25,570
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,448
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

10
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,826
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,035
Family, too...

12
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,245
Is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,329
If you're desperate.

14
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,455
Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,458
Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,045
you're not going anywhere.

17
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:47,533
<i>There aren't many rules
in the spy trade.</i>

18
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:51,842
<i>There are a few agreements that most
intelligence agencies honor, though.</i>

19
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:54,557
<i>Low-level agents get traded,
not prosecuted.</i>

20
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:58,053
<i>You don't shoot foreign operatives
if you can avoid it.</i>

21
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,855
<i>And you stay away
from embassies and consulates.</i>

22
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:06,609
Mike, look, you know I'm up
for just about anything,

23
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,629
but this, this is like
cursing in church.

24
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:10,699
I mean, technically,
this is foreign soil.

25
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,840
No, technically, it's just trespassing
the one perk of being burned.

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,028
My crimes are just crimes,
not acts of war.

27
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:18,232
But does it have to be
the Pakistani consulate?

28
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:21,822
Couldn't it be... I don't know, Jamaica?
Those guys are probably very easy going.

29
00:01:21,942 --> 00:01:24,259
And they're not gonna know
anything about Carla.

30
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:26,295
Look, she's just an employee, Mikey.

31
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:29,342
Some agent they sent to boss you around.
It's not like she burned you personally.

32
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:31,026
You don't know that. She's all I got.

33
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:34,681
Look, if she worked in Kurdistan,
the Pakistanis might have a file on her.

34
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,255
I don't know. I mean, the...

35
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,644
the prints she left on Veronica's camera
did not come up in any government system,

36
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:41,665
and my buddies checked around,
like you wanted.

37
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:44,331
- They didn't come up with anything.
- That's why I'm making a new friend.

38
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:47,523
Look, I got to believe that the best
intelligence outfit in the region

39
00:01:47,643 --> 00:01:50,743
took a few notes when she took off
her burka and started wreaking havoc.

40
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:52,655
Look, if you don't want to help,
I can ask Fiona.

41
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:55,613
No. No. It's fine. Fine.
You guys need your space.

42
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,365
Now that she's not your girlfriend
anymore, I guess it's probably weird

43
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,192
- She was never my girlfriend, Sam.
- Okay, Mike.

44
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:03,984
<i>Consulates are a great place
to renew your visa,</i>

45
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,712
<i>pay your taxes back home,</i>

46
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:08,923
<i>or find foreign spies
working under diplomatic cover.</i>

47
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:11,176
Hey. Back of the line right here, pal.

48
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:16,255
Rich Franklin, Miami Herald.
They call to say I was coming?

49
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,044
Of course they didn't.
I need a couple of visas.

50
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,099
I'm doing a piece on foreign trade.

51
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,941
I need visas for my editor.
I need one for me.

52
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:24,160
I need it pronto. I'm sorry.
I need it right now.

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,192
<i>Like all bureaucrats,
consulate employees</i>

54
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:29,652
live in fear of a pissed-off journalist.

55
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,526
What a crock.

56
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,073
Sir, can I just...

57
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:37,285
I just would like to get
in front of you, just for like...

58
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:41,372
Do I need to speak Pakistani?
Can you not understand what I'm saying?

59
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,441
- Sir, you are from The Herald?
- Miami Herald.

60
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:46,346
Oh, I am so sorry for the mix-up.
Please, come with me to my office.

61
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,895
This guy takes cuts.

62
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:50,863
This is how it works around here.
You got to know somebody around here?

63
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,718
You must be getting
a lot of that lately.

64
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,212
I'm talking about textiles.

65
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:55,756
I'm sure it's nothing.

66
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,626
I hear it's getting harder and harder
to do business in Pakistan.

67
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:04,117
I'm opening a factory
in Lahore in seven days.

68
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:05,678
If I don't get these sign-offs today,

69
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:08,848
ain't gonna be nothing
on those looms, sugar lips.

70
00:03:09,728 --> 00:03:11,171
Just take a seat.

71

<i>Most of the people

This is baloney.

77
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,199
- Come on. Like, today would be...
- Excuse me, sir.

78
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,142
Sir, you need to lower your volume.

79
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:45,685
- This is my regular speaking voice.
- This is not your regular speaking voice.

80
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:48,857
- This is my regular speaking volume.
- Don't patronize me.

81
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,859
Okay, let's start over.
Hello. How are you?

82
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,273
You are shouting!
This is not proper for this kind of place.

83
00:03:58,393 --> 00:03:59,993
But you're shouting back.
You're causing the same problem.

84
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:03,032
I'm a loud american.
Please take a look at that.

85
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:04,803
Sign that, and this guy's out of here.

86
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,587
Don't tell me what to do.
Who are you?

87
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:10,545
<i>One job of a security chief

92
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:33,827
I would like to invite you
to lower your voice.

93
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:35,672
Okay. How's that? Is that better?

94
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,029

113
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,213
I'm down to the felt.

114
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:39,550
Full-boat Phyllis here didn't tell me
she used to deal hold'em...

115
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:40,843
in Reno.

116
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:46,557
- Your girlfriend's getting creamed.
- She's not my girlfriend.

117
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:48,476
Okay, honey, whatever you say.

118
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,354
- Yeah. Thing is...
- What?

119
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:55,923
Yeah. we're not... well,
we're still working together,

120
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:58,047
but the other part, that's...

121
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,488
well, we've closed the door on that.

122
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:06,119
- Why do you always do this?

123
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,413
I didn't do it this time. She did.

124
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,624
- Right.
- Let's play poker!

125
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:13,318
I mean, exactly.

126
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:16,700
Now, how does a boy ever find
a loan shark in the first place?

127
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,840
- The yellow pages?
- Sure. That works.

128
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:21,217
Andy's in deep trouble with that man.

129
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,716
if he doesn't come up with the money,
they're going to hurt him again.

130
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,196
That's just awful.

131
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,266
Diane's been through so much.

132
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:31,436
You know, Michael sometimes helps
people with problems like this.

133
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,938
- We both do.
- Really?

134
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:41,443
- Fi, what was that?
- What was what?

135
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:44,322
"Michael helps people with problems
like this sometimes"?

136
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:45,346
Well, you do.

137
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,016
The guy borrowed money
from a loan shark.

138
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:50,639
Yeah, a dumb thing to do,
but he made the deal,

139
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,999
he owes the money, and we have
no business getting involved with that.

140
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:56,232
He borrowed the money to invest
in his mom's retirement.

141
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:58,766
Stupid, yes, and sweet.

142
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,507
- And now she's gonna lose the house.
- What is this about, Fi?

143
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:04,320
You really care that much
about some lady you never met

144
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,153
living out in Boca Raton...

145
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:07,855
with a bunch of cats?

146
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:10,141
- You owe me.
- I gave you the car.

147
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:12,051
You owe me more than that.

148
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:16,064
I want to do this
because this guy, Andy,

149
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,772
chose to put somebody he loved...

150
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:20,276
before himself.

151
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:22,948
That's why.

152
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:27,879
Let's go.

153
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,715
Hello.

154
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,127
Phyllis said you were handsome.

155
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,470
And single, too.
Can you believe it?

156
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,617
Yeah, let's talk about your problem.

157
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,950
I hear your son's having trouble
with a loan shark.

158
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,907
Andy's a good boy, a kind boy.
It's just he's...

159
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:52,433
a lot like his father was.
He just doesn't always... think.

160
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,935
How much did he borrow?

161
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:58,523
$200,000, and the man said that
if he doesn't return the money...

162
00:07:58,999 --> 00:07:59,774
Well...

163
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:02,355
He can't return it.
He doesn't have it.

164
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,237
Uh, he a gambler?

165
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,615
No. God, no.
He's a cellphone salesman.

166
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,033
He invested it.

167
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:11,698
It was... It was sweet, really.

168
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:15,623
I mean, the cancer didn't get me,
but the medical bills might.

169
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:17,719
So he was just trying to...

170
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,489
to make money
so he could take care of me.

171
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:23,695
What's going on here ?

172
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:27,218
Look, i have $200 left in savings.
Please, you can have it.

173
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:29,468
You can have all of it.
Just, please, make sure

174
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:31,389
he doesn't hurt my boy anymore.

175
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,974
No! Absolutely not!

176
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:35,325
We talked about this.
This is my problem.

177
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,915
Well, it's not just
your problem now, is it?

178
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,879
- Who are you?
- We're people who can help.

179
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,065
Oh, my...

180
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:45,337
<i>ANDY AND DIANE
THE CLIENTS</i>

181
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:49,756
I don't think
there's anything we can do.

182
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,534
He says I got to pay him, but I can't.

183
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,348
Loan sharks are businessmen.

184
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:55,548
We'll strike a deal with him,
set up a payment plan.

185
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,815
How much money can you
still get your hands on?

186
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:59,185
Uh, none of it.

187
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:02,003
I put it in this club, and it's gone.

188
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,152
- All of it?

189
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,623
It was a high-risk,
high-reward...

190
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:06,903
type deal.

191
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,594
A little... illegal.

192
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,973
That's why the money all had to be cash.

193
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:18,440
- Let's start from the beginning.
- Okay, but can we...

194
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,134
- talk about it outside?
- Yes.

195
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,219
A few months ago,
I started going to Velvet,

196
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,025
this club on South Beach,
and I got to know the owner, Zeke.

197
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:26,876
Zeke.

198
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,331
He's a really good guy.

199
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:29,922
He cut me in on the club...

200
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,020
partnership.

201
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,712
I put up five grand.

202
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,156
Dude, I'm telling you,

203
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:36,996
I saw dividends right away.

204
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:40,288
Zeke would pull these fat wads of cash
out of the safe right in the back.

205
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:41,686
I mean like...

206
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,212
Fat wads. Got it.

207
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,685
So anyway, one day, Zeke comes to me,

208
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:49,848
says he can get me in
on this new place he's gonna open...

209
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:50,910
200k...

210
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:52,937
Full partnership.

211
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,264
Thing is, the club is...

212
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:56,766
in Cuba...

213
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,646
hence the cash-only thing.

214
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,021
Shady, I know, but Zeke says
we're looking at like

215
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:04,148
1,000% return on investment.

216
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,776
- So you went in.
- Yeah.

217
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,986
I had to get the cash together.

218
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,438
My mom's got bills.

219
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,740
Anyway, so I go one day to deliver

220
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,328
the cash to Zeke's house,
and I'm telling you,

221
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,703
the minute I put the cash on the table,

222
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,278
the F.B.I. swarms the place.

223
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:22,554
Can i tell the rest of the story
just to save time?

224
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:26,153
The feds rush in, arrest Zeke,
but not before rushing you out the back.

225
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,867
Zeke's under indictment,
but he's promising not to turn you in.

226
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:31,467
- The feds take the cash, but...
- at least you got your freedom.

227
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:35,513
- How did you...
- Andy, you were conned.

228
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:38,015
- But the feds...
- They weren't feds. They were actors.

229
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,935
It's a classic kiss-off.
Zeke's a con man.

230
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:46,107
I'm such an idiot.

231
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,362
Look at the bright side.
You might get to keep your kneecaps.

232
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,657
Do you think...

233
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:53,531
You think Zeke will give me the money back
when he finds out I'm onto him?

234
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:56,075
No. But there are other ways
we can get your money back.

235
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:15,299
Look at her.

236
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:17,763
And her.

237
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:19,223
I bet she'd be fun.

238
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,521
Are you shopping for me or for you?

239
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:24,118
You are gonna have to get back
out there sooner or later.

240
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:26,188
No, what I have to do is get back there.

241
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,233
Andy said Zeke's office
is just past the V.I.P. room.

242
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,190
good bet he keeps the cash there.

243
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,147
Probably launders the money
through the club.

244
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:34,697
Fi, the cash.

245
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:35,699
The safe.

246
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:40,494
I don't understand why you refuse
to mix business with pleasure.

247
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,064
Can we focus?

248
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:45,137
Our ticket to the back room
just showed up.

249
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,417
You're no fun, Michael.

250
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:50,174
now, Zeke, on the other hand, looks
like he knows how to have a good time.

251
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,283

Breaking into the safe

257

Getting invited into the back...

258
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:11,776
shouldn't be too difficult, either.

259
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:15,613
Why don't you go and meet your Pakistani
spy and I'll take care of this?

260
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,907

261
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,451
Just... Just don't work too hard!

"I will be wearing a white shirt and..."

263
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,423
What's this word right here?

264
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,808
It's a kind of a spicy goat cheese.

265
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:46,560
I was trying to say "black pants".
My urdu is a little rusty.

266
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:50,077
At least you got the name
of the restaurant right.

267
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:52,566
I'm Waseem Ali Khan, and you are...

268
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:54,736
Just a friend who needs a favor.

269
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,607
Well, I need a favor too.

270
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,200
I would like those ocuments returned.
So what can i do for you?

271
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,950
So direct. It's refreshing.

272
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,305
I'm looking for a spy.

273
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:07,086
A woman who worked in Kurdistan
about 15 years ago.

274
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:09,248
I don't have her real name,
but she was very distinctive.

275
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,996
Very attractive. Very forceful.

276
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:15,297
I'm sure she made a big splash.
Your intel might have some info on it?

277
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:18,351
What you want is worth more
than what you have.

278
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:20,177
Sorry. Wish i could help.

279
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:23,164
Come on, Waseem. Pick up the phone.
Call back home.

280
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:25,850
To land a gig like this in Miami,
you got to be pretty well connected.

281
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,636
I am, and I'd like to stay that way.

282
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:31,974
So go ahead. Leak those documents.

283
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,732
I'd rather take my chances than ask

284
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:36,842
for an eyes-only dossier
on a foreign operative.

285
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:38,077
Now, uh...

286
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:41,279
How are the peach mojitos here, hmm?

00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:06,849
- Where's your loo?
- Out the front and around the bar.

293
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:10,685
You want me to go out there
looking like this?

294
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:14,064
No, no, of course not.
Use mine.

298
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,713
Zeke is one careful con man.

299
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:41,800
He's security-conscious.
He's smart. He's smooth, too,

300
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,511
in a cheesy, Sam kind of way.

301
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:45,262
Hey, smooth is smooth, baby.

302
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,056
Club is locked down tight.

303
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,570
We want to get to the safe,
we need Zeke's key card,

304
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,809
and he keeps it on him all the time.

305
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,520
Can't you lift it, sticky fingers?

306
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,288
Yes I can, but I already made my play.

307
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,775
He'll get suspicious if I duck
and come back again.

308
00:14:58,094 --> 00:14:59,935
So it's looks like a two-man job now.

309
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:03,697
Yeah, the trouble is, Zeke only lets
girls and marks past security.

310
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:06,075
Yeah, so one of us has to play the fool.

311
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:07,743
I know who I'd vote for.

312
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,082

00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:20,589

00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:39,984
How about if i handle the lookout

319
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:42,994

whatever is going on inside?

320
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,431
- That seems fair.
- Yeah.

321
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:47,608
He's, um, he's an old guy.

322
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:50,369
Little frail, but
he's probably armed though.

323
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:54,104

We don't have anything.

00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,947
We don't have to do this.
I mean, guys, come on.

336
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:37,207
- impressive.
- We don't want any trouble.

337
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,586
Okay, but now it's on you, too.

338
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,816
Two days. If I have my money,
there'll be no more trouble.

339
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:46,086
If i don't,...

340
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:48,344
you'll need a lot more than a magazine.

341
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,002
Two days?

342
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:04,860
How can we get that kind of money
in two days?

343
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,474
We're gonna hit the club tonight.

344
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:07,812
You know how to crack safes?

345
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:10,699
Some, but I can't crack just any safe.
I need some details.

346
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:14,185
Andy, do you think you would recognize
Zeke's safe if you saw it again?

347
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:17,506
I think so, but how are you
going to get to the safe?

348
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:20,539
Zeke's got these two huge
guys guarding the V.I.P.

349
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:22,098
He only takes women back there.

350
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:24,088
Andy, you got back there.

351
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,215
Oh, sure, but I was an investor.

352
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,635
Andy, you're looking at Zeke's new mark.

353
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:42,733
What's up, Waseem?!

354
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,038
How unexpected.

355
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:46,276
Trina, meet my friend, uh...

356
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:48,654
Mr. inconsiderate.
I should've brought a fruit salad.

357
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,698
So, Waseem.

358
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,450
Have you given any more thought
to what we talked about?

359
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,869
I'm sorry, but no.

360
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:58,455
So you really don't want
your documents back?

361
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,413
I wouldn't say that.
I'd say the price is too high.

362
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:02,945
Really? Too high.

363
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,351
I could get six figures
from any number of buyers,

364
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:07,352
and they'd all have a bone
to pick with Pakistan.

365
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:08,726
You're sure you're not interested?

366
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,550
What's bad for Pakistan...

367
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,520
and what's bad for Waseem...

368
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,521
they aren't necessarily the same thing.

369
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:20,018
I know what you mean.
You're a tough one, Waseem. You win.

370
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:22,028
Take your documents back.

371
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,988
Honey, he's a keeper.
I wouldn't let go of him.

372
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:40,058
All this stuff belongs to Fiona?
Is she a locksmith?

373
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:42,666
No. Just a hobby of hers.

374
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,040
You sure that's the safe?

375
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,628
Yeah. I remember that dial.

376
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:50,841
So, once you're into Zeke's office, what?
You just drill through the lock?

377
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:53,655
It's not a high-end safe.

378
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:55,525
I just knock the lock off with a hammer.

379
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:57,997
The real problem will be carrying
the cash out of the club.

380
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,758
Right. Cash is heavy.

381
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,603
I brought mine to Zeke in an overnight bag.
You want to borrow my duffel?

382
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:05,594
No. They're gonna carry the cash
out for us themselves.

383
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:08,681
Gonna stuff it into a trash bag,
give it to the busboys,

384
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:10,587
and then bring it out to the dumpster.

385
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:11,857
Listen, uh...

386
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,720
I brought you something from the store.

387
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,291
I wish I could pay you,
but it's all I got.

388
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:22,063
Think you can use a bunch of cellphones?

389
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:23,916
Yeah. I can find a use for them.

390
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:28,996
- Michael?
- No, Andy. Andy. Andy. No!

391
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,178
- Hi. You must be Andy.
- Yeah.

392
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,918
Hi, I'm Michael's mom.

393
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:39,306
Your son's been helping me out.

394
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:41,775
I got to get going,
but I just want to say

395
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:44,394
your son's awesome...
Smartest guy I ever met.

396
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,769
- Thank you.
- All right.

397
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:52,444
Sweet kid.
I can see why he's in trouble.

398
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,783
Mom, I got to get to work, actually.
What is it you need?

399
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,826
- Well, I can't find my salad spinner.

400
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,336
That is tragic.

401
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:03,121
Well, I lost it during poker.
Did you take it?

402
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:04,665
Ma, why are you here?

403
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,001
It's this thing with Fiona.

404
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:13,173
Just tell me what happened between you
and Fiona, and then you can go to work.

405
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,176
- I don't know what you want me to say.
- Michael, please.

406
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,537
I don't know what it is you're thinking,

407
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:21,395
but Fiona is the best thing
in your life.

408
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:23,333
You're the best thing in my life.

409
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:26,854
Don't be that way, Michael.
I want you to talk to me.

410
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,000
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Fine.

411
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,451
You don't want to talk about it?

412
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,518
I'll talk to Fiona.

413
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,077
Great.

414
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:53,171
- Who's your friend?
- You don't know Davis?

415
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,840
He's wild.

416
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:57,272
He's some oil baron's kid.

417
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:58,923
Oh, yeah?

418
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:00,793
You want to introduce me?

419
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:05,350
You're a veg-atarian?

420
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:09,556
There she is! Damn!

421
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,760
Davis, Zeke. Zeke,...

422
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:16,527
Davis.

423
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:19,090
Friend, you're ruining my ratio.
i have a good ratio going on.

424
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,533
I got four ladies to one Davis.
Four to one, I like that.

425
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:23,368
Oh, I-I can fix that. Ladies.

426
00:21:25,957 --> 00:21:27,414
Now you're talking. I'm Davis Cullen.

427
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:29,666
My name's Zeke.
Is that a Texas drawl I hear?

428
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,217
Born and raised.

429
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,070
Pardon me.

430
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:35,808
Honey bear? It's been a long time...

431
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:37,716
Honey bear, he's gonna have
to call you back.

432
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,686
He's gonna mind his manners.

433
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,511
That was rude. My apologies.

434
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:48,044
- How about a bottle of Dom?
- What is this? Breakfast?

435
00:21:48,164 --> 00:21:49,314
Whiskey, then.

436
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,813
Why don't we take this party
back to a private location?

437
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,565
Round up, ladies!

438
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:01,084
So, Fi tells me that you're into oil.

439
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:02,784
Well, that was daddy's business.

440
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,106
I got the hell out of Killeen
as fast as I could.

441
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:07,120
4AM is for going to bed,
not getting up.

442
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,748
Amen to that, brother.
So, what do you do, Davis?

443
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,540
Little of this, little of that.

444
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,794
How'd you like to add "club owner"
to your portfolio?

445
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:15,931
Usually, I bring in people slow...

446
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:18,906
offer them limited partnership
in Velvet, see how it goes.

447
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:21,300
But with you, I can see
you're like me, a player.

448
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,397
I'm not even gonna waste
your time in the shallow end.

449
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,122
Don't then. Say something, son.

450
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:26,972
I'm opening a new club in Havana.

451
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:29,399
Havana... last time I checked,
that was in Cuba.

452
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,160
We deal only in cash.
No legal hiccups that way.

453
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,162
It's gonna be huge.
The upside is enormous.

454
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:36,948
- Now, how much you putting in?
- Me? Plenty.

455
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:39,132
I mean, no cash, but sweat equity.

456
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,905
Believe me, the cash,
that's the easy part.

457
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:45,392
Why don't you boys stop playing
with each other...

458
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:50,247
.. and play with me instead?

459
00:22:53,194 --> 00:22:55,335
This whiskey is running
right through me!

460
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:57,745
- Where's the head?
- Uh, that way.

461
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:09,818
<i>There are two schools of safecracking.
Some people like to beat the lock.</i>

462
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,641
<i>Some people like to break the lock.</i>

463
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:15,051
<i>But it doesn't much matter
when the safe is sitting wide open.</i>

464
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:20,932
<i>Good counterfeit money is
more expensive than you think.</i>

465
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:22,904
<i>If you're looking to fake
money on the cheap,</i>

466
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:26,105
<i>a real bill bound to
a stack of filler will do.</i>

467
00:23:28,126 --> 00:23:29,786
Time to collect the trash?

468
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:32,241
This safe is nothing but
a prop to impress marks.

469
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:34,774
There's nothing in here but
a few hundreds and some newspapers.

470
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:37,210
- So, where's the real safe?
- No time to look.

471
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,783
I don't want any more surprises.
I'm putting ears on this guy.

472
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:42,507
Put your phone on mute and plug it in.

473
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:45,122
Aw, Mike, you're tying up my cell?

474
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,912
<i>How's Veronica supposed
to get ahold of me?</i>

475
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:50,098
Tell her to try the bar at Carlito's.

476
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,243
- Yeah, Fi?
- Michael, you got a problem.

477
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:05,404
It looks like Zeke's got partners.

478
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:07,583
<i>ZEKE'S
PARTNERS</i>

479
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:10,952
<i>I think you need to hurry it up.</i>

480
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:15,540
<i>30 years ago, the C.I.A. would've killed
for bugs as small as cellphones.</i>

481
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:18,617
<i>They're the perfect improvised
listening device,</i>

482
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:20,863
<i>but they burn juice like a humvee.</i>

483
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:24,591
<i>If there's no charger handy,
an unused usb port will do the trick.</i>

484
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:28,044
Michael, it's really time to go.
Your cover's about to be blown.

485
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:30,186
Almost done.

486
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,875
- Sam, you there?
- Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,422
- You want to talk some business?
- Maybe a little later!

488
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,681
I think it's time for me
and this little lady...

489
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,212
...to get to know each other better.

490
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,296
You don't mind, do you, partner?

491
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:10,345
There was nothing in the safe?

492
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:11,765
Newspaper...

493
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,135
Fat wads of it.

494
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,458
Man, we got one day.

495
00:25:15,578 --> 00:25:18,520
I got Baranski calling me for his money,
and now you're telling me...

496
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:20,063
Settle down.

497
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,618
See? Michael doesn't look worried.

498
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,316
Sharp lady, your ma.

499
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:28,486
Remember Zeke's partners, the guys
who played the feds that stung you?

500
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:31,031
Listen to what Zeke
was telling them last night.

501
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:36,997
<i>I'm telling you, this Davis cat
is big-time, and he's hungry.</i>

502
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:38,704
<i>What kind of timetable
are you looking at?</i>

503
00:25:38,824 --> 00:25:40,874
<i>How soon can you rent the house?</i>

504
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,078
See, he wants to score, so it's just
a matter of convincing him

505
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:46,931
that the only way he's gonna see our money

506
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:49,874
is if he shows us his first,
and when he does...

507
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:54,547
They're going to con him,

508
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:56,683
trick him into giving them the money.

509
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:00,145
Okay. Cool.

510
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:12,366
Zeke, this is Chuck.

511
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:15,159
The pain-in-the-ass wet nurse
that's watching my money.

512
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:18,618
Charles Finley, sole executor
of Mr. Cullen's trust.

513
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:22,724
I'm running a quart low.
I'm gonna get back here and serve myself.

514
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:29,538
Do you have any idea
who you're getting into bed with here?

515
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,303
Davis Cullen can be...

516
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:35,513
difficult.

517
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,591
I mean, there have been a few incidents.

518
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:41,436
- I think I'll take my chances.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

519
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:42,821
Fair enough.

520
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,785
Now, what we're talking about
is 200 grand.

521
00:26:46,008 --> 00:26:47,776
Not insubstantial.
What's your commitment?

522
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:50,472
Well, as I explained
to mr. Cullen,

523
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:52,023
I don't invest financially.

524
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,823
However, my time, my expertise...

525
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:54,933
Oh, I see.

526
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:58,395
<i>To win a negotiation, you have to show
you're willing to walk away.</i>

527
00:26:58,515 --> 00:27:01,875
I don't share in the same kind
of profits, either, of course.

528
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:04,715
By getting in on the ground floor
of our club in Havana,

529
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:07,254
- Mr. Cullen can expect...
- I'm sorry, sir. Did you say Havana?

530
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:08,088
Yes.

531
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,724
<i>And the best way to show
you're willing to walk away</i>

532
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:14,094
<i>is to walk away.</i>

533
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:18,186
- Where are you going?
- Sir,

534
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,353
it is my fiduciary duty

535
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,229
to protect Mr. Cullen's estate.

536
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,729
not a penny moves without
my sign-off, not a penny,

537
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:27,651
and I can't very well sign off
on anything in Cuba.

538
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,724
Good day.

539
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:34,655
- I don't think we have a deal.
- Son of a bitch!

540
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:36,366
Well, we'll see about this!

541
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:45,097
For the hostess.

542
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,531
I figured I'm gonna need
to get you girls half in the bag

543
00:27:47,651 --> 00:27:50,101
if I'm gonna hold my own at poker today.

544
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,173
Um, yeah. Well, about that...

545
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:54,575
- Am I early?
- No. No. No.

546
00:27:55,085 --> 00:27:57,773
I asked the girls if
they'd come an hour later.

547
00:28:00,443 --> 00:28:02,893
I wanted some time to talk to you alone.

548
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:04,686
Please.

549
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:08,619
Well, what's on your mind?

550
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:10,031
This breakup.

551
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:14,112
The two of you
are making a huge mistake.

552
00:28:15,678 --> 00:28:17,528
If you don't mind my saying.

553
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:19,826
- Madeline...
- No, please.

554
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:21,488
Listen.

555
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,178
I need you to know...

556
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:28,335
you are the best thing
that ever happened to Michael.

557
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,005
He's different when you're around.

558
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,172
He's better.

559
00:28:32,452 --> 00:28:33,935
He's almost happy.

560
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,346
Thank you for saying that.
It's more than he's ever said himself.

561
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,590
I know.

562
00:28:41,382 --> 00:28:43,126
His father was the same way.

563
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:48,549
but I see the way
he looks at you, Fiona.

564
00:28:49,691 --> 00:28:50,841
I'll always...

565
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,755
I'll always care
about your son, Madeline.

566
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:57,301
You know, I...

567
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:58,948
I just can't be the second...

568
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:01,432
most important thing in his life.

569
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,920
I can't blame you for that, honey.

570
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:25,263
Hurry back.

571
00:29:29,318 --> 00:29:30,313
A Pakistani spy

572
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:32,077
eating in an Indian restaurant...

573
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:33,733
My friend, you have gone native.

574
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:36,006
Oh, I like the chicken tikka.

575
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:40,426
- What do you want?
- Same as ever, I just want that file.

576
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:46,090
Kind of looks like
you're taking a bribe, doesn't it?

577
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:46,963
Maybe.

578
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,240
- It's flimsy.
- I don't know.

579
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,719
You're taking a kickback there.
You're accepting a free lunch right now.

580
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,758
- This is on me, by the way.
- Rajiv!

581
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,674
I haven't done anything wrong.

582
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:05,663
That's right, and you could explain
all of this to your boss back home,

583
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:09,477
probably even keep your job,
but your time in Miami would be over.

584
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,565
You've been made, approached,
possibly compromised.

585
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,353
You'd be relocated
to a different consulate.

586
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:16,266
Where do you think they'd send you?
Libya, Honduras?

587
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:17,874
How's Serbia these days?

588
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:20,540
- I thought you wanted to be friends.
- We can still be friends.

589
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,440
All i want is a 10-year-old file,
remember?

590
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:26,261
But if you really think

591
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:30,531
leaving the beaches, the blondes,
and the brunettes is worth it...

592
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:33,076
that's your call, Waseem.

593
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,886
Despite my strenuous objections,

594
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:43,025
Mr. Cullen has impressed upon me his...

595
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,721
desire to move forward.

596
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:49,350
Well, I'm glad to see that
cooler heads have prevailed.

597
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,128
I have two conditions.

598
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:53,734
As executor of Mr. Cullen's trust,

599
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,991
I still have to protect myself legally,

600
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:58,213
so i'm afraid that neither
of these are negotiable.

601
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,905
First, I need to see some paperwork,
and none of it had better mention Cuba.

602
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,205
Shouldn't be much of a problem
to dummy up some paperwork.

603
00:31:05,325 --> 00:31:06,275
Wonderful.

604
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:08,252
Secondly, and this is vital,

605
00:31:08,372 --> 00:31:12,301
we need to know that you are
as financially committed as Mr. Cullen.

606
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:14,493
As I explained before...

607
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:19,139
I will hold Mr. Cullen's $200,000
off shore in a joint escrow account.

608
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:21,799
If you would like to see
this deal go through,

609
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,427
you will have to put matching funds
into the same account.

610
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,847
Yeah. Well, I never put up my own money.

611
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:31,554
Awkward.

612
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:35,116
Mr. Cullen, I'm very sorry.

613
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:37,982
I tried... twice.

614
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:40,448
You've seen that. But...

615
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,999
I'm sorry. I cannot allow you...

616
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,461
to be involved...

617
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:45,323
in this.

618
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:51,746
Fine.

619
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:56,501
Let's do this.

620
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,016
Very well. Ready your funds.

621
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,902
We'll make the transfers tomorrow.

622
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:10,330
<i>I only need the money for one day.-/i></i>

623
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,141
<i>- No. No way.
- This is stupid. I got a whale here.</i>

624
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:15,544
<i>- Don't you see that?
- You need to watch yourself, Zeke.</i>

625
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:16,981
<i>You're just the face.</i>

626
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,498
<i>You don't like how we do it,
you can go back to tending bar.</i>

627
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:23,618
<i>If you can get him out to the house
so we can give him the brush-off, fine.</i>

628
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:25,822
<i>Otherwise, cut him loose.</i>

629
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:29,242
Sounds like Zeke's partners
have veto power.

630
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:32,829
So he can't put up any money.
We need to deal with Baranski.

631
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:34,664
I've got five hours.

632
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:37,148
I'm gonna get us some more time.

633
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:39,711
Hello. How are we this evening?

634
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:41,230
Oh, we're good.

635
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,715
We're gonna get you the money.
We just need a little more time.

636
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:46,095
That is acceptable.

637
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,080
I can wait.

638
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:51,556
<i>But there is someone here
who does not share the same patience.</i>

639
00:32:52,132 --> 00:32:54,851
Tell Andy his mother is
very disappointed with him.

640
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:02,275
Listen to me very carefully.
You do not want to hurt that woman.

641
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,315
You're right. I don't.

642
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:07,530
But she's going to stay right here
with me until I have every penny.

643
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,245
Andy, listen to me.
Baranski's not gonna hurt your mom.

644
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:17,790
- Are you sure? How can you be sure?
- He's just trying to prove a point.

645
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:21,628
- That you can get to us at any time.
- That he really wants his money.

646
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,422
Well, I really want to give it to him,
but I can't.

647
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:26,591
Andy, you have to just trust us.

648
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:41,760
You want me to make $200,000
just appear in a numbered account?

649
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:45,640
Michael, I'm good, but I can't just will
that kind of money into existence.

650
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,230
No one's saying it has to exist.

651
00:33:48,657 --> 00:33:51,208
Come on.
You've never written a bad check?

652
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:53,598
You were called "bad check" Barry.

653
00:33:54,124 --> 00:33:55,043
I know.

654
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:59,540
I guess I could wire the money from
an account that happens to be closed.

655
00:33:59,892 --> 00:34:01,876
Of course you can.
I have faith in you, Barry.

656
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:04,435
Yeah, but i'm gonna have to bounce
the money through a few time zones

657
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:07,674
just to keep my fingerprints off of it.
Take a couple days to set it up.

658
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:09,441
How does a couple hours sound?

659
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:13,914
Oh, it sounds like Michael Westen.
There's just one thing.

660
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:18,229
You're not gonna have long before some
branch manager in Zurich catches wind.

661
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:21,229
One panicked phone call to Aruba,
your money's gone.

662
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:23,628
How much time before
my money disappears?

663
00:34:23,748 --> 00:34:25,650
- Five minutes, maybe.
- Can you give me ten?

664
00:34:26,058 --> 00:34:27,860
For anyone else, Michael, it'd be three.

665
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,356
Zeke, it's Davis. I'm in.

666
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:41,511
Hey, I was beginning to think
that Finley guy called all the shots.

667
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:45,034
Yeah, I don't see Chuck figuring
much into my financial future.

668
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,553
How about you wire that money,
we solidify that future,

669
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:50,744
and I call a couple of girls over
to help celebrate?

670
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:53,844
Sounds mighty fine to me.
Let me just get my banker on the horn.

671
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,329
It's Davis.

672
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:05,804
Great Cayman Savings.
Account number 07-412-0029.

673
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:08,052
You got it?

674
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:20,728
Taking a while.

675
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,263
- Blondes or brunettes?
- Why choose?

676
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:35,774
My man!

677
00:35:37,392 --> 00:35:38,775
Harmony, it's Zeke.

678
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:41,668
Throwing a little gathering over
at my place.

679
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:43,138
He's ready for us.

680
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:45,271
Miami-dade police.

681
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:47,648
Turn off your engine.
Step out of the vehicle.

682
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:52,866
Girls are on their way.

683
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,946
They shouldn't be too long now. They...

684
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,709
Yeah, I see it now.
I see the fireworks.

685
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:11,005
Well, thanks for calling.
We're getting it.

686
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:14,033
- Who was that?
- Those are my new partners.

687
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:17,261
A couple of ex-delta force boys I know,
real heavy badasses.

688
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,051
What are you talking about?

689
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,848
Where do you think I got my money, son?

690
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:23,189
Finley's got my trust
all tied up in knots.

691
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,565
Those are my boys out there.
They insisted on watching my back.

692
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,788
Good thing, too.
You got F.B.I. troubles.

693
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:29,899
You had a couple agents
closing in on the house.

694
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:31,901
- We got to get.
- They killed them?

695
00:36:32,811 --> 00:36:34,654
Nothing gets between me and a deal.

696
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:39,916
No. No. I can't do this. I can't.
The... the deal is off.

697
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:44,080
The hell it is!  I cut those boys in.
They expect to be paid!

698
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:45,769
There is no deal.

699
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:49,377
You are not backing out!
You back out, you give me their money.

700
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,195
I can wire you back
what you already paid me, but i have...

701
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:55,091
You think those boys are just gonna
accept what they put in?

702
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:58,686
1,000% return on investment,

703
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:01,514
that's what you promised me,
that's what I promised them.

704
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,321
- I don't have that kind of cash.
- Well, then, you better get it.

705
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:07,228
They just killed two federal agents.

706
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,605
It's gonna take a lot
to get out of this one.

707
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,478
You need cash now.

708
00:37:30,102 --> 00:37:31,152
$200,000...

709
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:35,009
and $46,000.

710
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:37,943
You think it's enough?

711
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:39,743
I mean, do you think
the guys are gonna want more?

712
00:37:39,863 --> 00:37:41,413
You'd better hope not.

713
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,066
- What are you...
- How are...

714
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:57,445
Zeke, what the hell is going on?
We just got jumped.

715
00:37:57,723 --> 00:38:00,488
No. No. No. Because he told me
that you were dead.

716
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,403
Okay, that's wrong.
I saw the money.

717
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,084
It was there. It was right there.

718
00:38:13,245 --> 00:38:15,558
- What money?!
- The transfer...

719
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:18,132
Davis Cullen's money. I saw it.

720
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,475
- I gave him the cash.
- The money in the safe?

721
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:32,396
- How much did you give him?!
- All of it.

722
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:35,879
I gave him all of it.

723
00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:40,404
2:00. He said 2:00.

724
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:43,793
It's 2:01.

725
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:58,295
I'm so sorry, mom. I'm sorry.

726
00:38:58,415 --> 00:38:59,828
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

727
00:38:59,948 --> 00:39:02,677
$200,000 plus the vig, minus $300.

728
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:05,512
I got you a little present.
It's in the bag.

729
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,197
That's next month's issue.

730
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:11,116
You're a lifetime subscriber now.

731
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:14,461
- I'd rather have the $300.
- Oh, but this is money well spent.

732
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:17,483
Now you have a monthly reminder to keep
your hands off of people's mothers.

733
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:20,081
Leave.

734
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:25,013
Thank you.

735
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:36,752
If you ever need anything...

736
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:39,797
Do your mom a favor...
Go to a bank next time.

737
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,779
- Is everything all right?
- Sure.

738
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,041
You want to talk about
this thing with Fi?

739
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:09,054
It's all right, Michael.
That door is closed.

740
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:12,423
I get it. I talked to Fiona.

741
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:14,206
Oh, of course. Her, you believe.

742
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,918
Don't get mad at me. You don't want to
talk about it, I'm not talking about it.

743
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:21,088
Mom, I know how much you like her.
I'm sorry.

744
00:40:21,815 --> 00:40:23,257
And it's all right, Michael.

745
00:40:24,148 --> 00:40:25,968
Fiona is a wonderful girl.

746
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:28,349
But if it's not meant to be...

747
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:31,640
It's not meant to be.
Thank you. I'm gonna leave.

748
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,893
I just worry about you, that's all.

749
00:40:36,388 --> 00:40:39,464
I don't want to give up the idea
that you'll find someone.

750
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:41,442
I want you to have a family of your own.

751
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:43,944
This is about grandchildren?

752
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:45,779
No, honey.

753
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,820
It's not about me.

754
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,617
It's about you.

755
00:40:50,738 --> 00:40:53,258
Life is hard if you have
to live it alone,

756
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,525
and having kids just makes
the ride more fun.

757
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,171
I was fun?

758
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,788
This better not be old newspapers.

759
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:18,860
That was buried deep,

760
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,022
not easy to get.

761
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:22,399
I call in favors like that again,
people ask questions.

762
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:24,608
Don't worry. No more favors.

763
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:28,243
<i>They say a picture's
worth a thousand words.</i>

764
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:31,776
<i>Add in a few hundred that survived
the censor's black pen,</i>

765
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:35,287
<i>suddenly you've really got something.</i>

766
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,293
There's the negatives. you earned them.

767
00:41:42,006 --> 00:41:43,879
You're a man of your word. Thank you.

768
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,132
Thank you for lunch.

769
00:41:47,498 --> 00:41:49,848
- What is this?
- Your turn, Waseem.

770
00:41:58,768 --> 00:41:59,997
Someone's in a good mood.

771
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,915
I think I found Carla's cover.

772
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:04,692
Not bad, Mike. Not bad at all.
