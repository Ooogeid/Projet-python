1
00:00:00,895 --> 00:00:02,417
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,604
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,714
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:10,302
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing.</i>

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,719
<i>No cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:15,164
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,807
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,768
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,147
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:26,107
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:28,985
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI.</i>

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,363
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:33,782
- <i>Family, too...</i>
- Hey, is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,993
- <i>If you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:38,536
<i>Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,</i>

16
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:42,075
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,924
<i>Previously on</i> Burn Notice

18
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,673
Someone out there wants you dead,
and we both need to know who.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,430
You're gonna do this?
Hunt them down?

20
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:51,343
The enemy of my enemy
could be my friend.

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,197
I got the chemical analysis back
from the explosion. Professional.

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,890
Any progress finding our bomber?

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,294
Nope. Checked the blast.
Crude IED. Amateur hour.

24
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:01,771
We recruited you
because you're a good liar.

25
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,854
I guess we can't complain
when you lie to us.

26
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:07,482
They couldn't go out the door after they
set it. If they went off the balcony...

27
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,778
I could check the security cameras
at the businesses along the river.

28
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,930
<i>When you work
for an intelligence agency,</i>

29
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,362
<i>you operate within
an official structure.</i>

30
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:24,642
<i>There's a chain of command to report to,
protocols to be observed.</i>

31
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:26,504
<i>No one questions their mission.</i>

32
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,772
<i>But when you freelance,
you don't have those luxuries.</i>

33
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,582
<i>Getting your team on board
may require some convincing.</i>

34
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,789
I don't have a problem
with hunting down

35
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:36,092
someone who planted a bomb
at your place.

36
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,300
I have a problem
with why you're hunting him.

37
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:39,864
If this was revenge, I'd be fine.

38
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:42,397
- Revenge is a waste of time.
- So is watching TV and eating candy.

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,342
You do it 'cause it feels good.

40
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:47,975
You are finding a killer
for the people who ruined your life.

41
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:51,475
When I find him,
I'll have more on them.

42
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:53,767
Intelligence gathering. Right.

43
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:56,478
He should at least suffer a little.

44
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:59,370
When I find him, there will be
some pain involved. Are you happy?

45
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,403
Delighted.

46
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:02,787
Do you see that storage facility?

47
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,833
It has security cameras that cover
the approach to your loft from the road.

48
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:09,982
Here's the name of the service rep
who installed the security system.

49
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:12,415
And the model number.
You're welcome.

50
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:13,845
You do care.

51
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,761
Now run along
before I change my mind.

52
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:20,342
<i>Spies love technology upgrades.</i>

53
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:22,292
<i>When someone replaces old equipment,</i>

54
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,718
<i>a computer, a cellphone, a PDA,</i>

55
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:28,647
<i>Getting information becomes as easy
as looking through the trash.</i>

56
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,746
I cannot believe
Phil didn't call you.

57
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,794
I was up on an install up in Boca.

58
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:34,954
They had me come down here
and do your upgrade.

59
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,528
I got the paperwork right here.

60
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:38,742
- Is it gonna take long?
- No, it shouldn't be long.

61
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,034
It's just a simple
switch-out of a unit.

62
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:43,122
I should check with them.

63
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,346
No, you should yell at them.
I'm gonna get started here.

64
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,685
<i>When you need to steal
information in a hurry,</i>

65
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,296
<i>just arrange
the technology upgrade yourself.</i>

66
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,004
Ron, it's Kay, at Evergreen.

67
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,840
There's a guy doing an upgrade,
but I don't have him on the schedules.

68
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,032
Hang on.

69
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:58,093
I'm with Ron Lummer.
He needs to speak to you.

70
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,513
- Yeah, Ron?
- <i>Yeah. Who is this?</i>

71
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,859
No, no, no.
You're looking in the wrong files.

72
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:06,325
It's Evergreen Storage.
On your desk by the bobble-head guy.

73
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:07,848
<i>What? I don't have a file.</i>

74
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,166
- You found it?
- <i>What?</i>

75
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:12,537
Yeah. Oh, it looks like Phil
dropped the ball on this one.

76
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,943
<i>I'm calling the police now.</i>

77
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,487
No, no. Don't be too hard on him.
Everybody makes mistakes.

78
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,531
<i>You're breaking the law.
Don't touch anything.</i>

79
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,893
You know me. Anything for you.
Just save me a donut!

80
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,327
<i>This isn't funny! You hear me?
You're going to jail! I'm...</i>

81
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:26,895
- What did he say?
- Someone's in trouble, but it ain't me.

82
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:28,680
Sorry for the inconvenience.

83
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:32,047
<i>If you need to buy a few seconds
in an office environment,</i>

84
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,240
<i>programming a computer to dial
every phone in an office simultaneously</i>

85
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,440
<i>is simple and cheap.</i>

86
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:41,026
<i>Just set up your cellphone
to trigger the call remotely.</i>

87
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,342
Sounds like you guys are busy.

88
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,766
<i>To get away clean from an office,
it's okay to run.</i>

89
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,535
<i>People run out of offices
all the time.</i>

90
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,189
<i>If the look on your face
says "I'm in a hurry,"</i>

91
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:54,402
<i>you can go as fast as you want.</i>

92
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,392
<i>It's all about covering ground
before the yelling starts.</i>

93
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:59,113
Hey! Hey, stop!

94
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,289
<i>The one you love
is closer than you think.</i>

95
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,885
What's yours say?

96
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,474
<i>The one who burned you
is closer than you think.</i>

97
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:28,726
What? What?

98
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:33,062
- That got your attention.
- Not funny, Fi.

99
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:37,552
Is this what
your life's become, Michael?

100
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,987
Running around
like Carla's errand boy?

101
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,572
I'm doing this so I can get out
from under Carla.

102
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,742
The guy who blew me up...
She hates him.

103
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,869
So I would like to meet him.

104
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:49,413
I think I found something.

105
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:52,875
Passed the camera twice in 90 minutes
the day of the bombing.

106
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,012
Right time, too.

107
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,264
Collapsible ladder for getting down
from your balcony.

108
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:59,548
City worker outfit keeps people
from asking questions.

109
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,177
Meet the man who tried to kill me.

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Season 2, Episode 11 :
Hot Spot.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Synchro VO : S@lomon

112
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
<i>www.subbers-in-black.com</i>

113
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:11,312
Kind of ordinary for a spy killer.

114
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,682
- What were you expecting?
- I don't know. After all this, like,

115
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:17,607
boots and a mask, at least.
You know, a cape, maybe?

116
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,765
His gear is from
city of Miami public works.

117
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:22,802
Capes aren't standard issue.

118
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:24,435
Fi's checking it out.

119
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:25,846
Hey, good news.

120
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:27,646
Something to take your mind
off all this.

121
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,062
I got a way to score
some Dolphins tickets.

122
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:31,882
- Sam...
- Come on, Mikey.

123
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,032
When's the last time you did something
that regular people do?

124
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,992
Don't be afraid.
I'll be right there with you.

125
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:40,282
50-yard line, third row,
beer in big plastic cups.

126
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:43,132
- How are we getting these tickets?
- Buddy of mine, Sean Martin.

127
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:45,382
He used to play for the 'phins
in the '90s.

128
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:47,220
He... He needs a little favor.

129
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,764
- And there it is.
- Come on.

130
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,557
Look, we can probably
wrap this up in a day.

131
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,285
We're supposed to meet him at 2:00.

132
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:04,822
Most of these guys I handpicked
in the roughest part of overtown.

133
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,104
Pulled them out of broken families,
gangs. Put them on the field.

134
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:11,892
See, Mike? He's a great humanitarian,
he's got tickets on the 50-yard line.

135
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:13,652
Sam said you had a problem.

136
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:14,585
Not me.

137
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,925
One of my players, Corey Jensen.

138
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:20,336
Good kid. Stays out of trouble,
but he got into a fight the other day.

139
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,589
- A fight? What about?
- Not sure.

140
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,092
I just know the guy he fought
is bad news.

141
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:26,225
Felix Cole,

142
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:27,682
a local gangster.

143
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:29,888
Word is, he wants Corey dead.

144
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,156
Gangster...
This is the little problem you...

145
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:35,443
Yeah. Hey, Sean, what exactly
were you hoping for here, favor-wise?

146
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:37,222
He's at my place with his sister.

147
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:40,562
I just wanted you guys to go by and talk
to him and see what the options are.

148
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:43,106
Well, if he's being hunted,
he shouldn't be staying at your place.

149
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:44,803
Won't be long
before they look there.

150
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:47,402
Mike's right. Look, let me swing by.
I'll pick them up.

151
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:49,435
Thanks, Sam.
I appreciate it.

152
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:53,068
Okay, so it's not a little problem,

153
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,847
but we're not exactly talking
nosebleed seats either here, huh?

154
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,780
Come on.

155
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:01,425
Whoa, Mike.
We got a visitor.

156
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,255
Hello, Michael.

157
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:06,122
Is now a good time?

158
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:08,135
Carla. So great to see you.

159
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,636
You might want to give Sam your keys.
We need to talk.

160
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:13,264
- I'll meet you back at the loft.
- You sure, Mike?

161
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:14,565
He's sure.

162
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,540
Don't I get tied to the chair?
Don't go soft on me now, Carla.

163
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,092
I thought we'd keep this meeting
a little more casual.

164
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:43,095
We want to know
how your investigation is going.

165
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,422
"We"?
Who's "we"?

166
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,055
- Love to meet them, if they're around!
- Michael, sit down.

167
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:53,255
We got our analysis back
of the explosives at your place.

168
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:57,332
Same method and materials used on
the other operatives that were attacked.

169
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:59,002
"Operatives". Plural.

170
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,896
How many exactly?
Do I get names?

171
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,800
I thought you weren't going
to tie my hands.

172
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,022
I've seen your work.

173
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,555
You do just fine
with your hands tied.

174
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:12,202
Everything I can share
with you is here.

175
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,532
And it stays here.

176
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:15,392
Look it over,
let us know when you're done.

177
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:18,412
What if I have to go
to the little boys room?

178
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,965
Well, you're gonna have to hold it.

179
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,795
My men have orders to shoot you
if you try to leave the room.

180
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:37,833
Hey, Mike.

181
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:40,262
Well, that was a quickie.

182
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,979
You look... unbruised.

183
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:43,802
Just a few paper cuts.

184
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,835
I got a look at Carla's files.

185
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:48,052
She thinks the bomber is not local.

186
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,650
So the big, bad burn-notice lady's
a step behind you.

187
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,242
You think it's gonna stay that way?

188
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:54,605
Well, I asked for a list
of all demolition experts

189
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:57,047
who have spent time
in Serbia and Montenegro.

190
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,502
Said I saw a pattern there.

191
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,722
- We got another meeting on the books.
- Nice.

192
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,462
Fi's upstairs with the kids.

193
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,922
I'm just heading out
to get dinner for everybody.

194
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:06,592
- Pizza time?
- Yeah.

195
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,680
Mike, just a heads-up.

196
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:11,550
This one has Fi a little...
fired up.

197
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:18,563
Sorry. I was delayed.

198
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:23,055
Oh, that's okay, Michael.
I was getting to know your guests.

199
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:26,773
I'm Corey.
This is my little sister, Tanya.

200
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,992
- Hi. I'm Michael.
- Nice to meet you.

201
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:31,945
They told me about their situation.
It seems this...

202
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,031
Man... Felix?

203
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:37,075
He took Tanya for a ride
in his car...

204
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,412
... and then he attacked her.

205
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,040
And she escaped, barely,

206
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,625
and then Corey went after him
with a baseball bat.

207
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,795
I found her crying. I just wanted to
make sure he never tried to come back...

208
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,713
No explanation necessary.

209
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:54,426
Use a golf club next time.
Greater force to a smaller area.

210
00:09:57,544 --> 00:09:59,022
But now he's after me.

211
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,507
His guys came to my house.
They tried to shoot me in the street.

212
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,769
- I mean, I don't know where to go.
- It's fine.

213
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,938
- We'll take care of it.
- Would you excuse me?

214
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:12,165
Could I talk with you
out on the balcony?

215
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:20,332
Michael, I'm gonna say this once.
We are helping these kids.

216
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:22,663
- Fi, this is a job for the police.
- Oh, sure.

217
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:24,098
If we let Felix kill Corey,

218
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,458
we'll have more evidence
when he comes after this girl again.

219
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,044
You made your point.
We can get them out of town.

220
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:32,506
No. They've done nothing wrong.
They're not going anywhere.

221
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:36,468
That son of a bitch is going somewhere,
and this is not a discussion.

222
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:39,804
You're letting your emotions
get the best of you.

223
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,502
No. I'm doing better than that.

224
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:45,769
I'm letting my feelings run the show,
and I feel very strongly about this!

225
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,297
Felix works out of that club,
mostly.

226
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:02,619
His crew boosts cars
for the 24k syndicate.

227
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,372
That's him next to the GTO.

228
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,205
Man, what was I thinking?

229
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:07,802
He's a stone-cold gangster.

230
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,419
He doesn't deserve
to be called a gangster.

231
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,629
Anyone who attacks a 15-year-old
is a pervert.

232
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,822
It's just...
See, the thing is,

233
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:19,678
ever since the word went out,
his whole gang is after me.

234
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,555
The whole 24k crew.

235
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:26,351
The whole 24k crew.
Oh, this is getting better and better.

236
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,522
You see that guy he's talking to?
The guy with the glasses by the table?

237
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,455
That's Tony Soto, the boss.

238
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,672
Felix earns a lot of money for that guy.

239
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:36,442
Any car that gets boosted
from here to midtown,

240
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:37,675
it's his guys.

241
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,532
Listen, seriously, I don't think
there's anything you guys can do.

242
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,576
Oh, don't worry, Corey.

243
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:45,620
There's a long list of things
we can do.

244
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:49,502
You know, just for the record,

245
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,562
when I said "favor",
I was thinking, like,

246
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,192
find somebody's lost dog
or something like that.

247
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:56,599
You're gonna have to work
a little harder than you're used to.

248
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,842
I work plenty hard, lady.
I just make it look easy.

249
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:01,912
Corey's up against
an organization here, Fi.

250
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:03,429
Felix is well-connected.

251
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,141
Well, then we'll just have
to disconnect him, won't we?

252
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:09,165
Tony won't back Felix

253
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:11,062
if we put him out of business.

254
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:13,731
A new gang of car thieves
is coming to town.

255
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:15,802
You want to take him head-on?

256
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:18,903
Well, then we got to stash Corey
and his sister somewhere for a bit.

257
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,452
Corey and Tanya are getting settled,
and I'm making spaghetti.

258
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:28,342
- Excuse me.
- Ma, I'm sorry.

259
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,278
Fiona really felt strongly about

260
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:33,611
them being in a nicer environment
than the loft, and...

261
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:37,381
Well, you know, she was really not
in the mood to discuss the point.

262
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:40,216
It's fine. If you didn't bring
people over, I'd never see you.

263
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,428
And thank you
for what you did for your brother.

264
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,973
- For... For what?
- Your brother's papers.

265
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,521
When he got out of jail?

266
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,716
The arrest was erased,
like it never happened.

267
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,773
- You didn't do that?
- Not exactly.

268
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,358
It was... It was done for me.

269
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:59,361
Thank your friends for me, then.

270
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:02,988
Yeah, my friends put him in jail
in the first place, actually, so...

271
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:09,578
Sometimes I forget
how complicated your life is.

272
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,334
<i>There's a reason
armies wear uniforms,</i>

273
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,312
<i>even though they make them
easier to spot.</i>

274
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,046
<i>Sometimes that's what you want.</i>

275
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:22,310
<i>Uniforms suggest organization,
power, and numbers.</i>

276
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:24,632
<i>These, in turn, inspire fear.</i>

277
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:26,556
<i>And as any good operative knows,</i>

278
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,384
<i>there's no more effective weapon
than fear.</i>

279
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,575
Nice car.

280
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:57,377
It's too bad, really.

281
00:13:58,785 --> 00:14:00,035
What's too bad?

282
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:03,314
<i>Pepper grenades are used
by antiterrorist units</i>

283
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:04,926
<i>to disable and stun.</i>

284
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,086
<i>Not lethal, but a face full of
pepper gas will keep you pretty busy.</i>

285
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,892
No, no, no. Don't go anywhere.
The party's just starting.

286
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:16,771
What the hell, man?

287
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,153
<i>Melting through
the engine block of a car</i>

288
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,252
<i>isn't hard if you know
what you're doing.</i>

289
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:28,074
<i>A few pounds of thermite
in a coffee can and a fuse</i>

290
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:31,395
<i>will do the trick
and put on a pretty good show.</i>

291
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:36,291
Felix, over here.

292
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,735
It's time for you to leave Miami.

293
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,145
You what?

294
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,315
You did that to his car?
He's gonna come after you.

295
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:02,150
Better than him coming after you.

296
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:05,487
We're just sending him a message.
It's time for him to move on.

297
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,372
Yeah, sounds like it.

298
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:08,455
Damn.

299
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:10,700
Oh, I looked through those pictures
Mr. Axe gave to me.

300
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,301
- You recognize anyone?
- Yeah, this dude here is JB.

301
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,265
He's definitely big-time.

302
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:17,541
That's Rodrick.

303
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:20,001
And this dude here?
They call Reed.

304
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,962
These three are
Felix's main boosters.

305
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,645
I found some crackers.

306
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:30,675
Mom?

307
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,014
These are like cardboard.

308
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,882
They were in the back of the cupboard.
They're a few years old.

309
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:38,427
Corey's been helping me clean out
all of the old food in the house.

310
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,606
He ate a can of smoked oysters
that I've had since you were a baby.

311
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,492
A little salty,
but they really hit the spot.

312
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,778
- Thanks, Ms. Westen.
- Oh, no. Thank you.

313
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:49,614
- Can we go home now?
- Not yet.

314
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,212
This was a good first step,
but we still have to be careful.

315
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:56,037
Is there any family that you have
that Felix might know about?

316
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,992
It's just me and Tanya.

317
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:03,003
Our mom passed last year.
We got family up north.

318
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,422
But I need to finish school here.
I got a chance at a scholarship.

319
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:08,249
Coach Martin looks after us
if we need it.

320
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,051
Well, I think it's time
to talk to coach Martin.

321
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:17,852
The whole neighborhood's talking about
what happened with Felix yesterday.

322
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,585
The engine of his car
melted into the road?

323
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:21,882
It's crazy.

324
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:24,378
Well, crazy's kind of what you want
in a situation like this.

325
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:27,117
I mean, you want Felix to worry
about something that's bigger

326
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,617
than some kid beating him up.

327
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,841
Sounds like a plan to me.
If there's anything I can do to help.

328
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,163
Actually, I need you to keep
your head down for a while,

329
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:36,578
'cause this is gonna get worse
before it gets better.

330
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,788
Sam, you're asking me to hide?

331
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,624
Hide? Oh, no.
Of course not.

332
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,627
I just need you to be someplace
where no one can see you.

333
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:46,046
Until I give the all-clear.

334
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:48,256
You know, for the kids.

335
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,407
<i>When you need to get into
a building in a hurry,</i>

336
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,740
<i>you can always count on a fire exit.</i>

337
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,432
<i>Every building has them.
It's just about knowing how to use them.</i>

338
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:05,066
<i>The right shape charge will put
a big enough dent in a steel door</i>

339
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,645
<i>to disengage the lock,
which can turn a fire exit</i>

340
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,738
<i>into a convenient
and unexpected entrance.</i>

341
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,069
<i>A coil of detcord
attached to a rubber mat</i>

342
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:16,911
<i>will give you the explosion you need</i>

343
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,572
<i>and allow you to point it
wherever you need it to go.</i>

344
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,929
<i>SWAT teams call it a hockey puck.</i>

345
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,709
Let me do that.

346
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,963
I have a more delicate touch.

347
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,720
I made some progress
finding your would-be assassin today.

348
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,041
There's a chance he works
at ASA Dismantling.

349
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:44,104
The city contracts
their demolition work with them.

350
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,875
I think I'll pay him a visit,
see what I can find out.

351
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:53,905
It's beautiful.

352
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:57,325
Beautiful.

353
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:02,663
So, the front of the place
is pretty well guarded, but that's it.

354
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,742
- And Felix?
- He hangs around the back. He's there.

355
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:07,836
- Fresh from the printer.
- Shall we?

356
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,182
I want to know
who the hell they are!

357
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:12,837
They come out of nowhere,
destroy my car,

358
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,670
tell me to leave my home,

359
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:16,803
and you say nobody...

360
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,430
Nobody knows anything?

361
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:21,558
No, Felix.
Nobody's seen nothing.

362
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,977
Then maybe they're not
looking hard enough.

363
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,342
<i>"Blitzkrieg", or "lightning war",</i>

364
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:40,368
<i>was a strategy pioneered
by the Germans in World War II.</i>

365
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,430
<i>It refers to a fast attack designed
to inspire fear and confusion,</i>

366
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:46,962
<i>penetrating quickly
behind enemy lines.</i>

367
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:01,389
Good afternoon.
Let's get those hands up.

368
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,309
Thank you to back up against the wall.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

369
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:06,915
Nice. Comfortable?

370
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,415
Hello, Felix.

371
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:12,025
Who the hell are you people?

372
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,085
The name's Johnny.

373
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,932
We got a lot in common, Felix.
We're both in the car-theft game.

374
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:20,992
Only we work Miami, and you...
Well, you work someplace else.

375
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,491
You've 48 hours. After that, we'll make
your travel arrangements for you.

376
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:25,427
Leave town?

377
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,622
I'm supposed to be scared
of some fancy-ass suits and a shotgun?

378
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:30,668
You better get the hell out
of my establishment.

379
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:32,295
I hear you. You're busy.

380
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,380
You got a lot to do.
After all, you only have...

381
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,283
47 hours, 59 minutes...

382
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:38,345
And 10 seconds...

383
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:40,024
... left.

384
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:42,194
Trust me, Felix.
You want to move on.

385
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:44,832
You got a lot of headaches here
you don't need.

386
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:47,227
Miami is very humid in the summer,

387
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,202
and you got all these people
you have to manage.

388
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:52,398
Plus your place is on fire.

389
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:57,975
I'll kill you!

390
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,906
- Take care.
- You hear me?

391
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:01,616
Do you hear me?

392
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:15,124
Did you see the shopping list
your mother gave Sam?

393
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:19,055
Corey is eating his own body weight
in cereal every day.

394
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:21,255
He's a growing boy.

395
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,350
I have to say, I like this Johnny.
He's got flair.

396
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:30,937
He reminds me of your cover
in Dublin when we first met.

397
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:34,202
Do you remember
what you called yourself?

398
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,316
Michael McBride.

399
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:37,915
Michael McBride.

400
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:42,576
Sometimes I wonder if...

401
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:45,763
He's the one I fell in love with.

402
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,415
I wouldn't be surprised.

403
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,065
We caused a lot of mayhem,
you and I.

404
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:54,605
He was your type of guy.

405
00:20:55,283 --> 00:20:56,170
Yes, he was.

406
00:20:57,385 --> 00:20:58,635
Where did he go?

407
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:01,295
Oh, you know how it is
with cover IDs.

408
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:04,512
You become who you need to be.

409
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,665
And everyone gets to guess
who you really are.

410
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:17,835
I'll see you later, Michael.

411
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:22,374
I have an appointment
at ASA Dismantling and Demolition.

412
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:25,241
Fi, if you see this guy...

413
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,825
I'll give him a kiss from you.

414
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,094
- Are you Eric?
- Yeah.

415
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:49,515
Nina Roberts, Green Row Publishing.
We spoke on the phone yesterday.

416
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,633
Oh, right.

417
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:54,255
- You sell the calendars.
- No, darling.

418
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:57,649
I make the calendars.
Theme calendars.

419
00:21:57,865 --> 00:22:01,490
Firefighters, lumberjacks,
cops, cowboys...

420
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:03,702
And now the men of demolition.

421
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:07,435
Nothing turns a woman on more
than when something goes "boom".

422
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:11,642
All I need from you
are names and photos of all your...

423
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:12,972
demolition guys.

424
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,122
Do me a favor.

425
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,722
- Don't tell them you're doing it.
- Why is that?

426
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:20,254
No feelings get hurt if I just talk
to the guys I'm interested in.

427
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:23,473
All I need is
another homely firefighter

428
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:26,015
offering to wax his chest
in my office.

429
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:31,325
- What do you look for?
- Depends.

430
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:34,310
But I think I'm looking at
Mr. January right here.

431
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:45,392
<i>Target selection
is one of the least glamorous</i>

432
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:48,792
<i>but most important elements
in any strategy.</i>

433
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,984
<i>You want to take out the people
your opponent depends on.</i>

434
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:55,084
<i>The ones his organization
can't function without.</i>

435
00:22:56,205 --> 00:22:57,455
Lose your keys?

436
00:22:58,214 --> 00:22:59,711
I can give you a ride.

437
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,231
Don't look so scared.

438
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,317
Loaded it with a bean-bag round,
so it won't do any permanent damage.

439
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:31,625
But the temporary damage,
that hurts like hell.

440
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:33,910
Did I forget to mention that?

441
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,038
My fault.

442
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:45,845
My fault.

443
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,312
Maybe we should exchange
insurance information.

444
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:50,502
Or maybe you should put these on...

445
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:52,735
And get into the trunk of my car.

446
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:55,398
You see? Look.

447
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:59,297
<i>There's an element of theater
in any offensive campaign.</i>

448
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:01,360
<i>It's not just about
bullets and bodies.</i>

449
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:05,212
<i>Killing people usually creates
more problems than it solves.</i>

450
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:08,377
<i>It's about undermining
your enemy's will to fight,</i>

451
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,230
<i>destroying the morale of his troops,</i>

452
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:14,410
<i>sending the message
that fighting back is useless</i>

453
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:16,972
<i>because the battle is already lost.</i>

454
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,873
I brought you a little
going-away present.

455
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:22,793
- You call this a present?
- Yeah. They're alive.

456
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,145
Yeah, but you won't be.

457
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,891
I'm good to go if you are.

458
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:31,051
You really want to do this in front of
all these people in broad daylight?

459
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:38,465
- You just wait, Johnny boy.
- Oh, I'll wait.

460
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:40,644
I'll wait 23 hours and 14 minutes.

461
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:46,945
Clean this up, man!

462
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,764
Hello, Johnny.

463
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:54,533
This is Tony Soto.
Maybe you've heard of me?

464
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,652
You're Felix's boss. Yeah.

465
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:58,692
There's a car coming up the street.

466
00:24:58,775 --> 00:24:59,591
I see it.

467
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:00,892
I want to talk to you.

468
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:03,014
Well, go ahead and talk.
That's what phones are for.

469
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:04,247
No. In person.

470
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:06,419
- Get in the car.
- "Get in the car".

471
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:09,922
I'm new to Miami,
but are most people that stupid here?

472
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:13,126
I'll leave two of my guys
with your people, unarmed,

473
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:14,959
to guarantee your safety.

474
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:17,245
And I'm not asking.
I'm telling.

475
00:25:17,614 --> 00:25:18,641
Now get in.

476
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:21,518
Keep these boys company.
I'm going to meet Tony Soto.

477
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:38,492
<i>There's an old saying in war
that no plan survives the battlefield.</i>

478
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:42,093
<i>Often, as a situation evolves,
you create new enemies.</i>

479
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,493
<i>Sometimes you create
new alliances, new friends.</i>

480
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,184
<i>Soldiers are fine
for dealing with the enemies,</i>

481
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:50,965
<i>but you need a spy
to handle new friends.</i>

482
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:54,844
Behold the ghost
haunting Felix Cole.

483
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:58,639
- Where you from?
- Around. Why am I here?

484
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,425
You got style, Johnny.

485
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:01,995
You're aggressive.

486
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:05,082
- I like that.
- Nice to be appreciated.

487
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:07,072
Felix has been a good earner,

488
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:09,812
but any guy who lets
someone punk him like you did,

489
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:13,279
lets a 17-year-old kick his ass
with a baseball bat...

490
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:16,662
Well, I can't have
that kind of weakness in my house.

491
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:20,295
- I couldn't agree more.
- Which brings me to my question...

492
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:23,698
- What exactly do you want?
- My team doesn't like competition.

493
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:25,712
We want to be the only game in town.

494
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:28,745
- We're selfish that way.
- I'm selfish this way.

495
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:32,038
Nobody operates in this neighborhood
without dealing with me.

496
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:34,383
I'll deal with you.
Listen, Felix is an amateur.

497
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:38,679
He steals a few cars for sale
and lays the rest off in chop shops.

498
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,525
Go to a high school.
A kid can do that.

499
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:44,435
Us? We deal in high-end export.
Shipping them overseas at a markup.

500
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:45,785
Overseas?

501
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,883
How do you get the cars
through customs?

502
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:49,452
We clean 'em and clone 'em.

503
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:50,585
Untraceable.

504
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,145
Sell them at twice the price.

505
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,452
Now, I can't have
these idiots running around,

506
00:26:55,535 --> 00:26:57,781
boosting minivans
with a shim and a screwdriver.

507
00:27:01,684 --> 00:27:04,454
You can talk, Johnny.
I'm gonna give you that.

508
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:06,456
But let's see if you can deliver.

509
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,412
Hot off the street.

510
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:15,672
Bring it back clean.
Show me how it works.

511
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:17,412
You could be my new car man.

512
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:18,642
Felix is out?

513
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:21,202
Felix is out, or you are.

514
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,297
So, this is your job application?

515
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:31,312
More or less.

516
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:35,202
So, meanwhile, some poor guy's running
around, looking for his $150,000 car.

517
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,972
We'll get it back to him.
We got to move fast on this one, Sam.

518
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:41,117
No kidding. I went to Felix's place
earlier to do some surveillance.

519
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,504
He's been going nuts
since we did our thing.

520
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:45,746
Well, the more panicked he is,
the easier our job is.

521
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,373
But this isn't just business.

522
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,459
I mean, he put the word out to every kid
in the neighborhood to look for Corey.

523
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,506
That was the plan.
We made him look vulnerable.

524
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,938
With Tony breathing down his neck,
he has to look strong now.

525
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,671
Quit yapping.
Let's go.

526
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:02,022
<i>The actual theft of a car
isn't difficult.</i>

527
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:04,348
<i>The hard part is selling it
once you have it.</i>

528
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,777
<i>Between the license, registration,
tax records, and vin number,</i>

529
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,313
<i>it's surprisingly hard
to turn a car into cash.</i>

530
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,988
<i>The best approach is to start
with clean paperwork</i>

531
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:14,655
<i>on another car from out of state,</i>

532
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:17,862
<i>then match the stolen car
to the clean paperwork.</i>

533
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:28,889
<i>That means new vin tags
and a new registration.</i>

534
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,258
<i>And in case someone decides
to check closely,</i>

535
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,232
<i>some hydrochloric acid and a file</i>

536
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:45,306
<i>will make the etched vin number
on the car chassis impossible to read.</i>

537
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:47,903
Well, that's it.

538
00:28:47,986 --> 00:28:50,108
You think I should drive
around South Beach, you know,

539
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:52,641
just to make sure
it still drives okay?

540
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:54,112
Knock yourself out.

541
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:57,345
- I've got a meeting.
- Okay. Say hi to Carla for me.

542
00:29:02,695 --> 00:29:03,945
Hello, Michael.

543
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:05,445
Hello, Carla.

544
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:09,038
Do we have to go all the way to your
office, or can we just do this here?

545
00:29:13,514 --> 00:29:16,795
Everybody who's ever blown
something up in Eastern Europe.

546
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:18,995
Your ex-girlfriend's on there.

547
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,075
- I think we can rule Fiona out.
- Really?

548
00:29:22,305 --> 00:29:25,304
She has the expertise,
and she certainly had access.

549
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,555
Lot of names here.
This could take some time.

550
00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:29,505
Two days.

551
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,726
Driver.

552
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:35,323
I could get started that much faster
if you just dropped me off at home.

553
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,441
- Go up, make a left, make a...
- Goodbye, Michael.

554
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:48,577
- Aw, man. Look at that sweater.
- What?

555
00:29:50,514 --> 00:29:52,123
Yeah. That was Christmas.

556
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,808
Michael must have been 15, I think.

557
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:58,879
God, don't they look cute?
So sweet.

558
00:29:59,985 --> 00:30:01,135
Must be nice.

559
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,046
Me and Corey,

560
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:05,515
we never had a family like that.

561
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,635
Neither did we, sweetheart.

562
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:11,995
See the bruise on Michael's cheek?

563
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,478
He and his father got into a fight
because Frank was...

564
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:18,855
pushing his brother around.

565
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:23,437
Anyway, nobody was talking
to anybody, so I said,

566
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,548
"I'm gonna throw the whole dinner
down the garbage",

567
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,481
unless they stood there
and took that picture.

568
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,482
He fought his dad on...

569
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:31,454
on Christmas?

570
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:33,456
He was being a good big brother.

571
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:36,667
Like you.

572
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:44,377
- Is that everyone?
- Yep. Past and present.

573
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:49,675
Look who's on top.

574
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,525
I'll schedule photo sessions
in a few weeks,

575
00:30:53,608 --> 00:30:55,862
once I've had time
to go over all this.

576
00:30:55,945 --> 00:30:56,945
Cool.

577
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,305
Remember...

578
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:04,335
I'll be waiting.

579
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:19,772
- I believe I found your bomber.
- <i>Who is he, Fi?</i>

580
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:23,881
His name is Derek Poole,
and he works part-time for ASA.

581
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,169
I guess we know what he does
with the rest of his time.

582
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,719
- Can you get a home address?
- What do you think?

583
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:31,985
What's the word?

584
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:33,565
Fi got a name.

585
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:37,952
You expecting somebody, Mike?

586
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:39,035
Nope.

587
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:42,195
Who's there?

588
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:46,915
Sean!

589
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,850
What happened?

590
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:53,055
Felix and his boys jumped me.

591
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,885
They said if I didn't set up
a meeting with Corey,

592
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:57,442
they would go after my players.

593
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,156
He said he just wanted
to talk to him.

594
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:01,460
No. He's going to kill him.
He'll probably kill you both.

595
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,892
Should we call the police?

596
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:05,409
Well, we could get Felix arrested
for assaulting you,

597
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:08,402
but his crew would be on the streets,
and Corey would still be in danger.

598
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:11,428
So, what are we going to do, guys?
I can't have him going after my players.

599
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,056
Felix is on the edge.
It's time to push him over.

600
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,052
You're gonna call him.
Set up the meeting.

601
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,585
It's all right.
We've done this before.

602
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:29,375
This address Sean got from Felix?
It's an alley.

603
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,156
Industrial area by midtown.

604
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:34,785
- Perfect spot for an ambush?
- Bingo. You won yourself a beer, Mikey.

605
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:36,524
So, poked around.

606
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:40,132
Looks like this guy Felix is kind of
a one-trick pony when it comes to hits.

607
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:42,632
A few years ago,
one of his rivals got popped.

608
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:44,044
Same setup, different alley.

609
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,512
If something works...

610
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:47,112
Basically, car pulls in,

611
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,508
bad guys box him in,
hose him down with lead.

612
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,093
Well, this I can work with.

613
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:53,565
Can I work with that?
Thank you.

614
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:58,850
<i>There are a couple of ways
to make a vehicle bullet-resistant.</i>

615
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:02,965
<i>$60,000 worth of titanium siding
will do the job.</i>

616
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,733
<i>Or you can pick up a few
extra copies of the yellow pages</i>

617
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:08,026
<i>from your local phone company.</i>

618
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,305
<i>Most non-armor-piercing bullets</i>

619
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:14,038
<i>will only penetrate a phone book
to a depth of an inch or two.</i>

620
00:33:15,055 --> 00:33:18,605
Behind a layer of steel,
it's more like a quarter of an inch.

621
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:22,499
Commercially available foam sealants
will keep your tires rolling

622
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,324
long enough to get you
out of danger.

623
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:29,074
For the windows, dual-layer,
high-density plexiglas is your best bet.

624
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:33,655
It's expensive, but bulletproof glass
is not the sort of thing you skimp on.

625
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,772
My guy called the cops.

626
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:43,972
It checks out clean.

627
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,899
You could drive to the police yourself,
and you wouldn't have to worry about it.

628
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,694
- I must say, I'm impressed.
- We aim to please.

629
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,489
All right. Let's check out
this operation of yours.

630
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:54,657
Let's.

631
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,375
I figured you for a nicer ride.

632
00:34:04,815 --> 00:34:07,294
We don't like to take anything
flashy to our location.

633
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,512
- We can't afford to attract attention.
- You're careful. That's good.

634
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:14,343
Maybe a little crazy,
but you're careful.

635
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,096
And when it counts.
Now, about Felix...

636
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:19,722
Don't worry about him.

637
00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:22,184
This checks out,
I'll take care of Felix.

638
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:25,477
<i>Countless wars have been fought
over misunderstanding.</i>

639
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,029
<i>Tragic mistakes, misperceptions</i>

640
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:30,862
<i>that turn people
against each other forever.</i>

641
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:33,192
That's Corey's car. Let's do this.

642
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:35,008
<i>Of course, it's not so tragic</i>

643
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:37,480
<i>when you're the one creating
the misunderstanding.</i>

644
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:39,535
It's up here.
We operate out of a warehouse.

645
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,951
We do all our work there.

646
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:44,080
Nothing's in our name,
so there's no connection to us.

647
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,127
Johnny, is that Felix's car?

648
00:34:48,574 --> 00:34:51,213
- You tell Felix you were meeting us?
- No, I...

649
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,317
Why the hell is he here?
Did he follow you?

650
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,216
Get down!

651
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,265
Get us the hell out of here!

652
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:25,222
We got to ditch this thing.

653
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:28,667
- You can call your guys for a ride?
- Yeah, yeah. Jesus. How did we...

654
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:31,420
We armored the car.
We're crazy, but we're not stupid.

655
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:34,572
- You know, that son of a bitch, he...
- Yeah, about that.

656
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:37,718
You have a few things to straighten out
before we get into business together.

657
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:38,969
Yeah, I'd say so.

658
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,680
I think we're gonna leave Miami
for a little while. Let it cool down.

659
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,702
Give you time to clean house.

660
00:35:44,785 --> 00:35:46,622
You straighten out
this thing with Felix.

661
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:48,555
Oh, I'll straighten it out.

662
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:51,857
There's our ride.
We'll give you a call when it's time.

663
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,859
I want you to get big Ed
on the phone.

664
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:56,575
I'm gonna take care of this cat.

665
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:09,692
Felix cleared out of Miami soon as
he heard Tony was looking for him.

666
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:10,994
His whole crew left, too.

667
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:14,212
Yeah, it's probably safe to park
in that part of town for a while.

668
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:16,385
Here's your tickets.
I got you three.

669
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:19,384
I heard there was a lady
doing most of the work.

670
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,332
Piece of cake. Right, Mike?

671
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:23,465
Hey, Corey wanted to say thanks.

672
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:25,175
Hey, you guys.

673
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:28,672
Listen, man, I just wanted to
thank you guys for saving my life.

674
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:29,792
Both of ours.

675
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,855
Thank you, and can you thank
Fiona for us?

676
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,442
Look, if you get anywhere
near the Super Bowl,

677
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,945
I want tickets, okay?
I want to be sitting on a goalpost.

678
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:39,725
You got it, man.

679
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:44,295
Yeah, Fi?

680
00:36:45,345 --> 00:36:47,342
I believe I found
your bomber's house.

681
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:48,712
All right, I'm on my way.

682
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:51,652
Bad news is, looks like no one's
lived there in a while.

683
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:54,785
Mail's piled up in the box,
newspapers stacking up.

684
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,382
I think I may go in and poke around
a little while I'm waiting.

685
00:36:58,628 --> 00:37:00,104
Fi, no. I don't want to disturb...

686
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:02,095
You think I've never broken
into a house before?

687
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,728
Fiona, just take it easy
and be careful.

688
00:37:20,835 --> 00:37:22,999
<i>When you boobytrap
someone else's place,</i>

689
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:25,826
<i>you put the trigger
in the door or just inside</i>

690
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,644
<i>so the odds of tripping it
are much higher.</i>

691
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:34,553
<i>If you rig your own place,</i>

692
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:38,252
<i>the trigger has to be farther inside
so you can safely enter.</i>

693
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:40,507
<i>A trip wire is
a quick and dirty version,</i>

694
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,324
<i>but a contact plate under the rug</i>

695
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:45,416
<i>is completely undetectable.</i>

696
00:37:46,654 --> 00:37:49,002
<i>Put a little accelerant
on the walls...</i>

697
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:51,798
<i>There's a reason
they call it a firetrap.</i>

698
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:58,102
<i>It's Fi. Leave a message.</i>

699
00:37:58,185 --> 00:38:00,406
Fi, I'm at the address you gave me.

700
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,825
Call me back if you get this.

701
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,242
- Hey, you can't be here.
- Anyone in there?

702
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,119
- It's too hot.
- Did you find anyone?

703
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,621
We don't know yet. We haven't been
able to confirm. It's too hot.

704
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:15,171
- Was there a woman in there?
- Someone was seen going in.

705
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:17,419
I just need to know
if someone was in there!

706
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,297
Did you see a woman come out?
Did anyone see anything?

707
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,715
Was anyone in there?

708
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:24,509
Move back! Move!

709
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,887
Move it back!

710
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,013
Move it back!

711
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,725
We're clearing this whole street.
Let's go.

712
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:37,356
- <i>It's Fi. Leave a message.</i>
- Fi, Fi, pick up the phone!

713
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:39,435
Call me if you get this!

714
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,575
I need to know where you are!

715
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,625
<i>It's Fi. Leave a message.</i>

716
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:16,565
There you are.

717
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:18,897
You have got to get
a landline in here.

718
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,133
Poole rigged his place
to burst into flame.

719
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:26,842
It was no surprise, but
I let my curiosity get away with me.

720
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:31,002
I waited for a burnout
in one of the windows.

721
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:32,935
Now I need a new cellphone.

722
00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:43,135
Michael, you didn't think that...?

723
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:25,532
Breakfast?

724
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:26,465
For me?

725
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,025
I see Fiona's spending
the night now.

726
00:40:32,755 --> 00:40:33,847
Good for you.

727
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,307
Putting down roots.

728
00:40:35,904 --> 00:40:38,143
So, you've had your couple of days.

729
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:40,785
What's the good news?

730
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:43,523
I ruled out everyone
on the list you gave me.

731
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:45,275
I took another look at the blast.

732
00:40:45,514 --> 00:40:48,989
I'm checking demolition specialists,
private contractors.

733
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,074
You could have someone look at that list,
see if there's anyone worth flagging.

734
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:54,408
Is this some kind of a joke?

735
00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:56,330
From what I hear, you have time

736
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,488
to run around town
playing dress-up with your friends,

737
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:00,539
but the best you can do
is a needle in a haystack?

738
00:41:00,622 --> 00:41:02,584
If you have a better idea,
I'm willing to hear it.

739
00:41:02,737 --> 00:41:04,252
You're my idea, Michael.

740
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,672
Make no mistake.

741
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:08,992
There are those who think
you're more trouble than you're worth.

742
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:12,541
I've convinced them that you're useful
'cause you can find the bomber.

743
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:14,721
What do you think's gonna happen
if you don't deliver?

744
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,973
Same thing that would happen
to you, I suppose.

745
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:23,271
You gonna run that check for me?

746
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,315
Give me the list.

747
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,762
It's time you focus
on helping yourself,

748
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:32,895
or you're not gonna be around
to help anyone else.

749
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:49,205
<i>It's Fi. Leave a message.</i>
