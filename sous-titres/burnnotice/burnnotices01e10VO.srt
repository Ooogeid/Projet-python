1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,700
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,100
<i>I used to be a spy until ...</i>

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,700
We got a burn notice. 
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,500
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing </i>

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,333
<i>No cash, no credit,
no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:14,768
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:16,733
- Where am I? 
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:19,733
<i>You do whatever
work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:22,100
<i>You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,568
<i>A trigger-Happy ex-Girlfriend ...</i>

11
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:25,900
should we shoot them?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,368
<i> ...an old friend who's
informing on you to the FBI ...</i>

13
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,800
- You know spies
- A bunch of bitchy little girls.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,800
<i> ...family, too ...</i>

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,000
is that your mom again?

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,533
<i> ...if you're desperate.
Someone needs your help.</i>

17
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:35,833
<i>Bottom line
- Until you figure out who burned you,</i>

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,000
<i>You're not
going anywhere.</i>

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,468
What do you think of
these shoes, Michael?

20
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,835
Fantastic.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,000
I have just
the right dress.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,433
Are they real?

23
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:12,500
Well, they look real.
Isn't that what counts?

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,300
You're getting a fake
identity, Michael.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,700
I can't get fake shoes?

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,000
The place is up
here somewhere.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,200
You know, you go ahead.

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,633
I'm gonna
- Oh, that's pretty.

29
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:30,400
<i>A fake identity is
known in the spy trade</i>

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,100
<i>As a false flag.</i>

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,900
<i>It used to be you could
make your own documents</i>

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,668
<i>With a printer
and a laminator.</i>

33
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>These days, though,</i>

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,800
<i>I. D. S have magnetic
strips, holograms,</i>

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,668
<i>And infrared watermarks.</i>

36
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,700
<i>You need a pro.</i>

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,100
Yes. What can
i do for you?

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,768
I lost my passport
and driver's license.

39
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:49,185
I heard i could get
some new ones here.

40
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:51,568
All you got to do is
report them stolen.

41
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:52,768
They'll send
you replacements.

42
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,100
Right, but the thing is,

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,633
I'm going on a trip soon,

44
00:01:56,732 --> 00:01:58,268
And i heard you
could do it here

45
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,635
More quickly
and more quietly.

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,433
Hmm.

47
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:04,768
That might be
possible ... for a fee.

48
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:07,135
The fee is not an issue.

49
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,600
Come on back.

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,968
I don't get much call for
the good stuff anymore.

51
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,200
Most of my business
is just teenagers

52
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,068
Trying to get past a
bouncer at the titty bar.

53
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,433
Titty bar.

54
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,668
They got no appreciation
for art, you know?

55
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,633
Give me your right hand.

56
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:27,200
How about pulling
your sleeve back?

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,268
If this stuff gets on your
shirt, it'll never come out.

58
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:33,800
And slide these on for
me, if you don't mind.

59
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,033
This is you, isn't it?

60
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:39,400
Uh, kind of hard
to tell from here.

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,700
Put those on for me,
if you don't mind.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,168
<i>In some situations, a tactical
retreat is your best option.</i>

63
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:53,285
Listen, well, i'm sorry
as i can be about this.

64
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:56,144
But a guy like me don't
stay in business very long

65
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,023
Unless he slips the fbi
a bone every now and then.

66
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:01,868
And let's face it
- You're a big old soup bone.

67
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:02,700
Flattered.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,968
They come through every now
and then asking about you.

69
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:08,033
<i>A guy with a gun
is a guy with a gun.</i>

70
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:10,268
<i>You can fight him and
risk someone getting shot</i>

71
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:11,533
<i>Or wait for backup.</i>

72
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:14,700
You're gonna be my
get-No-Hassles-For-A-Year card.

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,268
Yeah, special
agent allerot.

74
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,333
Yeah, tell
him it's jumbo.

75
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:23,700
Well, how many jumbos
you think he knows?

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,768
Mike, look at the deal
i got on these shoes.

77
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:28,900
You're not
gonna believe it.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,100
Lady! Lady, you
can't be back here.

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,133
Get out of here.
Get out of here now.

80
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:37,200
Sorry, i just wanted to show my boyfriend
- Get out of here now.

81
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,600
She's pregnant.

82
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,700
Pregnant? It worked.

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,800
Where are you
going? My shoe.

84
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,200
They clashed with
my dress anyway.

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,100
You know, i
was thinking ...

86
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,000
we could do some
vacation-Y things

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,700
When we go to
d. C., you know?

88
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,400
Make the most
of our trip.

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,533
Where's my lockpicks at?

90
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:22,968
You know, maybe a
fancy dinner one night,

91
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,335
Take in some
of the sights.

92
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
I'm gonna confront a man
who tried to have me killed.

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,033
It's not a
weekend getaway.

94
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:31,068
We can mix business
with pleasure.

95
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,433
It was right here.

96
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,933
Fi, the thing
about d. C. -

97
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:36,918
Is that you're
going to need backup.

98
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:38,900
Don't tell me you'd
rather have sam.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,833
We can't talk about
this right now. Why not?

100
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,800
Because i have a hard time
focusing when i'm in handcuffs.

101
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Would this help?

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,533
Another fine illustration

103
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:53,900
Of your need for
tactical assistance.

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,600
Admit it, Michael.

105
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,600
You need me.

106
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't even have
your own hairpin.

107
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
I do now. You happy?

108
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,700
Well, yeah, i know a few
guys who do i. D. Work, mike.

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,568
But, you know, the feds are
gonna be all over them, too,

110
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,633
Especially now.

111
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:28,468
Feel them out
for me, will you?

112
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,300
Mike, they said
if you leave miami,

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
They're gonna
pick you up.

114
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,568
In d. C., there's
gonna be someone there

115
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,833
Who is gonna
recognize you.

116
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:36,900
The best fake i. D. In the
world isn't gonna change that.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,100
The guy that burned me
tried to have me killed.

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,268
As long as i'm in
miami, he can find me.

119
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,133
I'll take my
chances in d. C.

120
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:46,468
You know who might be
able to help is lucy.

121
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:47,868
She called a while
back with a job,

122
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:48,333
But you were pretty busy

123
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,868
With this whole burn-Notice
business, you know.

124
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:51,733
What's the job?

125
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:53,468
Well, i don't know the
details, but i do know

126
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,968
That she works with
some real artistes.

127
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:56,633
These are the guys

128
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,168
Who can give you a whole new
life to go with your i. D.

129
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:00,133
You interested?

130
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,500
Let's give her a call.

131
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,100
<i>Corporations need spies
just like governments do.</i>

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,968
<i>Of course, they're
not called spies.</i>

133
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,733
<i>They're called
security consultants.</i>

134
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:13,100
<i>They're basically
mercenaries with nice suits.</i>

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,168
Your offices just keep
getting better and better.

136
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,768
It's good to
see you, Michael.

137
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,033
What have you been up to?

138
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,133
A little of this,
a little of that.

139
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:32,500
Haven't you been getting your
reports from your fbi buddies?

140
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,200
I didn't tell them

141
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,468
Anything they couldn't
find out for themselves.

142
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:36,333
If you tell them,

143
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:39,500
They don't have to find
out for themselves, do they?

144
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,633
Uh, i ...

145
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:43,933
you were the one
that trained me

146
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:47,768
In the delicate art of giving
people useless information.

147
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,368
I said nice things,
for what it's worth.

148
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:51,168
Thank you. You
have a job for me?

149
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:52,885
A woman i met, evelyn.

150
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:54,244
She heard i
work security.

151
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:55,533
She asked me for help.

152
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,933
I guess her ex ran
off with their son.

153
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:01,368
We ran checks, credit
cards, airlines, got nothing.

154
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,685
Somebody's gonna have
to do some legwork.

155
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:06,000
But a job that small
- Not really our thing.

156
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,133
You thought of me?

157
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:11,468
I would consider it a
favor if you took the job.

158
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,133
And the money's not bad.

159
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,668
Money's not the
pressing issue.

160
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,035
Why? What do you need?

161
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,900
Identity.

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,133
Not for traveling?

163
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:23,700
Michael, if
you leave miami,

164
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,100
I can't help you with
that kind of thing.

165
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,200
Seriously.

166
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,200
Lucy.

167
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,933
Lucy.

168
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:39,600
Fine.

169
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,800
Get your
documents together.

170
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,200
I'll have my guys
do an i. D. Package.

171
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,000
Go see evelyn first.

172
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,600
Thanks.

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,100
I separated from
doug a few months ago.

174
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,468
I tried to keep it
together for jasper's sake.

175
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,835
That's our son.

176
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,568
But it was hard on him listening
to us fight all the time.

177
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,300
He started acting up at school,
and then doug turned on him,

178
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,368
And i wasn't gonna
let that happen.

179
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,368
I'm sure you made
the right decision.

180
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:16,733
He took him.

181
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:19,700
He picked him up early at school
one day, and he disappeared.

182
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,700
Did you call the police?

183
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,100
Yeah, every day.

184
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
But technically
we're still married,

185
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,033
And he's jasper's father.

186
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,933
So without a custody
order, i can't do anything.

187
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,900
Please, i cannot wait for
the courts to sort this out.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Do you have any idea where
he might have taken him?

189
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,700
None.

190
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,968
I have no idea, because i've
hardly spoken to him in months.

191
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,868
Do you have pictures?

192
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,235
Yeah.

193
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,600
Here, that's jasper.

194
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,200
Please. Lucy said
you could find him.

195
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,200
I need to know that he's
okay. I want him back.

196
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,233
I'm gonna find him.

197
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:08,100
<i>One of the things
you learn in training</i>

198
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
<i>Is to avoid situations
that cut too close.</i>

199
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,133
<i>If you had a
rough childhood,</i>

200
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:16,000
<i>A situation with an abusive
father and a vulnerable kid</i>

201
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
<i>Is gonna make you angry.</i>

202
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,568
<i>That can be motivating, but
it can also be dangerous.</i>

203
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,700
Well, she's a looker.
What's the story?

204
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Husband ran off
with her kid.

205
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,168
You all right, mike?

206
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,535
I'm gonna find this guy.

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,900
<i>Facts are the hallmark
of a good false identity.</i>

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,700
<i>It's harder to create history
than it is to alter it.</i>

209
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,168
<i>Plus, the more
truth to your lie,</i>

210
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:45,235
<i>The easier it
is to remember.</i>

211
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,233
I don't see
you for weeks,

212
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:48,800
And you start going
through the closets?

213
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,633
What are you looking for?

214
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:52,400
Where is that box you used
to keep all my stuff in?

215
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,568
The memory box?
Sounds about right.

216
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,633
I don't remember.

217
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm kidding. Excuse me.

218
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,433
Oh, god, look,
huh? First place.

219
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:06,868
God, the trophy was
bigger than you were.

220
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:07,933
Could we speed
this up, ma?

221
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:10,100
I need my medical records
and my birth certificate.

222
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,500
All right.

223
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,518
Oh, how about your
report card, huh?

224
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,333
You could have
been valedictorian

225
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:17,568
If you hadn't been
suspended so many times

226
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,300
For getting into fights.

227
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,068
Mom, i don't need
my report card.

228
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,685
Your father used
to get so angry.

229
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,300
I don't want to
talk about dad, ma.

230
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,900
I just need my
stuff. Fine, here.

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,400
I don't want you to think
you're keeping those.

232
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,168
No, i'm just
gonna make copies.

233
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:32,535
I'm gonna take a trip
- Work.

234
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,700
The last time you said that,
you left for 10 years, Michael.

235
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,100
It's not that kind.

236
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,000
Did you ever think
about leaving, mom?

237
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,400
What?

238
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,900
Did it ever get
bad enough with dad

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,300
That you thought
about leaving?

240
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,033
Of course i did.

241
00:10:58,132 --> 00:11:00,868
I wanted to keep the
family together, Michael,

242
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,235
Through the
good and the bad.

243
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,800
You kids were so cute.

244
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Sam: well, it's
like lucy said.

245
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Chances are, he's
probably still in the area.

246
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,968
There's no recent credit-Card
activity, no car rentals.

247
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:21,285
The only blip, mike,
is where he works -

248
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:24,568
Greenway worldwide
cargo off of 57th.

249
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,633
I talked to my atf buddy.

250
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:27,968
There's some kind of
investigation there,

251
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,968
Some link to
organized crime.

252
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,933
Great.

253
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:33,933
U. S. Attorney's
office is all over it.

254
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:36,900
I left a message, haven't
heard back, and that's about it.

255
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,500
I should go
talk to evelyn.

256
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,133
You just talked
to her, mike.

257
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:47,200
Yeah, but she was a little
flustered the last time.

258
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,333
She might have
forgotten something.

259
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:50,968
I thought you had to
get those documents

260
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,968
To lucy for
your fake i. D.

261
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,335
Yeah, i'll do it later.

262
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,868
Something i
should know, sam?

263
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,033
About what, Fi?

264
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:07,268
About why Michael's
acting this way.

265
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,635
What way? He
seems fine to me.

266
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,518
Tell me about
this new client.

267
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:18,333
You know, i
just remembered.

268
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:19,933
I've got to get
mike some yogurt,

269
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,400
'Cause if i don't do that,
boy, you know how he is.

270
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,233
He never mentioned
trouble at work.

271
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,833
Do you think there
could be a connection?

272
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:34,800
Could be. You hear atf
investigation, it raises flags.

273
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,700
I wish i could
be more helpful.

274
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,000
Sorry.

275
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,868
I think you should just focus
on getting your son back.

276
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,235
That's the best
way to deal with it.

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,268
Evelyn, i think you're
stronger than you realize.

278
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,635
Then maybe i should
have just stuck with it.

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
You know, what
would have happened

280
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,900
If i had pretended that
everything was all right?

281
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,068
But i didn't want my
family to be a lie,

282
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,100
Not for jasper
and not for me.

283
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,600
You're doing
the best thing.

284
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,100
Believe me, i know a
little something about this.

285
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,033
I've stayed,
and i've left.

286
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,400
Sometimes leaving is
what you have to do.

287
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,200
It must be lonely,
what you do.

288
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,768
I couldn't live that way.

289
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:35,033
In my line of work,

290
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:37,868
I can't allow myself
to get too close.

291
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,668
What if you
met someone ...

292
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,035
and there's a spark?

293
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,100
Would you ignore it?

294
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,300
Could you?

295
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,700
I would, uh ...

296
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,400
concentrate on
getting the job done.

297
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,600
I got to head
over to doug's.

298
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,300
I'll call you as soon
as i know anything.

299
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,700
Okay.

300
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,918
What's taking so long, sam?
Are you losing your touch?

301
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:20,160
I didn't know doug would
have a nine-Pin dimple lock -

302
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,527
You know, the new kind, the
kind i haven't practiced on?

303
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,868
Okay, my fingers
are bleeding now.

304
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,033
There's some
pain involved.

305
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:29,568
You know, this is the
only place around here

306
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,433
With bars on its windows.

307
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:33,300
I wonder what doug
was so worried about.

308
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,533
Come on, baby.

309
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:36,268
There better be
something good in here.

310
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,635
There we go. Got it.

311
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,800
Looks like he
didn't leave much.

312
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,468
I've worked with less.

313
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,835
Check for bills.

314
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,400
Bunch of junk
mail, magazines.

315
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
Hello.

316
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,433
Hey, here's a quiz.

317
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,968
It tells you how to pick your
mate based on what you eat.

318
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,268
Okay, mike, what's
your favorite meat?

319
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,868
Pleasure reading
later, sam.

320
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,235
Oh, you're no fun.

321
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,218
Mike, two guys with
guns coming fast.

322
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,585
They must have been
watching the house.

323
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,400
They've got the
back covered.

324
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,733
Aah, nothing.

325
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:32,968
<i>Just because there
are no windows or doors</i>

326
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>Doesn't mean
there are no exits.</i>

327
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,700
<i>The thing to look for is
an air-Conditioner unit.</i>

328
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,500
<i>That's where the
wall is weakest.</i>

329
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,133
<i>Also, people watch doors.</i>

330
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:45,500
<i>They don't watch
air conditioners.</i>

331
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,433
Oh, the damsel in distress.

332
00:15:57,532 --> 00:15:59,800
She said it was an emergency.
What do you want me to do?

333
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,900
Be her knight in
shining armor, of course.

334
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,100
Evelyn, this is Fiona.

335
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,133
We work together.

336
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:12,668
Fiona, thank you. Pleasure.

337
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:15,035
Evelyn.

338
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,133
What happened?

339
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:18,133
I went to the courthouse

340
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:20,500
To try to get an
emergency custody hearing.

341
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,068
Some guys were at my
car. They knocked me down.

342
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,668
How many men were there?

343
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,335
Two, i think.

344
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:27,933
You think?

345
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:30,333
Could there
have been more?

346
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:32,468
Probably the same guys
that came by doug's place.

347
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,568
Michael, if jasper's caught
up in the middle of this,

348
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:35,733
I will never
forgive myself.

349
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:38,000
Please, you've got
to bring him home.

350
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,400
It's all right
now. It's okay.

351
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,833
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,568
It's all right.

353
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,935
It's okay.

354
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,600
What happened to the trademark
westen emotional distance?

355
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,233
She was upset.

356
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:11,068
Obviously. Where's
your head at?

357
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,135
Fi, if you're
gonna help me,

358
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:15,168
You can't have
this attitude.

359
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,600
Attitude?

360
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,033
If you're gonna be like
this, i think i'm entitled.

361
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:20,968
Maybe i should do this one
alone, then. Maybe you should.

362
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:21,885
I'll drive you home.

363
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:24,252
I'll get there myself.

364
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,500
Okay, mike.

365
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,668
Tell me i'm a genius.

366
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,033
You're a genius.

367
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:51,300
Come on, you can
do better than that.

368
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,568
Remember the mail we were
sorting at doug's place -

369
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:56,068
<i>Outdoor life,
field & stream.</i>

370
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,233
It got me thinking.

371
00:17:57,332 --> 00:18:00,033
Outdoor types always
go back to the woods.

372
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:02,000
So i got ahold of a buddy of
mine. He's at the coast guard.

373
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,933
He knows a guy in park
service, and i said,

374
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:05,800
"There's a couple of bottles of patr_n in it for you

375
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,433
Just tell me, sam.

376
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:10,768
State parks has a record
of doug's license plate

377
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,800
At mangrove campground.

378
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,133
Keys? Yeah.

379
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:15,033
I'd go there with you,

380
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,968
But veronica sort of set
up a mini vacation in boca -

381
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:19,400
One of those
swimming-With-The-Dolphins -

382
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,800
I'll take care
of it, sam.

383
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
I can't believe that
you found him so quickly.

384
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,600
That's amazing.

385
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,933
My friend sam
may have bruised

386
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,733
A couple of federal
statutes along the way,

387
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:31,668
But nothing a bottle of
tequila can't smooth over.

388
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,900
Well, he won't
get in trouble?

389
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,300
We found him. That's
what's important.

390
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,300
I knew i could
count on you.

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,068
Is that loaded?

392
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,533
Yeah.

393
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,400
You're not gonna bring that
when you go get jasper, right?

394
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
It'll be fine. Trust me.

395
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,390
This is it?

396
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,790
What do we do now?

397
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,800
I don't want
anybody getting hurt.

398
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,980
No matter what you see,

399
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,450
Stay in the
car until i say.

400
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,370
Okay.

401
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,770
Thank you.

402
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,600
Where's your son?
Where's jasper?

403
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,400
Look, this is about me.

404
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,190
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't go after my son.

405
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,630
You people
killed my wife.

406
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,450
Isn't that enough?

407
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,860
<i>The basic rule
of covert ops</i>

408
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,550
<i>Is let someone else
do your dirty work.</i>

409
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,330
<i>Let someone else find
the guy you want to kill.</i>

410
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,200
<i>It's a great technique</i>

411
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,760
<i>As long as you're
not the someone else.</i>

412
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,880
Evelyn the assassin

413
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,770
Doug the new client

414
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,990
Where's your son?

415
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,690
What, you come
here to kill me -

416
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,570
I'm not here to kill you.

417
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,770
That woman out there is.

418
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,170
Who's she?

419
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,190
I need you to stay
away from the windows.

420
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,020
Where is your
son? He's not here.

421
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,390
I sent him to
stay with friends.

422
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,090
That is one thing that
has gone right today.

423
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,000
My name is Michael, and
i'm here to help you.

424
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,890
Evelyn: everything all
right in there, Michael?

425
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,330
Doug: what is she doing?

426
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,590
Michael: she'll wait
for us to make a move

427
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,100
And pick us
off when we do.

428
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,500
I need a screwdriver.

429
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,770
Shouldn't we call
the park rangers?

430
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,690
Unless the park
rangers have been issued

431
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,700
Body armor and
high-Caliber weapons,

432
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,250
We're on our own here.

433
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,670
She must have disabled my
gun when we stopped for gas.

434
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,850
<i>Remove the trigger-Bar
spring from a sig sauer p228,</i>

435
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,630
<i>And you've got a 9-Millimeter
semiautomatic doorstop.</i>

436
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,410
I don't know what you
think you're playing at,

437
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,720
But this is not a
game you can win.

438
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,360
Doug, i need a paper
clip. Do you have one?

439
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,500
I don't have
a paper clip.

440
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,330
Well, do you have something
like a paper clip -

441
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,890
A thin piece of metal -

442
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,600
Wait. Never mind.

443
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,910
Kill him yourself,
if you want.

444
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,310
We need to wrap
this thing up.

445
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,520
You fixed it?

446
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,500
Hardly. I might
get one shot off.

447
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,360
You have one
chance to shoot her?

448
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,910
I'm not gonna shoot her.

449
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,840
Wait.

450
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,990
Is she leaving?

451
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,390
I seriously doubt that.

452
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,030
Do you have
any duct tape?

453
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,040
Hold that there.

454
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,700
When i say,"now," you're
gonna open that door.

455
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,070
Now!

456
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,370
<i>Shoot a propane tank,</i>

457
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,740
<i>And you'll just get
a big pot of cold gas.</i>

458
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,260
<i>You need an open flame
and real good aim.</i>

459
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,720
Get down!

460
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,180
Yeah, sam, i had
to drive around,

461
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,500
Make sure we
weren't followed.

462
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,570
She could be anywhere
now. Got to go.

463
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,070
What's happening?

464
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,910
We'll get to that.

465
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,960
I need to know why
someone wants you dead.

466
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,310
It's a long story.

467
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,140
Well, it's a long story

468
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,390
That starts with
greenway cargo, right?

469
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,830
Give me the short
version for now.

470
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,650
I was the controller -

471
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,210
Mostly wrote
checks, did invoices.

472
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,230
It was a job. I've
been a cpa for 15 years.

473
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,980
Need to get to the
marked-For-Death part.

474
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,140
After a while,

475
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,680
I realized i was paying
vendors i had never heard of

476
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,740
For cargo that was
never delivered.

477
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,740
Front companies?

478
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,120
They were into all
kinds of stuff -

479
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,190
Weapons, ivory,
human cargo.

480
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,590
That's what the fbi said.

481
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,540
Anyway, they
came to my house,

482
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,590
Said they were investigating
the company, investigating me.

483
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,890
Unless you testify?

484
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,940
I didn't want to get involved,
but they said i'd go to jail.

485
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,150
I said i'd
think about it.

486
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,390
Then things
started happening.

487
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,880
Things? What things?

488
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,930
I had people
following me,

489
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,980
Phone calls, guys
watching my house.

490
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,110
Then my wife ...

491
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,140
 ...goes out in my car.

492
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,040
They said it
was an accident,

493
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,640
But i sent jasper
away, and i ran.

494
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,280
Who are they?

495
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,550
They're your new best
friends. Stay here.

496
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,800
Ha, well, what a
piece of work she is.

497
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,190
So evelyn used you
to do the grunt work

498
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,180
To track him down.

499
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,990
She shows up and
finishes the job.

500
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,800
And when she kills him,
everyone comes looking for you.

501
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,870
She seemed so nice.

502
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,910
Mike, she went through
lucy to get to you.

503
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,420
Yeah, call lucy. Evelyn's not
the type to leave loose ends.

504
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,170
Right. Oh, almost
forgot, that's for you.

505
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,030
Evelyn has the charger?

506
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,500
Yeah, it's gonna
need some work.

507
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,670
And your gun?

508
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,940
Removed the
trigger-Bar spring.

509
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,010
Oh, that sounds like
something you would do.

510
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,300
You guys do really have a
lot in common, don't you?

511
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,570
Look, Fi, I know
you're enjoying this.

512
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,090
But now's not the time
to say "i told you so. "

513
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,570
This isn't like
you, Michael.

514
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,010
I know.

515
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,330
Fiona, i need your help.

516
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,580
Oh, so you're not gonna
handle this one on your own.

517
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,000
You just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

518
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,400
Sadly, no.

519
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,880
Take doug back to the
loft. Lock him down tight.

520
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,130
You can handle
that, right?

521
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,240
Have i ever let you down?

522
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,030
Be careful, Fi.

523
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,460
<i>Don't worry, Michael. I
never let my guard down.</i>

524
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,340
What the hell do you mean
you can't get ahold of her?

525
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,280
She doesn't have
some kind of a -

526
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,340
Yeah, all right,
well, keep trying.

527
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,680
Mike, she's in some kind of
a meeting with a new client

528
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,420
That just called
this morning.

529
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,730
I mean, it
might be nothing.

530
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,770
It's not gonna
be nothing, sam.

531
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,600
Hello?

532
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,710
Evelyn: Michael,
if i had known

533
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,070
You were this much
fun to work with,

534
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,060
I would have come
to miami sooner.

535
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,070
I'm glad one of
us is having fun.

536
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,550
You're not missing the
damsel in distress, are you?

537
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,950
"Michael, my
son! I'm afraid!

538
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,350
Please, Michael!"

539
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,440
You changed.

540
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,840
This is more my style.

541
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,780
Oh, for crying out loud,
i'm not gonna shoot you here.

542
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,110
Besides, i need you.

543
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,770
You're the one who's going
to tell me where doug is.

544
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,800
Oh, here.

545
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,800
Your car is in the
campground parking lot.

546
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,420
What are we gonna do
to resolve our problem?

547
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,640
Well, i think our problems
are a little different,

548
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,280
But, yes, let's
resolve them.

549
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,450
You know, you and i have
a very special connection.

550
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,080
I'm not even sure
who i'm talking to.

551
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,100
Oh, we met, in a
manner of speaking -

552
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,260
Istanbul about
six years ago.

553
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,300
July, seven years ago -

554
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,620
You took out those
two diplomats.

555
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,700
Yes. You know how close
you came to catching me?

556
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,560
Now, that was impressive.

557
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,920
And ever since then,
i've kept tabs on you.

558
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,520
You might say
i've become a fan.

559
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,020
I heard you got burned
and got this gig in miami.

560
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,760
So the stars just
kind of lined up.

561
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,280
I like the new look. And
your bruise, it healed.

562
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,740
Yeah, well, that
was temporary.

563
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,530
I've been
studying up on you.

564
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,580
It's not easy with someone
as secretive as you are.

565
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,560
But, of course, things got a
lot easier when you got burned.

566
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,470
You're not classified
material anymore.

567
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,050
Lucky you.

568
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,590
'Cause i learned something
about your early years.

569
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,610
Your daddy was mean, hmm?

570
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,680
So i figured an
abusive husband

571
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,950
And a troubled
but gifted son -

572
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,790
Well, that would
be motivating.

573
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,240
Enough about me
- Let's talk about you.

574
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,640
No, i don't feel like it.

575
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,980
You know, i don't think

576
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,320
That we should waste
all your hard work.

577
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,410
What say we
split the fee?

578
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,490
You just tell me where he
is. I will do all the rest.

579
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,060
It's easy money.

580
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,460
Evelyn, i appreciate all the
effort you've put into this,

581
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,950
But there comes a time
where you have to walk away.

582
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,410
Come on.

583
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,560
Isn't there something i
can do to persuade you?

584
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,890
There's nothing
you can do.

585
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,480
You know what i
love about miami?

586
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,430
Apart from
you, of course.

587
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,830
The cheap labor.

588
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,700
You know, i can get
a kid off the street

589
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,610
To do a hit for
about a grand.

590
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,420
Well, if i flirt
with him a little.

591
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,400
Say, now,
isn't that lucy?

592
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,760
Lucy!

593
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,290
Michael, i am so sorry.

594
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,280
It's not your
fault. Yes, it is.

595
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,420
You taught me
better than that.

596
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,390
I'm so stupid. I should
have been more thorough.

597
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,140
I've got guys headed to her
hotel right now. It won't matter.

598
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,330
I know. I just feel like
i should do something.

599
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,660
You should.

600
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,380
You should be careful
because she's still out there.

601
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,850
Right on time.

602
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,060
Yeah?

603
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,520
Evelyn: change your mind?

604
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,590
Enough of this.

605
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,260
You want a deal,
you deal with me.

606
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,900
You leave lucy out of it.

607
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,960
Done. Lucy has no
more to fear from me.

608
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,890
You see, i can
be reasonable.

609
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,340
Of course, i still
have a job to do.

610
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,740
And the next target will
have to be sam or Fiona or ...

611
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,160
or - I know
- Mommy.

612
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,630
Sooner or later,
i'll find someone

613
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,500
You care about
more than doug.

614
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,230
So you call me when
you want it to stop.

615
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,010
She's not leaving
town, is she?

616
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,780
That would be a no.

617
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,230
Doug: if she knows
all this about you,

618
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,110
She'll probably
come here.

619
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,270
She won't play
this out on my turf.

620
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,630
She'll keep the pressure on
until she gets an opening.

621
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,780
I can't believe this.

622
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,180
I'm a cpa, for
christ's sake.

623
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,200
A cpa brought
down al capone.

624
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,170
There's a reason why the
feds want you to testify.

625
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,550
I say we hunt her down.

626
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,980
Ammunition's cheap.

627
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,130
Fi, if we go out there
without a plan, we're exposed.

628
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,980
She's more than happy
to keep killing people

629
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,440
Until we hand doug over.

630
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,500
She can come after me.

631
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,240
I'm ready.

632
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,640
Yeah?

633
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,290
What about sam?

634
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,220
I'm game, mike.

635
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,080
What about if she
comes after my mom?

636
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,550
My brother?
Doug's son, jasper?

637
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,350
So we just sit
here and wait?

638
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,800
For once, she's
right, mike.

639
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,260
We've got to
do something.

640
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,460
We're gonna hand him over
to the u. S. Attorney,

641
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,840
Get him into
witness protection.

642
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,510
Won't she still
come after you?

643
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,820
We'll deal
with that later.

644
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,610
Sam, i need you to
call the u. S. Attorney.

645
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,080
Tell them we're bringing
doug in tomorrow morning.

646
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,860
I'm on it.

647
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,700
And somebody needs
to go to my mom,

648
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,660
See that she's safe,
make her house secure.

649
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,150
You think she's
cooked dinner yet?

650
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,290
I'm sure she'll heat
something up for you, sam.

651
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,130
Well, then, i'm
on that, too.

652
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,140
Fi, i need you to
prep an armed escort.

653
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,530
Doug, i need you to stay
away from the windows.

654
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,580
You say this is
just a precaution?

655
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,150
Oh, yeah, it's
nothing to worry about.

656
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,440
Um, say, this is a
little embarrassing,

657
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,000
But me and my lady
friend had a falling out.

658
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,430
And, well, like, mike
thought maybe it would be okay

659
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,100
If i crashed here
for the night.

660
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,540
Sam, i'm not an idiot.

661
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,030
You want to tell
me what's going on?

662
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,700
Well, see, there
was this lady,

663
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,640
And she was making
some threats.

664
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,580
Against me?

665
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,780
Not specifically
- I mean, your name came up,

666
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,680
But it was more like a
hypothetical-Type thing,

667
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,350
So it's nothing
to worry about.

668
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,870
But mike wanted
me to stay here

669
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,040
And give you some
self-Defense pointers

670
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,300
In case i had to leave.

671
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,020
You gonna leave this
here when you go?

672
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,830
Okay, be careful, okay,
because that's loaded.

673
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,590
Yeah.

674
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,940
Michael's father had a
winchester single-Shot.

675
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,740
I think i may
still have it.

676
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,100
So, you want a beer?

677
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,500
You kidding?

678
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,330
Doug is sleeping
peacefully.

679
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,290
You gave him
something. Maybe.

680
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,130
Well, half of something.

681
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,760
Sam got in touch

682
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,550
With his buddy at
the u. S. Attorney's.

683
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,260
We're bringing doug
in tomorrow morning.

684
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,930
Great. We can
talk, finally.

685
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,410
There's nothing
to talk about.

686
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,560
You were right. I
was wrong. I'm sorry.

687
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,340
It isn't that
simple, Michael.

688
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,970
You think you can let
the job be who you are -

689
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,260
All you are -

690
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,230
And you can't.

691
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,630
It's dangerous to
think that you can.

692
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,350
I know i can
be ... passionate,

693
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,120
But i'm good
at what i do.

694
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,520
I know.

695
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,630
It's no secret that things
between us have been -

696
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,550
A little rocky.

697
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,240
It isn't easy
for me, either.

698
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,830
Evelyn comes along,

699
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,650
And she's attractive,
sweet, needy.

700
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,300
Don't deny it, Michael.

701
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,270
Fine.

702
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,220
Isn't it interesting that
she turned out to be ...

703
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,340
who she turned out to be?

704
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,620
What shall we
make of that?

705
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,590
You made your point, Fi.

706
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,300
Did i? Yep, you did.

707
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,810
What about d. C.?
You still going?

708
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
I have to.

709
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,710
If i don't, it
won't be long

710
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,780
Before cowan sends someone
else down here to kill me.

711
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,210
I need him to know that
i can get to him, too.

712
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,100
And i need him to
know that right now.

713
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,800
And you need help,
and you know it.

714
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,210
I don't think
that's a good idea.

715
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,160
Is that a tactical
judgment or a personal one?

716
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,530
Both
- Everybody i know is in danger right now,

717
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,250
Everyone i'm close to.

718
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,020
Well ...

719
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,280
i'm willing to risk it ...

720
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,800
if you are.

721
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,700
How's my mom?

722
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,240
Locked up cozy with a
cigarette and a shotgun,

723
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,200
Ready to kill anything
that comes through the door.

724
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,440
Here you go, doug
- My lucky vest.

725
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,715
It will look great
over my shirt.

726
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:19,510
Thanks

727
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,120
It's a little worn, but
it will do the trick.

728
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,440
Are these bullet holes?

729
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,840
Yeah, i broke
it in for you.

730
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,390
It's a short ride to the
u. S. Attorney's office.

731
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,660
Just think of it as a
precaution, like a seat belt.

732
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,000
A seat belt that smells like
old spice and bourbon. Easy, now.

733
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,340
<i>Assassination
is 1% shooting,</i>

734
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,340
<i>99% preparation -</i>

735
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,670
<i>Anticipating moves,</i>

736
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,690
<i>Devising approaches,
recruiting sources,</i>

737
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,270
<i>Finding the
perfect opportunity</i>

738
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,500
<i>So the bullet's
almost an afterthought.</i>

739
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,690
<i>Usually, that's when a
target is on the move -</i>

740
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,110
<i>When there are too many
variables to control them all.</i>

741
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,300
We should get
out of here.

742
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,450
Michael, whatever
happens, thank you.

743
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,340
Yeah, you can thank me

744
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,040
By keeping your head down and
staying away from windows, okay?

745
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,770
<i>There are ways to
lessen the risk ...</i>

746
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,930
<i> ...an armed escort,</i>

747
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,710
<i>Taking an unpredictable
route to your destination,</i>

748
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,400
<i>Having backup
in a trail car.</i>

749
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,640
<i>But ultimately,</i>

750
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,720
<i>As long as the assassin
knows where you're going,</i>

751
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,440
<i>They have the upper hand.</i>

752
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,890
The point is
the thing works.

753
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,550
It's one of the few things in
my life that's never let me down.

754
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,900
<i>It's impossible to
stop a good assassin</i>

755
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,510
<i>From finding an opening
and taking a shot.</i>

756
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,490
<i>The best you can do is control
where the best opening is.</i>

757
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,080
<i>And sometimes,
that's enough.</i>

758
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,530
Michael: drop it.

759
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,060
You set me up.

760
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,540
Bravo.

761
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,140
Put it down, evelyn.

762
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,500
Hey, i can still do this.

763
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,600
Did i tell you how
much this job pays?

764
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,300
You could buy someplace
decent to live,

765
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,810
Even at miami prices.

766
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:42,420
Put the rifle down.

767
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,780
How did you
know i'd be here?

768
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,660
I figured you had a source in
the u. S. Attorney's office.

769
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,940
You knew doug was
thinking about testifying.

770
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,670
I count six different
vantage points

771
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,950
With a better view
of that entrance.

772
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,420
How did you know
i'd be at this one?

773
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,260
Istanbul wasn't
that long ago.

774
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,670
You like rooftops
over windows.

775
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,440
You like angles with the
target on your right-Hand side

776
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,230
Because you're
left-Handed.

777
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,250
That's right.

778
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,650
I knew i liked you.

779
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,140
Put it on.

780
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,170
Michael, is this what
you really want? Huh?

781
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,420
Helping out civilians
with their little problems,

782
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,750
Trying to get your
government job back?

783
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,390
Pathetic.

784
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,140
You're better than that.

785
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,410
Let's go. We have a
big day ahead of us.

786
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,530
I've got to turn you in.
There will be questions.

787
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,850
It will be past lunch
before we're done.

788
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,740
Turn me in.

789
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,600
A lot of secrets,
a lot of enemies -

790
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,990
I think it would be a
short stay, don't you?

791
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:48,000
Now, don't you think we
could come to an arrangement?

792
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,610
I don't think so.

793
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,010
Now, be honest with me.

794
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,780
If circumstances
were different ...

795
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,240
 ...do you think
that we could ...

796
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,170
not in this lifetime.

797
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,240
Maybe the next one, then.

798
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,960
The indictments
came down yesterday.

799
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,030
That was quick.

800
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,130
They found a leak in the
u. S. Attorney's office,

801
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,280
And evelyn, wow -

802
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,590
They're gonna be working
up her file for years.

803
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,410
She was a very,
very bad girl.

804
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,870
I managed to keep
you out of it so far.

805
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,450
It's gonna
take some work.

806
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,830
I appreciate that, lucy.

807
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,650
Don't say i never
did anything for you.

808
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,050
I never would.

809
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,290
Did she say
anything before ...

810
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,360
she wished

811
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,290
That things had turned
out ... differently.

812
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,840
Tell me about
doug and jasper.

813
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,430
On their way to a new life
in an undisclosed location.

814
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,360
He's gonna have to
come back for trial.

815
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,500
He wanted you
to have that.

816
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,170
And i have another
present for you.

817
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,990
It's your new identity.

818
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,020
It should get you
to d. C. Or wherever.

819
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,630
Thank you, Lucy.

820
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,680
It's the least i could do
- And your car,

821
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,910
Whatever it costs to repair,
I want to reimburse you.

822
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,260
Don't worry about it.

823
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,230
I'm not gonna be in
miami that much longer.

824
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,010
Will I see you again?

825
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,410
Maybe.

826
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,560
Lucy.

827
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,960
Sam.

828
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,760
So, is that
your new I. D.?

829
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,160
Yep.

830
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,900
I could get into the
white house press room

831
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,160
With these documents.

832
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,410
I don't think
you're gonna need it.

833
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,590
Why is that?

834
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,420
I just got a call from a buddy.

835
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,820
One of the guys I asked 
to keep an eye out

836
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,070
on this burn-Notice business.

837
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,470
Told me you might want to
rethink your trip to d. C.

838
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,350
Why? What did he say?

839
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,200
The guy who burned you.

840
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,760
It turns out you don't need
to go up there to see him

841
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,480
Because ...

842
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,540
well, he's coming
down here to see you.

843
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,770
See me?

844
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,160
What does that mean?

845
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,440
I don't know.

846
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,900
Just a heads-up.

847
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,570
Well, it looks like
i'm gonna have to get.
