1
00:00:00,185 --> 00:00:01,707
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:03,894
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,004
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,592
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing.</i>

5
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:12,009
<i>No cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,464
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,097
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:19,058
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:22,437
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:25,398
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:28,276
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI.</i>

12
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,653
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:33,072
- <i>Family, too...</i>
- Hey, is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,283
- <i>If you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:37,827
<i>Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,</i>

16
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:41,365
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,632
<i>Bribery's a lot more difficult
than it sounds.</i>

18
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:59,092
<i>There's no way to shop around,</i>

19
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:01,992
<i>so you usually overpay
for whatever information you're after.</i>

20
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:04,812
<i>There's no money-back guarantee
if the information's bad,</i>

21
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:07,082
<i>and of course the only thing
that you know for sure</i>

22
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:09,702
<i>is that you're handing your money
to a thief and a liar.</i>

23
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:12,832
I still can't believe you're giving
this money to some sleazy bank manager.

24
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:15,991
I went to a lot of trouble to find him.
I don't have a lot of options here.

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,619
Michael, he hid money for a man
who tried to assassinate you.

26
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,789
Which makes him a good person to know
if I'm trying to find that assassin.

27
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:24,701
You're going to this meeting unarmed.
You have no information.

28
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:25,972
It's a tactical risk.

29
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,202
Fi, I was warned not to meet you
the first time.

30
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:31,424
Yeah. I almost blew off your hand
with a block of C-4.

31
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,092
And I made a friend.

32
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:35,082
Maybe I'll make another one.

33
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:36,365
Watch my back.

34
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:48,575
Gustavo.

35
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:53,946
You have the money?

36
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,032
No small talk?
How was the flight?

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Bad. All the way here,
I wonder why I do this.

38
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:05,105
You came here because I'm giving you
a lot of money for a little information.

39
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:08,085
I just want a name, a few numbers,
and you're back on a plane.

40
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,796
First, I need to know
how you found me.

41
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,363
Bank-secrecy regulations
in the Cayman Islands

42
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:14,802
are not easy to penetrate.

43
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,135
I have friends.

44
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:17,662
What friends?

45
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:20,681
I don't even know who you are
or why you want this information.

46
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,248
<i>When someone's asking
for sensitive information,</i>

47
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:26,122
<i>it's basic security to make sure
that the person you're dealing with</i>

48
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,396
<i>is who he says he is.</i>

49
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,202
<i>An easy way is to change details
that the other person would know.</i>

50
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:32,958
We talked about this on the phone.

51
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,902
I'm giving you $8,000 for a file.

52
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,865
Part of what that money buys
is privacy.

53
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:40,409
I don't care what I said
on the phone.

54
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,712
You don't tell me what I want to know,
you don't get this file.

55
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,582
$8,000, no $8,000.

56
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,941
The deal I made with Gustavo

57
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:50,586
was for $10,000, not $8,000.

58
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,792
He was very clear about that number.

59
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,840
And we never talked on the phone.

60
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,108
You want to tell me who you are?

61
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:58,895
I can explain.

62
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,127
Michael, what happened?

63
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,963
He didn't want to make friends.

64
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,672
Season 2, Episode 14:
Truth and Reconciliation.

65
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:38,008
Synchro VO: S@lomon

66
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,677
<i>www.subbers-in-black.com</i>

67
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:51,905
Hey, Mike.

68
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,625
Look what I got for you, huh?

69
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:58,272
My police buddy. It was his day off.
We went out on his boat.

70
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,406
Did you get anything
besides the fish?

71
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,022
I got a peek at a police file
from the Caymans.

72
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:06,022
Seems that the real Gustavo
was found dead in a bar.

73
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:08,836
I guess that's what you get
if you run payroll for an assassin.

74
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,749
- Where do you want me to put this?
- Sink.

75
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:13,765
- Did you catch it?
- No, buddy of mine did,

76
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,812
but I figured
you could use the protein.

77
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:16,822
Thanks.

78
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:19,162
So there was nothing
on my friend with the knives?

79
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:21,552
No, except that he's
as dead as that fish.

80
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:23,282
Probably got smuggled in.

81
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:26,202
Fi knows some people who make
extra-special travel arrangements.

82
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,267
I'm supposed to meet her
at the Carlito for lunch.

83
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,105
Bring the fish.

84
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:35,405
Maybe they'll cook it for you.

85
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:40,525
Mr. Westen?

86
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,822
- That depends.
- My name is Claude Laurent.

87
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:47,369
I need help. I found someone
who worked with you before.

88
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:51,332
He said that you were a good man
and once worked for the government?

89
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,325
Yeah, I was a government worker.

90
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:57,296
Please, please.

91
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,502
- I can pay you.
- What exactly do you need?

92
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:04,585
Several years ago, my daughter,
Veronique, was murdered in Haiti.

93
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,514
I am here to bring the man
who killed her to justice.

94
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,902
I'm not sure what you've heard
about me, but...

95
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,811
a murder in Haiti, that's not...

96
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,064
- No, I can't go there.
- No, please. Here.

97
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:16,945
See?

98
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,986
Jean-Pierre Duman.
He has a new name.

99
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:23,265
I have this, too.

100
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,452
It's from the inter-American
court of human rights.

101
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:32,957
We use it to make him come back
to Haiti and stand trial.

102
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,918
Duman was an official in Haiti.

103
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,711
Veronique spoke out against him.

104
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,629
He had her put in prison,

105
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:41,548
and then he had her killed.

106
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:45,594
Mr. Laurent, this is not gonna work
in an American court.

107
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:50,855
- Who is this man with the fish?
- The man with the fish is right.

108
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,147
You don't even have proof
of Duman's identity.

109
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,922
- No, no, no, I have found him, and...
- Claude, listen to me.

110
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:57,909
I'm sure Veronique
would want you to go home

111
00:05:57,992 --> 00:06:00,105
and live out the rest of your life
remembering...

112
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:01,638
You know nothing...

113
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:03,988
of my daughter.

114
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,265
You do not deserve

115
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:08,534
to speak her name.

116
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:14,985
They said you were an honorable man.

117
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,169
They lied.

118
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:36,515
- What?
- Nothing.

119
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,064
Just waiting for Fi to show up.

120
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:43,554
You know, Mike, back in the day,

121
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:46,280
I had some buddies
who worked in Haiti.

122
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:49,935
Saw some of those prisons.

123
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,585
Bad, Mike.

124
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,995
Very bad.

125
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:57,958
A lot of guys got away
with a lot of bad stuff...

126
00:06:58,795 --> 00:06:59,795
Evil.

127
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,254
Always wished I could do more.

128
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,715
Sam, he's got a worthless letter.

129
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,483
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

130
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,605
Probably just a...
big fat waste of time.

131
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:12,895
Just forget all about it.

132
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,767
A man and his daughter.

133
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,542
You want me to check out Duman?
Is that what you want me to do?

134
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,582
I made some calls
when I was taking a leak,

135
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:22,691
and I found addresses
of a couple places he hangs out.

136
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:27,282
- Yeah, mom?
- <i>Michael, I need you to come over.</i>

137
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,756
- <i>There's been a break-in.</i>
- All right. I'll be right there.

138
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:38,295
So, this was the break-in, mom?

139
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:41,182
I didn't even know
you still owned this car.

140
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:44,546
I park it at Mrs. Gartelman's.
They took the tape deck, Michael!

141
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:48,742
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Well, not you. We.

142
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:52,855
They're having break-ins all over here.
There's a real crime spree,

143
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,933
and I thought that the two of us
could look into it together.

144
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,227
Well, how about I get you
a new stereo?

145
00:07:58,475 --> 00:07:59,739
It's not about the stereo.

146
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,832
I got the descriptions
of the boys who did it.

147
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,365
So call the police.

148
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:06,443
Yeah, right. They're not gonna do
anything about this, and you know it.

149
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:10,192
Could you at least give me
a ride to the store?

150
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:11,425
'cause the...

151
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:12,783
car won't start now.

152
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,660
Because the tape deck is stolen?

153
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,954
Hey, blame your father.
He installed the radio.

154
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:19,832
He wired the damn thing
to the ignition.

155
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:28,528
<i>Spend enough time
in international hot spots,</i>

156
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,102
<i>and you learn that a lot of
the worst monsters on Earth</i>

157
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,972
<i>are just spoiled rich kids.</i>

158
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,771
<i>Mass murderers come
in many shapes and sizes,</i>

159
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:38,582
<i>but they tend to drink
the same brands of champagne.</i>

160
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:39,915
That's the guy.

161
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,437
Jean-Pierre Duman.

162
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,705
His dad was a regional governor.

163
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:48,152
Damn near turned corruption into
an art form, died a few years back.

164
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,462
Jean-Pierre went into
the family business?

165
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:53,695
Yeah. Party boy there
ran the local prison.

166
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:57,635
Anybody complained, they went there.
Lucky ones were just executed.

167
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,714
After the election,
the whole family disappeared

168
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:05,797
with most of the island's GNP.

169
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,575
Disappeared till now?

170
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,672
Well, yeah, now he's Luc Renard.

171
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:12,301
He chases skirts, throws parties
at his place on Star Island.

172
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,303
Mike, I'm telling you,
we can do this.

173
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:16,513
You mean prove he's Duman?

174
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,018
Yeah, and you know how it is.

175
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:20,331
Nobody throws out everything
when they go off-grid.

176
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:21,894
We just got to get into his place.

177
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,854
Into his high-security place
on Star Island.

178
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:27,566
Nothing worth doing is easy, and nobody
loves easy more than me, but it's true.

179
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:33,435
Fiona, feel like coming to a party?

180
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:39,172
<i>People love the sound
of their native tongue.</i>

181
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:42,663
<i>Even the most security-conscious person
often lets his guard down</i>

182
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:44,922
<i>when he hears somebody
who speaks his language.</i>

183
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,532
<i>If that somebody happens to be
in a designer dress...</i>

184
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:48,792
What, I can't go in?

185
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,995
<i>So much the better.</i>

186
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,945
I will see you both later?

187
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,365
No. No, you won't.

188
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:14,555
And what do you suppose
I will be doing later?

189
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:17,745
I'll think of something.

190
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,035
I don't even know your name.

191
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,208
Luc Renard.

192
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,834
Claire Neville.

193
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:31,105
Come.

194
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,505
Party at my house.

195
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:48,945
Is this yours?

196
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:51,865
Yes. Do you like it?

197
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:58,515
Does it belong to your family,
or did you buy all this all by yourself?

198
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,825
You know, I don't like
to talk business.

199
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,095
Come, let me show you
the rest of the house.

200
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,675
Where does this lead?

201
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:17,565
This leads nowhere.

202
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:21,495
Come this way.
I have the biggest bathtub in Miami.

203
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:27,195
Well, if it's so big,
maybe we should invite a friend or two.

204
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:33,885
Give me a minute.

205
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,645
- Yeah, Fi?
- I'm in his office.

206
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,852
- There's not much here.
- Well, then, get out.

207
00:11:56,935 --> 00:12:00,469
If Duman catches you, you're not getting
out of there with a stern conversation.

208
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:03,555
Well, it's a shame
to waste the opportunity.

209
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,350
I'm planting a bug.

210
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,519
<i>This is the house
of Jean-Pierre Duman!</i>

211
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:12,135
<i>He murdered my daughter!</i>

212
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>Come out and show yourself,
Jean-Pierre!</i>

213
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,652
<i>You cannot hide from your crime!</i>

214
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:18,945
Our Haitian friend

215
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,602
<i>just crashed the party,</i>

216
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:23,992
and it looks like Monsieur Duman
is not too happy about his new guest.

217
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:25,775
Go and take care of him.

218
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:27,815
Now!

219
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,205
Go!

220
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:33,737
You have 30 seconds to get here

221
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,254
before Duman kills another member
of the Laurent family.

222
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,765
- You're driving my car back.
- No problem, Mike.

223
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,260
<i>Come out, Duman!</i>

224
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:47,705
<i>Staying hidden isn't always
about sticking to the shadows.</i>

225
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,351
Get in the car now!

226
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:52,973
<i>In fact, if you're enemy's eyes
are adjusted to the dark,</i>

227
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:56,858
<i>there's no better place to be than
behind the brightest light you can find.</i>

228
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:09,545
Why did you come?

229
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:13,208
- Why did you change your mind?
- Because that's the kind of guy he is.

230
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,422
He's an honorable man,
just like they told you.

231
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:17,129
He's just a little slow sometimes.

232
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:18,469
So...

233
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:20,757
- Where do we go from here?
- You go back to Haiti.

234
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,275
I am not leaving.

235
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:25,137
I am staying until it is done.

236
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,264
We have more experience
with this kind of thing.

237
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,482
I can help.

238
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,476
I found Duman
when no one else could find him.

239
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:35,132
Listen, Claude.
You've done your part.

240
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,315
Now let us do ours.
We'll get the guy.

241
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,582
How?
How will you do that?

242
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:43,905
By getting him to give us
evidence proving who he is.

243
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,323
Now, Mike is a very convincing guy.

244
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:47,642
Trust me.

245
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:48,827
You can count on him.

246
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,955
But you need to go home.

247
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:54,833
It's better for everyone.
You understand?

248
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:57,752
Yes.
I understand.

249
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:10,201
So, I asked around about
who might have brought your...

250
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:13,101
knife-wielding fake banker
into the country.

251
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,646
It was rough. I mean,

252
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:18,148
the Miami gun smugglers and the Miami
people smugglers, they don't get along.

253
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,782
And I've always been
more of a gun person.

254
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:23,361
- You're sure not a people person.
- You want to take over, Sam?

255
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:24,805
Oh, wait.

256
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,412
That's right. I forgot.

257
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:28,545
All your friends wear uniforms,

258
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,410
which makes you useless.

259
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,787
Hey, who found out about this guy
in the first place, huh?

260
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,855
Sam, Fi, just keep looking.

261
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:38,885
I intend to.

262
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,840
Good news on the Haitian front.

263
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,708
I got an angle on Duman.

264
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,295
His family used to do business
with Flintridge Industries.

265
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,562
It's a big multinational
that built all the prisons.

266
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:52,349
FBI's been nosing around them
for years.

267
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,002
You still in touch with those FBI agents
that were on the

268
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:57,270
"Follow Michael Westen
around Miami" beat?

269
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,981
Well, I could make a call,
but we didn't part on the best of terms.

270
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:03,415
Well, I think it's time
to mend some fences, Sam.

271
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:07,089
<i>If you've spent time
working for the government,</i>

272
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,812
<i>you understand that it's a game
with its own rules.</i>

273
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:11,821
<i>If you want to make
the government work for you,</i>

274
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:14,512
<i>you have to understand
how the game is played.</i>

275
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:16,390
<i>An FBI agent might hate you,</i>

276
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:19,843
<i>but if working with you gets him out
of an assignment he hates even more,</i>

277
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:22,175
<i>you've got yourself a partner.</i>

278
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:25,215
Hey, guys!
What's going on, huh?

279
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:29,065
She looks dangerous.

280
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,464
Cute, Sam. You know you're interfering
with a federal investigation?

281
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:34,903
What is she, like 80?
Did she steal somebody's dentures?

282
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:38,986
It's a racketeering case. Biggest
drug-smuggling family in South Florida.

283
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:41,015
Is she the boss?

284
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:42,816
Boss's grandmother.

285
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,023
Oh, man. You should check
the film speed in that camera.

286
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:48,530
At the rate she's moving,
you don't want to miss anything.

287
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,342
- What do you want, Axe?
- I come bearing gifts.

288
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,962
I have a peace offering.

289
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:56,381
A case that you guys can take back
to your office and be proud of.

290
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,748
You might even get a commendation
from the higher-ups.

291
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:01,376
This more crap like the stuff
you gave us on Westen?

292
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:03,925
I never lied to you guys about him.

293
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,382
Well, sure, I forgot some stuff.

294
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,341
What is it, Sam?
We've got work to do here.

295
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,928
He's an international fugitive
hiding in Miami under a new identity,

296
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:15,822
related to an investigation
you guys are already doing.

297
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,772
That's a whole different
department, Sam.

298
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:19,811
- Years in court.
- Listen, guys,

299
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,341
just check it out, all right?

300
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:23,440
We've had our differences,
but I know you FBI guys

301
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:25,872
bust your ass every day
to do the right thing.

302
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,611
I'll give you a time and a place.

303
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:29,535
Just check it out.

304
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,014
Watch out for granny.

305
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:33,322
You know, if you guys want me
to take her out, let me know.

306
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:35,005
All right. Good luck.

307
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:51,772
<i>Being a fugitive takes work.
When you're being hunted,</i>

308
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:54,612
<i>hiding isn't something you can do
effectively without help.</i>

309
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:56,485
<i>So the best way to catch a fugitive</i>

310
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:59,162
<i>isn't to approach him as one
of the people hunting him down.</i>

311
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:00,391
<i>It's to approach him</i>

312
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:02,842
<i>as one of the people
who can help him stay on the run.</i>

313
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:03,922
Ladies,

314
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:08,105
I'm terribly sorry, but I have a very
important meeting with Mr. Duman.

315
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,071
- Could you excuse us?
- Who are you?

316
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,276
Me?
My name is Owen Matthews.

317
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,117
But the more important question is,
who are you?

318
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:18,082
If you don't want to have
a very public,

319
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,747
very uncomfortable conversation
on that topic right now,

320
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,915
I'd ask these ladies to leave.

321
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:31,965
What do you want?

322
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,935
What makes you think
you can just sit at my table?

323
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,602
What gives you that right?

324
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,876
You know, I don't like to have
a meeting like this,

325
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,806
but when I find Jean-Pierre Duman

326
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:45,839
sitting in a restaurant
with FBI agents outside,

327
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:48,695
it is my obligation to sit down.

328
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,443
I've got a job.

329
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,772
The people I work for
pay me a lot of money

330
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:54,948
to make sure they don't land
in federal prison.

331
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,117
The people I work for
are very concerned right now

332
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,782
about the legal problems
of Jean-Pierre Duman.

333
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:04,683
I don't know what you're talking about.
My name is Luc Renard.

334
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:07,010
Luc Renard.
Call yourself whatever you like.

335
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,302
It doesn't matter what I think.
It matters what they think

336
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:11,035
because they're the ones
following you.

337
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:13,126
They're the ones who will be
asking you questions.

338
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:16,159
- This conversation is over.
- Just give me a few more minutes.

339
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:18,888
- You need to hear what I have to say.
- Speak.

340
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,260
The people I work for
were at Flintridge Industries

341
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:25,061
back when the company
was working with the Duman family.

342
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:28,692
I have been hired to sanitize
the record of those years.

343
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,943
- I am here to help you, Jean-Pierre.
- My name is Luc Renard.

344
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,112
No, it's not. Not yet.

345
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,241
There is still a trail that exists,

346
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,950
linking who you are
with who you were.

347
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,612
I am here to redirect
that trail, Jean-Pierre.

348
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,495
Until I do, everyone's in jeopardy.

349
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,791
You, my clients, everyone.

350
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:49,445
Let go...

351
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:51,504
of my arm.

352
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,720
I'm not the problem here.

353
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,749
I'm the solution.
Call me.

354
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:13,712
- Hey, Maddie.
- Hey, Sam! What are you doing here?

355
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:16,029
Mike said your ignition
need some work.

356
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:17,947
I'm already taking care of it.

357
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,315
I'm not helpless, Sam.

358
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,705
- You ever had your car broken into?
- No, mostly just broken.

359
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,834
Well, I told the police I want a list of
all the reported break-ins in this area

360
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,461
over the last six months.

361
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,339
Do you know these types of crimes
tend to cluster?

362
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:35,799
I read that.

363
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:37,717
Very impressive.

364
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,052
Don't pretend.

365
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:42,365
This is gonna take time.

366
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:44,772
I have a partner-stretching class
in half an hour.

367
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:46,017
Can you give me a ride?

368
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,146
- Sure, yeah, I can get you over there.
- Great!

369
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,267
'cause I need a partner too,
all right?

370
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,862
So you can hang out for the class
and then give me a ride back.

371
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,278
Partner stretching?
That sounds painful.

372
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:05,620
Boy.

373
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,665
Geez.

374
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:11,382
You all right?

375
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:14,587
This body was not built
for the hip-adductor stretch.

376
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:23,179
What? I got an inflamed bursal sac.
Got to ice it down.

377
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:26,474
Look, Mike, I think it's best
if you deal with your mom about the car.

378
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,371
<i>... with the FBI.
They know my real name.</i>

379
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,282
- Is that the bug in Duman's office?
- Yeah.

380
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,513
<i>What do I pay you for?</i>

381
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:37,068
<i>To protect me,
to keep your eyes on things.</i>

382
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,593
<i>We found the license plate of the car
that was here at the gates,</i>

383
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:41,940
<i>- the man with the megaphone.
- So, who was he?</i>

384
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,310
<i>His name is Claude Laurent.</i>

385
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:46,262
<i>He's staying at the Golden Sunset motel
down by the beach.</i>

386
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,215
<i>Maybe he talked to the FBI.</i>

387
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,332
<i>Then why are we here?
Take me. Now!</i>

388
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,939
Mike, Claude didn't leave Miami.
We got to get over there.

389
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:56,045
Before Duman sends him home
in a body bag.

390
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:10,845
Well, looky there.

391
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:15,025
Got our own little death squad
right here in the U.S. of A.

392
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:16,733
Hold on, Sam.
Stay here.

393
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:20,066
I'm pretty sure this is a two-man job,
you know, once the shooting starts.

394
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,449
I'm gonna see if I can keep
the shooting from starting.

395
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,455
Tell me you guys aren't this stupid.

396
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,252
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What do you think I'm doing here?

397
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,452
I'm here because
the guy in this motel

398
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:40,173
is pretty pissed at the Duman family
and causing problems for my clients.

399
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,631
But let me ask you, Luc,
what are you doing here?

400
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:44,928
Last we spoke, you hadn't even heard
of the Duman family.

401
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,802
- Get out of my way.
- You think that's gonna solve anything?

402
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:51,002
No, this is gonna solve nothing.
It is gonna cause us problems.

403
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:53,394
It's gonna make it worse.
Worse for me, worse for my clients,

404
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,212
- worse for you.
- Move!

405
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,702
You kill that man,
you validate everything he says.

406
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:07,835
That means news attention,
attention from the FBI.

407
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:09,602
I cannot let that happen.

408
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:11,852
You say you can change the past.
How?

409
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:14,082
Yes, I can change that.

410
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,751
I can take everything
that connects you back to Haiti,

411
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,919
every document,
every bank statement, all of it.

412
00:22:20,495 --> 00:22:23,867
I can clean it and hand you back
a whole new you,

413
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:27,887
a Jean-Pierre Duman
who never has to hide again.

414
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,432
Now choose.
I can change your story...

415
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:33,285
Or end it.

416
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:40,137
Come to my house

417
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:41,925
tomorrow.

418
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,194
Your house?

419
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,412
Is that Jean-Pierre Duman's house
or Luc Renard's?

420
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:47,685
We will see.

421
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,430
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You said you were going to leave town.

422
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:14,100
No, you said
it would be safer for me to go.

423
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:16,405
I said I understood.

424
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,262
And I do.

425
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:19,814
You put yourself in danger.

426
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:21,535
I...

427
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,733
do not want safety, Mr. Westen.

428
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:26,904
I want justice.

429
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:29,073
We said we would handle this.

430
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,119
Your daughter wants you
to get yourself killed?

431
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,602
That is what they said
when I wanted to go to the prisons

432
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:35,747
to find her.

433
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:39,725
That is what they said
when I wanted to go to the newspapers.

434
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,355
I failed her before.

435
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:46,132
I will not fail her again.

436
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:50,115
- You were not responsible.
- I was a coward!

437
00:23:55,455 --> 00:23:56,905
But never again.

438
00:23:58,455 --> 00:23:59,755
I will not leave

439
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,572
until Jean-Pierre Duman

440
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,925
is returned to Haiti

441
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,425
to face what he has done.

442
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:15,036
<i>Working covert ops,
you learn to exploit weakness.</i>

443
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:19,141
<i>You manipulate greed, fear, pride</i>

444
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,812
<i>to make people do what you want.</i>

445
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,775
<i>But when you're dealing
with true believers,</i>

446
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:24,632
<i>those weaknesses aren't there.</i>

447
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:27,452
<i>All you can do is help
or get out of the way.</i>

448
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:28,535
Wait.

449
00:24:34,415 --> 00:24:36,515
You won't be safe at your motel.

450
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,644
I would like you to stay here.

451
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:54,652
It seems my people skills
are improving, Michael.

452
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:57,783
<i>You found the guy who smuggled in
our fake banker from the Cayman Islands?</i>

453
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:01,016
I found where he keeps his boat,
and he just arrived.

454
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:06,315
- <i>Go easy on him, Fi.</i>
- You're breaking up.

455
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,375
<i>As a spy, it's usually best
to be unknown.</i>

456
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:16,665
<i>It allows you to adjust to any situation
and be whoever you need to be.</i>

457
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:20,226
<i>However, there are certain advantages
to being known.</i>

458
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:22,915
<i>A reputation can be a powerful tool.</i>

459
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:26,026
- You leaving?
- I was just...

460
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,352
You just got here.

461
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:30,194
I forgot something. I have to go
get the thing that I forgot.

462
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,574
- Look, I don't want any trouble.
- But we haven't had a chance to meet.

463
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:37,076
- Fiona.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

464
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:40,621
You shot up Paco's boat, you set fire
to that guy's place up in Boca.

465
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:43,256
Well, they interfered
with one of my gun shipments.

466
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:45,042
But you wouldn't do that.

467
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,773
- We're friends.
- What do you want?

468
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,631
I need to know about a guy who came in
a few days ago, called himself Gustavo.

469
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:53,975
He liked to play with knives.
He's dead, Gary.

470
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:57,285
He fell off a parking garage.

471
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,872
I brought him in on a run-up
from the Caymans.

472
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:01,655
He paid cash. That's it.

473
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:06,735
You know, I got to tell you,
I'm a little disappointed, Gary.

474
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,875
I expect so much more
from my friends.

475
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,272
I brought him in.

476
00:26:11,355 --> 00:26:14,071
I dropped him off at a storage unit.
I never saw him again.

477
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:16,157
A storage unit.
That's good.

478
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:20,286
You wouldn't happen to have the address
of that storage unit, would you, Gary?

479
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,956
Ma!

480
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:25,145
What, honey?

481
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:28,127
Have you seen dad's power sander?

482
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:31,278
What?
I've been to your place, Michael.

483
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:34,717
Your sander's better than your father's.
What, are you checking on my progress?

484
00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:37,247
I've seen guided missiles
with simpler circuitry.

485
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,230
- Why don't you just let me...
- I can do this.

486
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,665
How's Sam?

487
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:43,225
Recovering.

488
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,228
Your stretching class
nearly killed him.

489
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:47,772
Well, what doesn't kill him
will make him stronger.

490
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:49,005
Believe me.

491
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,691
I know.

492
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,403
I don't think that applies
to cigarettes, ma.

493
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,520
You want to go
to the police with me?

494
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,186
They're gonna show me photos
of every burglar in the area.

495
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:01,327
No, I got to...

496
00:27:01,615 --> 00:27:04,832
Michael, what is so important
that you couldn't do that with me?

497
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,667
I'm helping a man find justice
for his murdered daughter.

498
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:13,505
Well, if you need any help with that,
honey, you let me know.

499
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:24,045
I think I found the storage facility
where Gustavo kept his stuff.

500
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,192
Not too much damage done, I hope?

501
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:28,512
Oh, no. I didn't have
to lift a finger.

502
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:30,564
My reputation precedes me,
apparently.

503
00:27:33,225 --> 00:27:36,237
You should think about moving into
one of these storage units.

504
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,560
Some have air-conditioning.
It would be a step up.

505
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:40,193
I'll keep it in mind.

506
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:47,235
Call the storage unit
and make some inquiries.

507
00:27:47,318 --> 00:27:49,552
Let them know Gustavo passed away

508
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:52,253
and that you're coming by after-hours
to check on the unit.

509
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:54,565
I think I can handle that.

510
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,465
And you...

511
00:27:57,085 --> 00:28:00,485
can say hello
to Monsieur Duman for me.

512
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:21,246
<i>Most people have a hard time
letting go of their past.</i>

513
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:24,542
<i>The same guy who will burn a village
to the ground without a thought</i>

514
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,753
<i>often won't throw away
an old necktie</i>

515
00:28:26,836 --> 00:28:29,121
<i>because it reminds him
of his high-school graduation.</i>

516
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:33,054
<i>If you know what you're doing,
you can hang him with that necktie.</i>

517
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:34,385
Come in.

518
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:40,562
How does this work, what you do?

519
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:42,121
You give me everything you have.

520
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:45,086
Your passport, your medical records,
your financial records,

521
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:46,557
everything from the old days,

522
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,018
everything that ties you
to the name Jean-Pierre Duman.

523
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,186
And then?

524
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:52,937
We give you a new set of records.

525
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,950
<i>The money siphoned from the government
turns into income</i>

526
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,842
<i>from overseas investments.</i>

527
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:01,296
<i>You get a new travel record proving
you weren't even in the country</i>

528
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:02,871
<i>when your enemies died in prison.</i>

529
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,333
I handle it all.

530
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,956
My family left
the island of Haiti in a hurry.

531
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:14,335
These are some of the things
we thought we might need.

532
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,503
My father wanted to burn them,

533
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,252
but I thought perhaps someday...

534
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:22,134
You made the right choice.
No man should ever have to hide forever.

535
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,844
<i>I'll take these and start cleaning.</i>

536
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,221
Wait. First...

537
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:28,075
My father would like
to speak to you.

538
00:29:28,495 --> 00:29:29,595
Your father?

539
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:34,022
- I've read that your father was...
- Was dead, yes?

540
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,105
Back in Haiti, we buried
another man in his place.

541
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,694
Oh, no. Daddy's still alive.

542
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:42,613
He's old-fashioned.

543
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,762
He wants me to sit in the house
and hide from the cameras,

544
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:47,595
but I told him about you.

545
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:49,161
He did not believe,

546
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,331
but I said that you would explain.

547
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:00,005
So...

548
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,575
This is the man

549
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:04,510
who can change the past.

550
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,675
I called some people I know long ago

551
00:30:08,615 --> 00:30:10,808
at Flintridge Industries.

552
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:13,125
<i>They do not know you.</i>

553
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:15,495
Tell me.

554
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:17,465
Why is this?

555
00:30:17,995 --> 00:30:19,772
Some big misunderstanding.

556
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:22,695
Let's clear it up, though.
Who did you talk to? Sam?

557
00:30:23,315 --> 00:30:25,156
<i>Because Sam is who I talk to.</i>

558
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:28,012
Let me get him on the phone.
You know Sam.

559
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:30,773
He's got the big office
with the big windows,

560
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:33,914
south side of the building,
the glass doors,

561
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:36,417
you know, where you can walk
right out onto the balcony.

562
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:37,705
There is...

563
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:39,837
no such man.

564
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:42,214
Who are you?

565
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:44,995
Papa...

566
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,510
Wait, he said,

567
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,478
he knew about the prisons,

568
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,262
about Flintridge,
about the money, he...

569
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:53,845
How many times...

570
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:56,147
I tell you

571
00:30:56,495 --> 00:30:57,688
to be careful?

572
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,156
But he warned me

573
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:03,110
that the FBI was investigating us.

574
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,322
Tell him!

575
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:10,862
<i>It takes a lot longer to pull a gun
than most people think it does.</i>

576
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:14,205
<i>Almost five seconds, on average,
to draw and line up a shot.</i>

577
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,708
<i>Whether this is good or bad news depends
on what side of the gun you're on.</i>

578
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:28,795
Get him!

579
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:30,295
Get him!

580
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:53,115
The papers are gone.
They know we're looking.

581
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,502
- They'll have burned them by now.
- So that's it?

582
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:58,771
- Now we can do nothing?
- I didn't say that.

583
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:01,182
The papers were just a way
to get him to Haiti.

584
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:04,838
I assume there are people who can
identify him there without papers?

585
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:07,007
Yes, many people.

586
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:10,032
It's time for Duman to take
a trip back home. I like it.

587
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:13,015
Fi, can you get Duman away
from his bodyguards?

588
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,632
Sam, can you get us a truck?

589
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:19,315
For the chance to take these guys down,
I'll get us a convoy.

590
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,312
<i>When you're abducting someone,</i>

591
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:26,902
<i>transportation usually
isn't the issue.</i>

592
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,698
<i>There is no trick to driving a truck
with someone hidden in the back.</i>

593
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,132
<i>The challenge is getting them
into the truck.</i>

594
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:35,161
<i>You can walk them in, drag them in,</i>

595
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,994
<i>or let gravity do the work
and drop them in.</i>

596
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:43,512
Well, that should do it.

597
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,632
I just hope
it's not too comfortable.

598
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,047
I'm sure it'll be fine.

599
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:54,597
My guys in ties.

600
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:55,882
We checked out Duman.

601
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:58,623
Looks like the information you gave us
is good for once, Axe.

602
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:00,072
He's a real son of a bitch.

603
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:04,155
Thing is, there's not a lot we can do,
not without proof of who he is.

604
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:06,475
- Damn shame, really.
- Right.

605
00:33:06,745 --> 00:33:10,321
But the thing is,
if you still want to help...

606
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,312
Come on, Axe,
you know as well as I do

607
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:14,722
we can't do anything official
unless we got warrants.

608
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:18,155
- The thing's got to go up the chain.
- Yeah, I figured.

609
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:21,874
But, unofficially,
what did you have in mind?

610
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,789
<i>Spend time with corrupt, homicidal
third-world political figures,</i>

611
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:03,457
<i>and you hear a lot of self-pity.</i>

612
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:15,530
<i>What kind of man throws
his political enemies in prison</i>

613
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:16,924
<i>and tortures them to death?</i>

614
00:34:17,007 --> 00:34:19,515
<i>Usually it's a guy who feels
so sorry for himself</i>

615
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:21,798
<i>he feels justified doing anything.</i>

616
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:25,015
<i>Killers, by and large,
are whiny losers,</i>

617
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:28,345
<i>but that doesn't make them
any less dangerous.</i>

618
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:32,027
I do not want to be disturbed.

619
00:34:33,495 --> 00:34:34,545
Understand?

620
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,965
Lie down on your stomach.

621
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:55,935
Close your eyes.

622
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:01,305
<i>Most over-the-counter allergy medicines
contain mild sedatives.</i>

623
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:06,782
<i>In the right dosage,
they cause a pleasant drowsiness.</i>

624
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:08,362
<i>In the wrong dosage,</i>

625
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:11,895
<i>they cause dizziness, hallucinations,
and unconsciousness.</i>

626
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:14,125
What was that?

627
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:16,195
My secret.

628
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:22,635
Mr. Duman?

629
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:27,958
Mr. Duman!

630
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,505
Mr. Duman,

631
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,325
open the door!

632
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:47,976
Mr. Duman, are you okay?

633
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,690
Mr. Duman, open the door!

634
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,527
Calm down.

635
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:40,030
Keep screaming all the way to Haiti,
you're gonna be hoarse for your trial.

636
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,574
I guess he can't change
the past after all.

637
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,002
You need to get going.

638
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:48,247
Sam has a friend with a boat.
He'll get you both back to Haiti.

639
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:50,275
You'll go now?

640
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:55,405
My daughter,
she would have liked you.

641
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:57,995
She was very brave.

642
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:00,926
Like her father.

643
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:20,205
What are those for?

644
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:21,895
Well, I thought I'd...

645
00:37:22,645 --> 00:37:25,402
help you with the rewiring
of the car, if you needed it.

646
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:26,485
I did it!

647
00:37:29,285 --> 00:37:30,285
Really?

648
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:32,845
You rewired the car by yourself?

649
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:34,065
I did it.

650
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:37,022
I went through some of
your father's old papers.

651
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:38,224
I found this diagram,

652
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:41,091
and I just put the wires back
where they were supposed to be.

653
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:44,095
It wasn't that hard, Michael.

654
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:46,179
I don't know what to say.

655
00:37:47,855 --> 00:37:49,205
They caught them!

656
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:51,009
Teenagers breaking into garages.

657
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:53,082
I watched them come out
of Mrs. Hale's house.

658
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:55,939
I recognized the photographs,
and I called the cops.

659
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:04,489
You know why I think your father
wired the car the way he did?

660
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:10,205
'cause he thought if he was the only one
who could fix it, we'd always need him.

661
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:13,215
He'd be more useful, you know,

662
00:38:13,635 --> 00:38:15,085
part of the family.

663
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:19,525
So, did you catch yours?

664
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,532
The guy who killed the girl?

665
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:25,886
Yeah, I did.

666
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,379
Good for you, sweetheart.

667
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:38,945
Hey, Sam,

668
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:41,446
your buddy's boat make it
back to Haiti okay?

669
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:43,695
Yeah, the coast guard kept clear,

670
00:38:44,515 --> 00:38:45,781
thanks to you guys.

671
00:38:46,295 --> 00:38:48,232
We have no idea
what you're talking about, Axe.

672
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:50,600
Yeah, right.
Well, I got a list of officials

673
00:38:50,683 --> 00:38:53,956
who took kickbacks from
Flintridge Industries back in the day.

674
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,959
It's probably enough for you guys
to go after Papa Duman, too.

675
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:00,253
- A little bird told me.
- Little bird, huh?

676
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:04,372
He thought it would keep him
from being returned to the nest,

677
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:06,677
and I figured this could buy
some time away from granny.

678
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:08,845
Not exactly by the book, Axe.

679
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,890
Or I could send you a bouquet
with a nice card.

680
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,475
We'll find a way to use this.

681
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:16,642
Man, all this talking
makes me hungry,

682
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:17,813
but mostly thirsty.

683
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:19,505
Drinks on uncle Sam.

684
00:39:20,415 --> 00:39:22,282
Come on, guys.
Cough it up.

685
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:23,365
Mojito!

686
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,952
- You call the storage place?
- The manager knows we're coming.

687
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:30,412
For the record, Michael,
I don't like this plan.

688
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:31,495
What plan?

689
00:39:31,895 --> 00:39:33,490
You using yourself as bait

690
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:38,105
to see if whoever sent Gustavo
after you takes another crack.

691
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,195
That's what I would do.

692
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:46,385
You're gonna let me
back you up for real this time?

693
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,522
If you're right,

694
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:49,942
there's a good chance

695
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:53,475
he's waiting on a roof with a rifle
to take a shot at you.

696
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,545
That's what I would do.

697
00:39:57,455 --> 00:39:58,805
I need him alive.

698
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,285
I need you alive.

699
00:40:13,425 --> 00:40:14,975
You see anything, Fi?

700
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,501
Not yet.

701
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,129
Maybe it's time
we announced our arrival.

702
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,855
<i>If you suspect
you're walking into an ambush,</i>

703
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:28,881
<i>searching for where
the bad guys are hidden</i>

704
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:30,832
<i>is probably going to get you killed.</i>

705
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:32,261
<i>Unless you get lucky</i>

706
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:35,042
<i>and find them in the first place
you look, you're dead.</i>

707
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,977
<i>If you can manage it, the best move
is to make it impossible to hide.</i>

708
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:44,566
He's right above you.
He's on the move, Michael.

709
00:40:59,905 --> 00:41:03,591
<i>When you're in a foot chase,
the trick is to stay in visual contact</i>

710
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:06,171
<i>with whoever you're pursuing
until they run out of gas.</i>

711
00:41:08,515 --> 00:41:10,951
<i>Of course, visual contact
doesn't do you much good</i>

712
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:14,387
<i>if you're separated by a 12-foot-high,
razor-wire-topped fence.</i>

713
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:22,857
You should change
your workout, Michael!

714
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,356
You're not doing enough cardio.

715
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,315
Wait.

716
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:29,152
Did you see him?

717
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,470
Yeah. Turns out we've met before.
