00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,791
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:03,978
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,088
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,676
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing.</i>

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,093
<i>No cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,538
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:16,181
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,142
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:22,521
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:25,482
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI.</i>

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,737
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,156
- <i>Family, too...</i>
- Hey, is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,367
- <i>If you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,911
<i>Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,</i>

16
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,449
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:48,162
<i>Getting information
is all about fitting in.</i>

18
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:50,132
<i>If you're hunting for intel
in the Middle East,</i>

19
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:52,091
<i>that means a beard and a jellaba.</i>

20
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:53,724
<i>If you're doing it on South Beach,</i>

21
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:56,052
<i>you're probably wearing
a swimsuit and flip-flops.</i>

22
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:59,662
You think the sarong is too much?
Suddenly I'm feeling overdressed.

23
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:02,402
You look fine, Fi.
Besides, we're here on business.

24
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:04,230
What is the big deal
with this bomber?

25
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:07,191
If we looked for everyone who tried
to kill you, we'd do nothing else.

26
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,472
I need to find out
what this guy knows.

27
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:12,113
Well, if there's anyone in Miami
who can track down a bomber,

28
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,192
it's our old friend Seymour here.

29
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:17,868
Hope he's not mad about the face full
of gunpowder last time we dropped by.

30
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:21,182
Well, he was pretty enchanted
with you once upon a time.

31
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:22,989
Pretty enchanted with me?

32
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:26,872
He showed it when he attacked me
with a baseball bat.

33
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:28,705
Will you do my shoulders?

34
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:35,155
You know, Fi, if...

35
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,912
If you want to talk about
what happened the other night...

36
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:41,102
There's nothing to talk about.
We were just...

37
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,135
blowing off some steam, right?

38
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:46,395
We should go in.

39
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:02,002
<i>When it comes to intelligence gathering,
you can't hold grudges.</i>

40
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:05,002
<i>The guy who hit you
with a baseball bat yesterday</i>

41
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:07,435
<i>could be
an information source today.</i>

42
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,401
Fi, you wanna take care of...

43
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:14,424
Yeah, I'll take care of Mr. Security
while you say hello to Seymour.

44
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,973
Hello, Seymour.

45
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:22,635
Security!

46
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,278
Nice going, jackass.

47
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,864
I learned a thing or two
after the last time you kicked his ass.

48
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,241
- What's that?
- When it comes to my personal security,

49
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:41,327
I've got to take care
of things myself.

50
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:46,165
- You have hollow-points in there.
- You can tell just by looking?

51
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,712
No, I can't, but I can distract you
long enough to take it.

52
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:51,921
Now, I just need help tracking
someone down, Seymour. That's it.

53
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:53,672
You are such a badass.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,132
It's kind of awesome.

55
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:56,745
You need my help?

56
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:59,094
Okay. One condition.

57
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,742
You got to teach me
some of these moves.

58
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:02,825
Sure.

59
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:06,018
All right, what's everybody staring at?
This is a party!

60
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:07,705
I'm sorry, Mike.

61
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:09,772
What are we doing again?

62
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:13,526
I need help tracking someone.
An explosives expert. Derek Poole.

63
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,792
Oh, right. A manhunt. I love it.

64
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,614
First, you're gonna have to front me
some cash to spread around.

65
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,032
It opens doors.

66
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:23,195
Okay. I'll front you.

67
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:25,082
Because I know you're good for it.

68
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,915
But we are gonna have to be
in constant dialogue, Mike.

69
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,709
Okay? You and me,
badasses in this together.

70
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:34,222
All right, jackass.

71
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:36,362
You see how they just
laid you out again?

72
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:39,320
That is called teamwork, people.

73
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,015
And it is a beautiful thing.

74
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:43,597
So, up and at 'em.

75
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,308
Hit the blender.
Make some smoothies.

76
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:47,975
Feel like mango?

77
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,295
Mango!

78
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,145
Season 2, Episode 12 :
Seek and Destroy.

79
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:52,481
Synchro VO : S@lomon

80
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,000
<i>www.subbers-in-black.com</i>

81
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:56,302
Fi, I need a favor.

82
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:59,405
- I need to put some money together.
- Seymour said he'd front you.

83
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:02,772
Yeah, Seymour's not the type of guy
I want to owe money to long-term.

84
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:04,605
You want to borrow money.

85
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,772
If you need cash,
you can get a job like the rest of us.

86
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,505
I can't fill out a W-2.

87
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:12,022
If the people who burned me
find out I'm looking for a job,

88
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:13,832
they'll wonder why I need money.

89
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:15,512
I just passed on a gig.

90
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:18,852
Some art dealer, someone stealing
paper clips or something dull.

91
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:19,852
Pays good.

92
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:22,672
You take a job under a cover ID,
no one needs to know.

93
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,005
You're the best.

94
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,145
I expect a commission, Michael.

95
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:36,400
Do you have to work with Seymour?
I mean, the guy's unstable.

96
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,777
He's connected, and doesn't mix
with government types.

97
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,739
- Do you have my new cover ID?
- Yes. You're Miles Parker.

98
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,533
Background in corporate espionage.
You're a desk jockey.

99
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:46,534
Perfect for a cushy office gig.

100
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:48,185
Looks good, Sam.

101
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:53,805
Yeah, Fi, looks like I'm good to go
for that art-dealer job.

102
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:58,213
Thanks, I'll call you later.
Maybe we can grab dinner.

103
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:01,216
So, you two are just...
grabbing dinner.

104
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:03,435
- Just to debrief.
- Right.

105
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,025
Debrief.

106
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:12,052
<i>There are a lot of advantages
to taking on a new identity</i>

107
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:13,434
<i>when you take a new job.</i>

108
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:15,732
<i>You can tailor your résumé
to the position,</i>

109
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,782
<i>and it gives you
a lot of flexibility.</i>

110
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:21,779
<i>You just have to get used to the idea
of lying to everyone you meet.</i>

111
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,252
- I'm Miles Parker.
- Hi, Miles Parker.

112
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:25,741
I'm here to see Scott Chandler.

113
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:26,959
Mr. Parker!

114
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:30,752
You came highly recommended.
Scott Chandler.

115
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:33,540
- Welcome to the gallery.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

116
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,632
Can I get you something to drink?

117
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:36,865
Coffee, water,

118
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,695
scotch and soda?

119
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:40,075
I'm fine.

120
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,883
Right this way.

121
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:46,219
Quite the résumé.

122
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,347
Wall Street, Silicon Valley, D.C.

123
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,772
Any place where a little information
goes a long way,

124
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:52,372
I've been there to protect it.

125
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:53,702
Any PI experience?

126
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:57,022
A PI license comes with
a lot of privacy concerns.

127
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,275
There's a chance anything a PI finds
could wind up in court.

128
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:03,752
Yeah, well, I prefer to resolve this
quickly and quietly as possible.

129
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:07,162
Quick and quiet, that's what I do.
Tell me about your problem.

130
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:09,785
A few weeks ago, I noticed
unusual activity on the computers.

131
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,121
Files moved, log-ins at odd times.

132
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,569
And then I started hearing
a buzzing sound in my office phone.

133
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:18,419
- I checked it out.
- Infinity transmitter in its base.

134
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,379
I saw a lot of that in the dot-coms.

135
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,638
Whoever installed it
didn't isolate the circuit.

136
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:24,915
You were hearing a little feedback.

137
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,175
I want to know who planted this.

138
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:29,850
Any idea what they're looking for?

139
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:32,391
I sell about $30 million
worth of art a year.

140
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,622
They could be thieves,
buyers looking to lowball a bid,

141
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,646
other art dealers.
Too many possibilities.

142
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:39,732
My business, my reputation,

143
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:42,192
depends on information
remaing private.

144
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,527
Let's take a look.

145
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,382
Now, the gallery's under 24-hour
video surveillance.

146
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:48,555
You can't get through here
without someone seeing you.

147
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:50,788
What about the executive offices?

148
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:54,592
There's no cameras, but all the offices
are keypad-access only.

149
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:57,172
No one gets in here
without me knowing.

150
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:58,705
Well, somebody has.

151
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:01,378
Does anybody have
a habit of working late?

152
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:04,256
No later than I do.
I'm the first one in, last one out.

153
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,377
So, What do you think, Mr. Parker?
Think you can find whoever's doing this?

154
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,852
I'll see what I can do.
I need a floor plan of the office.

155
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,479
I'll have something by the end of today.
Excuse me.

156
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,565
<i>Alpha, it's Bravo, over.</i>

157
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:22,932
Hello, Seymour.

158
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:25,228
<i>Chalk one up
for the brotherhood of badass, buddy.</i>

159
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,961
<i>I got good news.
You got to get over here.</i>

160
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,828
I asked about that explosives guy
you were looking for.

161
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:38,916
He does demo for the city,
but he moonlights for the russian mob.

162
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:40,682
This is their hangout.

163
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:43,504
He's their go-to guy
when something's got to go boom.

164
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,631
- Any idea where he's hiding?
- No.

165
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:47,508
Seymour, you said you had good news.

166
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:50,933
No, I do. He's got a girlfriend.
And they're hot and heavy.

167
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:52,985
They can't be apart
for more than a couple of days

168
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:54,681
without some together time.
You know?

169
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,682
- I know what you're saying.
- I bet you do. You and Fi?

170
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:00,652
My god, a molten-hot action couple.

171
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,732
I can't even imagine what it must be
like in the bedroom. Just...

172
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,819
- Don't do that.
- Right? Am I right?

173
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,437
We're not together.

174
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,115
Are you serious?
Oh, my god. You guys were like the...

175
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:13,422
Bomber's girlfriend.
Stay focused.

176
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:14,655
There she is.

177
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:17,235
Don't point.

178
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,710
Bianca. She works here.
Her shift starts in like 10 minutes.

179
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:25,985
Nice work, Seymour.

180
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,346
The best part is,
my jackass bodyguard...

181
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:38,475
He's gonna put a tracker under her car
so you can follow her right to him.

182
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,562
He's gonna put a tracking device under
her car in front of the Russian mob?

183
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:44,940
But it's cool. I told him, just pretend
like he's tying his shoe...

184
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,864
He's gonna tip her off that someone's
watching. Keep your eyes on Bianca,

185
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:49,319
and no more moves on your own!

186
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:54,668
<i>To protect someone
without blowing your cover,</i>

187
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:58,246
<i>you have to come up with a story,
one that explains what they're doing,</i>

188
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,158
<i>explains what you're doing,</i>

189
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,332
<i>and gets everyone out in one piece.</i>

190
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,250
Hey, you forgot your keys!

191
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:06,105
Wait, my keys? No. What?

192
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:08,255
You forgot your keys
on my wife's dresser!

193
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:11,092
Yeah, that remind you?

194
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,801
<i>Of course, not everyone
is a born storyteller.</i>

195
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,555
- Go with it. Run.
- But Seymour said to plant a tracker.

196
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,815
And don't let me catch you
near my wife again!

197
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:32,701
I gotta tell you, this corporate
espionage stuff is kind of fun.

198
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:34,653
You know, there's no guns,
no explosions.

199
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:37,859
It's like going on the kiddie rides
at the carnival.

200
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,776
Any idea how our spy got his way
into the art dealer's office?

201
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,041
I know how I'd do it.

202
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,043
Cleaning crew comes around midnight

203
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,092
from the service entrance here,

204
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:49,652
away from the gallery cameras.

205
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:52,146
That's good, because then
there's no door codes either

206
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:54,049
'cause the cleaning crew
opens them for you.

207
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,553
Get in, find a hiding place,
let everyone clear out.

208
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,871
And you get the place to yourself.

209
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:06,362
As stimulating as all this is,

210
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:08,815
I still don't see why
you called me over here, Michael.

211
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:11,151
It always helps to bounce ideas, Fi.

212
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,033
I'm gonna grab another beer.

213
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:20,855
And drink it on the balcony.

214
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,925
Is this about the other night?

215
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,422
Is this about me
not staying for breakfast?

216
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:36,468
Is it so strange that I would want
your opinion on a job?

217
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,972
Look me in the eye
and tell me that's all this is.

218
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,520
I have to go see Chandler.

219
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,522
You think he came in
with the cleaning crew.

220
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,044
I can't believe I was so stupid.

221
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:01,282
Whoever did this didn't come
through the gallery.

222
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:04,642
There's a chance the parking-lot cameras
got him at the service entrance.

223
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:08,417
I'll call the property manager, set up
a time for you to stop by their office.

224
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,572
You really think
sweeping my office is necessary?

225
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:14,022
I don't think a phone bug
was the only thing your spy left you.

226
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:18,355
Well, I've got dinner with a client.
You let me know if you find something.

227
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:21,932
<i>A bug, in its simplest form,</i>

228
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,932
<i>is just a microphone
attached to a radio.</i>

229
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:28,395
<i>Effective but easy to detect
with a frequency scanner.</i>

230
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:38,030
<i>A more subtle device
is the wireless keylogger circuit.</i>

231
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,298
<i>Nearly undetectable
and easy to install,</i>

232
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:43,201
<i>it transmits every password
you type into the keyboard.</i>

233
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:47,432
<i>All surveillance devices, though,
share a weakness.</i>

234
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:48,752
<i>They're machines.</i>

235
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:51,212
<i>When machines break,
somebody has to fix them.</i>

236
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:55,011
<i>More spies get caught
changing batteries and fixing wires</i>

237
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,144
<i>than any other single activity.</i>

238
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,092
Mr. Chandler.

239
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:02,804
I'm gonna need to work late tonight.

240
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,298
Mr. Parker.

241
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,212
You're the receptionist here, right?
What is it?

242
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,932
- Melanie.
- Melanie. Right.

243
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:37,565
- We need to have a conversation.
- Okay.

244
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:40,384
I know this looks crazy, but...

245
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:41,845
I can explain.

246
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:55,892
Melanie, stop. Stop.

247
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,069
Whatever you're up to, it's not worth
stabbing me with a letter opener.

248
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:00,715
Don't tell Chandler!

249
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:03,212
- He'll kill me.
- Chandler?

250
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:05,492
That sounds a little hardcore
for an art dealer.

251
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,485
No, you don't understand.

252
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,287
He killed my father.

253
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,423
My father was JD Blake.

254
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:21,785
The painter?

255
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:24,344
How 'bout that?

256
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,802
Veronica was really into pop art.

257
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:30,725
You could stand getting out
to a few museums every so often, Mike.

258
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,811
Chandler was his art dealer.

259
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:36,275
Trouble started over a painting
called "Lady in White."

260
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:40,652
Bids of like $5 million, $7 million were
coming in before he even finished it.

261
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,113
My dad's health was failing,

262
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:45,699
but Chandler just kept
pressuring him to finish it.

263
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:48,285
Dad got sick of it, said that
he was gonna get a new dealer.

264
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:50,352
That probably stung Chandler
pretty good.

265
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:53,462
The commission on $7 million...
That's a lot of money.

266
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:54,795
One month later,

267
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,385
someone broke into my dad's loft,

268
00:13:57,782 --> 00:13:59,132
beat him to death,

269
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:01,298
and burned down his studio.

270
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:04,222
"Lady in White"
was reported destroyed.

271
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:06,303
The cops called it
a burglary gone bad.

272
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,096
You think Chandler was behind it?

273
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:12,100
And he never put it together
that you're JD Blake's daughter?

274
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,525
I grew up with my mom in New York.

275
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,314
I didn't even know who my dad was
until about a year ago.

276
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,733
We talked on the phone
for a couple of months.

277
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:22,195
I never got to meet him in person.

278
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:25,402
When I heard that "Lady in White"
was being moved on the black market,

279
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:27,824
I came down
and got a job with Chandler.

280
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,665
I like your heart, but, you know,
that painting could be anywhere.

281
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,675
You get caught looking for it,
you're dead.

282
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:35,175
I got to prove
that Chandler's involved.

283
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:39,336
His security's good. I thought that
I'd get him with that keylogger thing,

284
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,102
but I need more access to his files.

285
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:44,808
Melanie, I'm supposed to check
the security footage

286
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:46,801
from the service entrance tomorrow,

287
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:48,822
the same one you used.

288
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,205
You told him?

289
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:51,737
Look, if he sees me...

290
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,518
I'll make sure he doesn't,
provided your story checks out.

291
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,229
My story?

292
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:01,149
Don't worry about it.
We'll check into it.

293
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,222
Looks like Melanie
was telling the truth.

294
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:23,046
Had to pull a few favors,
but I was able to get my hands on that.

295
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,493
An apartment lease from 1985.

296
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:29,192
Check that out.

297
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,138
JD Blake's signature
right next to Melanie's mom's.

298
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,102
Little loft in Soho.
The math adds up, Mike.

299
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,143
- She's his daughter.
- All right.

300
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:39,554
Give her a call,
tell her I'll help her out.

301
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,648
But tell Melanie
she has to stop spying.

302
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,265
I'll handle it.

303
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,404
<i>To make a magnet powerful enough
to wipe a security camera tape,</i>

304
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,402
<i>you need a strong power supply.</i>

305
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:52,712
<i>A wall outlet will do nicely
if there's one available,</i>

306
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:56,628
<i>but if you need something more portable,
a car battery works in a pinch.</i>

307
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,531
<i>Of course, you have to be careful
to use a heavy-gauge wire</i>

308
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:04,452
<i>if you don't want a fiery explosion
that covers you in battery acid.</i>

309
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,753
<i>But do it right
and you've got a magnet</i>

310
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,473
<i>powerful enough to wipe
any magnetic media</i>

311
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:10,958
<i>you can manage to get close to.</i>

312
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,312
Mr. Chandler said you were coming by.
He had a break-in?

313
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:14,482
Something like that.

314
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:17,202
We keep all the footage backed up
on the hard drive there.

315
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:19,062
Should go back about six months.

316
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,712
If you can lay off just the last
few weeks to DVD, I can go through them.

317
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:26,245
Sure. Or I can do VHS,
not that anybody has those anymore.

318
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,117
That's...

319
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:37,245
- Not coming up.
- What? What's wrong? How do you mean?

320
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,418
It's not possible.
The drives... They're wiped.

321
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:45,605
The footage... It's all gone.

322
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:48,297
I better tell Chandler about this
right now.

323
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:52,062
You got a serious problem, much more
serious than you led me to believe.

324
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,312
- Now, I need to know...
- Slow down. Just...

325
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:57,515
You're saying the footage was erased.
Could it be a screwup in the machine?

326
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,643
I know how it looks
when a machine screws up,

327
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,354
and I know how it looks
when someone is erasing their tracks.

328
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,481
I mean, how could anyone
possibly do that?

329
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,399
A crooked security guard, a hacker.

330
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:08,758
For all I know,
it could have been some guy

331
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,127
walking in with an electromagnet.

332
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,615
The point is he's a professional.

333
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,542
You're the security expert.
What do I do?

334
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,249
I got to start with your computers.
I got to go through everything.

335
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:21,282
I got to see if your systems
have been breached.

336
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,662
My computer files? No, no.
That's private information.

337
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:27,462
Do you want me to find this guy
with one hand tied behind my back?

338
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,943
I mean, are you hoping
he walks through that door,

339
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:33,176
stands in front of you,
and says, "Hi, I'm your spy"?

340
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,962
Call me when you're serious.

341
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:38,973
<i>When you're playing
the role of spy hunter</i>

342
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,232
<i>and the person you're hunting
is yourself,</i>

343
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:44,362
<i>the trail of evidence can lead
anywhere you say it does.</i>

344
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:45,445
Wait!

345
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,236
You really think access to the computers
will help you find him?

346
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,682
<i>And no one can create more fear,</i>

347
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,192
<i>more paranoia, than the spy hunter.</i>

348
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,232
I hope so, but I'm gonna be
honest with you.

349
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,245
When you're dealing
with someone this good,

350
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,539
it could get a lot worse
before it gets better.

351
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:09,995
So, I gave Chandler's encrypted files
a deep-tissue massage.

352
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,757
- We got his whole life here.
- Anything about "the Lady in White"?

353
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,751
If he has it, he hasn't moved it yet,
'cause there's no big cash movements,

354
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,502
and he hasn't been doing
much offshore.

355
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:19,848
- There's got to be something.
- Oh, there's something.

356
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:21,892
The week Melanie's dad died,

357
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,207
Chandler's calendar had
a bunch of blank spots.

358
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,782
So I cross-referenced that with
the phone records, came up with a guy.

359
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,817
Jacob Orr,
a so-called security consultant.

360
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:32,702
He did a stint for manslaughter.

361
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:35,155
- Chandler's wet-work guy.
- If I'm a betting man.

362
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:37,662
You want to make a new friend?
You can take Fi.

363
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:40,535
Oh, boy. You sure know
how to sweeten the pot, Mike.

364
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:43,475
Speaking of Fi,

365
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,724
what was that whole business
at the loft,

366
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:47,857
you know, with the weird energy?

367
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:50,628
Oh, no, Mike.

368
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,575
Tell me you didn't.

369
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,841
You did, didn't you?
You did!

370
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,209
What? No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

371
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,148
How many times do you have
to touch the flame

372
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:02,646
- until you figure out that it burns?
- You gonna help with the job or not?

373
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,801
Of course, but I object to the fact
that you wanted me to work with her

374
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:08,146
without telling me that
you were doing a little booty call.

375
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,119
Check!

376
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:22,855
That's our boy.

377
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,625
Bigger in person.

378
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:27,755
Recently divorced.
Lives here at the hotel.

379
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,620
Spends a good chunk of his time
bouncing in and out of rehab.

380
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:37,445
Looks like he's ready
for another visit.

381
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,902
You sure you're up for this?

382
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:41,935
Planting a bug in a cellphone?

383
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,462
You think I can't get a guy
to go up to his room?

384
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:47,477
No, I'd say you have a gift
for getting men to make bad choices.

385
00:19:48,315 --> 00:19:50,730
- Michael told you.
- He didn't have to.

386
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,608
Well, don't look at me.
He started it.

387
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:56,653
Fi, Mr. Orr is waiting.

388
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:03,372
<i>For a female operative,</i>

389
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,432
<i>picking a guy up at a bar
is harder than it might seem.</i>

390
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:09,965
<i>Most men have a sense
for when a pickup is going too well.</i>

391
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,482
<i>If it's too easy,
they get suspicious.</i>

392
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:14,504
<i>If it's too hard, they move on.</i>

393
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:17,115
Are you serious?

394
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,716
My ex was from Morristown.

395
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:19,895
Your ex?

396
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:21,886
That means your single now.

397
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:25,682
Now, that's a leading question.

398
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,305
How's about I buy you another drink?

399
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:31,641
- I really shouldn't.
- You should.

400
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,341
Or I could make you
a drink in my room.

401
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:41,044
<i>Once an operative
has a guy on the hook,</i>

402
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:44,377
<i>she needs backup to make sure
things don't go too far.</i>

403
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,277
<i>The proper sedative for cocktail hour
ensures an early evening.</i>

404
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:54,913
<i>Chloral hydrate is a mild
but effective choice.</i>

405
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:03,345
- <i>It'll do the trick...</i>
- After.

406
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:06,735
<i>But only if the target's
interested in drinking it.</i>

407
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:13,354
What are you doing?

408
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,892
<i>If he's not, you have to induce
unconsciousness some other way.</i>

409
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,484
Not with this shirt on.

410
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:22,238
I want to see these big muscles.

411
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:38,254
You got somebody outside?
You set me up, bitch?

412
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:53,225
Come on.

413
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:00,305
What?

414
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:10,115
Where's Michael?

415
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:12,692
- Make yourself right at home.
- Where is he?

416
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:15,280
He's out getting some yogurt.
Why? What's going on?

417
00:22:15,363 --> 00:22:17,293
That security footage
he erased with the magnet,

418
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,837
Chandler paid to have the drives
sent out to be rebuilt!

419
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,022
Okay, relax. That'll take a while.

420
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:24,687
Reconstructing data stripped off
a hard drive is kind of like

421
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,637
putting a shredded document
back together again, only different.

422
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,162
We're running out of time.
By the time he's done, I'm dead!

423
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:31,349
We're getting close.

424
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,273
Chandler hired a guy
to do his dirty work.

425
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:35,892
We put a bug in his phone.
This is what we heard.

426
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:38,092
<i>I'm telling you, Chandler.
The bitch attacked me.</i>

427
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:40,762
- <i>She had backup.</i>
- <i>It was probably just a robbery.</i>

428
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,912
<i>A two-man team to steal $40?</i>

429
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,732
<i>I'm serious. If somebody found out
about the holding company...</i>

430
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:48,552
<i>Look, I've got all that stuff
locked up in my office. Just relax.</i>

431
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,482
<i>I'll relax when I got my money.</i>

432
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:52,912
So, sounds like they set up
a holding company

433
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:55,581
to deal with the dirty money
once they sell the painting.

434
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,822
So, if we can link these documents
up connecting the two of them,

435
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:01,802
- that's enough to take to the cops.
- How are we gonna get them, though?

436
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:04,325
Chandler, he doesn't even let
the cleaning crew in anymore.

437
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:07,845
I think it's time for Chandler's spy
to be more aggressive.

438
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:09,678
I mean Mike, not you.

439
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:16,265
- Miles.
- What the hell did you get me into?

440
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:18,345
What are you talking about? What?

441
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:20,754
They broke into my home.

442
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:24,292
- Where I sleep, where I live.
- What?

443
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,974
- You sure it wasn't...
- No, no.

444
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:28,232
Maybe the lock
on the door broke itself.

445
00:23:28,315 --> 00:23:31,159
Maybe my files
threw themselves around!

446
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,461
- Of course I'm sure.
- Was there anything taken?

447
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:36,782
- Did he find anything?
- No. All the files are encrypted.

448
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:40,126
They're kept off-site.
I talked to people in the neighborhood.

449
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,296
They said they saw a man and a woman.
It was a two-person team.

450
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,342
What? What is it?

451
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:52,662
A business associate of mine,
he was...

452
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:54,195
He was approached the same way.

453
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,987
And you didn't tell me?
Maybe I'm not being clear.

454
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,188
I need to know everything
that is going on!

455
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:02,065
Because now I'm involved.

456
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,125
Whoever this guy is,

457
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,390
he's got resources, training.

458
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:09,662
- What kind of person could be...
- It could be anybody.

459
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:11,874
Some spy gets blacklisted,
goes freelance,

460
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:14,065
he could stand in front of you,
you wouldn't know it.

461
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:15,148
Jesus.

462
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:19,790
I need to know what he's after.

463
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:21,334
You have a mistress?

464
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,892
Fudge your tax records?

465
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,463
Steal a pack of gum in the sixth grade?
You have to tell me!

466
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:28,508
It's the only way I can protect you,
protect us.

467
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:33,815
- No. There's nothing. I don't have...
- Nothing.

468
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:41,292
I'm gonna need to upgrade your system.
I'm gonna lock down your office.

469
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:45,274
I need access to the camera feeds,
the security codes, and the alarms.

470
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:48,545
You're gonna have to trust me.

471
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:51,030
You with me?

472
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:04,544
Okay, Mikey, the feeds are up.

473
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,900
You sure you have to go
through the gallery?

474
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:09,966
Chandler's checking
the service-entrance cameras.

475
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,605
I don't have much of a choice.

476
00:25:11,688 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm at the west entrance of the gallery.
Tell me when to go.

477
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:18,349
Okay, you are clear to get
to the first column...

478
00:25:19,973 --> 00:25:20,685
Now.

479
00:25:23,715 --> 00:25:26,292
<i>Okay, now, there's a camera
on the other side of that column,</i>

480
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,342
<i>and it's sweeping
the north end of the gallery.</i>

481
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:31,195
So, on my cue,
I want you to go to the left.

482
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:32,975
Left?

483
00:25:33,414 --> 00:25:34,202
You sure?

484
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:36,909
Yeah, Mike, who's the guy looking
at the camera here? Yeah, I'm sure.

485
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,786
<i>You're fine.
The cameras are moving.</i>

486
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:40,913
<i>Moving.</i>

487
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:43,791
Here we go. 3, 2, 1...

488
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:47,378
No, no, that's my left! My left.
Your right. Stop, stop. Sorry.

489
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:49,573
Okay, let's try this again.

490
00:25:50,054 --> 00:25:51,924
I want you to go to your left.

491
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:53,165
<i>3...</i>

492
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:54,302
<i>2...</i>

493
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,469
<i>1...</i>

494
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,691
- <i>Go.</i>
- <i>When it comes to security,</i>

495
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,121
<i>the difference between
a spy and a regular thief</i>

496
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:03,853
<i>is that a thief gets to take
what he wants and run.</i>

497
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,132
<i>A spy has to go back
to the scene of the crime the next day</i>

498
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,102
<i>and act like nothing happened.</i>

499
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:11,935
<i>It makes the approach
a little more delicate.</i>

500
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,992
- <i>How's it going in there?</i>
- Yeah, there's nothing here

501
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,525
but certificates of authenticity
for paintings and artwork.

502
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:20,685
It's got to be here somewhere.

503
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:24,245
<i>When you're a spy,
you spend a lot of time</i>

504
00:26:24,328 --> 00:26:26,000
<i>looking for people's hiding places.</i>

505
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:30,379
<i>It's always good to start by searching
where the target has the easiest access.</i>

506
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,082
<i>Of course,</i>

507
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:36,510
<i>smart targets don't always hide things
where they have the easiest access.</i>

508
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,342
<i>After that,
the search gets a little more subtle.</i>

509
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:41,530
<i>You look for signs
of moved furniture,</i>

510
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:44,300
<i>marks on the carpet,
scuffs on the walls.</i>

511
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:50,924
<i>Anything out of place.</i>

512
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,129
I found where he's hiding the papers,
but it's an armored file cabinet.

513
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,012
<i>That's no sweat. We'll come back
with a cutting torch and call it a day.</i>

514
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:18,259
Yeah, a torch would burn the documents.
I need something more specialized,

515
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:21,222
like a diamond-tipped drill bit
with a cooling system.

516
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,267
<i>That sounds like a doozy.</i>

517
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:27,006
<i>Look, I can make some calls,
but it's gonna take a couple days.</i>

518
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:28,339
Let's get on it.

519
00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:31,610
Melanie, we're making progress.

520
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,776
We should have everything we need
in a couple of days.

521
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,482
- You just need to sit tight.
- Sit tight?

522
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:38,155
Chandler is acting weird.

523
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,500
He's walking around the office,
staring at all the employees,

524
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,865
checking people's desks.

525
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:44,975
That means he's getting paranoid.
That's good.

526
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:47,623
The worse it gets,
the more he turns to Michael for help.

527
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:49,750
- What if he knows?
- There's no way he rebuilt

528
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,882
the security footage
from those hard drives yet.

529
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:54,772
The most important thing is for you
to just act completely normal.

530
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:56,632
Pretend that nothing's going on.

531
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:57,508
I'll try.

532
00:27:58,022 --> 00:28:00,672
I got to run.
It's nice meeting you, Fiona.

533
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:01,554
You too.

534
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:08,727
You know, pretending nothing's going on
is easier for some people than others.

535
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,722
- What have you got, Seymour?
- <i>I'll show you what I got.</i>

536
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:19,655
<i>Tell Fiona to fire up the Saab, dude.
We're gonna need room for three.</i>

537
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:25,619
Your bomber is holed up
in that little cottage right there.

538
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:29,155
His girlfriend went over
this morning for a little...

539
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,235
Together time.

540
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:43,992
Booby trap on the door.

541
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:45,931
I guess he's not expecting
any more visitors.

542
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:48,755
That's no problem.

543
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:51,437
I got the shotguns
and those breaching rounds I brought.

544
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,731
They'll cut through that wall
like it's cardboard.

545
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:56,901
That would make a little bigger bang
than we want.

546
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:59,802
The door isn't the only thing
rigged to blow.

547
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:00,885
Look.

548
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:06,045
I'm gonna do some scouting, figure out
a better route for an approach.

549
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:13,225
Man.

550
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:14,655
That guy.

551
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:18,089
I mean, it's like he sees
around corners, you know?

552
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:22,015
So, what's up with you two?

553
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:24,315
You're not together anymore?

554
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:28,845
We're in...

555
00:29:29,615 --> 00:29:31,435
different spaces, Seymour.

556
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:33,532
Different spaces?

557
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:34,865
Give me a break.

558
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:38,651
As a practitioner of tai chi,
let me tell you something, missy.

559
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:42,158
Go with the flow
of the universe, all right?

560
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:44,365
It's destiny, you two.

561
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:46,367
Forces bigger than us.

562
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,182
Don't argue with destiny.

563
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:49,815
It will kick your ass.

564
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,035
Believe me.

565
00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,975
I'll keep that in mind, Seymour.

566
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:10,599
I can drink this outside
if you two need some alone time.

567
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,520
- Drink it here, Sam.
- So,

568
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:17,075
Seymour find your bomber?

569
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:19,719
The place he's staying at
is wired to blow

570
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:21,402
if we so much
as knock on the window.

571
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,762
Yikes.
Well, in other news,

572
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:27,142
I got a lead on a precision drill
we can use on Chandler's file cabinet.

573
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,175
Buddy's gonna give us a break.

574
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,592
- Yeah, Melanie, what's going on?
- I'm at the office.

575
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:35,702
- I found something.
- You're at the office?

576
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:38,131
- You're not supposed...
- I was talking to a friend from work.

577
00:30:38,214 --> 00:30:41,216
She told me that Chandler's secretary
was shredding, like, a ton of paperwork.

578
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,602
But get this...
The secretary didn't finish.

579
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:47,292
She left a ton of paperwork for monday,
so I've been going through the files...

580
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,192
You're at the office on a weekend?

581
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:52,475
If you used your employee security code,
Chandler will know you're there.

582
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,033
What else was I supposed to do?

583
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:56,103
This stuff could be gone,
and we'll never know.

584
00:30:56,271 --> 00:31:00,149
He's not gonna just leave documents
lying around for someone to find.

585
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,401
- What do you mean?
- It's a trap.

586
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:05,154
He knows you're there.
You need to get out right now.

587
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:09,825
Oh, my god.

588
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:12,465
Oh, my god. He's here.

589
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:17,077
Melanie, listen to me
very carefully.

590
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,502
- Are you in the copy room?
- Yeah, I am.

591
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:22,546
Get a box of paper, some duct tape,
and an extension cord.

592
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:24,924
Some duct tape
and an extension cord?

593
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:28,385
Tape the cellphone to the top of the box
and run a wire behind it,

594
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:30,322
and put it in the gallery entrance.

595
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:31,722
Do it now. I'm on my way.

596
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:33,933
- You got explosives?
- I'll pretend you didn't ask.

597
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,072
I've to take a more direct approach
with Chandler.

598
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:38,522
- I like the sound of that.
- You want me to come with you?

599
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,855
No, I want you to get in touch
with Chandler's hit man.

600
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,152
<i>It's Miles Parker. Where are you?</i>

601
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:54,298
I'm at the gallery.

602
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:56,141
<i>Are you all right?
Did they come after you?</i>

603
00:31:56,224 --> 00:31:57,522
What are you talking about?

604
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:00,292
Listen, it's over. I shredded
some files at the office today.

605
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,878
Figured whoever's behind this
might go after them. I was right.

606
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:06,019
Someone came in today
using an employee security code.

607
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,175
What's so funny?

608
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,482
You don't get it.
They tried to kill me.

609
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:13,542
You think the spy who's doing
all of this would be stupid enough

610
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,809
to come by your office
and use a security code on the weekend?

611
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:18,795
<i>It's a trap, Chandler.</i>

612
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,195
Trap? What?

613
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,289
If you want to take
another breath on this Earth,

614
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:24,906
do not go inside.
I'll be right there.

615
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:27,402
There was a bomb
wired to my front door.

616
00:32:27,485 --> 00:32:29,917
It was just dumb luck I saw it
through my living-room window.

617
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,352
- You're serious.
- Do I look like I'm joking?

618
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:35,411
There it is right there.
The top of the box is a detonator.

619
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,412
It's wired to the doors.
If you had gone inside,

620
00:32:38,495 --> 00:32:41,208
they'd be picking up little pieces
of you from the gallery floor.

621
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:44,802
Look, this is your last chance.
You tell me what this guy is after,

622
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:46,982
or I walk away
and you handle this alone.

623
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,215
It's about a painting, all right?

624
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:51,010
It's about a painting.

625
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,173
- What painting?
- It's called "the Lady in White."

626
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:55,846
I've been trying to move it on the black
market. It's worth $7 million.

627
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:58,111
- I think that's what he wants.
- Genius.

628
00:32:58,194 --> 00:33:01,604
What do you think is cheaper for him,
paying $7 million or having us killed?

629
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:03,188
What are we gonna do?

630
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,150
We need to trade the painting
for our lives. Where is it?

631
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,735
Let's just get out of here
and we can figure this out.

632
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:13,927
<i>When you're playing the spy hunter,</i>

633
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,126
<i>the goal is to get the target
to trust you completely,</i>

634
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:20,090
<i>to think of you as his only ally.</i>

635
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,385
<i>Convince him that
he's on the brink of disaster...</i>

636
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:36,332
- Where's that painting, Chandler?
- It's at my house!

637
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,765
It's at my house!

638
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,016
<i>And he'll tell you
whatever you want him to.</i>

639
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:58,077
Careful now.

640
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,954
Last time I saw you, you got your ass
kicked by a girl smaller than her.

641
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,331
You son of a bitch.

642
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,542
- God!
- Now, now.

643
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,060
No need for name-calling.
Feel that?

644
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:10,632
Feel your thumb go
snap, crackle, pop?

645
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,299
Okay, looky here.

646
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:15,332
This is what I didn't put in your scotch
when you went to take a leak.

647
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:16,665
That's arsenic.

648
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:20,099
- Who do you think gave that to me?
- Who in the hell are you?

649
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:21,802
My name is Finley.

650
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:24,395
Now, your buddy Chandler
hired me and my partner to kill you.

651
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:26,814
If the hotel security
hadn't come by,

652
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,245
- you'd be in a morgue right now.
- Chandler?

653
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:34,042
Something about selling a painting,
cutting you out of the deal.

654
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,722
Anyway, I'm only getting
$10,000 to hit you.

655
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:39,316
A lousy 10 g's
and that guy's pocketing millions?

656
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,037
And I said to myself,
"that's not fair".

657
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,508
What do you want me to do?

658
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,742
I tell you where
he's off-loading the painting,

659
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:48,675
you cut me in on the action.

660
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:52,756
If not, we can go back to plan A.
10,000 bucks is better than nothing.

661
00:34:57,855 --> 00:34:59,205
Where is Chandler?

662
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:01,098
You think he's been here?

663
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,552
Hopefully, he thinks he killed you
when the car blew.

664
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,561
What, this...
this "the Lady in White"?

665
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,563
No, it's underneath.
Give me a hand.

666
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:11,728
Here. Here it is.

667
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,488
So now we make a deal.
How are we gonna find this guy?

668
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:18,866
- He's already here.
- You?

669
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:27,124
That's the thing about spies.
You never know who they are.

670
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:34,272
Sam, how'd it go with Orr?

671
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:38,005
<i>He'll be there any minute.
You better get out of there, Mikey.</i>

672
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:42,252
What are you doing here?

673
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:45,585
<i>One of the problems
with running a criminal conspiracy</i>

674
00:35:45,805 --> 00:35:49,222
<i>is that there's no real way to avoid
trust issues with your co-workers.</i>

675
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:51,532
- Where's the painting?
- He took it.

676
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,665
- Yeah? Who took it?
- The spy!

677
00:35:54,295 --> 00:35:56,862
He was here and he took it,
then he... he hit me.

678
00:35:56,945 --> 00:35:59,672
<i>If you steal with a guy,
he knows you're a thief.</i>

679
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:00,755
The spy?

680
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:02,845
The spy took it?

681
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,798
You rip me off, you try to kill me,

682
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:10,000
and you can't come up
with anything better than that?

683
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,832
I swear to God.
Please, I swear to you.

684
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:14,379
<i>If you kill with him,
he knows you're a killer.</i>

685
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:15,635
Last chance.

686
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:18,759
- Where is it?
- No, the spy, he took it!

687
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,832
The spy! A spy took it!

688
00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:24,785
<i>It's a serious management issue.</i>

689
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:29,292
You don't have to worry
about Chandler anymore.

690
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:32,022
His partner just got arrested trying
to dump his body in the Miami river.

691
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:35,575
I really don't know
how to thank you guys.

692
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:36,632
I...

693
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:37,945
... brought some cash.

694
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:43,325
Melanie, I'm pretty sure
you just lost your job, so...

695
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:46,168
My dad left most of his estate
to an art school,

696
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:47,913
but he left me a little bit.

697
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:50,958
Trust me, it's cool.

698
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:55,337
And I'm not sure if you're really into
this sort of thing, but...

699
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:59,295
My dad painted this
the year I was born.

700
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:01,385
It's always been
one of my favorites.

701
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:03,285
I want you to have it.

702
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:06,145
Thank you.

703
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:11,353
- Thanks again.
- Take care.

704
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,400
Do me a favor?
Drop this off at the loft.

705
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:19,736
I have to go kidnap
an explosives expert.

706
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:21,196
Good luck with that.

707
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,225
The shotguns you requested?

708
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:29,325
Modified them myself.

709
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,888
You're sure
you don't want me to come,

710
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:36,321
- help you guys out, back you up?
- We're fine, Seymour.

711
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:37,705
Godspeed.

712
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:41,101
Those are...
They're loaded with the...

713
00:37:41,765 --> 00:37:44,600
Shells that I made
specifically for this job.

714
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,685
<i>Favored by bomb squads,</i>

715
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:03,780
<i>disrupter shells are
a specially designed shotgun round</i>

716
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,157
<i>filled with water.</i>

717
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,471
<i>The blast can blow
an explosive device apart</i>

718
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:10,235
<i>without igniting it.</i>

719
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:13,502
<i>The shells are only lethal
up to about 6 feet.</i>

720
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:15,751
<i>At 10 feet, they just hurt a lot.</i>

721
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:25,462
Recognize me?

722
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:27,972
Yeah. You're the guy
that lives over the club.

723
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,764
Listen,

724
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:31,825
I work for hire.
It was nothing personal.

725
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:35,222
You want some of this?

726
00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:37,314
Because I made it special,
just for you.

727
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:40,317
Seymour, I don't think we need that.
What do you say, Derek?

728
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,783
Answer my questions,

729
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,482
and I'll get you and your girlfriend
out of the country. Deal?

730
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:49,368
All right.

731
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:50,994
Who hired you to kill me?

732
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:52,388
I don't know.

733
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:54,789
Okay, Mike, look, I know
you're the professional here,

734
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:56,500
but I really think a little...

735
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:58,846
Listen, I never met the guy before!

736
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:00,902
He just gave me your address,
and I did the job!

737
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:02,535
How did they pay you?

738
00:39:04,705 --> 00:39:07,342
Transferred 100 grand
to an account in the Caymans.

739
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,275
You have the account number?

740
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:11,431
7-5-9...

741
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:13,915
7-5-9...

742
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:16,186
7-5-9...

743
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,146
5-1-6...

744
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:19,522
Hold on.

745
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:21,475
Go ahead.

746
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,442
5-1-6...

747
00:39:22,744 --> 00:39:23,485
5-1-6...

748
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:28,407
3-0-0-3.

749
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,450
3-0-0-3.

750
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,869
He had me memorize it.

751
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:35,182
That's all I know.

752
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:38,083
Seymour, you have any gun shipments
heading out to Suriname?

753
00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:40,627
Suriname?
Every other week.

754
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:44,172
Wait, wait, wait.
Suriname?

755
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,232
- Come on, man!
- Out of the country. A deal's a deal.

756
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:50,803
- It's a beautiful place.
- I don't even know where that is!

757
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:54,216
That was quick.

758
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:57,095
I got the account number used by the man
who hired Poole to kill me.

759
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:59,022
I just need to turn it into a name.

760
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,355
Hey, I'm sorry!

761
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,815
I almost forgot.

762
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,484
Here.

763
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:06,705
It's a little...

764
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:10,145
It's a little something
I had made for...

765
00:40:10,715 --> 00:40:13,865
Well, it's in honor
of our first operation together.

766
00:40:14,775 --> 00:40:15,829
Go on, open them.

767
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:23,003
Matching throwing daggers.

768
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,465
That's...

769
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:27,204
very thoughtful of you, Seymour.

770
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:29,737
And if you look,
the engraving there...

771
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:31,335
means "Destiny".

772
00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:36,098
It's a symbol of your bond.

773
00:40:38,455 --> 00:40:40,005
Of our bond, actually.

774
00:40:41,335 --> 00:40:43,185
I made one for myself, too.

775
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:49,832
Well, I better get back, you know?

776
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:53,465
Don't want to leave jackass alone
too long with the captive.

777
00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:00,284
That is... kinda sweet.

778
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:04,685
You know, the morning after we....

779
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:06,645
Yeah.

780
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:10,635
I brought you a spanish omelet,
egg-white only,

781
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:12,745
but you were gone.

782
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,489
My favorite.

783
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:19,034
Maybe next time I'll have to stay.
