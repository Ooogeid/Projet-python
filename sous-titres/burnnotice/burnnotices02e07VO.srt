1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:03,896
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:07,177
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:12,265
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,812
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,269
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:19,314
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,609
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:25,570
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,448
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

10
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,825
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,035
Family, too...

12
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,244
Is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,329
If you're desperate.

14
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,455
Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,458
Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,045
you're not going anywhere.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,772
Your arms-dealer friend couldn't
just meet us at the Café Carlito?

18
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:51,054
He wanted to meet here.

19
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:53,227
I bought an assault rifle
from him last year.

20
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:54,474
He doesn't know you.

21
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:57,464
- Seymour has trust issues.
- I don't want to date him, Fi.

22
00:00:57,584 --> 00:00:59,765
I just want to find out
what the people who burned me

23
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:01,523
are doing with a Russian sniper rifle.

24
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:03,710
And Seymour's the perfect guy
to track it down.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,485
He's just a little... eccentric.

26
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:13,712
<i>When you work with people,</i>

27
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,767
<i>you want to know
everything about them...</i>

28
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:17,937
<i>their history, their associates,</i>

29
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:19,707
<i>who's contacting them.</i>

30
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:21,429
That Seymour?

31
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,228
- That... that Seymour?
- Oh, no. This guy I met.

32
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:27,923
He just asked me out.

33
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:31,886
<i>Although sometimes there are details
you'd rather not know.</i>

34
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:39,021
Fiona, baby,

35
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:40,979
good to see you.

36
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:43,515
Michael, right?

37
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,914
Hey, man. Heard a lot about you.

38
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,838
Come on. We're going for a walk.

39
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,160
Fiona,

40
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,036
keep Jackass company. He'll like you.
He's attracted to shiny objects.

41
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:00,123
So,

42
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:01,910
Fi tells me you want a gun.

43
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,991
Rifle, actually.

44
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:06,907
Well, I got plenty. What do you need?
I got semi, automatic, european.

45
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,848
- I need a Dragunov, actually.
- Wow. Yeah. Nice gun.

46
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:12,173
Of course, there are not too many
of them floating around.

47
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:15,184
- How about a nice Romanian PSL?
- No, I'm not looking to buy, Seymour...

48
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:16,556
Hold that thought.

49
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,474
I got business I got to attend to here.

50
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,018
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

51
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,197
Vladimir, right?

52
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:24,067
Pavel.

53
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,949
Anyway, you got my money?

54
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,029
I got to count it first.

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,996
So, what?

56
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:41,998
They don't teach arithmetic
in the Ukraine?

57
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:43,333
We're Bulgarian.

58
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,174
I don't even know
what you just said.

59
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:48,129
The deal was 100 grand, okay?
Not 50.

60
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:49,756
Are you trying to rip me off?

61
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,341
Nobody rips me off.

62
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,443
Wow. Fiona said you were a bad-ass.

63
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:59,891
- This is really none of my business.
- Well, it is now.

64
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:02,936
And this is the part
where we haul ass.

65
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:03,812
No, no.

66
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:05,772
Okay.

67
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:11,510
Michael, we'll talk later, okay?

68
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:15,615
Let's go, Jackass! Punch it, man!
They're shooting at us!

69
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,586
<i>If you're driving a sports coupe,</i>

70
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:31,667
<i>you're not going to be able to lose
an off-road vehicle off road.</i>

71
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:34,050
<i>Your best bet is
to get them on the road,</i>

72
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,552
<i>where you have the advantage.</i>

73
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,420
<i>It's less about speed than
it is about maneuverability.</i>

74
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:49,632
<i>You need to put yourself
in a position</i>

75
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:51,651
<i>where you can do something
that they can't.</i>

76
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:00,158
The <i>Subbers in Black</i> presents...

00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:01,035

79
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,847
Okay, then, what about
Gerda from East Berlin?

80
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:11,981
You remember her?

81
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,823
I wanted to invade the Soviet bloc
in 1983 just for her.

82
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,123
Hey, Mike.

83
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:22,950
You remember Virgil?

84
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,803
Mike.

85
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,065
I brought us some tall cool ones.

86
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,524
I seem to recall you promising
to stay out of Miami.

87
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,318
Last time I saw you,

88
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,820
there were people looking for you...
angry people with guns.

89
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:38,474
That's... That's all blown over.

90
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:41,451
I was planning on staying away, but...

91
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:43,061
He needs help, Mike.

92
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,871
Well, not for myself.

93
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:47,503
I had a partner
in the repo business,

94
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,013
a fella the name of Jay Flores.

95
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,576
He died several years back.

96
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:52,243
His daughter, Marcela,

97
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:54,893
runs a medical-relief agency in town.

98
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:57,762
They got hit hard.
Big shipment of medicine got ripped off.

99
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,928
Virgil's trying to track it down
and needs backup.

100
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:00,803
Backup?

101
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:02,712
I figured that was in your wheelhouse.

102
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:05,516
- She doesn't have anywhere else to turn.
- Can't hurt to talk to her.

103
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:07,997
Mm, it could. It could hurt a little.
Could hurt a lot.

104
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:08,853
Come on.

105
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:12,069
Gathering intel, lending tactical
support to a worthwhile mission.

106
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:16,188
I mean, this is our old gig, Mike.
This is why signed up back in the day.

107
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:18,905
Fine, I'll talk to her.

108
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:20,959
All right.

109
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,493
Oh, mind if I use your phone?
I need to call Madeline.

110
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:27,891
- Yeah, about that.
- Special lady.

111
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:31,074
There's a magnetic thing about her...
Irresistible.

112
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:33,895
She offered to put me up,
so I need to get on over th...

113
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:35,259
You'll stay here.

114
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,341
You tell her you can't make it and you'll
call her when you're back in the Bahamas.

115
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:44,089
Mike, you serious?

116
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:47,225
Last time you were in town,
you nearly got her killed.

117
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,353
That's not going to happen again.

118
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:54,148
Okay.

119
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:58,462
Mike, I'm telling you,
you're not gonna regret this.

120
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:00,741
Marcela's done great things
with this clinic.

121
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,658
They send medicine to kids in every
country of the world that has diseases.

122
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,496
Kick it, kick it!

123
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:10,719
Hey,

124
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,959
no ball on the sidewalk.

125
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:14,127
He started it.

126
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:16,169
I see you brought the cavalry.

127
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:21,551
Listen, if anyone can find
this stuff, it's these two.

128
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:22,927
We really need your help.

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,888
Well, why don't you start
by telling us what we're looking for.

130
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:29,096
We spent months on a fund-raiser
for kids in Rio.

131
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,936
Shipped nearly
$1 million worth of medicine.

132
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,859
Yesterday, an hour out of Miami,

133
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,275
these guys boarded the freighter,

134
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:38,415
took everything.

135
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,702
Well, unless they're starting
a medical clinic,

136
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:42,488
they're gonna want to sell this stuff.

137
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:45,194
Whatever this stuff is worth
on the black market,

138
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:47,744
it's nothing compared
to what it means to those kids.

139
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:51,289
- If you can bring it back...
- We'll see what we can do.

140
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:57,874
Thank you so much, Michael.

141
00:06:57,994 --> 00:06:59,996
I've been meaning to move
these out here for ages.

142
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:03,336
Any particular reason why
you had to do everything today?

143
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,661
Uh, just spring cleaning. You know.

144
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,930
So, have you heard from Virgil?

145
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:10,723
Virgil?

146
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:13,003
Yeah. He called and said that

147
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,595
he was coming into town
to see you and Sam.

148
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:18,158
You know Virgil...
just being Virgil.

149
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,161
I... Yeah, I got to...

150
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:25,118
Yeah?

151
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,325
Mikey, good news.
We got to head up to Boca.

152
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,398
Got a lead on a guy who deals
in black-market pharmaceuticals.

153
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,472
That could be our way in. I was thinking
we could head up there and check it out.

154
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:34,950
Just the two of us?

155
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:36,635
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:39,243
Virgil's gonna see some friends
while he's here in town.

157
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,213
Friends?

158
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:45,840
Yeah, I think it would be better
if I went with him to Boca.

159
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,008
Okay, sure. That's a good idea.

160
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:51,018
It would be good for you guys
to have some bonding time.

161
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,559
Listen, Virgil needs to
ask you just a little favor.

162
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:57,396
Listen, I didn't pack enough underwear,
so I borrowed

163
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:59,832
<i>a set of your boxers...
the blue ones with the stripes.</i>

164
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:03,069
They will never fit you.
Stay out of my closets.

165
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,809
They're a little snug down under,
but I got all packed in...

166
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,079
Appreciate it.

167
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,451
Mike, be glad you didn't
have to see that.

168
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:15,623
Someone staying in the loft?

169
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:18,718
Yeah, good old Sam, back in the loft.

170
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:21,629
You don't say.

171
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,172
Yeah. I'm gonna go, mom.

172
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:41,065
That store there...
It's owned by a guy named Feldman.

173
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,860
In the last few years, a bunch of ships
have been robbed the same way.

174
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,070
Thieves are in and out
in five minutes.

175
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,503
They like to hit
pharmaceutical shipments.

176
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:50,042
And this guy likes to buy them.

177
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,112
Hell, he's a one-man pharmacy.

178
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:56,205
He got caught some time ago for selling
vicodin taken off some boat in Naples.

179
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:59,959
Charged with receiving stolen property,
but his lawyer got him off.

180
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:02,837
Doing a pretty brisk business now,
it appears.

181
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,045
Michael, this thing
with your mama and me...

182
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:16,703
I know you're uncomfortable about...

183
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,312
I'm not uncomfortable.
You attract bullets. It's too risky.

184
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:21,480
Come on. What's a few bullets?

185
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:26,072
You know what? I've got enough here.
I'll run down to the photo store,

186
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,442
and then you and I can run in
and raise a little hell.

187
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:34,631
Can I help you?

188
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:40,374
My friend here is looking for a 5-iron.
Graphite shaft, nothing too heavy.

189
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:43,165
And $1 million worth
of high-grade pharmaceuticals

190
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,087
stolen off a freighter
a couple of days ago.

191
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:48,716
Excuse me? I sell golf equipment.
I don't know what you're talking about.

192
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:51,443
Really? I mean, this is
nice golf equipment.

193
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:53,679
But this store isn't paying
for that Porsche out back.

194
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,425
You are selling something else.

195
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:03,105
Would you look at this.

196
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:06,215
- Who are you? What is this?
- Quite a clientele.

197
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:08,444
Banker, superior-court judge.

198
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:12,322
We thought we'd mail everybody a copy
of their photo coming out of this store

199
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:14,116
in one of these lovely,
handsome frames.

200
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:16,452
All right, just stop.
This guy came by.

201
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,658
I sell viagra, vicodin,
and, and trancs.

202
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,333
What am I gonna do with
$1 million worth of antivirals?

203
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:23,694
Who is this guy, anyway?

204
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:25,711
His name's Gerard. He's a total psycho.

205
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:29,048
You are gonna call Gerard, and tell him
you have a buyer for his drugs.

206
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:32,176
No, no. That's insane.
I can't... I can't call him.

207
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:33,962
What will the neighbors think?

208
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:36,264
They've been living
next to a drug dealer!

209
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,808
- He seemed so nice.
- All right, all right.

210
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:44,272
- I'll get you a meeting.
- And...

211
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:47,182
- Throw in one of those shirts.
- Yeah, sure.

212
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:51,568
Well, it sounds like you and Virg made
some progress. You found our thief.

213
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,338
Yeah. I'm told he's a total psycho.

214
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,659
You know, this is the reason why
I don't look forward to Virgil's visits.

215
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,077
One of the reasons.

216
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:02,461
Listen, we're in the home stretch here.
We got to get medicine out in the open.

217
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:05,123
Look, I'll run point, okay?
I'll go in as a buyer.

218
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:08,087
- Fine. The sooner we get this done...
- I'm all over it, Mikey.

219
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:12,369
So, you gonna hook up with Fi's
arms-dealer friend? How's that going?

220
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:14,339
Yeah, another total psycho.

221
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:26,533
Seymour,

222
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:29,329
you might have mentioned
we were going to a gun buy.

223
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:32,277
That Jackass I call a bodyguard...
he's worthless.

224
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:35,489
So I figured you come along as backup,
and I'd know for sure you're not a cop.

225
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,628
See? Kill two birds, right?

226
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:41,738
- Whoa, whoa, what's this?
- You said you wanted a gun.

227
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:44,485
No, no, no. I wanted information
about a sniper rifle.

228
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:45,700
Oh, right.

229
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,293
The Dragunov.

230
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:51,005
I mean, I could maybe import one
from this guy in the Czech Republic.

231
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,133
No, I'm not looking to buy
a sniper rifle, Seymour.

232
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:58,043
I just need to track down a place
where someone can calibrate it.

233
00:12:00,623 --> 00:12:02,773
Do me a favor. Wave at that guy.

234
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:08,564
Uh, if I'm not mistaken, that's
one of the guys who shot at us.

235
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,317
He's bringing the rest of the money.
See? 50 g's.

236
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:12,486
Why wave at him?

237
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,987
I told him, you and me,
we don't have a beef with him anymore.

238
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:18,559
We... we, Seymour,
do not have a beef with him.

239
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,911
- You have a beef with him.
- Whatever. Look, look, here he comes.

240
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:25,122
And he's not bringing your money.
He has a gun.

241
00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:26,874
I'm not a part of this.

242
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:29,210
Damn it. I told him.
I talked to him.

243
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:48,187
<i>For certain kinds of criminals,</i>

244
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:51,090
<i>partying hard serves an
important management function.</i>

245
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:57,089
<i>You can keep your eye on
your employees during the off hours</i>

246
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,259
<i>and keep them spending money...</i>

247
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,160
<i>... so they're hungry
for the next score.</i>

248
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,550
- Scotch and soda.
- You Finley?

249
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,926
I am. You're Gerard?

250
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:21,118
Get out of here.

251
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:25,683
Yeah, Feldman said you'd be by.
He didn't tell me a whole hell of a lot.

252
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,561
- So, you're what, a gun dealer?
- I deal in everything...

253
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,178
Guns so people can shoot each other,

254
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,496
medicine to get them ready
for round two.

255
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:36,451
Even Somali warlords
need penicillin, my friend.

256
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:39,905
So, I hear you're in, uh, acquisitions.

257
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,066
Hostile takeovers.

258
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,829
I got a client breathing down
my neck for antivirals.

259
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,704
Feldman said you had
a shipment to spare.

260
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:50,410
Antivirals. That's bad timing.
I sold those a couple hours ago.

261
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,002
Well, that's a shame.

262
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:54,884
I assume they haven't
been delivered yet.

263
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:57,840
Maybe they can be unsold.
My client has deep pockets.

264
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,408
Deal's done. We deliver next week.

265
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:04,847
Excuse me a second.

266
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:09,414
Why don't you calm down and go
play with your boyfriend?

267
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,062
<i>Bar fights aren't just a way
to blow off steam.</i>

268
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,393
<i>They're a great way to showcase
your leadership skills,</i>

269
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:16,863
<i>and they're a team-building exercise.</i>

270
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,073
Watch it, there.

271
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,910
A broken bottle can hurt someone.

272
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:31,977
<i>There's also no better way
for someone new to get noticed.</i>

273
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:37,226
If this guy Gerard sold the medicine,
what can we do?

274
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:39,965
Maybe we could get the cops
to sting the buy.

275
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,301
Buyer shows up, cops swoop in.

276
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,314
We don't know when the delivery is.
And if the cops get involved,

277
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,306
Gerard might find out.
No, forget it.

278
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:51,684
Wait a minute.
I got an in with this guy.

279
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,277
We can use that to find out
where he's keeping this medicine.

280
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:55,773
We just need an inside man.

281
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:58,400
An inside man? What does that mean?

282
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:01,932
He wants me to join Gerard's crew

283
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:05,103
so I can find out where he hides
the stuff that he steals.

284
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:07,033
- No, Sam, I can't.
- Mikey,

285
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:09,638
Come on. Let me just pitch
a whole new heist,

286
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,494
something where he's got
to bring you in.

287
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:15,167
We'll never actually have to do it.
It has to look good, get him talking.

288
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,670
Virgil, can you get us a yacht
just for show?

289
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:21,705
You know, I think I probably can.

290
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:24,002
I helped a rich guy out
in Fort Lauderdale...

291
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:26,422
sank his catamaran before
his ex-wife could get it.

292
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,931
He might be in an accommodating
frame of mind.

293
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:31,892
Guys, you think
you can find the medicine?

294
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:34,790
I have no idea,
but we got to give it a shot.

295
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,356
Michael, you home?

296
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:38,816
You are not here.

297
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,414
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

298
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:46,128
Oh, I'm in a hurry, ma.
I'm going to meet Fi.

299
00:15:46,248 --> 00:15:47,663
Well, but I made you this.

300
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:49,050
You baked a pie?

301
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:51,038
Okay, I just sprinkled
cinnamon on it.

302
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,067
But I thought maybe
you could share it with Sam...

303
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,750
- and Virgil.
- Virgil?

304
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:57,771
Michael.

305
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:02,045
Michael, I may not be a superspy,
but I'm not an idiot.

306
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:04,534
All right, I got a call
from Virgil, saying...

307
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:07,526
some story about being stranded
in the Bahamas with boat trouble.

308
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:10,381
I mean, that wouldn't fool a 2-year-old.
So, what's going on?

309
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,234
Nothing is going on.
I have to go to work.

310
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,662
But if I hear from Virgil,
I'll let you know.

311
00:16:14,782 --> 00:16:16,632
Can I walk you to your car?

312
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:19,403
I can walk myself.

313
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,235
Okay. I'll call you later.

314
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:33,203
Keeping Virgil away from your mom
is just about keeping her from danger?

315
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,077
What else would it be?

316
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:39,782
They did have a connection, Michael.
A romantic connection.

317
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,896
An intimate, steamy connection.

318
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,983
I'm just saying, you know,
when an important woman in your life

319
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:47,756
meets someone,
it can be an adjustment.

320
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,926
Is this about your date?
Because I'm fine with it.

321
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,157
I don't think so, Michael.

322
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,782
Not one question about who he is?
You're not the least bit interested?

323
00:16:57,902 --> 00:16:59,552
No, I'm not interested.

324
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:03,305
I thought spies
were meant to be good liars.

325
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:04,975
You are getting rusty.

326
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:35,724
How you doing? Jackass...

327
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,112
fruit smoothies for my friends.

328
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,042
That's all he's good for.

329
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:42,106
And lay off the wheat grass, will you?

330
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,612
Hey, guess what.

331
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:45,240
That Ukrainian guy

332
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:47,627
finally paid me my money,

333
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:49,279
and here is your cut.

334
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:51,684
Seymour, we don't work together.

335
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,066
No more tests, no more buys,
no more Bulgarians.

336
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,870
I just want information about where
I can get a certain rifle serviced.

337
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,580
Oh, right, the Dragunov.

338
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,489
Yes.

339
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,874
Do you know anyone in Miami
who would modify, calibrate it?

340
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:05,170
I just want a name
and to keep it quiet.

341
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,672
Yeah. I'll make some calls.

342
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:07,998
Thank you.

343
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:10,592
But first, you got to have
a fruit smoothie.

344
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:13,637
If you want to be a bad-ass,
you got to eat healthy, right?

345
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,358
What? I made them just for you.

346
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:20,190
He doesn't like fruits?

347
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:22,713
I thought you and me...

348
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:24,906
bad-asses, yeah!

349
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:33,574
Scotch and soda. Make it two.

350
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,411
Nice to see you survived
yesterday's little brawl.

351
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:41,165
Some people don't understand
their place in the food chain.

352
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,170
Not afraid to get
your hands dirty. I like that.

353
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,377
I got a job for you.

354
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:47,588
No, thanks.
I don't do work for hire.

355
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:51,747
Then consider yourself a partner in
a very lucrative business opportunity.

356
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:54,344
What do you know about
designer performance enhancers?

357
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:56,013
You mean like steroids?

358
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:58,105
More like steroids on steroids.

359
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,758
I know a lab
that makes undetectable stuff...

360
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,021
Next generation.

361
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,732
Human tissue. 100% biological.

362
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,516
It's worth millions.

363
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:12,570
They're, uh, running a shipment
up north in a yacht.

364
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,134
You want us to hit it?

365
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,574
Shipment's worth $2 million.

366
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,880
You'd get a third.

367
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,710
How does that sound?

368
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,590
A third sounds like work for hire.

369
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:24,750
Half sounds like a partnership.

370
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:29,777
All right, done.

371
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,828
You handle the heist, but you got
to bring in a pro to keep the drugs

372
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:35,298
at the right temperature and humidity.

373
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:37,402
You got someone in mind?

374
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:38,222
Yeah.

375
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:40,654
He works at the lab.
His name is Jackson.

376
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:43,865
He used to cook meth before
he got into designing steroids.

377
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:46,235
You're gonna convince him to help.

378
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,065
Convince him?

379
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,858
I'm sure you can be persuasive.

380
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:51,671
- Why don't you do it?
- Me?

381
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,680
Oh, no.

382
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,302
No, in my line of work,
you stay in the shadows.

383
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:57,324
So the name Finley
is never mentioned.

384
00:19:58,058 --> 00:19:59,808
We clear on that, partner?

385
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:10,690
<i>Dealing with an aggressive adversary
isn't always about showing strength.</i>

386
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:12,741
You Jackson?

387
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,617
<i>Sometimes it's best to show weakness.</i>

388
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:20,418
<i>If they believe they can dominate you,
they'll drop their guard.</i>

389
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,591
<i>Of course, that means getting dominated.</i>

390
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,745
A heist? Seriously?

391
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:34,278
No, no, no. I'm a chemist.
I don't do heists.

392
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,920
Guys with guns, violence...
that's why I got out of meth!

393
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,910
I mean, it's... it's just not my thing.
It makes my chest tight.

394
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,246
- Can't breathe.
- I can stop your breathing real quick.

395
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:47,730
Please, you don't want to do this.
Guys that own the lab are chechenyans.

396
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,960
I mean, if they ever found out
that I was in on it...

397
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,212
Don't worry.
They're not gonna know it was you.

398
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,594
Can I get that as a guarantee?
Can you put that in writing?

399
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:56,164
Here's a guarantee.

400
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,542
You do this,

401
00:20:57,662 --> 00:21:00,912
we never see each other again,
and you make some money.

402
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,377
You don't...

403
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:10,480
That's the guy that moves the stuff.
He takes off in the morning.

404
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:13,650
- How big's the cargo?
- Six cannisters. Not so big.

405
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,259
- What do we need to do with them?
- You got to pack it in coolers.

406
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,615
You got to get it inside
a custom liquid-air rig ASAP,

407
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:20,657
as soon as...

408
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,911
Because you let this stuff warm up,
and it's is a nasty cocktail.

409
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:29,917
I can train one of your guys
to move it off the boat.

410
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,794
- One of my guys. You're the guy.
- What?

411
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:36,688
No, no. I got a thing
with boats and water, and

412
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:38,127
I get...

413
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:41,145
I get...

414
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:44,765
I get seasick. I mean, look at me.
Can you crack a window?

415
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:46,642
We'll scrounge up some dramamine.

416
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:49,311
- Then they'll recognize my face.
- We'll get you a mask.

417
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:51,309
All right, well,
if we're gonna do this, man,

418
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,316
Then I need to know where...
where this stuff's going, all right?

419
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:56,026
Is it a warehouse? Is it a garage?

420
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:57,648
You don't need to know.

421
00:21:57,768 --> 00:21:58,737
We'll store it.

422
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,405
Come on, I mean...

423
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,035
power issues, humidity.
Have you been outside?

424
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,078
Look, you tell me what you need,
and we'll set you up, all right?

425
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:09,872
Now, look at that.
Old guy's got a girlfriend.

426
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:17,434
Uh, can we, uh, can we go

427
00:22:17,554 --> 00:22:19,273
before, you know,
somebody recognizes me?

428
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:21,443
I don't know who, but someone.

429
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,100
Madeline.

430
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:29,142
What are you doing here?

431
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:31,812
I followed you from Michael's loft.

432
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:36,143
Did Michael tell you
to stay away from me?

433
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:37,526
Look, Maddy,

434
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:40,614
sweetie, listen,
he's just looking out for you.

435
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,937
See, the thing is,
I tend to attract bullets

436
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,863
and he just doesn't want you
to get hurt.

437
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:48,036
Well, you can tell Michael
that I can take care of myself.

438
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:55,293
Madeline, I'm kind of in the
middle of something right now,

439
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:56,712
and you need to leave.

440
00:22:58,563 --> 00:22:59,263
Now.

441
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,384
Please, Madeline.

442
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:25,454
Can I... can I know
about the storage space,

443
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:27,867
the room temperature,
the sunlight sensitivity?

444
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:30,859
I mean, we got to have these
at a certain temp range.

445
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:33,875
I'll tell you what, talk to Evan about
what you need. We'll get it to you.

446
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,664
- It's gonna take a while.
- Take your time. You'll have all night.

447
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:38,920
You're staying with us
till we pull this job tomorrow.

448
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,930
He never leaves your sight.

449
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,967
I got to call in sick.

450
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,635
You're not calling anybody.

451
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:47,574
What's gonna happen
when I don't show up?

452
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:50,020
I got to call the office.
I got to leave a message.

453
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,309
They'll think something's wrong
if I don't show up.

454
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,286
One call, and I'll be listening.

455
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,657
Not a good time, Michael.
I'm going to a movie.

456
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:08,967
Boris, it's...

457
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:13,663
it's Jackson. Yeah
I'm not gonna make it into the office.

458
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,332
What's going on, Michael?

459
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:19,743
The doc said that
I can't get out of bed.

460
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:22,274
So, I came down with something, so...

461
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:23,840
If you need anything,

462
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,717
<i>you can call me at extension</i>

463
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:27,291
One Eight Two Zero.

464
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:28,961
- All right.
- One...

465
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,091
Hey, Fi.

466
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:37,717
Michael just called me from a bar.

467
00:24:37,837 --> 00:24:40,028
Does the number 1820
mean anything to you?

468
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:42,210
Yeah, a place in the marina. Why?

469
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:44,503
I'm gonna miss my movie.

470
00:24:52,332 --> 00:24:55,477
<i>When you need to distract someone
without raising suspicions,</i>

471
00:24:55,597 --> 00:24:57,677
<i>it helps to play to preconceptions.</i>

472
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,252
<i>Tourists are fat, old people are cranky,</i>

473
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:02,090
<i>and girls can't drive.</i>

474
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,185
What the hell?

475
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:08,724
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

476
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,763
I was putting on my makeup,
and I didn't see you, and...

477
00:25:12,924 --> 00:25:14,850
Oh, let me give you
my insurance information.

478
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,008
So silly.

479
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:20,465
Okay.

480
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:23,358
How about just your number,
and we'll call it even.

481
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:27,487
Okay. Do you have a pen?

482
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:32,366
- Do you have a pen?
- Sorry, nope.

483
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:38,540
Do you have a pen?

484
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,127
They're not letting me leave. Tell Sam
the fake heist is on for real now.

485
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:43,789
I missed my date.

486
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:44,854
Thank you.

487
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,645
They're getting ready, Sam.
How much longer?

488
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,894
We'll be there. We're just
trying to do this right.

489
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:03,064
Mikey's donating his fridge
to the cause.

490
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:06,288
Better look good. Gerard's got
to believe the drugs he's stealing

491
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:08,403
are real if he's gonna
lead us to his stash.

492
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:10,817
We got it covered.
We're just trying to find a place

493
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,852
to put Mike's yogurt
while we do the job.

494
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:13,909
How's he doing?

495
00:26:14,276 --> 00:26:15,004
Fine.

496
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,037
I wish they'd smack him around a bit.

497
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:19,664
I had to tell my date
I got food poisoning.

498
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,625
Come on, Fi, don't be like that.

499
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:23,379
I don't want him dead,

500
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,649
just bruised.

501
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:26,405
Hurry up.

502
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:28,505
Looks like the show's starting.

503
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,180
<i>Counterfeiting pharmaceuticals
is pretty straightforward.</i>

504
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,510
<i>Fill some vials
with your choice of beverage.</i>

505
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,519
<i>The trick is to keep people
from looking closer.</i>

506
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,587
<i>With some compressed gas
from your local farming-supply store</i>

507
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:48,318
<i>and a few cryogenic containers,</i>

508
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:51,446
<i>you can convince people that
if they get a little too curious,</i>

509
00:26:51,815 --> 00:26:54,165
<i>they could lose a finger to frostbite.</i>

510
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:11,486
Where... Where... Where's my mask?
I need my mask.

511
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:12,801
You don't need one.

512
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:16,127
What are you talking about? I told you
the guy on the boat will recognize me

513
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:17,962
if I don't got a mask,
so I need a mask!

514
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:18,848
Let him.

515
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:20,433
He can tell it to the fishes.

516
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:23,061
The fish? What are...
You're gonna kill him?!

517
00:27:23,428 --> 00:27:26,692
Trust me, Jackson, it's better this way.
No loose ends.

518
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:30,727
<i>Dealing with a trained operative
is like playing chess with a master.</i>

519
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:33,238
<i>Dealing with criminals,
on the other hand,</i>

520
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:36,048
<i>is like playing checkers
with a 3-year-old.</i>

521
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:38,228
<i>They like to change the rules.</i>

522
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:40,489
Well, I need a gun. I need a gun.

523
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:42,707
- Give me a gun!
- You said you didn't want one.

524
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,401
Yeah, well, that was before I knew
people were gonna be shot.

525
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:47,749
And if you're gonna shoot people,
they're gonna shoot back.

526
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,298
And if they shoot back, they'll probably
hit me. So I need a gun.

527
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,768
I'm not going on the boat unless I...

528
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:55,386
- You happy?
- Yeah.

529
00:27:58,298 --> 00:28:01,182
<i>Using a zodiac to catch a yacht
has certain advantages.</i>

530
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,727
<i>It's low to the water,
so it's hard to see coming.</i>

531
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:07,385
<i>It tops out at a brisk
60 miles per hour,</i>

532
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:09,858
<i>and it's designed to turn on a dime.</i>

533
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:14,362
<i>Of course, the one disadvantage is,
it can make for a bumpy ride.</i>

534
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:37,915
Take anything you want...
the boat, anything.

535
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:40,407
Where's the shipment?

536
00:28:40,527 --> 00:28:41,944
Sealed cannisters in the fridge.

537
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:43,314
Get to the bow.

538
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:45,534
Find them.

539
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:58,281
Virgil, go with this.

540
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:01,034
You shut up! I don't even know
what you're talking about.

541
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,769
Shut up! I've never met you
before in my life.

542
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:06,452
- Did I miss something?
- Yeah. He says he knows me.

543
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:09,054
... I do know you.
You're that... that guy...

544
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:10,963
No, no! Shut up! Stop saying that!

545
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,922
- Everyone's gonna know you did this.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:29:16,181 --> 00:29:18,284
<i>Navy Seals are trained
to hold their breath</i>

547
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:20,071
<i>for three to five minutes underwater.</i>

548
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:23,280
<i>If you're an ex-Navy Seal,
you'll probably still have the chops,</i>

549
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,725
<i>but there's only one way to find out.</i>

550
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:27,477
Oh, god, what did I do?

551
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:29,840
Good for you.

552
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,399
You broke your cherry.

553
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,531
Hey, do you want to lose a finger?!

554
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:42,283
- What's the matter?
- Put that down! Put that down!

555
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:44,815
You'll lose a finger
you keep doing that.

556
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:46,531
You have no idea what you're doing.

557
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,978
This is my work, and I don't want it
messed up by some idiots!

558
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:52,015
- What did you say?
- I say you're idiot!

559
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:53,085
Let it go.

560
00:29:53,314 --> 00:29:54,212
Come on!

561
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:55,850
Load them up.

562
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:58,633
Load them up.

563
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:03,363
Great.

564
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:33,766
Maybe even laid.

565
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:36,424
Let's just make sure
we get this stuff into storage.

566
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,061
We can't let it spoil.

567
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:41,064
You know, I'm not gonna be
responsible for this if, you know...

568
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:44,429
Stop worrying about the storage space,
you'll be fine with it.

569
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:47,232
I almost slipped.

570
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:51,152
Looks like Mike's got them
hooked pretty good.

571
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:55,271
Now let's see if they lead us back
to where they're hiding the antivirals.

572
00:30:56,694 --> 00:30:59,611
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Watch out for the fence. It's rusty.

573
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,660
There you go. Don't lose them, Fi.

574
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:10,371
I know how to tail a car.

575
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:35,673
Well, there's no barbed wire,
just one guard with a Beretta,

576
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,358
so getting in shouldn't be a problem.

577
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,693
We wait for Mike and Gerard and the guys
to leave, and we'll make our move.

578
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,195
Well, why not go in now?

579
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:43,924
Because Mike could get hurt.

580
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:45,594
Doesn't sound so bad.

581
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:47,922
What is this place?

582
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:50,866
Big office-supply company
uses it for inventory.

583
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:54,030
We got a guy on the inside,
keeps us off the paperwork.

584
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,454
We got building security
on the payroll, too.

585
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:59,160
Aren't you, you know, afraid
someone might find your stuff?

586
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,745
In here? Good luck!

587
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:02,962
Everything you need's right up here.

588
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:04,175
Oh, okay.

589
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:05,889
All right, this will do, okay.

590
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,805
Now, you're gonna have to
have power sources clear

591
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:11,815
because this thing
will suck up a lot of juice.

592
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:13,143
Okay?

593
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,782
Yeah, oh, all right, good.

594
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:18,076
Now, listen, my rig will generate
a lot of heat.

595
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:20,714
So if you have anything
that's yours that's nearby

596
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:23,728
that's pharmaceutical, it'll fry it.
Is this yours? Any of this yours?

597
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:27,162
Don't worry about it. All our other stuff
is scattered around, nothing nearby.

598
00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:30,616
Oh, yeah? Oh, good. Oh, good.
Okay, so, then... then...

599
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:33,079
Yeah. Yeah, that will work out.

600
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:37,530
I just need to go out to the van
and get some tools.

601
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,900
Give him a hand.

602
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,473
He's waving us off.

603
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:55,236
Guess we're not going in, then.

604
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:05,314
That's the warehouse
he hides the medicine in.

605
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:07,984
But the medicine...
it could be anywhere.

606
00:33:08,574 --> 00:33:10,384
So we got to the end zone
and no touchdown.

607
00:33:10,504 --> 00:33:13,235
You wanna search through 10,000 boxes?
Be my guest.

608
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:15,805
Sounds like the world's worst game show.

609
00:33:16,984 --> 00:33:18,373
Sorry about the fridge, Mike.

610
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:21,582
It was kind of a last-minute thing.

611
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:24,431
Hungry?

612
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:27,673
I've got to do something. Where's
that warehouse? I'm going down there.

613
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:29,384
Maybe there's somebody I can know.

614
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,921
Virgil, it's not gonna work.

615
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:33,674
No. We...

616
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:38,894
... we got to get Gerard
to move the medicine.

617
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,566
We do that, and we might be able
to get it back.

618
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:46,184
You got any ideas?

619
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:49,613
Yeah. I think it's time to bring back
the mysterious Mr. Finley.

620
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,820
I like where you're going.

621
00:33:56,574 --> 00:33:58,026
I just want my money.

622
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:01,249
Can I have my money? Can I have
my money, man? I just want my money!

623
00:34:02,745 --> 00:34:05,724
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- You said this was a simple heist.

624
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,727
You never said Chuck Finley
was involved.

625
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:09,633
So Finley's involved.
What's the big deal?

626
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:12,250
What's the big...
You have no idea, do you?

627
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,385
You don't get it. Yeah you don't get it.
We're dead. We're dead.

628
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:16,633
We are dead.

629
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:19,493
What are you talking about?
He's the buyer.

630
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,695
Chuck Finley's the buyer?

631
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:27,309
Man. You don't get it. He comes in.

632
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,069
He gets you to bite on a job.

633
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,390
He tells you a story.

634
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,775
He says I deal in everything.
I got guns to shoot people up.

635
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:36,201
I got medical supplies
to patch them up for round two.

636
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:37,562
I've never heard of him.

637
00:34:37,682 --> 00:34:41,026
Because everyone
he's worked with is dead.

638
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:44,064
He's everywhere.

639
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:47,420
If the devil had a name,
it'd be Chuck Finley.

640
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:49,834
Who is he,
and what do you know about him?

641
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:53,135
He did the same thing to
a couple of guys I worked with out west.

642
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:55,679
He used to run black ops
for the government.

643
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:59,261
Assassinations, man, stealing secrets.

644
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,679
But now, he just steals
from people like you and me.

645
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:05,828
He takes what he wants, and he
just leaves a trail of bodies.

646
00:35:05,948 --> 00:35:08,299
He's not stealing from anybody.
We got the warehouse.

647
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:11,412
You don't think he already knows
about the warehouse?

648
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:12,689
Are you kid...

649
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:15,956
And if he doesn't, he'll figure
it out one way or another.

650
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:18,371
And not just this stuff.
He's gonna take everything.

651
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,241
He's gonna clean you out!

652
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:22,629
In fact, yeah, he's probably
already done that.

653
00:35:22,749 --> 00:35:24,191
He's gone. I'd like to go.

654
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:26,626
Give me my money.
I'll get on a plane, a train, anything.

655
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:29,173
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna help us move the drugs.

656
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,382
No, no, no. I am not going back
to that warehouse. Are you crazy?

657
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:34,669
You tell me.

658
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,184
Hello, police?

659
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,469
I'm on the corner of 29th and 1st ave.

660
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,339
There are these men here with guns.
I think they're drug dealers.

661
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:55,489
You have patrols in the area already?
Thank goodness.

662
00:35:55,766 --> 00:35:59,255
<i>You need the police to respond
right away, call ahead.</i>

663
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:03,335
<i>If you've reported a few minor crimes
within a six-block radius,</i>

664
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:06,805
<i>you can be sure someone will
show up when you need them.</i>

665
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:10,246
- What's that? What are the boxes?
- Antiviral drugs.

666
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:12,744
Antiviral?
I can't be responsible for that.

667
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:14,801
Don't worry. You won't be.
They're already sold.

668
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:19,957
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. He's here.

669
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,224
That's the guy. That's Finley.
We got to go!

670
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:26,686
- He's one guy.
- One guy? You don't understand!

671
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:29,273
He's not alone.
He must have guys in that truck.

672
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:31,901
- We got to get out of here!
- You're not going anywhere.

673
00:36:32,061 --> 00:36:33,438
Just load the stuff.

674
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,008
We'll take care
of Finley and his guys.

675
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,764
<i>Most people think that
shooting the gas tank</i>

676
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:04,433
<i>of a vehicle makes it explode.</i>

677
00:37:04,593 --> 00:37:06,311
<i>Unless the car's on fire,</i>

678
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:08,744
<i>you'll just spill
a few bucks' worth of gas.</i>

679
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:11,060
<i>An explosion requires something extra,</i>

680
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,361
<i>like a few bags of acetone peroxide
taped to the gas tank.</i>

681
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:11,416
You don't know
what this means for us.

682
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:15,246
May I suggest that you fly
the medicine next time?

683
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:17,339
What can I do to repay you?

684
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:19,633
You know some guys
who can help move a fridge?

685
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,094
My cooler doesn't
hold much beer, Mike.

686
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:25,905
Your daddy would have been
so proud of you.

687
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:29,392
Thank you.

688
00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:36,733
- Mike, I didn't call her.
- I know.

689
00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:41,862
Michael told me what you
were doing here in Miami,

690
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:44,199
and it's a wonderful thing
you did, Virgil.

691
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:46,701
- I'm sorry about before.
- It's okay.

692
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:49,955
You can make it up to me
over a dinner.

693
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:53,993
Take her someplace nice. No guns.

694
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:55,509
You got it.

695
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,428
You know, Mike, if you had to have
a stepdad, you could do worse.

696
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:11,316
Seymour has our information?

697
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:14,359
He didn't say.
Just wanted us to stop by his place.

698
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,829
He sounded more paranoid than normal.

699
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:19,203
You missing a date for this?

700
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,871
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

701
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,692
Seymour promised to upgrade
my laser-targeting assist.

702
00:39:23,812 --> 00:39:26,589
Said I could pick it up tonight.
Should be quick.

703
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:29,559
I have no intention
of missing any more dates.

704
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,671
You look beautiful, Fi.

705
00:39:46,411 --> 00:39:48,978
So, this guy, is he nice?
Your date?

706
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,592
Yeah, very. He's a paramedic.

707
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:55,855
- I think you'd like him.
- I wouldn't count on that.

708
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,233
What'd you get me into?

709
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,836
I was wondering the same thing.

710
00:40:02,956 --> 00:40:04,456
Who the hell are you?

711
00:40:05,576 --> 00:40:08,116
Why did you ask me
about that sniper rifle?

712
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,543
You'll start answering questions
or your girlfriend gets

713
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:13,997
- a bullet in the head.
- I'm not his girlfriend.

714
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,916
<i>Anyone who played soccer</i>

715
00:40:17,144 --> 00:40:19,917
<i>knows there's a long nerve
that runs down the shin.</i>

716
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,716
<i>Hit that nerve,
and people lock up in pain.</i>

717
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:33,217
<i>Arms dealers keep gunpowder handy
to manufacture customate rounds.</i>

718
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,794
<i>But gunpowder doesn't need to be
in a bullet to be dangerous.</i>

719
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:39,618
<i>Even muzzle flare can set it off.</i>

720
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:41,706
<i>So when dispersed through a room,</i>

721
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:43,860
<i>anyone with half a brain
puts his gun away.</i>

722
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:47,072
No, no, no! Jackass, don't shoot!
You'll blow us all up!

723
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:55,281
Seymour, you want to tell me
what that was about?

724
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:57,036
Dude, look!

725
00:40:57,425 --> 00:41:00,835
I track down a shop that had done
some work on the gun you're asking about.

726
00:41:00,996 --> 00:41:04,964
The place was burned to the ground, man.
They killed the guy who owned it.

727
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:07,447
All right? I thought you were
setting me up for something.

728
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,886
- Who brought the gun in, Seymour?
- I don't know.

729
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:13,571
No, I swear, I swear.

730
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:17,197
All I know is some guy picked up
some stuff for it, okay?

731
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:20,738
Specialy calibrated muzzle brakes,

732
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,326
night sights, and a fiber-optic camera.

733
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:24,820
That's all I know.

734
00:41:26,427 --> 00:41:28,070
Who's the guy? What's his name?

735
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,198
They said his name is Bill Johnson.

736
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,992
OK? That's all I know, I swear.
Please don't hurt me.

737
00:41:34,638 --> 00:41:35,338
Fi.

738
00:41:37,186 --> 00:41:39,082
We were never here, you understand?

739
00:41:39,485 --> 00:41:41,568
I got it. I never saw you.

740
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:45,550
Sorry about the dress, Fi.

741
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,484
I'm not. I got this baby.

742
00:41:47,994 --> 00:41:49,990
With amazing targeting assist.

743
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:52,470
Johnson has something to do
with people who burned you?

744
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:56,069
I have to assume so. He's putting
a fiber-optic camera on a sniper rifle.

745
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:58,351
That's for proof of death.
We better find this guy.

746
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:01,669
Now we've got his name,
but he could be anywhere.
