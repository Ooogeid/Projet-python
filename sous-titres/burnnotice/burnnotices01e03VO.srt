<i>Michael: my name is michael westen.</i>

3
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,379
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

4
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,090
man: we got a burn notice. You're blacklisted.

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,968
<i>When you're burned, you've got nothing -</i>

6
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,513
<i>No cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,723
<i>You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.</i>

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,934
Where am i? Miami.

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,606
<i>You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.</i>

11
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,775
<i>A trigger-Happy ex-Girlfriend...</i>

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,692
should we shoot them?

13
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,445
<i>...an old friend who's informing on you to the fbi...</i>

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,781
you know spies - A bunch of bitchy little girls.

15
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:31,949
<i>...family, too...</i>

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,116
is that your mom again?

17
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,702
<i>...if you're desperate. Someone needs your help.</i>

18
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,081
<i>Bottom line - Until you figure out who burned you,</i>

19
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,251
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

<i>International conferences attract spies</i>

23
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,597
<i>For the same reason hotel bars attract hookers.</i>

24
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,725
<i>You can do business and drink for free.</i>

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,190
Fiona: looks like your fbi tail found us.

26
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,192
Should we call this off?

27
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:10,320
No. Keep the engine running. I'll try to make this quick.

28
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,907
Fi, this is not an armored assault.

29
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,160
Do you think they're just gonna give you a list of covert operatives coming?

30
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,997
All i need is a name - Somebody in miami who can get me

31
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,040
The homeland security directive that burned me.

32
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,293
One name.

33
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,502
I don't need a gun for that.

34
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,880
You're no fun, mi-

35
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,889
<i>Any high-Security function</i>

36
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,891
<i>Is going to have a lot of oversight,</i>

37
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:39,892
<i>A lot of meetings,</i>

38
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,519
<i>A lot of bureaucrats checking up on each other.</i>

39
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,397
Remember, i forgot my badge. The security office is...?

40
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,899
Right.

41
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,734
<i>In all the confusion of the big event,</i>

42
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,279
<i>It's easy for another bureaucrat to just show up.</i>

43
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,156
Security brief, right? Sorry.

44
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:54,656
Anyway...

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,951
we're concentrating our efforts on crowd control

46
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,204
If we get protestors.

47
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,496
Sounds good.

48
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,706
Excuse me. Which office are you with?

49
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,750
I'm an interdepartmental liaison.

50
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,377
They wanted me to come down, make sure we're up to speed

51
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,588
On everything you guys are doing.

52
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,964
Looks like things are under control.

53
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,925
Is there anything you need from us support-Wise?

54
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,301
Okay, then, well, you let us know

55
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,887
If there's anything you want us to coordinate on our end.

56
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,264
<i>The important thing is to disappear</i>

57
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,183
<i>Before people can ask questions.</i>

58
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,560
Excuse me, sir. Sir!

59
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,979
Great.

60
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,856
<i>If they do decide to ask questions,</i>

61
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,107
<i>You just have to hope you're in a building</i>

62
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,485
<i>With a lot of hallways, a good service basement,</i>

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,611
<i>And plenty of exits.</i>

64
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,696
Locked.

65
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,075
This is a fire hazard.

66
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,705
Sir?

67
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:44,748
But in?

68
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,167
Sometime?

69
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,586
Is just?

70
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,715
By jump?

71
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,441
I just walked 2 miles with a twisted ankle.

72
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,152
What happened to "keep the car running"?

73
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,947
<i>The stolen car, michael.</i>

74
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,782
Your feds were getting curious.

75
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,242
I had a gun in the car.

76
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,661
Our little mission was in danger of being compromised,

77
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,371
So i returned to base.

78
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,707
And broke in again.

79
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,375
I think our little post-Operation debriefing

80
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,586
Has taught us that you need a car

81
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,296
And i need a key to your apartment.

82
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,840
A key? Aren't you more comfortable breaking in?

83
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,842
What is your problem with me having a key, michael?

84
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,011
<i>I don't want anyone to have a key to my place.</i>

85
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,013
It's a security issue.

86
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,056
And your problem with car ownership?

87
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,266
You prefer the bus?

88
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,060
Urine-Scented transportation is more secure?

89
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,521
I don't know where to get a car. My assets are frozen.

90
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,899
I don't even have a driver's license.

91
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,651
I spoke to your mom. Apparently, you have a car.

92
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,946
Your father's old, uh... what is it?

93
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,449
Charger. Not interested.

94
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,284
What are you doing talking to my mom?

95
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,995
We chat. And you know what i think?

96
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,207
I think a car is commitment.

97
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,210
I think you're afraid to be tied down.

98
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,090
Is there a problem with the lock?

99
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,384
More like a problem with boundaries.

100
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,720
Apartment is good for you, yes?

101
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,973
<i>Apartment is good.</i>

102
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,893
Yeah, club is good, too, but always competition, though.

103
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,395
Many problems.

104
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,732
What do you need, oleg?

105
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,109
I have a waitress, cara, knows my regulars.

106
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,570
On a good night, half of my business is from her.

107
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,948
But for a week now, she doesn't come to work.

108
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,617
You don't want me filling in for her, trust me.

109
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,328
<i>No, i need her, but she's scared to leave her house.</i>

110
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,539
Someone threatened her, maybe boyfriend.

111
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,791
What do you want me to do? I think maybe you can help.

112
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,584
You got rid of the drug dealer next door,

113
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,003
So i think maybe it's no problem for you, huh?

114
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,340
Look, you take care of this,

115
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,218
I give you free rent for two months, yes?

116
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,346
<i>Four months, da?</i>

117
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,306
Okay.

118
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,684
I'll talk to her.

119
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,939
Cara: so, you work for oleg.

120
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,650
We have an arrangement. I'm here to see if i can help.

121
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,736
So, a couple weeks ago, i was driving home from work -

122
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:20,737
Ohh.

123
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,156
Oh. Recycled grounds.

124
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,160
I haven't been out to the store in more than a week.

125
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,912
I haven't been anywhere.

126
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:29,872
It's fine. Uh...

127
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,499
so, what exactly is the situation?

128
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,001
Do you know who's threatening you?

129
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,627
Kind of.

130
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,462
A couple weeks ago,

131
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,590
I was driving home after work, around 3:00,

132
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,759
And i saw this pizza-Delivery guy rear-End this gold lexus.

133
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,388
The guy in the lexus pulled this poor kid out of the car

134
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,516
And started pounding him with this steering-Wheel lock.

135
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,020
I got the license-Plate number, and i called the cops.

136
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,105
So you're the only witness.

137
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,398
Yeah.

138
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,358
The pizza-Delivery kid is on life support,

139
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,611
So it's just me.

140
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:01,945
The next week, i get home,

141
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,364
And there's a rat nailed to my door.

142
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,533
So i went to the police.

143
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,368
You know, i figured that they could protect me, right?

144
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,454
They're like, "we'll send some patrols by. "

145
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,832
Meanwhile, there are these scary guys coming around my work,

146
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,293
And somebody's hanging around sophie's school,

147
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,045
Wanting to know where we live, and...

148
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,213
sophie?

149
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,964
Yeah.

150
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,841
Sophie?

151
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,051
This has been really hard on her,

152
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,845
Being cooped up in this little house for so long.

153
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,098
Sophie, um, this is michael.

154
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,560
Um...

155
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,938
he's a...

156
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,940
what are you, exactly?

157
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,359
Someone oleg thought could help.

158
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,278
So, are you going to help or what?

159
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,697
I'll see what i can do.

160
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,207
This is good.

161
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,626
It's a persian recipe.

162
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,173
You haven't cooked for me in a while - Years.

163
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,008
What is it you want, michael?

164
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,969
Listen, fi, if i show up at that hotel

165
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,679
Now that the conference has started,

166
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,347
I'll set off every alarm there is.

167
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,682
I need your help.

168
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,394
There's a delegate i need to talk to - Akhom thabet.

169
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:16,937
He's a friend?

170
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,689
Not exactly. I saved his life a while back.

171
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,108
He owes me.

172
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,111
You want me to track down an egyptian spy,

173
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,738
And in return, i get what?

174
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,659
This meal? It's tasty, but...

175
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,371
you want me to ask my mom for the car...

176
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,750
i'll ask my mom for the car.

177
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>Asking my mom for anything</i>

178
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,262
<i>Is a lot like getting a favor from a russian mob boss.</i>

179
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,055
<i>They'll give you what you want with a smile,</i>

180
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,682
<i>But believe me, you'll pay for it.</i>

181
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,058
What are you doing, mom?

182
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,728
Making a salad. I'm getting healthy.

183
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,564
Does the recipe call for cigarette ash?

184
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,150
One mountain a day, michael.

185
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,902
That's what my yoga teacher said.

186
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,820
Uh, you never leave the house.

187
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,405
Where are you meeting yogis?

188
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,992
I bought a yoga dvd on the home shopping network.

189
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,578
That's great.

190
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,997
Listen...

191
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,583
i need the car - The charger.

192
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,129
Oh, michael, that's wonderful!

193
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,797
Your father always wanted you

194
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,299
To have something to remember him by.

195
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,301
<i>Oh, i have this to remember him by.</i>

196
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,802
I remember what fun you two had,

197
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,846
Always working on cars in the garage.

198
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:33,931
Fun?

199
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,559
I remember him making me fake a seizure at mr. Goodwrench

200
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,144
So he could steal spark plugs.

201
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,772
I remember him quitting every project early

202
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,983
And handing me a to-Do list to finish the job for him.

203
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,402
And look at you now, michael.

204
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:51,406
So many things you can do. Here, honey.

205
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,414
<i>My father's approach to machinery</i>

206
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,583
<i>Was similar to his approach to his family -</i>

207
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,377
<i>If you don't like how something works,</i>

208
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,046
<i>Keep banging on it until it does what you want.</i>

209
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,257
<i>If something doesn't fit, force it.</i>

210
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,969
<i>And above all, make sure it looks good on the outside.</i>

211
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,193
Spark plugs.

212
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,612
Perfect.

213
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,369
Thank you, melinda.

214
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,788
<i>So, a babysitting gig?</i>

215
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,290
What? Are you that hard up for cash?

216
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,500
Hey, at least i've gotten an apartment.

217
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,919
I'm working on that. I got a few irons in the fire.

218
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,755
Hey, so, this, uh... this new job -

219
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:49,882
You want some help?

220
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,800
Maybe i could provide a little something.

221
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,219
I already sent fiona over to cara's place.

222
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,347
You got a sexy cocktail waitress that needs protecting,

223
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,223
And you send fiona.

224
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,142
What is she? 80 pounds?

225
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,019
Mike, come on. Look at that - Guns of steel.

226
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,188
If there's a situation that requires

227
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,648
Showing off your body and boozy flirting, you're my guy.

228
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,400
Oh, that's low.

229
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,735
I need you to have your cop buddies

230
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,112
Check on a license plate and get an address.

231
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,867
Okay.

232
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,119
Next time, i get the girl.

233
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,955
<i>So, i have one teaspoon of ground cumin seed.</i>

234
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,290
Ew, too much cumin.

235
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,334
You cook? Used to.

236
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,711
I was in chef school when i got pregnant.

237
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,796
But i was failing out.

238
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,216
I was 19, a mess.

239
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,511
And then sophie came along.

240
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,056
She saved my life.

241
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,023
All right, his name is alvaro disantos.

242
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,693
That's him there at the outdoor table.

243
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:53,862
Want me to go in with you?

244
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,782
No, you stay with the car. You get distracted in bars.

245
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,574
Fair enough.

246
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,952
Hey, if they have dos equis, just grab me a couple -

247
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,706
<i>Michael: convincing a bully to back down</i>

248
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,874
<i>Is usually just a matter</i>

249
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,376
<i>Of showing you're not afraid of him.</i>

250
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,043
Can i help you?

251
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,211
I think so.

252
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,422
A friend of mine, cara stagner, she has a rat problem.

253
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,174
And you come here?

254
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,552
Sounds like she needs an exterminator.

255
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,765
Little late for that. They're nailed to her door.

256
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,059
I want this to stop.

257
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,853
Take your chances at trial.

258
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,437
There are worse things than going to jail.

259
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,523
Oh, yes? What things?

260
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,818
<i>Of course, some bullies have guys with. 357 magnums.</i>

261
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,361
<i>Then you change tactics.</i>

262
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,196
There's no need for unpleasantness.

263
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,615
I'm just trying to resolve this situation.

264
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,117
Disantos: i'm happy that you come here.

265
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,077
This "situation," as you call it,

266
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,788
Is going to be resolved within the hour.

267
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,084
By the time we finish our mojitos,

268
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,087
This will all be done... for good.

269
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,889
Go! Go, go!

270
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,645
Hello? How did it go?

271
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,981
Michael: fi, disantos has a hit squad on the way.

272
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,358
No worries.

273
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,861
Go in the bathroom, get in the tub, and stay down.

274
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,738
What? Be a sweetie.

275
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,115
Do it before someone starts shooting.

276
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,161
Where's your liquor cabinet?

277
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,136
<i>When faced with superior force, you can do two things.</i>

278
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,554
<i>You can retreat quietly,</i>

279
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,224
<i>Or you can attack with as much fanfare as possible.</i>

280
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,603
Last call, boys.

281
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,408
Sam: how many were there?

282
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,701
I don't know. Four?

283
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,328
They took off after cocktail hour.

284
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,205
Fi, it looks like fallujah down there.

285
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,541
I was half hoping they'd stick around for a bit.

286
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,959
Cara's got quite a liquor cabinet -

287
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,002
Good for a 10-Hour siege.

288
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,379
Michael. You okay?

289
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,798
Can't we just tell them i won't testify? I don't care.

290
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,508
Once they send guys to kill you,

291
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,593
They're past the "i promise not to tell" stage.

292
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,554
We need to get them out of here. Where are we going?

293
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,389
Sam: you can't take them to your apartment.

294
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,891
Cara works downstairs. They're gonna come looking.

295
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,436
I know a place.

296
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,571
Madeline: how long are they going to be here?

297
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,282
I'm not sure how long they'll be here.

298
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,199
Maybe a few days?

299
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,202
Why the garage, though? We have a very nice guest room.

300
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,829
I need to control access points.

301
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,247
Trust me, it's better.

302
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,707
This way, you can have the whole house.

303
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,418
You can do your, uh... yoga.

304
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,837
Michael...

305
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:01,049
all these years, ever since your first background check,

306
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,926
All those letters where you couldn't say where you were,

307
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,887
I never asked questions.

308
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,389
<i>Now i want to know what you're doing.</i>

309
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:11,101
They're in danger, and i'm helping them, okay?

310
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,313
Please, mom.

311
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,274
Thank you.

312
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,651
Do something for me.

313
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,946
Go see your father's grave. It would mean a lot to me.

314
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll think about it.

315
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,537
<i>Outfitting a safe house is about two things -</i>

316
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,081
<i>You need to know if someone's coming,</i>

317
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,667
<i>And you need to know how the folks you're protecting</i>

318
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,253
<i>Are going to get out of there if they do.</i>

319
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,798
<i>If you can't be on babysitting duty all the time,</i>

320
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:42,633
<i>You need to make sure</i>

321
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,426
<i>That you know the minute something's wrong.</i>

322
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:48,514
<i>A $35 outdoor floodlight has a decent motion detector on it.</i>

323
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,062
<i>Wire that to a cellphone,</i>

324
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,688
<i>And you've got a remote alarm system</i>

325
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,066
<i>That will call you if there's trouble.</i>

326
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,284
Nice.

327
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,203
It came with the phone.

328
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,622
So if anyone comes in here, you'll know.

329
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,416
And if that goes off, i'll know, too.

330
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,877
So we're supposed to stay in here -

331
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,421
<i>In the garage? - And do nothing?</i>

332
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,340
Pretty much. It's not so bad, as safe houses go.

333
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,550
You got a tv, at least.

334
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,094
I once spent three days in a riyadh storage facility

335
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,345
With nothing but a flashlight

336
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,931
And an arabic celebrity magazine.

337
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,058
Can i call my friends at least?

338
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,894
No. No outside contact until this is over.

339
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,897
They're high-School students. You're completely paranoid.

340
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,859
Maybe. But i'm still breathing.

341
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,652
Now, if you need to run,

342
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,114
You can go safely through that opening, but don't -

343
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,241
See? Don't touch that.

344
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,869
I'll be rigging this so if anyone comes through this door,

345
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,245
They'll be electrocuted.

346
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,330
I don't want you to get zapped accidentally.

347
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,082
Whatever. It's a freaking garage.

348
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,126
I'd rather be killed than live here.

349
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,461
<i>Well, those are your two options.</i>

350
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,255
I'll miss our spring formal.

351
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,799
Is it too much to ask to go to one dance?

352
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,010
Look, these guys know where you go to high school.

353
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,387
If they have any brains at all, they will put the word out.

354
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,181
You show up, someone makes a phone call.

355
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,808
You really think they're gonna use kids at my school?

356
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,186
That's what i would do.

357
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,313
I can't believe this. This is so -

358
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,690
Sophie!

359
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,568
We are very grateful, michael. I am sorry.

360
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,945
It's fine. You might want to go use the bathroom.

361
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,323
I'm gonna lock down for the night.

362
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:32,784
Kids.

363
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,162
Yeah.

364
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,000
Thank you, mariposa. Appreciate it.

365
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,711
Hey, what's happening here? What? Bus fare.

366
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,005
What about your car? I thought you had some wheels.

367
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,216
Spark plugs. Spark plugs cost 2 bucks, mike.

368
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,719
My dad rebuilt the engine. The ignition system is shot.

369
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,972
Plugs won't fit until i rebuild the system from scratch.

370
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,516
From scratch?

371
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,392
Sounds like you and your pop had a lot in common.

372
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,686
Changing the subject, what did you find out about disantos?

373
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,771
Well, i checked around.

374
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,773
He's a distributor for one of the drug cartels.

375
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,608
He's not a major player, but he's got some firepower.

376
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,152
Any chance we can nudge the fbi to pick him up?

377
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,197
Your little fbi surveillance team

378
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,199
Is more interested in your romp at the convention

379
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,450
Than doing you favors, f. Y. I.

380
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,827
It sounds like they've been trying

381
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,163
To make a case against disantos, but nothing ever sticks.

382
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,624
Who's disantos' lawyer? Gellman.

383
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,417
Who? Oh, that's right.

384
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,253
You've been running around the world for the past decade.

385
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,504
Bruce gellman.

386
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,464
He's the lawyer for the whole drug cartel -

387
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,466
Disantos all the way up to el jefe.

388
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,885
Guess i better meet gellman.

389
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,014
What is this? Weapon?

390
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,266
Nothing you need to worry about.

391
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,768
You know what i worry about? I worry about my waitress.

392
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,187
How long this takes, michael? A week now?

393
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,397
I'm working on it.

394
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,357
Things got a little complicated,

395
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,777
But i think i found someone disantos will listen to.

396
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,281
<i>I love commuters.</i>

397
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,867
<i>Anybody who drives the same route to work every day,</i>

398
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,618
<i>It's like they're doing all the work for you,</i>

399
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,287
<i>And a punctual commuter,</i>

400
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:02,416
<i>A guy who's in the same place every morning at 8:36 a. M.,</i>

401
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,043
<i>It's almost too easy.</i>

402
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,757
I'm gonna feel really bad if you don't have a aaa card.

403
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,218
Is this a robbery?

404
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,848
The wallet, keys are in the car.

405
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,309
Is this the 7 series - With the leather seats?

406
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,020
Tempting, but it needs new tires, and i'm here on business.

407
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,520
Business?

408
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:27,149
I've been calling, trying to make an appointment,

409
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,151
But then i thought, "he's a busy man.

410
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,652
I'll just talk to him on his way into work. "

411
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,655
What do you want? Alvaro disantos.

412
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,991
I want to talk to you about his assault trial.

413
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,368
And my daughter wants a pony.

414
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,496
I don't discuss my clients' business.

415
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,915
"A pony. " That's funny.

416
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,917
Well, i'll do all the talking, then.

417
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,668
I don't know how much attention you've been paying

418
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,171
To your client lately, but he's been a bad boy -

419
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,508
Witness intimidation, attempted murder.

420
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,218
You know - The kind of things

421
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,595
That could cause problems for your...

422
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,014
other clients.

423
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,266
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

424
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,268
No, i read the article - Most of it anyway.

425
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,355
Scary guys, drugs, guns. I miss something?

426
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,398
I doubt el jefe back in colombia

427
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,359
Wants to risk yet another murder investigation

428
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,819
Just so disantos can avoid a few years in prison.

429
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:17,908
Have el jefe tell disantos to back off.

430
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,077
I want an answer by tomorrow.

431
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,539
I'll meet you here, same time. Understood?

432
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,708
Oh, i understand.

433
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,381
How'd it go?

434
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,800
Gellman gonna talk to colombia, make our lives easy?

435
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,970
Hope so. Those two can only stay in mom's garage for so long.

436
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,596
And if he doesn't go for it?

437
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,974
Then our lives aren't so easy.

438
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,560
There's your man.

439
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,730
Oh. Been a while.

440
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,358
<i>He's lost a little - A lot of hair.</i>

441
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,360
I tailed him for you.

442
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,779
<i>He's renting a nice mercedes.</i>

443
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,614
Spends a lot of time in restaurants.

444
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,991
He lives pretty well for a spy.

445
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,367
Hands out bribes mostly -

446
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,119
Bid rigging, industrial espionage.

447
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,620
Listen, i need you to keep watching him.

448
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,290
Let me know when's the best time to get next to him.

449
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,625
What then?

450
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,836
Then i'll find out who's behind this burn notice -

451
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,422
I'm just curious about your plans.

452
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,549
I suppose if you get this resolved,

453
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,633
Then you'll leave miami.

454
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,052
Fi, can we talk about this later?

455
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,858
<i>Threaten any serious criminal organization,</i>

456
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,485
<i>And they're going to do one of two things -</i>

457
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,782
<i>They'll send someone to make a deal...</i>

458
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,244
<i>...or they'll send someone to make a corpse.</i>

459
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,622
<i>Either way, you've got something to work with.</i>

460
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,139
Problem with the detonator?

461
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,517
I borrowed this when you went to take a leak.

462
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,104
Aah!

463
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:14,358
Gellman's not coming, is he?

464
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,692
What's going on?

465
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:16,735
I don't know nothing.

466
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,737
Oh, come on. Don't be so modest.

467
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,241
You hear things around the water cooler at the office.

468
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,870
I could take the other knee out if that helps.

469
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,789
They talked to the guys in colombia.

470
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,041
They say...

471
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,584
to kill you all.

472
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,003
Really?

473
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,884
That's not what i was hoping they'd say.

474
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,849
What? We have to leave miami?

475
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:47,891
You don't have a choice.

476
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,268
The whole cartel is after you now.

477
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,644
They won't stop until you're dead.

478
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,355
What about you? They don't care about me.

479
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,525
So we just leave? That's it?

480
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,110
Sophie, sophie, he's just trying to help us.

481
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,945
It was bad being stuck in here,

482
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,446
But now we're just supposed to leave?

483
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,908
What - What about my friends? It's m- It's my senior year.

484
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,286
I have a date for the dance!

485
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:08,328
Perimeter's clear.

486
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,164
Sam's out front keeping a lookout.

487
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,832
<i>Can't you do something?</i>

488
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,584
Didn't you say that you were better

489
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,170
At tactical whatever than he is?

490
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,338
What? I am.

491
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,716
I'm sure fi would be happy to take on the cartel

492
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,968
With a lighter and whatever's in the liquor cabinet,

493
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,761
But trust me, it's not an option.

494
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,180
You have to go now.

495
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:28,599
We don't even have our things. Can we at least go home?

496
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,185
They'll have people watching your house.

497
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:35,647
But i need my phone. It has all my friends' numbers on it.

498
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,608
Maybe i'm not being clear.

499
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,027
You will leave miami. You will not contact anyone.

500
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,528
You will start over.

501
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,614
They want cara and sophie stagner dead.

502
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,783
It is our job to turn cara and sophie stagner into ghosts.

503
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,631
I know how you feel.

504
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,216
Normally, i would agree with you.

505
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,259
Michael would change his identity and disappear

506
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,637
To get out of a parking ticket.

507
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,890
But in this case, he's right.

508
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,185
It's for the best.

509
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:14,978
Okay, so, where do we go?

510
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,815
Write up a list - Places you have family, vacation spots,

511
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,026
Anywhere you've been in the last 10 years or so.

512
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,904
You can go anywhere that's not on that list.

513
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,447
Won't they just follow us?

514
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,782
Trust me.

515
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,451
They will not know where you're heading.

516
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,208
Fi, we've got to get over to cara's apartment now.

517
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,506
<i>When you go on the run, the first thing you do</i>

518
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,425
<i>Is lay down tracks in the opposite direction,</i>

519
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,845
<i>But that only works if the bad guys find the trail</i>

520
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,390
<i>And believe it's for real, which means selling it.</i>

521
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,768
<i>You need to put on a little show, make them feel clever.</i>

522
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,604
<i>When you make somebody work to get a piece of information,</i>

523
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,899
<i>He'll believe it that much more because it was hard to get.</i>

524
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:03,986
Fiona: i am in cara's apartment.

525
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,028
They see me?

526
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,072
Yeah. Hurry up, fi.

527
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,992
Michael, are you worried about me?

528
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,202
That is sweet.

529
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:15,080
Sometimes i feel you're more of a romantic than you realize.

530
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,082
Fi, there are guys with guns outside.

531
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,333
Oh, it's not that bad.

532
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,085
Last week, i was holing in some dodgy -

533
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,379
I don't want to hear about your other jobs, okay?

534
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,256
If i knew you were gonna take this long,

535
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,799
I'd have done it myself.

536
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,218
Don't be silly, dear. You're on their hit list.

537
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:29,261
Just hurry.

538
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,847
Actually, i was thinking that now would be a good time

539
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,516
To talk to you about getting a key to your place.

540
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,268
Fiona, please.

541
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:39,313
What? I'm just saying - It's practical.

542
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,565
I'm not talking about moving in.

543
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,859
I could come over anytime, and - And we could -

544
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,236
Okay, here they come. Get out of there now.

545
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:52,159
So, what do you think? A key?

546
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,413
Two more coming in and disantos.

547
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:02,711
I want an answer.

548
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,130
Fi, go to the back door and get out now.

549
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,715
Yes or no?

550
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,383
Fine! Just get out of there.

551
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,677
Fi! Fiona, get out of there!

552
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,096
God damn it, fi! Get out of there!

553
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,901
As far as disantos and the colombians are concerned,

554
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,237
The stagners are off to salt lake city.

555
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,948
You know, michael, if i'm gonna be there more,

556
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,617
You really ought to get some proper furniture.

557
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,120
So they think we're going to salt lake city,

558
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:37,913
But we're really going...

559
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,874
to buffalo. Tomorrow morning, you're on the first flight.

560
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,585
Airport security is your friend at a time like this.

561
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:44,962
What are we supposed to do in buffalo?

562
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,463
Same thing you do here.

563
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:50,884
There are malls and... clothing stores.

564
00:25:57,683 --> 00:26:00,269
Such a tough age just to get up and move.

565
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,145
I joined the military at her age.

566
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,565
I left home with 50 bucks and a change of clothes.

567
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,401
Was someone trying to chase you down and kill you?

568
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:14,491
I'll, uh... i'll talk to you in the morning.

569
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,743
Yeah, fi?

570
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:20,080
Your egyptian just got back, and he has dinner reservations.

571
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,499
I'll be right there.

572
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,296
<i>Approaching a spy in the middle of a job</i>

573
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,964
<i>Gives you a lot of leverage.</i>

574
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,841
<i>They're playing a delicate game,</i>

575
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:33,093
<i>And the last thing they want is someone coming in</i>

576
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,596
<i>And smashing their delicate game with a brick.</i>

577
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,973
Good to see you, akhom.

578
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,809
<i>"Good to see you, michael, my old friend.</i>

579
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,395
Why, just the other day, i was telling someone -"

580
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,814
Michael. "... how you saved my life. "

581
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:48,817
It's good to see you. I'm in a meeting - Maybe later.

582
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:52,529
I need a few minutes with him. You don't mind, do you?

583
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:57,826
What do you want?

584
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,786
I need your help.

585
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:01,413
Akhom, if it wasn't for me,

586
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,415
You'd be buried somewhere in the desert -

587
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,376
A horror story diplomats tell one another around the campfire,

588
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,045
But you're not because i helped you.

589
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,048
I'm grateful, but you're burned. You're out.

590
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,633
You're still in business, though.

591
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:15,969
Wasn't that the vice chair of the sudanese delegation?

592
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,680
<i>And what is that? That is - Ohh.</i>

593
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,349
What do you want?

594
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:21,767
Well, for starters, a sip of your drink.

595
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,144
I mean, the taste, it's just -

596
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:24,937
Ohh.

597
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:26,647
Oh, and, uh...

598
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:28,649
a copy of the homeland security directive

599
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:30,776
That authorized my burn notice.

600
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:31,777
I can't.

601
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,028
Sure you can,

602
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,072
Because you don't want me to tell your friends there

603
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,908
About the jobs you did on the wrong side of his border.

604
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,454
Maybe he'll forgive you.

605
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:49,503
Yeah, i need an answer... now.

606
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,298
I also need your valet ticket.

607
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,218
Michael. Where is she?

608
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,387
She's gone. The alarm went off, and -

609
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,056
How many men were there? Did you get a look at their car?

610
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,891
What? No, there was nobody.

611
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,601
She snuck out while i was asleep.

612
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,436
It's her spring formal.

613
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,273
Sam - Sam, i need you to get to the safe house.

614
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,941
Sam: yeah, just let me put on some pants.

615
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,026
Come naked. Just get here now.

616
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,445
Michael, if they find sophie, they're gonna -

617
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:16,572
Hey.

618
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,907
I'll find her first.

619
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,631
Sophie. Sophie.

620
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,049
Sophie!

621
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,468
Oh, come on.

622
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:39,928
One night.

623
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:40,888
Just one.

624
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,390
Why can't you just leave me alone?

625
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,895
<i>One night - That's all i wanted,</i>

626
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,396
But you have to be a drama queen!

627
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,856
Why can't you just leave me alone?!

628
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,399
I don't understand.

629
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,818
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

630
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:57,196
Shop class - Where is it?

631
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:00,991
Turn the lights back on.

632
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,409
But they'll find us.

633
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,786
We're not hiding.

634
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:10,125
You will go out the back door.

635
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,293
You're gonna meet me behind the gym,

636
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,754
And i will find you in five minutes.

637
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,091
Seriously, go. I can't.

638
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,426
No arguments! Go!

639
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,845
Sophie, go right now! You can't leave me!

640
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,640
I won't let anything bad happen to you. Go.

641
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,100
Go.

642
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,781
Aah!

643
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:48,539
<i>Basic rule of bodyguarding -</i>

644
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,916
<i>Never fight with the protectee around,</i>

645
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,293
<i>Mostly, because if they happen to catch a stray bullet,</i>

646
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:55,754
<i>You just lost your job.</i>

647
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,686
Sophie?

648
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:14,940
Sophie, bad guys are gone now.

649
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:17,359
Soph?

650
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,326
Sophie: i should have listened to you. I'm sorry.

651
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,787
Let's go.

652
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:33,876
I barely had a chance to go inside.

653
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,590
I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye to my boyfriend.

654
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,426
Boyfriend? I-I thought it was just a date.

655
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:45,012
He could have been my boyfriend.

656
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:48,599
I'll never know now.

657
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,188
I was on this job once in dublin.

658
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,150
The whole plan fell apart, totally compromised.

659
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,569
I only had an hour to get out of the country.

660
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:01,862
I couldn't get word back

661
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:04,740
To a key asset i had developed in the i. R. A.

662
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,499
It was fiona.

663
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:17,336
We were... involved romantically.

664
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,922
Are you guys still together?

665
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,465
No.

666
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,801
But we reconnected later.

667
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,139
Sort of.

668
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,016
Sophie, we should go.

669
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,436
So you're saying that if we're meant to be, we'll find each other.

670
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,106
Sure.

671
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:40,484
You're really bad at this.

672
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:42,903
Yeah.

673
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:47,074
It's just hard, you know?

674
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,745
<i>Leave your whole life behind.</i>

675
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:57,125
Sometimes it can be.

676
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,713
Yeah.

677
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,218
Can we go now?

678
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:17,062
Bottom line is... disantos knows cara hasn't left.

679
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,730
Eventually, he'll hunt her down.

680
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,858
We need a more permanent solution.

681
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,526
It's about time. Fi.

682
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,112
Sam, have you talked to your fbi buddies lately?

683
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,947
Guys, we've been through this, all right?

684
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,366
<i>They're not my buddies. They're just -</i>

685
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,450
<i>Your keepers?</i>

686
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:31,743
<i>Your masters?</i>

687
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,036
That's enough out of you.

688
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,497
They're both by-The-Book suits, right?

689
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:42,421
Yeah, mike, they're feds. I mean, come on.

690
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,425
Why?

691
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,635
<i>Modern technology has made it possible</i>

692
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,846
<i>To do sophisticated electronic surveillance</i>

693
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,724
<i>With stuff from your local electronics store.</i>

694
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,226
<i>It sounds more fun than it is.</i>

695
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,666
Come for that drink?

696
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,876
Another time.

697
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,128
This has gone far enough. We want to make a deal.

698
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:24,796
Good. Fine.

699
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,298
Bring me the girl, we make a deal.

700
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,675
Just listen to this first?

701
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:35,265
Who is this?

702
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:39,311
Uh, yes, mr. Disantos, this is chuck finley,

703
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,313
Attorney for cara stagner.

704
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,483
Mr. Finley, i dislike meetings over the telephone.

705
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,902
Perhaps i could meet with your client face-To-Face.

706
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,153
Well, i just want to tell you

707
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:51,281
That cara stagner is not going to be a problem.

708
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,158
Not a problem?

709
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,993
Now, y-You see, this confuses me

710
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,037
Because i know she made a statement to the police.

711
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,873
Yes, uh, and to the feds, uh...

712
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,125
but, uh, they turned her away.

713
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:05,254
She thought they would put her in witness protection.

714
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,048
Well, she doesn't want to die.

715
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,300
And i don't want to go to jail.

716
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,886
So this is our dilemma.

717
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,347
How can i convince you?

718
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,516
I want a guarantee.

719
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,394
I have to know that she's not going to testify,

720
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:23,272
And the only way i can know this for sure is, uh...

721
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,899
let me tell you how we do this in colombia, eh?

722
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:31,446
<i>Faking surveillance video has come a long way.</i>

723
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:32,781
<i>It used to be you'd spend days</i>

724
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,325
<i>Slaving over a vhs tape with a razor blade.</i>

725
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,786
<i>Now it's a few hours and a computer.</i>

726
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:39,913
<i>Disantos: i don't want to go to jail.</i>

727
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:42,916
<i>Testify? I want witness protection.</i>

728
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,085
<i>I want a guarantee.</i>

729
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:47,171
<i>Do you really think you can hide me?</i>

730
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,548
I've heard legit recordings a hell of a lot worse.

731
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:50,966
Add car noise, it'll sound like

732
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,801
A surveillance van across the street.

733
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,011
Have you talked to the feds yet?

734
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,805
Hmm. Yeah. They're all over it.

735
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:58,348
And they're still asking

736
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:01,810
About your little, um, developing-Nations escapade.

737
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,229
But when they think i'm gonna give them something good,

738
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,815
They buy me lunch.

739
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:11,278
Anyway, he was looking for someone he used to know,

740
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,655
Like an old spy buddy.

741
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,450
I mean, between you and me, i think he's lonely.

742
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:17,493
I couldn't get much more out of him,

743
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:19,786
But i think he's about a six-Pack away from talking,

744
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:20,829
So if you guys could spring for a little -

745
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,706
We're not buying you beer, sam.

746
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:27,503
You want to catch him or not? Oh. Got a present for you.

747
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:30,255
That sure doesn't look like what we asked for.

748
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:32,216
Where's the list of westen's known associates?

749
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,135
How about the inventory of what he's got in that apartment?

750
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,347
No, no, that's much better - Alvaro disantos. Good stuff.

751
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:39,723
Is he involved with westen?

752
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,935
Mnh. No, that's just something i picked up poking around.

753
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:45,187
Kind of a side project.

754
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,688
What the hell you want us to do with it?

755
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:48,774
Only what you boys are legally bound to,

756
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:52,444
Which is take it from me, log it, and pass it upstairs.

757
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:56,114
It's got to be worth a couple thou in reward money, right?

758
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,910
Man, i'm just about ready for dessert.

759
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:15,551
I suppose i should thank you for not blowing out my tires again.

760
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,178
Gellman, you're a better guy than i thought.

761
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:20,681
I bet you got your daughter that pony after all.

762
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:22,933
What the hell are you talking about?

763
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:26,562
Thank you - Talking your client into flipping on the big boys.

764
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:29,356
Assault charge gets kicked, my witness is off the hook -

765
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:31,817
Win-Win.

766
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:32,943
I get it.

767
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,778
You don't discuss client business.

768
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,698
Just know i appreciate it. I really do.

769
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,165
That's for trying to kill me.

770
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,502
Sam: he go for it, mike?

771
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,296
Yeah, he's gonna be on the phone

772
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:54,131
With whatever fbi contacts he's got

773
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,632
Before his tire goes flat.

774
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:58,051
My guess is, he'll have the tape by lunch.

775
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:01,221
We'll see how the big boys in colombia like that.

776
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:03,432
<i>Michael: a drug cartel is a business.</i>

777
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:04,349
<i>If killing a witness</i>

778
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,685
<i>To protect a valued employee from jail time</i>

779
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,771
<i>Is the best way to keep making money, they'll do that.</i>

780
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:11,565
<i>If it looks like</i>

781
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,234
<i>That employee is testifying to the fbi, though,</i>

782
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,487
<i>They're just as happy to leave the witness alone</i>

783
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,906
<i>And take care of the problem another way.</i>

784
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,293
I hear you're thinking about taking a trip,

785
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,003
Going out of town.

786
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:35,422
What? Who told you that?

787
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,926
I got some friends with the fbi.

788
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,345
Fbi?

789
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,726
What the -

790
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,144
No!

791
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:51,563
It's not true! Don't!

792
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:01,490
Shame to let them have all the fun.

793
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:03,951
I'm just glad it's done.

794
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,581
Do i get to have my key now?

795
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,654
Micheal?

796
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,496
Your mother?

797
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:52,541
She's nice.

798
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,793
I went by your house, and fiona told me you were here.

799
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,587
I hope that's okay.

800
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,629
No, it's fine.

801
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,007
Well, we just wanted to say thank you...

802
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,134
...in person.

803
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,970
Also, i could pay you - You know, when i get my check.

804
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,306
Don't worry - Oleg has been more than generous.

805
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,683
But - No, seriously.

806
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,312
Sophie: cool car.

807
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:15,689
We'll see if it works.

808
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:19,151
Hey, what do you know?

809
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,655
Your mom said this was your dad's car.

810
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:25,282
Sounds like he was a pretty cool guy.

811
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:28,202
Not really. I left home for a reason.

812
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,662
Well, i'm glad that i didn't have to.

813
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:48,388
"Beloved" is a bit of a stretch.

814
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,907
Thanks for the car, dad.

815
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,284
I think you'd like how it looks.

816
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:14,957
<i>We meet here?</i>

817
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:18,168
You wanted someplace safe. It's quiet, lots of cover.

818
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:20,796
Two guys in business suits don't raise any eyebrows.

819
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,756
You should have more meetings outside, thabet.

820
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,091
Get some color.

821
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:27,261
You were always good, michael. It's a shame you're out.

822
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,721
I'm gonna get back in.

823
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:34,518
I've enjoyed our friendship, but...

824
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:37,813
but don't call you ever again. I got it.

825
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,236
Michael.

826
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,531
Be careful.

827
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,081
<i>An alphanumeric tracking code</i>

828
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:59,001
<i>And a special-Access program code name.</i>

829
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:03,213
<i>It's not much, but it's a start.</i>
