Ex-girlfriend...</i>

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Should we shoot them?

12

<i>... An old friend who's
Informing on you to the FBI...</i>

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,200
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,000
<i>... Family, too...</i>

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,200
Is that your mom again?

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,800

<i>... And you'll just
Piss him off.</i>

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,600
Good to see you.

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
I figured you'd find me
Sooner or later.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,300
Everyone!

31
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Everyone, this is officer
Jason Bly of the css.

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,800
It is a branch of the NSA,

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,500
Performing covert intelligence
Support for the military.

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,300
All right, that's enough.
You think so?

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,600
I was gonna go into
The history of the service,

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,700
Give people
Some background.

37
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,100
Not a bad picture.
I take terrible photo I.D.'s.

38
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,800
One of the reasons why

39
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,300
I never worked for any
Service branch directly.

40
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,900
I suppose you think
That you're gonna be able

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,800
To leverage
Stealing my agency I.D. card

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Into a ticket off the blacklist?

43
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,000
No, I just wanted
To get to know you better.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, i've been getting to know
You and your friends...

45
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,200
Sam axe, Fiona Glenanne,
Your mother.

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,600
Oh, Bly,
I thought I told you.6

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
This is just between you and me.

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,700
See, I don't think so.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,500
Adjusting to your circumstances
Is a process.

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,300
It's natural for there to be
Some grieving, some anger...

51
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,200
Some denial.

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,100
Involving your friends and family's

53
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,700
An important part of adjusting.

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,900
For example, your girlfriend, Fiona.

55
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,600
She's not my girlfriend.

56
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
On again, off again.

57
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,400
That is a complicated
Relationship.

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,900
I've been listening
To the surveillance tapes...

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,200
You know, I think...

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,900
Well, I think both of you
Have issues.

61
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,000
One man's opinion. That's true.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,500
She is coming here to meet you,
Isn't she?

63
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,300
If my information's correct,
She should be here shortly.

64
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,600
Oh, hey. There she is.

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,300
Mike, she is a really
Fine-looking girl.

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,400
She does take risks, though,
Doesn't she?

67
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,300
That car was stolen
Three weeks ago.

68
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,600
Have you looked inside the trunk?

69
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,700
Seems that she's been doing
Some gun dealing.

70
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,200
Yeah. She can take care of herself.

71
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,800
No. You should talk to her.

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,400
You should talk to her,
Because if she gets caught,

73
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,100
You may never be able to resolve

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,900
Those thorny relationship issues.

75
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,400
Oh. You should get going.

76
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
Hey, i'll get the check.

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,400
Go. Go!

78
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
Michael, what? Bly set you up.

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,900
Do you have guns
In the trunk?

80
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,600
Fi?

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
A few semiautomatics, yeah.

82
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,700
I got a deal, Michael.

83
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,300
This guy was selling
Browning .9 millimeters

84
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,700
For 200 bucks apiece.

85
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,900
You have unregistered weapons
In a stolen car, Fi!

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,500
You know,

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,900
You have always had a problem
With my work.

88
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,400
I have always supported you.

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm helping people,
You're running guns!

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,100
Big difference.

91
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,100
Is the car at least clean?

92
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,300
Good.

93
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,700
<i>the longer you run
From the police,</i>

94
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,900
<i>the more certain you are
To get caught.</i>

95
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,200
<i>there's a small window of time
After a chase begins</i>

96
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,800
<i>before backup arrives,</i>

97
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,900
<i>before helicopters
Are deployed.</i>

98
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,800
<i>if you want any chance
Of getting away,</i>

99
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,500
<i>you'd best use this time
To find someplace secluded...</i>

100
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,400
Here, here.

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
<i>... And bail out.</i>

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,300
See you back at the loft?

103
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,600
Oh, here he is now.
I'll talk to you later.

104
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Your mom says, "hi."

105
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,400
How did you get here so fast?

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Oh, I got a ride

107
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,900
From a pleasant retired
Gentleman named Hubert.

108
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,100
He was concerned for my safety.

109
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,200
Let me get this straight.

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,500
I was set up by Bly?

111
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,700
Revenge for stealing his wallet?

112
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,500
He wasn't gonna send you to jail.

113
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Too much paperwork.
He knew I'd save you.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,100
Save me?
I don't need saving.

115
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,800
The point is,
It was a message for me

116
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,700
To shut up and accept
That i've been burned for good

117
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,600
Or my friends and family
Are fair game.

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I see.

119
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,900
Just curious... Which am I?

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,700
Can we discuss this later?

121
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,100
So once Bly gets taken care of,

122
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,300
We can discuss our relationship?

123
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,800
Sure.

124
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,100
I don't suppose killing him
Would expedite that?

125
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,100
No, Fi, no.
He's the best connection I have.

126
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,900
He can tell me why I was burned,
Who did this to me.

127
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,500
I need to get some leverage.

128
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,600
If I got to go to war with Bly,

129
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,400
I got to put some cash together.

130
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,800
These guys come down
And make me give them money...

131
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
... Every couple of days.

132
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,400
At first, they said
It was for protection.

133
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Now they don't even bother to lie.

134
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
<i>they work for this bruja,
Concha ramirez.</i>

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
She's got guys all around here.

136
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,300
A woman boss. How progressive.

137
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
Listen, pretty soon,
I can't be in business no more.

138
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,600
I talked to my friend Javier.

139
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,200
<i>you helped him with that cabrón...</i>

140
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,900
That came after his kid.

141
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,000
And asked him not
To talk about it, yeah.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
What exactly are you looking for?

143
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,500
I got 20 grand.

144
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,800
I want them out of the neighborhood.

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,200
No, I want them gone.

146
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
These guys work for this woman, Concha.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,400
It sounds like an organization.

148
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,600
Javier said you could handle it.

149
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,500
Aw, I'm flattered, but...

150
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,000
They're ruining
The neighborhood, okay?

151
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,000
People who lived on this block
Their whole lives

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Are losing everything.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
My pops built this place.

154
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,800
I ain't giving up without a fight.

155
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,600
Have you tried
Talking to the police?

156
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
They come, give me paperwork,
And go back to coral gables.

157
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,600
I try to get the neighborhood to
Fight, but they're scared.

158
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,500
We got families.

159
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,300
I need your help.

160
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,200
10 grand now,
The rest after.

161
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,600
I'll see what I can do.

162
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,200
Don't "i'll see what I can do."
Do it.

163
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,600
You're the last chance we got.

164
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Okay.

165
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,500
Yeah, Sam?

166
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Hey, Mike.
We got a situation here.

167
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,700
Your buddy Bly talked to my
Girlfriend, and she's pissed.

168
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Hi, honey.

169
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,500
She hit me with one of those
Meat tenderizers.

170
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,800
Sam, get in here!

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Okay, honey. Just a minute.

172
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Do you want an extraction team?

173
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,100
I'll let you know. What about Bly?

174
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,400
The son of a bitch is doing
Scorched-earth number here.

175
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm taking care of it.

176
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,300
See if you can get out in one piece.

177
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,700
Yeah.

178
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,800
Sweetie, hey.
Easy now. Come on.

179
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,400
A CIA agent came into my home.

180
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Look, it wasn't CIA, it was CSS.

181
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,300
It's a branch of
The national security agency.

182
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,700
He told me you were seeing
That whore in bal harbour.

183
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,100
I was just going
To get my clothes.

184
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,500
It's over, pumpkin.

185
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,700
Oh!

186
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,800
Mike, this is some serious
Collateral damage.

187
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,900
I mean, I like this girl.
We got to do something.

188
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,500
I know. I know.

189
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,600
I think this will be enough cash
To take care of Bly,

190
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,500
Maybe even find out
Why I was burned.

191
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,500
What, are you gonna
Throw money at him?

192
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,300
Something like that.
I'll work out the details.

193
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,900
You know anything
About this gang?

194
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,600
They work for a cuban émigré
Named Concha Ramirez.

195
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,000
She works out of a restaurant
On Miami beach.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,700
I don't know. Organized crime
Is a pain in the ass.

197
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,400
There's a reason
I didn't become a FED.

198
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,500
We just need them to decide

199
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,900
The neighborhood's not worth
The trouble and move on.

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,500
Scare the hell out of them.

201
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
Sounds like fun.

202
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,300
Let's do the recon,
Check out her soldiers,

203
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,600
Take a look at Concha,
And see what we're dealing with.

204
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,200
Here you go, Sam.

205
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,500
Buy your girlfriend
Some flowers.

206
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,600
Oh, Mike, it's gonna take
More than flowers.

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,700
I mean, she's pretty pissed.

208
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,800
This Bly was rude...
I mean, really rude.

209
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,400
She's feeling a little better now.

210
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,900
Okay, perfect. Thanks.

211
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,700
I'll get the check.

212
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,200
When you gonna get a real car?

213
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,500
This thing's like a toy.

214
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,900
Veronica was gonna get me a cadillac

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,200
Until Mike's surveillance guy
Screwed everything up.

216
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
A cadillac?

217
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,700
What could you possibly be doing
To these women?

218
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,900
Wouldn't you like to know?

219
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,100
There she is.

220
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,800
Wow. Not bad for a crime boss.

221
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,400
<i>dice que no puede pagar.
Que tiene un chiquito enfermo.</i>

222
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,800
<i>¿com\an no puede pagar?
¿porqu\ t? Me traes esto?</i>

223
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,900
<i>mira, si él no puede pagar
Díle, pregúntale a la esposa,</i>

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
<i>"¿si tienes el seguro
De la vida?"</i>

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,300
<i>porqu\ t...
Mira, yo te di ésto... Usalo.</i>

226
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,900
<i>¿porqu\ t me traes \sto?i>

227
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,400
<i>vaya.</i>

228
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,300
Get in there.

229
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,900
<i>in intelligence work,</i>

230
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,200
<i>surveillance
Is called "coverage."</i>

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,500
<i>it's like basketball...</i>

232
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,300
<i>you can run zone defense
Or man-to-man.</i>

233
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,500

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,900

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,300
<i>... And you can catch up

240
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,000
Charo.

241
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
<i>Mira que yo tengo

242
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,500
<i>No saque es aqu^.</i>

243
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
<i>no habla.
Entrale, entra.</i>

244
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,400
They're leaning hard
On the neighborhood.

245
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,900
Bad business... Driving away
People who are paying you off.

246
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,100
So they're amateurs.

247
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
That'll make it easier
To get rid of them.

248
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm not sure it was a good idea
To give Sam the caf?

249
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,700
Three cuban coffees in,

250
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,400
His camerawork
Gets kind of jittery.

251
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
It's not the coffee.

252
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,700
He has lady-friend problems.

253
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,400
You know, I have to say,

254
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,000
Sam's romantic side is surprising.

255
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,900
Not now, Fi.
I'm talking about sam.

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,400
And you're going to use Sam
As a way to talk about us.

257
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,800
After.

258
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,200
All right?

259
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,300
All right.

260
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,500
But I promise you,
If I'm not satisfied,

261
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,200
Then I am gonna kick your ass.

262
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,100
<i>explaining the rules
Of covert ops</i>

263
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,300
<i>is always a challenge.</i>

264
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,300
<i>it's a world where good guys
Look like bad guys</i>

265
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,000
<i>and two wrongs do, in fact,
Make a right.</i>

266
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,700
I got to bust up your counter.

267
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,300
You want to smash up my counter?

268
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,800
And a few other things.
It's part of the plan, Ernie.

269
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,900
No, I already got enough people

270
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,400
Who want to smash up my place.

271
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,900
I don't need anymore.

272
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,000
The only way this ends
Is if these guys think

273
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
They're up against somebody
Worse than they are.

274
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,700
I thought you were supposed
To protect the neighborhood.

275
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,300
If I act like a security guard,

276
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
They're just gonna send more guys.

277
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,600
My friend said you could fight.

278
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,800
He said you were, you know,
Special forces.

279
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,500
Bullets don't bounce off
My skin, Ernie.

280
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm gonna solve this,
But I got to do it my way.

281
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,600
And, Ernie, Ernie, look.
I need your help.

282
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,100
What do you want me to do?

283
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,500
I need you to spread the word

284
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
That some serious psycho
Robbed your place.

285
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,600
And please, please,

286
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,300
Keep your mouth shut
About hiring me,

287
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,600
Or you'll get us both killed,
You understand?

288
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,500
There's no turning back, Ernie,
After I do this.

289
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,000
If you want to walk away,
Now's the time.

290
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,300
I don't walk away. Do it.

291
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
All right, call the cops
In five minutes.

292
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,100
So, my job is to say
That a psycho robbed my store.

293
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,800
What's your job?

294
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,900
I get to be the psycho.

295
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,400
Trust me, that's
The hard part. Aah!

296
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,100
<i>as cover I.D.'s go,</i>

297
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,400
<i>I prefer rich businessman
Or international playboy</i>

298
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,500
<i>to crazy thief,</i>

299
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
<i>but if the situation
Calls for it,</i>

300
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,600
<i>you do what you have to do.</i>

301
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,800
What's this dude doing on my car?

302
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, boys, boys, boys.
You need to do me a favor.

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,500
Nothing personal, but you need
To leave the neighborhood.

304
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,300
Yeah, well, why's that?

305
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,800
Because it's mine.

306
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,800
And they're out of here!

307
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,900
<i>¿qu?Diablos pas? Eh?</i>

308
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,700
<i>no s? Mano.
Un hombre... Estaba loco.</i>

309
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,800
<i>pues, entra. Entra.</i>

310
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
<i>Concha quiere hablar
Contigo.</i>

311
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
They made it back...
Barely.

312
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,800
Nice work.

313
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,300
I'd say 8.5 for style.

314
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,500
Maybe 9 for execution.

315
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,300
Quite a compliment.
Keep an eye out.

316
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
See what moves they make.
They'll be back soon enough.

317
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,300
We get to babysit the bad guys
For a while.

318
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,200
You've been checking that thing
All day. Expecting a call?

319
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
No.

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,500
Well, the...
The lady friend.

321
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,400
Send her flowers?

322
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Yes, I sent her flowers.

323
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,400
Why do you think
I'm checking my phone?

324
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,400
What did the card say?

325
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,900
It said,
"I'm sorry. Call me."

326
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,600
She doesn't need, "I'm sorry."

327
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,000
She needs to know who you are,

328
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,800
Where she stands.

329
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,400
I would imagine.

330
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,400
All right, well, let's say
I sent her a second card.

331
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,700
What would it say?

332
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,800
Jason Bly.
Always a pleasure.

333
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,300
Nice job ditching the police
The other day.

334
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,800
You always manage those things
With such style.

335
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,800
Maybe it's the sunglasses.
Where did you get them?

336
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, an algerian special-OPS guy
I tangled with a while back.

337
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
He didn't need them anymore.

338
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,700
I'd part with them if you'd
Tell me why I got burned.

339
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,400
Tempting, but that's classified.

340
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,100
No, I just came by to see

341
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,000
If you'd reconsidered
Your position at all.

342
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,400
I've been reading up
On your exploits.

343
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,100
You are a man of many talents.

344
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,200
Nice to be appreciated.

345
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,000
My hope...
My commitment, really,

346
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,200
Is that you'll find a new outlet
For your skills here in Miami,

347
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
A new outlet that involves
You settling down

348
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
And no longer making problems
For the intelligence community.

349
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
I see.
You got any ideas?

350
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Well, I realize that
You probably don't have much

351
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,600
In the way of job references

352
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,300
From your times in afghanistan
Or the former Soviet Republics,

353
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,400
So I am prepared to offer you
Full-time employment...

354
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,100
Papers and references.

355
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,300
You'll start as a security guard
At a bank.

356
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,500
And who knows where things
Might go from there?

357
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Really?
A security guard?

358
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,500
A new life as a private citizen.
A spook no more.

359
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,300
I'll think about it.

360
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,900
You do that.
I'll be in touch.

361
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,200
Barry, it's Michael.
We need to meet.

362
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,300
I want you to set up a business
For a friend of mine...

363
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,500
A government worker,
Name is Jason Bly, B-L-Y.

364
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,700
What kind of business you have
In mind for your friend?

365
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,600
Let's keep it vague.

366
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,900
I supplied the cash,
But I need you to set it up.

367
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,400
He'll need bank accounts,
An offshore corporation or two.

368
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,700
He'll need to make
Some purchases.

369
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,200
Is your friend gonna
Know about this business?

370
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,400
I'd like it to be a surprise.

371
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,100
So, I help you set up
This schmuck Bly.

372
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,900
I just want to know,
What's in it for me?

373
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,600
30% commission,
And i'll owe you one.

374
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Three grand? Come on.

375
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,900
I'll do it,
But you'll owe me big.

376
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,100
You know I'm good for it.

377
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,800
How do you think I feel?
This is crazy.

378
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,900
I give you all this money,
And I don't even see you.

379
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm a criminal
Terrorizing their neighborhood.

380
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,600
How's it gonna look
If we're seen together?

381
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,100
They came back, you know?
More of them this time.

382
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,500
They hit a couple of places
Down the block.

383
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,500
They're not gonna
Leave your neighborhood alone

384
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,700
Because a couple of guys
Got beat up.

385
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
It's a business, ernie.
They're making money.

386
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
When are they gonna
Leave the neighborhood?

387
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
When I make it clear to them

388
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,300
That the cost of doing business
In your neighborhood

389
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,900
Will be unacceptably high.

390
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
That better be soon.

391
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Get the money and a six pack.

392
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,000
<i>the term "shock and awe"</i>

393
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,300
<i>gets misused a lot these days.</i>

394
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,000
<i>it's a popular name
For a military tactic</i>

395
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,100
<i>known as rapid dominance.</i>

396
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,800
<i>whether you do it
With a 1,000-pound bomb</i>

397
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,200
<i>or with a can of turpentine
And a power drill,</i>

398
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
<i>it's all about
Being spectacular.</i>

399
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,000
<i>vamanos!</i>

400
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,900
<i>kill the electronic brain
Of any late-model car,</i>

401
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,800
<i>and it's dead...</i>

402
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,600
<i>won't start, windows won't open.</i>

403
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,600
<i>then you can pretty much do
Whatever you want.</i>

404
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,300
No gun, no gun!

405
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,200
<i>no, no, no! ¿t?Quieres
Explotar aqu?Adentro?</i>

406
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,300
Highly flammable!

407
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,000
You shoot me,
You set yourself on fire.

408
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
But that won't kill you.

409
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
The fire will suck the oxygen
Out, and you'll suffocate.

410
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,100
Then you'll burn, but first
You'll suffocate to death.

411
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,400
Fascinating, isn't it?

412
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Give me the money.

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
Give me the money!

414
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
Now! Let's go!

415
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,300
<i>rápido! Move it!</i>

416
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,400
This neighborhood is mine!
You hear me?

417
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
My neighborhood!

418
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,800
My neighborhood!
This neighborhood is mine!

419
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
All right! It's yours!

420
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,100
<i>piss off a criminal organization</i>

421
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,400
<i>and you could end up dead.</i>

422
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,600
You're pretty slick, huh?

423
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,100
<i>but if they don't kill you,
They've got plans for you.</i>

424
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,400
Come on.
Come with me. Go.

425
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,000
<i>there's no substitute
For improvisation.</i>

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
<i>even the best plans
Can't anticipate everything.</i>

427
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,200
<i>you better be able
To roll with the punches.</i>

428
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Get him up.
Bring him here.

429
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,300
My name is Consuela.
They call me Concha.

430
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,100
Nice to meet you, Consuela.

431
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,900
Shut up.

432
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,500
<i>diego, por favor.</i>

433
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That bodega that you robbed...

434
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,500
You know, that guy, the owner,
He gives us a lot of trouble.

435
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,600
Doesn't seem so tough to me.

436
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,100
You could have saved us a lot
Of trouble if you killed him,

437
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,800
But you attack luis,
You attack oscar,

438
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,000
Now everybody's talking about
The crazy gringo.

439
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
I think
I have to meet you.

440
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,900
Crazy? I like to think of myself
As dedicated.

441
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,700
<i>s?</i>

442
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
But you have to understand
Something...

443
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,500
This block, for me, is not about
Money from some small shops.

444
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,200
<i>it's about real estate,
¿entiendes?</i>

445
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Oh, you're buying it?

446
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,600
Exactly, and when the business
Gets bad enough,

447
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,300
They will sell to me.

448
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,900
You know, I thought about
Killing you,

449
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,800
But then I think,
"oh, maybe not.

450
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,000
Maybe I have this guy
Work for me."

451
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Work for you?

452
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,400
The thing is,
I'm not the employee type.

453
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,600
I've had some problems
In the past with some jobs,

454
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,100
Some unpleasantness...
You know, water-cooler stuff.

455
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Like I said,
I am very determined.

456
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,800
You will work for me.

457
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
<i>they say you only get
One chance</i>

458
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,800
<i>to make a first impression
With an employer.</i>

459
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,000
<i>doesn't matter if you're
A store manager</i>

460
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
<i>or a strong-arm guy...</i>

461
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
<i>you have to put
Your best foot forward.</i>

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We make collections
Every two or three days.

463
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,200
Do about half the stores
On the street.

464
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,000
Next time,
We do the others.

465
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Where are your boys?

466
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
They don't make collections
Around here no more,

467
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Not with you anyway.

468
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,400
Tell them I said hi.

469
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Hey, you can do that psycho crap
With Concha,

470
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
<i>but not with me,
¿comprendes?</i>

471
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,800
And I don't want you
Pouring turpentine on nobody

472
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,100
While we're working,
You got that?

473
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,600
How's the real-estate business going?

474
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Eh, it's too complicated.
I'm old-school.

475
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,700
Used to be a bookie,
Worked down at Jai Alai,

476
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
Lent money, had my own crew.

477
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,800
The guy I worked for, though,

478
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,600
Was into a lot of money
With Concha.

479
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,700
<i>crazy puta shot him
Right in front of his kids</i>

480
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
During a birthday party,

481
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,400
But I needed the work,
So I ended up with her.

482
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
How's it working for a lady boss?

483
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,800
Woman, man, I don't care, you know?

484
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,200
I just don't want to be out in
The street working at my age.

485
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,200
This place...
The guy's behind a little.

486
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,300
Just have to push him
A little bit.

487
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,800
Not too much, though, you understand?

488
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Not too much.

489
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,600
He's an old man.

490
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,400
Look, you want this neighborhood
To go down fast, right?

491
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,900
This nickel-and-dime stuff
Is gonna take forever.

492
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,000
<i>any new employer is looking
For the same things...</i>

493
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
<i>are you willing to go
The extra mile?</i>

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,900
<i>can you take the initiative,
Impress them?</i>

495
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,800
You want this neighborhood
To go downhill? I'll show you.

496
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,800
Hey, honey!

497
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,800
Honey! Yeah, you!

498
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,100
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

499
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Get out!
Give me your bag!

500
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,400
Give me your money!
Give me your money!

501
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,900
Fi, sell it!

502
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,200
Give me your bag.

503
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,500
Fi!

504
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Fi, give me the bag, Fi.
Let it go.

505
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,700
See, this is how
You get a neighborhood.

506
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,800
<i>¿están loco, hombre?</i>

507
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,500
What?
This is how you do it.

508
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,400
No, you don't do this.

509
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,500
What did I say, huh?

510
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,100
Whatever, I thought
The point was...

511
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,500
You start mugging people
On the street,

512
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,300
We're gonna
Have the cops down here.

513
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Now we can't make
No more collections today.

514
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,900
Well, she's got 100 bucks here.

515
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,700
Bah!

516
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,400
We got to talk to Concha
About this later.

517
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
You understand? Huh?
I do.

518
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
<i>no tiene nada aqu?</i>

519
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,600
Okay. Buh-bye.

520
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,600
Oh, you're home.

521
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,500
Oh, Michael Westen,
You look fabulous.

522
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,300
Good thing about being
Out of a job...

523
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
I can dress how I like now.

524
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
One of your little side projects.

525
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't want to know.

526
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,100
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

527
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,700
No, make yourself comfortable.
You want a yogurt or something?

528
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,100
Uh, I had one. Not bad.

529
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,200
I don't want to sound
Inhospitable, but...

530
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,400
Don't you need a warrant
To be in here?

531
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,200
Aren't your superiors
Going to be a little concerned?

532
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,900
We're a little past warrants,
Aren't we?

533
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,900
I don't think you and I

534
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,200
Need to worry about official
Protocol at this point.

535
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,800
You know, you're the one
That made this personal.

536
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,100
You got a new rental car.

537
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah, they upgraded me yesterday.

538
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
Man, I have to say, Miami
Has treated me pretty well.

539
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
That makes one of us.

540
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,000
Listen, I hope that you took
My job offer seriously,

541
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,500
Because round one
Was just a warm-up.

542
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
In round two,

543
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,200
Your brother lands in jail
If he's not careful,

544
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,900
And Fiona has some associates

545
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,700
Who are very interested
To know where she is...

546
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,900
Angry, angry people.

547
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,600
What do you say?

548
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,800
Leave them alone, Bly.
I'll take the job.

549
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,100
Good call. Good call.

550
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,300
You're gonna love
Being a security guard.

551
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh, you get to brush up
On your reading and...

552
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,500
Well, you get to brush up
On your reading.

553
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,200
All right, we'll talk soon.

554
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,000
<i>in any new job, there's always
Friction with your co-workers.</i>

555
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,400
<i>they're wondering if the boss
Likes the new guy better,</i>

556
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,900
<i>if he's going to make them
Look bad.</i>

557
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,200
<i>in some jobs, that can get you
A dark look in the break room.</i>

558
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,100
<i>in other jobs, that can get you
A bullet in the head.</i>

559
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,400
I wish I could have seen it.

560
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
You went right in the car,
And you took her purse?

561
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You should have seen her face
When I opened the door.

562
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,400
The cops were all over the street

563
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,900
Asking questions for hours,
Trying to find the lady.

564
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,900
Well, you know,
Diego's right, of course.

565
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,700
Street crime like that
Can be very dangerous for us,

566
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,900
But I appreciate your dedication.

567
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,100
He can't go back there now.

568
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,200
He can't make collections with
Cops asking everyone about him.

569
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,600
<i>diego, da un momento, por favor.</i>

570
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
I don't think that guy likes me.

571
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,000
He's old-fashioned, wants rules.

572
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,600
He likes when people
Respect the rules.

573
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,000
And you?

574
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
When the coast guard found me,
I had nothing.

575
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,600
<i>Mira.</i>

576
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,600
I didn't build all of this...
By following rules.

577
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,400
However you pull it off, sign me up.

578
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,400
I want to talk to you
About something...

579
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,400
A special job.

580
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,500
You know the bodega,
The one that you robbed?

581
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
You want me to knock it off again?

582
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,900
There's not much there.

583
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,700
No, it's this man,
The owner, Ernie Paseo.

584
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,600
He makes lots of problems for us.

585
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,200
He calls the cops, talks to
The neighbors, meets with them.

586
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
I hear he's thinking about
Getting outside security, too.

587
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,700
Sounds like a problem.

588
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,400
A problem that I think
You can make go away.

589
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,400
He goes, the whole neighborhood
Goes with him

590
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,900
In just a few months.

591
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,200
Kill him?

592
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,000
<i>s? Maybe a fire.</i>

593
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,500
Do the whole family,

594
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Because I don't want to deal
With lawyers or inheritance.

595
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,800
She wants to kill me?

596
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,800
I thought you were gonna
Make this better.

597
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,500
I'm working on it, Ernie.

598
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,900
She can kill my whole family?

599
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,600
She plans on killing me, too,

600
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,700
If that makes you feel any better.

601
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,800
Can we call the police?

742
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:11,900
I'm supposed to be a hit man.

602
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,160
It's not like I can get
Them on tape,

603
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,570
And the police won't be
Able to do anything,

604
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,080
And Concha will
Come after both of us.

605
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,560
Just trust me. 
You just need to get out of town,

606
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,500
And i'll let you know when
It's safe to come back.

607
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,370
30 years. The store's
Never been closed.

608
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,640
Well, then it's time
For a vacation.

609
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,260
Take your family.
Go to Disney World.

610
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,420
Just get out of town.

611
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,530
You can do this, right?

612
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,620
I'm giving you everything,
All my savings.

613
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,970
And I promise you,
I'm earning every penny.

614
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,150
I can do this.

615
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,700
I just need you to trust me.

616
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,950
<i>military firebombs</i>

617
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,080
<i>are typically white phosphorus
Or chlorine trifluoride.</i>

618
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,580
<i>these are remarkably effective,</i>

619
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,280
<i>but they're also unstable,
Lethally toxic,</i>

620
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,600
<i>and hard to find
At the grocery store.</i>

621
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,910
<i>the main ingredient
In a homemade firebomb,</i>

622
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,360
<i>on the other hand,
Is styrofoam.</i>

623
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,720
<i>a military demolitions expert</i>

624
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,090
<i>could put something together
In a few hours.</i>

625
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,400
<i>an i.r.a.-trained guerilla
Could do it in 20 minutes,</i>

626
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,200
<i>give or take.</i>

627
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,000
All right,Fi. I'm off.

628
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,190
I'll talk to you later.

629
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,700
Be careful out there.

630
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,660
So, you do this,and you call me
After, all right?

631
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,910
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

632
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,640
I put the bomb down,
It goes boom... Nice and easy.

633
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,970
We meet later,
I'll take you to Concha.

634
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,340
Everything gonna be...

635
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,590
Hell. Bodega's closed.

636
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,460
It's never closed. Somebody told him.

637
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,790
Nobody told him.

638
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,970
Then why isn't he...

639
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,700
'Cause you're the target, not Ernie.

640
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,170
I'm sorry I got to do this.
I talked to Concha.

641
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,710
She told me to do it.
It's nobody's fault.

642
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,850
It's just times are changing,
And you got to go.

643
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,890
She told you to kill me?

644
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,620
She told me I could do it
Before or after Ernie.

645
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,610
I figure it was just
Easier to do it now.

646
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,370
I was supposed to kill you.

647
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,900
What?!

648
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,170
I was supposed to kill you.

649
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,980
That's what she... She told you?

650
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,150
Yeah.

651
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,040
'Cause then... And then...

652
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,080
Me and you.

653
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,230
Probably she'll do it later.

654
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,120
That's how she does it, you know?

655
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,080
She doesn't care about anybody.

656
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,570
She did my own boss the same way.

657
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,510
Listen to me... She'll do you,too.

658
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,990
Turn around on your knees.
On your knees!

659
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,800
Listen to me. Listen to me!
Concha's crazy.

660
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,130
Yeah, no arguments here.

661
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,250
She's... She's killing people...
Our people.

662
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,500
It's got to stop.

663
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,360
I should have stopped
It a long time ago.

664
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,420
We shouldn't be here
Doing these things.

665
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,840
Maybe you're just a psycho.

666
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,800
If that's true,
Then shoot me. Shoot me.

667
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,130
But if not, let me finish this.

668
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,710
I will deal with Concha.

669
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,190
You walk away... I walk away.

670
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,030
I walk away!

671
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,720
Never see each other.
The neighborhood is yours.

672
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,360
How would you do it?

673
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,550
<i>being a spy,
You have to get comfortable</i>

674
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,750
<i>with the idea of people doing
Bad things for good reasons,</i>

675
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,880
<i>doing good things for bad reasons.</i>

676
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,970
<i>you do the best you can.</i>

677
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,270
You can go back to your store.

678
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,200
They're never gonna come to
Your neighborhood again.

679
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,080
You can count it... It's all there.

680
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,460
That's all right.

681
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,910
Actually, here.

682
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,780
That's most of it back,
Less some expenses.

683
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,210
I just needed a wad of cash

684
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,080
To run through some bank accounts.

685
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,780
It's complicated.

686
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,800
I wasn't gonna take your life savings.

687
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,450
I don't know what to say.

688
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,140
I'm gonna tell the others so that
They know what you did.

689
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,400
No, seriously, it ends here.

690
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,240
For everyone's safety,

691
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,550
You can never tell anyone,
Ever, about this.

692
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,900
I'm just some crazy guy who
Robbed your store one day.

693
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,690
And we can never meet again,
You understand?

694
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,380
Thank you.

695
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,380
I'm gonna go.

696
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,720
The retirement luncheon
For Michael Westen.

697
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,660
I love it. I should have
Brought you a gold watch.

698
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,640
Have a seat.

699
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,850
I have your new life right here.

700
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,400
You'll start on the night shift,

701
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,180
But if you're a good boy,
Work hard, keep your nose clean,

702
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,650
You will be the day security
Manager in a couple years,

703
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,490
And I think that there's a
Dental plan in there,too.

704
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,350
This... Is awkward.

705
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,970
I've decided not to take the job.

706
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,020
Oh, Michael.

707
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,450
I am down here
On a government paycheck.

708
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,730
The good citizens of this country

709
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,340
Are gonna continue to pay me
To make your life miserable.

710
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,660
I'm telling you, take
A look at this folder.

711
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,080
It'd be much easier for both of us.

712
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:30,340
Actually, I have an even
Bigger folder.

713
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,720
You like to talk about our close,
Personal friendship.

714
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,280
I took it a step further.

715
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,320
I set up an offshore business
In both of our names.

716
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,410
I gave you $100,000
In cash over the last week.

717
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,930
Actually, it's just 10 grand
Deposited over and over,

718
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,740
But it sure looks like
A whole lot of money.

719
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,570
What are you talking about?
Not done.

720
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,850
There are other things
That document our friendship.

721
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,140
Uh, there's you in my place
Without a warrant

722
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,180
Eating my yogurt.

723
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,030
There you are riding around
In a convertible mustang,

724
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,930
Which I upgraded you to.

725
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,280
You're welcome.

726
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:07,950
I got to say, it looks pretty
Convincing to me.

727
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,220
That's a career-ender there,
Agent Bly.

728
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,840
All right, I'm listening.

729
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,170
I want the dossier
On my burn notice.

730
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,830
Yeah, confidential, I know,

731
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,090
But since we're such close,
Personal friends...

732
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,470
We can keep this just between us.

733
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,200
I'll wait for your call, buddy.

734
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,410
Hey buddy

735
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,810
Listen, I just wanted
To let you know

736
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,400
That the lady friend got a big,
Fat apology from your buddy Bly,

737
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,510
So you pulled it off.

738
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,760
It worked out okay?

739
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,010
Oh, better than okay.

740
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,760
I got a toothbrush here now,

741
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,740
And I think I might get
That cadillac, too.

742
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,150
Kind of a makeup present.

743
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,900
So there's no hard feelings?

744
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,310
No, no, I think it boosted
My cred, actually.

745
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,550
I mean, I got the css to back off.

746
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,840
I got some super
Spy juice going now.

747
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,590
Glad I could help, Sam.

748
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,990
Oh, Mike,

749
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,550
One other thing I wanted
To give you a heads-up on.

750
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,960
I just got off the phone
With Fi a few minutes ago.

751
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,120
You know, she's been helping me

752
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,000
With this whole girlfriend thing,

753
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,220
And just wanted to tell you man-to-man,

754
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,920
You better get ready
For the big talk.

755
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,280
She is coming over there.
She should be there any...

756
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,540
Got to go.

757
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,710
Hi.

758
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,760
So, Bly is gone.

759
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:46,370
As promised, we talk about us,
Or I kick your ass.

760
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,960
Fi, I don't know what to tell you.

761
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,770
You promised, Michael.

762
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,180
Yeah, I promised to talk about it.

763
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,990
I didn't promise
I'd know what to say.

764
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,290
I just want to know where I stand.

765
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,610
I've been here a while.
It's been fun.

766
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,240
Is this going anywhere?

767
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,110
Fi, do you remember
When we were together?

768
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,780
We were profoundly unhappy.

769
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,060
I still have scars to prove it.

770
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,160
You remember Dublin, Germany?

771
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,990
Yes.

772
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,470
I just can't do that again.

773
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,570
So you want to be with someone else?

774
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,970
No.

775
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,060
Fi...

776
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,570
As unhappy as we were,

777
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,900
I don't think there's
Anyone I could be with

778
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,060
That would make me happier than you.

779
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,670
And I don't know
If that's good enough...

780
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,850
No, it's not.

781
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,200
Oh, sorry! Sorry!

782
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:52,630
Fi, Fi, I didn't mean that.

783
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,190
Fi.

784
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,460
Fi.

785
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,970
Fi, hold on. Hold on.

786
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

787
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,210
Ow!

788
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,820
You're gonna get yourself hurt.

789
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,990
Stop it.

790
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,130
I'm warning you, Fiona.

791
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,820
No.

792
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,870
<i>in any kind of covert
Intelligence operation,</i>

793
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,690
<i>it's important to be careful
What you wish for.</i>

794

797
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,110
Thanks.

798
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,930
Have fun with it.
