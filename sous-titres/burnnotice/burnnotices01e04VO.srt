<i>My Name Is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,100
<i>I Used To Be A Spy Until...</i>

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,600
We got a burn notice.
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,700
<i>when you're burned,
You've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:12,300
<i>no cash, no credit,
No job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:14,900
<i>you're stuck in whatever city
They decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:16,500
Where am I?
Miami.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,900
<i>you do whatever work
Comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>you rely on anyone
Who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,000
<i>a trigger-happy
Ex-girlfriend...</i>

11
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:25,800
Should we shoot them?

12
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:28,300
<i>... an old friend who's
Informing on you to the FBI...</i>

13
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:31,000
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,900
<i>... family, too.</i>

15
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:33,000
Is that your mom again?

16
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>you're desperate.
Someone needs your help, Michael</i>

17
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,400
<i>bottom line... until
You figure out who burned you,</i>

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,200
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,900
Ahh.

20
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:58,300
Okay, easy one... who led
The phins in sacks in '06?

21
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:01,100
The phins in sacks,
'060... agh.

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,200
See, Mike, these are
The important things in life.

23
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:06,800
This is what you missed when you
Were running around the world

24
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:08,300
With a satellite phone
And a gun.

25
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,100
Jason Taylor.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,000
<i>You want to blend into
A new city,</i>

27
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:13,000
<i>you better be up
On local sports.</i>

28
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:13,800
Drink.

29
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:15,900
Come on, sweetheart.
Give me one kiss.

30
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,400
Come on. Just one.

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,800
Just one. Bitch.

32
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,800
Ah, another gimme.

33
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:25,400
Who was the phins'
All-time passing leader?

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,300
<i>covert ops has its perks.</i>

35
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:28,600
<i>You travel,
Make your own hours,</i>

36
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,600
<i>and expense most of your meals.</i>

37
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,200
<i>The downside...
Lots of people want you dead.</i>

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
Here's a hint...
It's a quarterback.

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,500
Phins' all-time
Passing leader.

40
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,500
Uh...

41
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,900
Barry bonds?

42
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,000
Barry bonds?
Come on, Mike.

43
00:01:48,035 --> 00:01:50,200
It's not even the right sport.
Drink.

44
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,600
Dwyane wade sucks!

45
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,800
<i>if it looks like you're
About to get into a fight</i>

46
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:58,800
<i>that could get you killed,
Try starting another one.</i>

47
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,000
I mean, he can dunk,
But he's no kobe bryant.

48
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,300
Kobe sucks.

49
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:06,400
Kobe has a better
Free-throw percentage

50
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,600
And three rings, dude.

51
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:10,100
Dwyane
Has a ring, too, dude.

52
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:12,700
The rest of the league
Had an off year,

53
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:16,700
Just like any fat-ass loser
Can have a good day.

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,100
You got a problem?

55
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:19,900
Hey, Mike,
What are you doing?

56
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:21,300
He's drunk.
Don't listen to him.

57
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:24,500
Wow! Are those real?
I'm thinking double d's.

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,500
<i>vitáme do Miami, Comrade.</i>

59
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:34,400
Welcome to Miami

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Assxxxx

61
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,000
Come on!

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,100
Any ideas why your friend Jan
There wants you dead?

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,300
Probably payback
For a job I did.

64
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,000
<i>when booby-trapping your home,</i>

65
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:10,500
<i>it's important
To keep it simple.</i>

66
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:14,200
No coincidence a czech wet work
Guy is on me after I get burned.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,200
<i>make it easy to set up,
Easy to disable.</i>

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
I need to find out
What he knows...

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
... about my situation.

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,400
Talk to Sam.

71
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:27,700
He's the cold warrior
With the direct line to the FBI.

72
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:29,300
Somebody's got to feed
The feds something.

73
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,400
It might as well be sam.

74
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,400
You know, I just can't
Risk the feds picking up Jan

75
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:39,300
Before I get a chance
To talk to him.

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,600
Hi, mom.

77
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:46,500
The disposal
Is acting up again.

78
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, I'm really busy right now,
So call a plumber.

79
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:52,300
There's something in there.
I think I can get it.

80
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:55,400
No, do not put your hand
Down the disposal.

81
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,500
I'm coming over right now.

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,900
<i>one more thing
About booby traps...</i>

83
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,800
<i>make sure your friends know
Not to drop by unannounced.</i>

84
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,500
A few minutes later.

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Oh, well.

86
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,100
Mike, what the hell
Is going on?

87
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:13,500
You got shotguns, you're picking
Fights for no reason.

88
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,100
<i>dwyane wade is overrated.</i>

89
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,100
Fine. Lie to me.

90
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,400
But next time you go
Chuck Norris on some guy,

91
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't do it
In one of my favorite bars.

92
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:21,700
It's the sandbar.

93
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:23,100
They got $1 well drinks,

94
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:26,400
Directv's nfl sunday ticket
In h.d.

95
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:28,500
And did you see the t-shirts
Those girls were wearing?

96
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,400
And now I can't go back there.
That hurts.

97
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
So, what's the deal?

98
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:35,300
You're gonna drive me
Over to my mom's.

99
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:36,700
I just got here.

100
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Mom.

101
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,500
Mom!

102
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,300
<i>you can learn good self-defense</i>

103
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,200
<i>fighting with students
In a class.</i>

104
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,500
<i>but great self-defense...</i>

105
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
You been lifting weights?

106
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:08,800
<i>... that you pick up
Fighting with your family.</i>

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Michael,
What are you doing?

108
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,200
It's all right, mom.
I deserved it.

109
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,800
He deserves
A lot more than that.

110
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:20,800
You need to forgive
Your brother, Michael.

111
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,200
All right?
It was years ago.

112
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,700
He took out 10 credit cards
Under my name,

113
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:27,300
And then he hit me
With a telephone book.

114
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,200
He's right. It's true.
I was totally wrong.

115
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:32,400
But you were so angry, it was
Really more like self-defense.

116
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,400
You lost my car
In a card game.

117
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,900
Well, I needed the money,
And you weren't helping me out.

118
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,300
Besides, nothing ventured,
Nothing gained, bro.

119
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:41,800
It was a rental car
You ventured.

120
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,900
Well, they didn't
Charge you for it.

121
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,400
It's like playing
With house money.

122
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,400
The disposal works.

123
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:51,100
There was nothing wrong
With it, was there?

124
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
Well, how else was I supposed to
Get you to see your brother?

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

126
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,200
All right?
Nate, tell him.

127
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Yeah, uh, your buddy Bill
From high school.

128
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,800
Bill wasn't my buddy.
I worked for his dad.

129
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:05,200
Whatever. The point is
His daughter ran away.

130
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:06,700
I told him
You can help him out.

131
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,100
Mom said you got this thing
Going, helping people.

132
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,800
It's not a thing.

133
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,900
Nate said
That bill is desperate.

134
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,700
You took money
From him, didn't you?

135
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,100
Didn't you?

136
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,900
It's not about money.
It's a friend in need, bro.

137
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:31,800
How much?
Let's see it. Come on.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,900
All right, he...

139
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
He gave me 1,000 bucks
To find her, for expenses, okay?

140
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,400
We'll split it?

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,900
So, are you in?

142
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,900
No, I'm gonna go give him
Back the money.

143
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,300
Who gives money back?

144
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Hey!

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,700
Couldn't believe it
When you went in the army.

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Bill reese the client

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
Missed you
At graduation.

148
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:02,000
You just disappeared,
It seemed like.

149
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,300
Nate told me
About your daughter.

150
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,000
It's something
The police should handle.

151
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,000
They won't do anything.
Jenna's 18.

152
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:10,800
I told them she's just a kid.
She's still in high school.

153
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,600
But they said
She can still leave home.

154
00:07:12,635 --> 00:07:14,500
Can you believe that?
We got to do something.

155
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,300
Nate.

156
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Why'd she leave, Bill?

157
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:20,000
We argued about her boyfriend,
Brandon diggs,

158
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:23,900
Some half-assed modeling scout
She met in a flashy car.

159
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Jenna wanted to model
And paid for some of her photos.

160
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,300
It's been a month.

161
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
She called once,

162
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,600
Sounded messed up,
Like she was drunk.

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,100
I asked where she was,
And she wouldn't tell me.

164
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:39,800
Sounds like bad news.
I think we got to help.

165
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,000
I have the rest
Of the money... the $2,000.

166
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:46,600
Wait.
Nate told you $3,000?

167
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:49,600
He said that was the old-friend
Price, but I got more.

168
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,600
I just need to know
If she's okay.

169
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:53,800
Of course you do.

170
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Fine.

171
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
I'll hold on to this
For operating costs.

172
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:05,800
You have Brandon's
Phone number?

173
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,100
He disconnected it.

174
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:09,200
I called it a million times
Trying to find her.

175
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:10,500
All I got's this.

176
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,600
It's a photo I found
In Jenna's things.

177
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,500
It was just luck... I caught him
Out of the corner of my eye.

178
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,500
Hey.

179
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,200
His cellphone was linked
To a bogus address,

180
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,400
So no luck there.

181
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:31,200
Hermano!

182
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,400
<i>dos fajitas, arroz con pollo,
And uno cerveza, por favor.</i>

183
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:37,200
Eating light?

184
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:39,700
Tracking this guy down
Was hard work, let me tell you.

185
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
I had to hit up a buddy of mine
On the bureau for a favor.

186
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,200
Wow, hitting up some paper
Pusher for some information.

187
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:46,700
You must really
Work up an appetite.

188
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,500
He knows I'm not on their
Most-favored-nations list.all right

189
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,300
He insisted meeting on the q.t.
During his spin class.

190
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:54,500
Does a hell of a job
On the acorns, let me tell you.

191
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,300
Nice job.
The kid's popular.

192
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:57,900
Yeah.

193
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,100
I called some of his buddies,
Said I was his old pot dealer.

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,500
Hangs out at a bar
Down on south beach.

195
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,000
We can go there
And look around.

196
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,800
Every third guy in a bar will
Tell you he's a modeling scout.

197
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:10,200
Hey, I've used worse lines...

198
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,400
And succeeded.

199
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
<i>spies go to bars</i>

200
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:25,300

202
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,000
Seriously, that money
Bill fronted us...

203
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:31,200
I need my half, bro.

204
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,200
We'll talk about it later.
Let's just do this job.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Excuse me.

206
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,000
Brandon diggs...

207
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,100
I heard
This is where he hangs out.

208
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:39,100
Maybe you heard wrong.

209
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,800
I need to talk
To brandon Diggs, okay?

210
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:43,700
Jesus, nate!
Lay off.

211
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:44,700
I take him out,

212
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:47,600
And he comes on to every guy
Who looks like he can bench 200.

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Frank pierce,
Coconut grove mercedes-benz.

214
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,400
This kid brandon put a deposit
Down on an sl550.

215
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:57,800
My salesman here
Wrote his number down wrong.

216
00:09:57,835 --> 00:09:59,400
Yeah,
It's a beautiful car...

217
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:02,000
Pewter exterior,
Burl walnut trim, it's nice

218
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,000
The thing is, we got 20 people
Lined up behind him.

219
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:06,400
We don't want to give it away,
But we will if we have to.

220
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:07,700
Can you help us out?

221
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700
Check the v.i.p. Room
Upstairs.

222
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,600
Thank you kindly.

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,200
I was doing fine.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,700
You were not doing fine.

225
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
You looked like
You were gonna slug the guy.

226
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,300
You have no idea
What you're doing.

227
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:25,900
Why don't you boys wait outside,
And I'll go get brandon?

228
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:26,900
Are you sure?

229
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,100
If there's one thing
I know how to do,

230
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:30,800
It's to get a guy
To leave a bar.

231
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, damn, girl,
You are fine.

232
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Braandon diggs
The boyfriend

233
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,100
Oh.

234
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,300
Where's your car?

235
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:43,100
It's over there.

236
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Wow.
This is a really nice car.

237
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:04,900
Listen, bro,
I don't want trouble, man.

238
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:07,200
Take the car.
I got about 100 bucks.

239
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,700
We're looking
For Jenna reese.

240
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:09,800
I don't know any Jenna.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,900
That Jenna.

242
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:14,300
Mm-hmm.

243
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,200
Jenna's with
The wilhelm brothers, okay?

244
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:20,100
They're like
An escort service.

245
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,900
I recruit for them
At the club sometimes.

246
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:26,000
Why don't you go
And unrecruit her for us?

247
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,700
They got guys with guns watching
Those girls around the clock.

248
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:30,000
Guys with guns?

249
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
Of course.

250
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,500
It says here the inside
And lower areas of the arch

251
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:47,000
Are the most erogenous zones
Of the foot.

252
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,400
What?

253
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,000
It's research
On the wilhelm brothers.

254
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,500
They're fronting
As fashion guys.

255
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:54,400
My ex-girlfriend
Is totally into this crap.

256
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:56,400
She says they're pretty
Well known in the miami scene.

257
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:57,600
I looked them up
On the internet.

258
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,100
They own a photo studio.

259
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,200
It seems to be their only
Legitimate business.

260
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,800
Find out anything
About their escort service?

261
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:05,900
No, but they're all over
The charity circuit.

262
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
When they're not
Pimping girls,

263
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,000
They're donating 10,000 bucks

264
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:11,700
To some "neuter your dog
And cat" group,

265
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:13,400
"save the everglades,"
Et cetera, et cetera.

266
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:14,900
That's a perfect way
To find rich johns.

267
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,200
Talk to your ex, find out when
The next event is happening ???.

268
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,400
Yeah, Fi.

269
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,700
I know where 
your assassin is staying.

270
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,400
after he got
Tired staking out your place,

271
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:31,200
I tailed him to this hotel
Near the convention center.

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,700
He's in room 741.

273
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,900
Be careful.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,100
It's a little too easy
For a guy this good.

275
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,900
Hey, can I borrow
Your car?

276
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,100
Where are you going?

277
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:46,900
Just to the store
To get some yogurt.

278
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,300
Come on, Mike.

279
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,200
Fiona calls,
Whisper whisper.

280
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,100
All of a sudden,
You got to have yogurt?

281
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:54,200
What's the big secret?

282
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,500
No big secret.
Just love yogurt.

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,700
So?

284
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
You want anything?

285
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:10,800
Yeah, a toothbrush.

286
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,000
Yours is a little rough.

287
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,500
Ha ha.

288
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,000

You're looking at her.

A few more bucks.

00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,700
All those beautiful women
All the time.

346
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,700
We're throwing a party
This evening.

347
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,500
Come by
And see for yourself.

348
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Some of our girls
Will be there.

349
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
They love meeting
New people.

350
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,700
He just left.

351
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,900
Housekeeping.

352
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,700
Yes, I need fresh sheets
In room 740, please.

353
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,000
Thank you.

354
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,500
Hmm.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,500
Maybe we should get a room.

356
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:20,400
I could only afford about a half
An hour in a place like this.

357
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:22,300
That's all we need.

358
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
Fi, just... Fi... Fi.

359
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,700
Just... Fi.
Keep a lookout.

360
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,200
I forgot the ice.

361
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,700
Oh, no.

362
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, no, no.

363
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I forgot my key.

364
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
<i>my wife... mi esposa... </i>

365
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:53,400
So, I don't want to wake her.

366
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:56,000
So, you open... key.

367
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:57,200
Oh, thank you!

368
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,400
Thank you!

369
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Thank you. Shh!

370
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,000
<i>any good operative is careful
Not to leave much behind.</i>

371
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
<i>everyone gets careless, though,</i>

372
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:20,300
<i>and even the littlest things
Can turn out to be useful.</i>

373
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,700
<i>a receipt, a paperback...</i>

374
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,600
<i>... room-service records...
Every bit helps.</i>

375
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,200
Guys, I'm telling you,
I don't know what he's up to.

376
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,500
Don't jerk us around, sam.

377
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
The guy's sneaking around,
And you don't know anything?

378
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,600
What, you want me
To make something up?

379
00:18:57,635 --> 00:19:00,400
Okay, he's got a goddamn
Spy satellite in his bathroom.

380
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm doing my best here.

381
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:04,000
You're supposed to be
Keeping an eye on him.

382
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,200
We need results, Sam,

383
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,200
Or we'll haul your ass
Off to d.c.

384
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,800
For a little face time
With the section chief.

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,300
Nice talking to you.

386
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,000
The next big thing...
Air-conditioning in China.

387
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:53,000
Think about it...
Billions of people,

388
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,000
Global warming... big bucks.

389
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:56,700
We get rich.
It's a great thing.

390
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,700
Hey, remember me from the skybar
The other night?

391
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,100
Hey, I'm gonna just borrow her
For one second.

392
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:05,900
I'll bring her back,
I promise.

393
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,400
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

394
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:10,200
No, but you looked bored,
So I thought I'd help you out.

395
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, thanks, but those guys,
They're really nice.

396
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,600
Are you friends
With Carl, too?

397
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,500
Yeah, you can say that.
How about you?

398
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,100
He's helping me
With my modeling.

399
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,200
Oh, yeah?
You're a model.

400
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,200
Yeah, well, not yet,

401
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,200
But carl just got me
My first job in Dubai.

402
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:26,400
That's near Saudi Arabia.

403
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,700
And I'm gonna be flying there
Thursday.

404
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:30,100
So, what are
You doing here?

405
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:31,100
Networking.

406
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:32,600
Carl says
That businesspeople,

407
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:34,900
They're always looking
For models to be in commercials.

408
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,100
And he's got this,
Like, total training program,

409
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,400
You know, where you learn
About clothes and etiquette

410
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:41,700
And things like that
While he gets us jobs.

411
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

412
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,900
Why don't we just step outside
For a little bit?

413
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,100
I need to talk to you
About something.

414
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:49,800
Jenna!

415
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
Be a sweetheart
And get me a drink.

416
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:52,900
You know,
We were just gonna...

417
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,800
You know what?
Some merlot would be great.

418
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay.
All right, sure.

419
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:02,100
Is there anything
I can help you with?

420
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,700
I assume she's for hire.

421
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,100
We tell you who to talk to,
Jenna. Let's go.

422
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,300
But I get the feeling
She hasn't done this before.

423
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,500
That's our specialty...

424
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:13,000
Girls who are new
To the business.

425
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:14,900
She doesn't even look
Like she's the type.

426
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:16,400
You're right.
She isn't.

427
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,200
But some clients
Appreciate girls

428
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
With a little fight
In them.

429
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:22,400
Name your price.
I'm interested.

430
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm sorry?

431
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:24,800
Oh, no.

432
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,500
We don't offer that service...
Domestically.

433
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:30,500
Strictly
An overseas operation.

434
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:32,800
Yeah, so, if you're ever
In the middle east,

435
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,700
Let me know, huh?

436
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:37,500
Come on. I'll introduce you
To some of our other girls.

437
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:38,700
This way.

438
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,000
We should call the police.

439
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,500
Bill, what are
The police gonna do?

440
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,700
She'll just say she's doing
A modeling job overseas.

441
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:50,000
But she's not.

442
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:52,600
And if we tell her the truth,
She won't believe us.

443
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,400
The wilhelms will have her
On a plane by the next day.

444
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:57,700
We can go over there
Right now.

445
00:21:57,735 --> 00:22:00,300
We can just go over
And get her out.

446
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,100
Bill, stop.
Hey, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

447
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,900
You want to spook them?
She'll get hurt.

448
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,000
Do you understand?

449
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,000
Just... hey... trust me.

450
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:10,300
Let us do our thing.

451
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,400
You'll call me
When you get her?

452
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,400
I promise.

453
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,200
How exactly do you plan
On keeping that promise?

454
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:33,900
I have no idea.

455
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,200
Grabbing Jenna
Shouldn't be that big a deal.

456
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:46,800
In, out...
Couple minutes.

457
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:47,900
And run away?

458
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I say we blow our way
Into the house,

459
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,300
Grab the girl, take the wilhelms
Out as a bonus.

460
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:57,100
That's great...
Hey, let's storm a place

461
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,900
Guarded by guys
With semiautomatics,

462
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:00,600
Get shot up,
Get the target killed.

463
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,400
Maybe you don't have
The stomach for it.

464
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:03,800
Michael...

465
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:06,100
Fi, the body count
Would be a little high.

466
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,200
We know she's booked
On a flight to Dubai.

467
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:10,000
There's two flights
On thursday...

468
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:12,600
A 10:00 a.m. Direct and
A 2:00 p.m. Through switzerland.

469
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,600
We take her
When she goes to the airport.

470
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,000
I like it.

471
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,200
Deal with the guys in the car,
Pull her out. Nice.

472
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll see you.
I'm gonna do some recon.

473
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,800
Do you think I could convince
Your czech assassin

474
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:26,200
To switch targets?

475
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:29,400
Sam is bigger, slower,
Easier to hit.

476
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,600
What about Jan's car?
You check?

477
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:34,600
Yeah, he runs a mirror under
The engine before he unlocks it,

478
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,300
Uses a remote
To start the engine.

479
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,700
You check the bookstores?

480
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
All the local rezoli's.

481
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:42,700
No scary czechs buying sci-fi
Paperbacks on a regular basis.

482
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:44,600
We won't be
Ambushing him there.

483
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,500
He's been ordering food
At the hotel.

484
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:47,700
Not room service.

485
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,900
He stops by the kitchen
To place his order,

486
00:23:49,935 --> 00:23:51,400
Oversees the cooking
Himself.

487
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,600
Religious reasons.

488
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:54,600
He wants to make sure
The food is halal.

489
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:57,000
Halal?
Nice cover story.

490
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,600
Jan isn't muslim.

491
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,100
There's got to be
Another reason

492
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:01,800
Why he's spending time
In the kitchen.

493
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:02,800
Here's some cash.

494
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:04,400
Spread it
Around the kitchen staff.

495
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,700
See what you can find out.

496
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,100
Yeah, mom?

497
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Michael,
Can you come over?

498
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,600
It's an emergency.
It's your brother.

499
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,000
What happened?

500
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:24,200
I told him
That nate wasn't here,

501
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:26,400
But t-they said
They'd stay anyway.

502
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,800
I tried to call you,
And they wouldn't let me.

503
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:31,800
T-then nate came in,
And they started hitting him.

504
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:33,400
They said
He owed them money.

505
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:34,500
They broke the dishes?

506
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
No, I did.

507
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,300
Mrs. Hale's always coming over
When I have the tv on too loud,

508
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,500
So I figured
She'd hear the crash.

509
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:44,300
Anyway, they left
When they saw her coming.

510
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,800
Why didn't you call
The police?

511
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,700
Because nate said it would
Cause him even more trouble.

512
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
I got warrants.

513
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:52,000
Mom, I need to talk to Nate.

514
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:53,600
Don't you get angry
At him, all right?

515
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:56,300
It's a sickness, Michael,
Just like your father.

516
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:57,900
Look, I just need
My half of the money

517
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,500
So I can pay these guys,
All right?

518
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:01,400
If I give you money,
You'll go to the track,

519
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:02,700
And you'll try to double it.

520
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,800
You'll try to make a little
Extra until it's gone.

521
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,500
I can help you, Nate.

522
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
I can get these guys
Off your back.

523
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,500
You could hide out
In my place.

524
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:17,400
I don't need
A goddamn place to hide.

525
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:18,900
I can protect myself.

526
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,300
Yeah, blocking punches with
Your face... real effective.

527
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:23,500
I got a guy
Bringing me a gun.

528
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,700
A gun?

529
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:26,200
I'm not gonna need
To use it, mom,

530
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:27,600
If he'll just give me
The money.

531
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,600
Michael, please.

532
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,000
I'll give him the money
After the job.

533
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:36,200
I'll make sure the money goes
To the right place.

534
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,400
Go to hell.

535
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
<i>a rescue attempt is hard enough</i>

536
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,200
<i>when it's someone who actually
Wants to be rescued.</i>

537
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,400
<i>doesn't matter whether
It's a brother</i>

538
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
<i>with a compulsive-gambling
Problem</i>

539
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:53,100
<i>or a girl who thinks</i>

540
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,600
<i>she's about to launch
Her modeling career.</i>

541
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,800
<i>so, you eliminate
Escape options...</i>

542
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,600
<i>... keep a low profile...</i>

543
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,800
<i>... but no matter what you do,</i>

544
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,200
<i>you'll still have someone
Screaming bloody murder</i>

545
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:23,600
<i>in the back of your car.</i>

546
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,700
Bill, don't worry.
We've got a plan.

547
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,200
I'll go with you.
I should be there.

548
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:32,400
No, listen to me.

549
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:34,900
The best thing for you to do
Is stay at home.

550
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:37,000
You'll be the first one
We call.

551
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,900
Talk to you soon.

552
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:40,900
Michael?

553
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:42,400
Is Nate with you?

554
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,900
No.
I'm just fixing his truck.

555
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,000
What's wrong, mom?

556
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:51,700
He said he was going over
To your apartment

557
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,400
To get his share
Of the money.

558
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,600
What?

559
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,800
He's going over to my place?
What's his cell number?

560
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:01,300
Nate doesn't have a cell.
They cut him off months ago.

561
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:03,900
Michael!

562
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,100
Nate!

563
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,400
<i>some situations just come down
To probability...</i>

564
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,500
<i>the chance that an assassin
With a handgun</i>

565
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
<i>can hit you at 50 yards,</i>

566
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:31,600
<i>the number of shots
He can get off.</i>

567
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,100
<i>might have a 1-in-5 chance
Of taking a bullet,</i>

568
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,000
<i>maybe a 1-in-10 chance
Of dying...</i>

569
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,500
Nate!

570
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,100
<i>... or a 100% chance
Of getting blown away</i>

571
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,000
<i>by a shotgun wired to a door.</i>

572
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,200
A ricochet
Is usually not deadly,

573
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,000
But it sure feels that way.

574
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
Michael!

575
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,300
Aah!

576
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,000
Where the hell is Michael...
On one of your secret missions?

577
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,800
Don't look at me.

578
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,400
Your guys should be out
Pretty soon.

579
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,300
Last flight to Dubai
Is in a couple hours.

580
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:24,700
I'm ready.
Oh, no way.

581
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:26,900
There's no way we're
Gonna do this without Mike.

582
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:28,100
We don't have the manpower.

583
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,300
We don't have a choice.

584
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
I knew it.
You got no backbone.

585
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:35,900
Backbone?
You remember how this works?

586
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:37,400
You hold off the guy
In the front.

587
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,400
I take the guy in the back.
Mike takes Jenna.

588
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:41,200
What's missing
From this picture?

589
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:42,500
The guy that takes Jenna.

590
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,700
So I'll take Jenna.

591
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:45,700
Okay, so who takes the guy
In the front?

592
00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:47,800
Nobody.
What happens then?

593
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:49,200
People start shooting.

594
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:50,400
We lose, we're dead.

595
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,500
We win, we got three bodies,
A traumatized girl,

596
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,400
And spots on the FBI's
Most wanted list.

597
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:56,100
I've been on plenty
Of those lists.

598
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,800
It's not so bad.

599
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,900
Here they are.
Let's do this.

600
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:03,000
No, we can't do it
Without Mike.

601
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,200
Then I'll do it myself.

602
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,000
I got it, honey.

603
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,800
Oh, my back!
Aah!

604
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,800
What did you do?

605
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,300
Aah, my back.
Honey, call 911.

606
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Damn right
I'm calling 911.

607
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,000
You almost killed him!

608
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:20,300
It was an accident.

609
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm sure the cops
Will sort it all out.

610
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,700
Jenna: we're not going to
Make the flight.

611
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
<i>any decent criminal
Will change his plans</i>

612
00:29:26,835 --> 00:29:29,400
<i>at the mention
Of the word "cops."</i>

613
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,300
Don't worry, Jenna.
We'll catch a plane tomorrow.

614
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:33,600
Best we sort this out.

615
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:34,800
Hey, you guys got a pen?

616
00:29:34,835 --> 00:29:37,000
We could start exchanging
Information.

617
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,200
I assume you guys have
Insurance, right?

618
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,700
I don't think
It's necessary

619
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:43,100
For us to get the insurance
Companies involved.

620
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,000
Well, I don't know, Pal.
I got hit pretty good.

621
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,600
Don't come looking
For more.

622
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:52,500
Let's go back to the house.

623
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,700
Oh!

624
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,700
Hey! It's illegal
To drive away from an accident.

625
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,300
Mike better have one hell
Of an excuse for not being here.

626
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,800
Aah.

627
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,300
Easy.

628
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:18,100
<i>spend a lot of time
In countries without hospitals,</i>

629
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:19,600
<i>you pick up a few things.</i>

630
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,200
Take it easy.

631
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,000
Now, make a small incision
Just above the wound.

632
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:32,800
You want me to just dig in
Here or what?

633
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,800
You're enjoying this
Way too much.

634
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,200
Disinfect the blade
In the alcohol.

635
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,100
And then run the lighter
Over the edge of the blade.

636
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
God damn.
This is kind of fun.

637
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:00,900
Small incision.

638
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:02,600
Small incision!
Aah!

639
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:05,500
Come on, you'd think I was
Pulling a goddamn cannonball

640
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,800
Out of your shoulder.

641
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:08,900
Just a little more.

642
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,300
God!

643
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:15,300
Okay. Okay.

645
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,800
All right.

646
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
There you go,
You big baby.

647
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,800
Jesus.
What happened?

648
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:28,700
Mike, you get shot?

649
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:30,000
There's cops all over
Out there.

650
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,600
No, it was just this gang-bang
Drive-by thing.

651
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:35,200
It's really nothing.

652
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,700
What happened with Jenna?

653
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:38,000
She's still for sale,

654
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,500
But we kept her from boarding
The plane, at least.

655
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,900
Gangbangers, huh?

656
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:45,400
What, you join the crips
Or something?

657
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,700
I mean, Mike, look, you don't
Want to tell me, that's fine.

658
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
But I'll keep my mouth shut.
I'm your friend.

659
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:54,800
I'm supposed to help you
With crap like this.

660
00:31:54,835 --> 00:31:55,900
You've got to trust me.

661
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:57,000
Help me with my shirt.

662
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,500
I do trust you, Sam.

663
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:01,200
Keeping you in the dark
Gives you deniability.

664
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:04,400
Yeah, okay.
I know how it works.

665
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:07,900
All right, I'll go out and help
You with your cop problem.

666
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,900
"Nice job, nate.

667
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,100
Thanks for pulling
That bullet out of me."

668
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:16,500
"Oh, yeah, hey, you're welcome,
Mike. No problem."

669
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,800
"Hey, nate, how 'bout
That money I owe you?"

670
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,700
Jackass.

671
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,900
Nate.

672
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,100
Thank you.

673
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,200
Pay them back.

674
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,400
Hey.
How's your shoulder?

675
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:45,700
Patched up.
It hurts, but it wasn't deep.

676
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:47,300
Glad to hear it.

677
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,600
Listen, Mike...

678
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:55,000
I understand you got
A situation, but so do I.

679
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:58,000
I mean, I'm covering for you,
But if I lose my pension,

680
00:32:58,035 --> 00:32:59,700
You're gonna be changing
My diapers

681
00:32:59,735 --> 00:33:00,800
When I'm 95 and drooling.

682
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,900
Sam, I would never let
That happen.

683
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:05,000
I'd smother you
With a pillow first.

684
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,700
Promise me you're not gonna pick
Any fights in this place.

685
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,300
It's the only bar in Miami
That will let me run a tab.

686
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,100
Hi, mom.

687
00:33:13,135 --> 00:33:15,400
It's Nate.
Bill's been hurt.

688
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,900
You said you were going
To get her.

689
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
I didn't hear from you.

690
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,800
So I went to the house.

691
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
Barely made it
Through the front gate.

692
00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:31,600
I thought
You were my friend.

693
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm sorry.
Something came up.

694
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,600
I need to call the police!

695
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:35,800
This was a bad idea.

696
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,700
She'll be on a plane
Within the hour.

697
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:39,400
Don't call.
We don't have time.

698
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,200
I said I'll take care of it,
And I'll take care of it.

699
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:43,200
What are you gonna do?

700
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:45,200
Same plan as before,

701
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Just a different target.

702
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
<i>running an operation,</i>

703
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:03,100
<i>you can't let personal feelings
Get in the way.</i>

704
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,300
<i>it's about planning
And execution...</i>

705
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,800
You have to get out.
Now! Now!

706
00:34:06,835 --> 00:34:08,300
<i>... not about being angry.</i>

707
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,800
Come on! Let's go!
Move it!

708
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:12,400
Wow, this is
Really well-made.

709
00:34:12,435 --> 00:34:15,200
Open the door.

710
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,900
Out!

711
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:19,300
Piss me off.

712
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:20,500
Move.
Whoa, whoa!

713
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:22,100
Do you know
Who my brother is?

714
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,300
I know who he is,
And I know what he does.

715
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:25,900
Get off me, man!
You're making...

716
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,500
<i>although, occasionally,
You may get a little angry.</i>

717
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,500
Helping people's
Not a bad gig, bro,

718
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,300
But if you want to make
Some real money,

719
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:42,400
I could hook you up.

720
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:45,700
Did you pay them back,
These guys you owe?

721
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:47,800
Yeah.

722
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,900
Most of it.

723
00:34:52,935 --> 00:34:55,400
Look, they're not gonna be
Visiting mom for a while,

724
00:34:55,435 --> 00:34:56,400
All right?

725
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Think he suffocated?

726
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,500
You ready to call
Your brother,

727
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,100
Let him know
You want to go home?

728
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,000
I think that's a "yeah."

729
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:18,300
I want my brother back.
How much?

730
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:19,700
We don't want your money,

731
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,200
Which is not to say
That we want you to have it.

732
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:24,600
We want all your records

733
00:35:24,635 --> 00:35:27,400
And all the money you made
From all the girls you pimped.

734
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,400
Pimped?
I'm not a pimp.

735
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,100
You say tomato.
I say pimp.

736
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:32,900
You can keep
Whatever you made legally

737
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:34,500
From, you know,
The photo studio,

738
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,300
But the girls
Get the rest of it.

739
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
What are you,
Some kind of crusading cop?

740
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,200
No, Unfortunately for you,

741
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:42,700
I'm just some guy
You managed to piss off.

742
00:35:42,735 --> 00:35:44,700
Your brother's
In a trunk of a car, carl.

743
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:46,200
He's eating
On 10 bucks a day.

744
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:48,300
That's a bag of chips,
A sandwich, and a coke.

745
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:49,500
Tomorrow he eats on 5,

746
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,400
And we'll be down
To sugar packets by friday.

747
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:53,800
And just so there's
No misunderstanding,

748
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:55,300
You're going to explain
To Jenna

749
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:56,800
Exactly
What was waiting for her

750
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,400
At the other end
Of that flight.

751
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,800
I think that covers it.

752
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:03,100
We'll wait for your call.

753
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,700
You know...

754
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,100
I think we could probably
Keep some of that money

755
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
For ourselves.

756
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
It's not like the girls
Are gonna miss it.

757
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,600
What?

758
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,400
They don't know
How much there is.

759
00:36:15,435 --> 00:36:17,300
I met some of those girls
At the party.

760
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,300
Some of them
Probably couldn't even count.

761
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,600
<i>There is a reason</i>

762
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
<i>family is always a good source
Of leverage,</i>

763
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,200
<i>whether it's a brother
That always owes people money</i>

764
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,800
<i>or a brother
Stuck in the trunk of a car.</i>

765
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,200
<i>you can't really turn
Your back on them.</i>

766
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,500
Out.

767
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:38,800
Come on.

768
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,900
Walk. Walk.

769
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Who are you?

770
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:04,700
I'm a friend
Of your father's.

771
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,100
<i>the drive home
Is often a grueling experience</i>

772
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,900
<i>for someone
You've just rescued,</i>

773
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:18,900
<i>especially if they were unaware
Of their situation.</i>

774
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,900
<i>they ask a lot of questions.</i>

775
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:22,500
<i>you fill them
In on the answers,</i>

776
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:25,500
<i>and then it dawns on them...</i>

777
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,500
<i>... the truth.</i>

778
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
<i>it can be
A little overwhelming.</i>

779
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,700
Neat. What's this?

780
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:24,800
What's this, huh?

781
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,100
Oh, neat.

782
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:27,900
What does this say here?

783
00:38:27,935 --> 00:38:29,600
Anall-phyl...

784
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:31,500
How do you say
That word, Jan?

785
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,000
Anaphylactic.
What does that word mean?

786
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
Can't... breathe.

787
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,600
Oh, you can't breathe?

788
00:38:36,635 --> 00:38:39,000
Is this for when your throat
Closes up from allergies,

789
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:40,900
Like from pollen?
'Cause that's what I get.

790
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,500
Or maybe
It's the crushed peanuts

791
00:38:42,535 --> 00:38:43,900
I sprinkled
On your hot dog.

792
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,600
Yeah, I talked
To the chef at the hotel.

793
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:48,200
Seems like you're allergic
To peanuts.

794
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,900
Well,
Now that you've shot me,

795
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:51,700
And I hold your life
In my hands,

796
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:53,600
I think
It's time we talked.

797
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:57,100
No, no, no, no.
Don't... don't.

798
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,100
Jan. Jan.

799
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,000
After we talk,
You get this.

800
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,100
I need to know what you know
About my situation.

801
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,800
Don't know much.

802
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:07,700
Come on, Jan. You're a pro.
You must have asked around.

803
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:10,600
Why was I burned?
Who did this to me?

804
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,800
Come on, Jan.

805
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:13,500
I need to know
What you know.

806
00:39:13,535 --> 00:39:17,000
Now would be the time
To tell me.

807
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,800
Lot of people want you dead...
From old days.

808
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,600
Now you out.

809
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:27,800
No one to protect...

810
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,000
That's all.

811
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:30,600
Why was I burned?

812
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:34,100
Who did this to me?
Jan.

813
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:35,700
Jan!

814
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Sam, you know Toni's
All american hot dog

815
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,800
Down by the boardwalk?

816
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,300
Of course you do.

817
00:39:57,335 --> 00:40:00,100
Get your FBI guys over there
Right away with an ambulance.

818
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,000
If this doesn't get them
Off your ass,

819
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:03,800
I don't know what will.

820
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,000
Take care of that shoulder, we'll be in touch soon.
Hugs and kisses, your old friend.

821
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,900
Sam, did the FBI
Pick Jan up last night?

822
00:40:48,935 --> 00:40:51,300
Yeah, I don't think
These guys get a lot of action.

823
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:53,400
They were very excited
To finally get their hands

824
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:55,000
On a former soviet bloc
Wet work guy.

825
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,500
They were like kids
On christmas.

826
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,200
What did they get out of him?
I mean, he tried to kill me.

827
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:01,300
I assume he's gonna try
And finish the job.

828
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:03,300
Yeah, about that...

829
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,600
I guess they never got a chance
To talk to him.

830
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:06,800
Why is that?

831
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:09,100
Some guys came by
In the middle of the night

832
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,200
And took him away.

833
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,300
What guys?

834
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,500
Nobody knows.

835
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:14,600
They walked in
With some heavy-duty clearances,

836
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,100
Took Jan off the FBI's hands,
And poof, they were gone.

837
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:20,200
Word is they found Jan
Hanging from his shoelaces.

838
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,300
I mean, who leaves a guy
In a holding cell

839
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,700
With shoelaces, right?

840
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:26,000
Anyway, they're calling it
A suicide.

841
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Michael.

842
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:29,900
Yeah?

843
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Do you know
What's going on?

844
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:36,000
Looks like whoever burned me
Has something planned.

845
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,100
They don't want me
Leaving Miami,

846
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:40,600
But they don't want me
Dead, either.

847
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:42,000
Do you know why?

848
00:41:42,100 --> 00:42:03,900
