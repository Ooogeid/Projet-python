00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:03,729
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:07,010
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:12,098
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:14,645
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,102
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:19,147
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:22,442
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:25,403
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:28,281
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

10
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:30,659
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:31,868
Family, too...

12
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:33,078
Is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:34,162
If you're desperate.

14
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:35,288
Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:38,291
Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,

16
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,878
you're not going anywhere.

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,325
In the world of intelligence, if an
operative hands you a crossword puzzle,

18
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:56,351
chances are you've just
received a coded message.

19
00:00:57,594 --> 00:00:59,598
It's the art of
steganography --

20
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:02,545
sending coded messages
that don't look like messages

21
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,216
unless you have the key.

00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:06,986
<i>MEET AT MARWA MALL NOON</i>

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,910
So, does this new handler of yours set
all her meetings with crossword puzzles?

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,672
Or is she just flirting with you?

25
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:17,580
These people burned me, blacklisted me,
and threatened my family.

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,624
I think we're a little past flirting.

27
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,780
Keep the engine running.

28
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,310
- If you see her leave,
- tail her. I know.

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,780
We can't take more proactive measures?
There's room in the trunk.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,230
The idea is to find out who
she's working for without her knowing.

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,990
It calls for something a little more
subtle than throwing her in the trunk.

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,876
- You ready, Sam?
- All set.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,150
Listen, Mike, I hate to bring this up,
but is this gonna take a while?

34
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,140
'Cause I got a meeting
of my own I got to get to.

35
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,955
Yeah, the pilates class with Veronica.

36
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:49,826
Fi told me.

37
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:53,190
Look, it's a great way
to strengthen your core, okay?

38
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:54,700
Give me a break, will you?

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,523
I'm in the doghouse with Veronica,
and it's all your fault.

40
00:01:57,643 --> 00:02:01,324
Yeah. She's still all over me about
how the cadillac got all banged up.

41
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:02,822
I won't make you late, Sam.

42
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:05,798
Just make sure you get
a shot of Carla before you go.

43
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:09,674
In covert ops, you always want
to be the one setting the meeting.

44
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:12,764
When you're following
someone else's instructions,

45
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,945
they set the agenda,
they control the security,

46
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:19,809
and they get to make you jump through
hoops to remind you they are in charge.

47
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:21,180
Hello, Michael.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,399
Can I get you something to drink?

49
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,610
<i>CARLA THE NEW HANDLER</i>

50
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,196
I'll have what you're having.

51
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,470
I don't think they serve qishr here.

52
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,576
Mmm, yemenese coffee.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,246
I prefer to brew it myself.

54
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,744
Drinks you get in restaurants,
you never...

55
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:43,374
quite know what's in them, do you?

56
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:46,290
Thank you for meeting me at the mall.

57
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,880
Work has been so busy that
i just don't get the time to shop.

58
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,381
Well, we can't have that.

59
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,175
Give me your boss's number.
I'll give him a call.

60
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:53,301
Cute.

61
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:00,725
It's a security badge.

near impossible to duplicate.

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,612
- Where'd you get it?
- That's not your concern.

66
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:16,616
What you need to know is there's one
counterfeiter in Miami who can forge it.

67
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,910
A tunisian...
Name's Nefzi.

68
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,453
You're gonna introduce us?

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,788
No, you're gonna make
the approach on your own.

70
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:24,540
That's the way we do things,

71
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,709
and that's why we like working
with people like you.

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,419
We'd like the duplicate

73
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,747
and the original back in two days.

74
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,798
Then...

75
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:33,716
What?

76
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,677
We're done with the burn notice?
I get my life back?

77
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,265
It's not that simple, Michael
Not by a long shot.

78
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:44,078
But playing nice has its rewards.

79
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,503
You can keep whatever
you don't give to Nefzi.

80
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,390
Looking for Sam?

81
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,361
You know, Michael,
I brought friends, too.

82
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,676
- What did you do?
- Oh, don't worry. They're fine.

83
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,761

Carla's guys were good.

87
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,261
I never saw them coming.

88
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,971
They way they covered their approach.

89
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,386
It was impressive.

90
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,848
A polite bunch, too,
for countersurveillance types.

91
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,294
Not with this.

92
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,244
Sam still pouting?

93
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:32,856
It was Veronica's.

94
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,323
What's the security badge for?

95
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:39,560
I don't know.

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,670
Figure that out, we might be able
to answer a few questions.

97
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,870
I got to find a tunisian counterfeiter.

98
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,709
What about Barry? He's a weasel.

99
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:50,918
But he launders money for half of Miami.
He can probably put you in touch.

100
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:53,671
Yeah, Barry didn't enjoy
our last meeting.

101
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:55,152
He's dodging me.

102
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:57,341
Avoiding Sam's calls, too.

103
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,733
Nope. Gonna need a fresh face...

104
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:03,222
someone he won't expect.

105
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:06,892
You know how I feel
about money launderers.

106
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:08,684
The last one I dealt with,

107
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:11,063
They're still finding pieces
of him all over Belfast.

108
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:12,439
Do it for me?

109
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,487
Your charms no longer have
any effect on me, Michael.

110
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,715
Do it for all the yogurt you can eat?

111
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,009
Fine.

112
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,272
But I can't promise
that I won't kill him.

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,002
Yeah, Sam?

114
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:35,335
Hey, Mike.
I'm headed to the Carlito.

115
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:39,233
Um, look, there's a thing I need
to talk to you about right away.

116
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:46,814
- I hope he will come.
- He'll be here.

117
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,184
We'll just grab a seat.
Hey, Mike.

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,499
Hold up.

119
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,351
Is this a job, Sam?
It's not a good time for a job.

120
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:57,370
Look, I know you got this whole
counterfeiting thing.

121
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,454
But just hear her out.

122
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,821
She's a real sweetheart.
She's got a problem with a stalker.

123
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:01,940
- Stalker?
- Yeah.

124
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,070
You were a navy seal.
You can't handle this?

125
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:06,850
Yeah, well, look, normally,
I'd handle it with a few stern words

126
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,620
and a baseball bat,
but this is kind of a...

127
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,914
kind of a delicate situation.

128
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:13,500
Plus, she asked me in front of veronica.

129
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:15,169
So?

130
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,221
When I'm on a job,

131
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:19,054
it turns her on.

132
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:20,442
It's all I can do to keep up.

133
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:22,207
- The things this woman does...
- got it.

134
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:24,803
- I'm trying to get some, too.
- Got it. Got it. I got it.

135
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,290
His name is Raul.

136
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,726
I met him at the restaurant
where I'm a hostess.

137
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,818
He calls me all the time.

138
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:35,130
<i>SOPHIA THE CLIENT</i>

139
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:37,238
I say I'm not interested, but...

140
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,151
he thinks I am teasing.

141
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,486
The guy won't take
"hit the road, Raul" for an answer.

142
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:43,436
He pays all the bartenders at the restaurant

143
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,245
to tell him who I talk to.

144
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:47,447
And every day he just comes...

145
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,786
he comes and watches me.

146
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:51,538
- Have you gone to the police?
- Yes.

147
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,569
They say they cannot do
anything unless he hurts me.

148
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:56,460
But he gets so angry.

149
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,508
Every day it gets worse.

150
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,215
I don't want to wait until
something terrible happens.

151
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:05,135
It's gonna be fine. Like I told you,
Mike is the best in the business.

152
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,028
I'll see what I can do.

153
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:10,474
What time does Raul usually
show up at the restaurant?

154
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,760
At the restaurant? Ay, no.

155
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,937
Por dios, you can't.

156
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,235
Raul... He's a very big customer.

157
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:20,091
If you make a problem there,
I will lose my job.

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,979
Okay, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

159
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:25,448
We can meet him somewhere else.
Just tell us where to find him.

160
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,159
I go to church every day.

161
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:31,711
Raul always wants to pick me up.

162
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:36,675
How did you and Sophia meet, exactly?

163
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:39,050
Oh, we're in the same cooking class.

164
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,302
Veronica set it up.

165
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:43,420
You know, it was one of those things
where they get a famous chef in,

166
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,840
and they crack open a couple eggs
and a bottle of wine.

167
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,119
Not exactly the kind of thing that
a hostess making minimum wage signs up for.

168
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:53,245
Don't know. She wants to be
a chef. Must have saved up.

169
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,830
- Yeah, ma?
- Micheal ?

170
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,210
You still haven't fixed my coffee maker,
and I can't find the warranty.

171
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,837
Warranty? That thing was built in 1967.

172
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:05,330
Well, I need it for my poker game.
Can you come over later?

173
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,827
There he is, Mike.

174
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,718
Hello?

175
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:11,191
Yeah, I'll be there.
See you later, ma.

176
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:15,930
<i>RAUL THE STALHER</i>

177
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:19,876
That stalker happens to have
a mac-10 in his jacket.

178
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:23,970
Oh, you knew, didn't you?

179
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:28,144
Mike, look, I did a little pre-scouting,
but I... I knew he was packing.

180
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:31,680
I didn't know he had a mac-10.
I thought it was like a regular gun.

181
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,832
Look, I'm in a jam, and this girl Sophia,
she's in real trouble.

182
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,123
- Yeah.
- I just need a little help.

183
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,529
We're gonna have to do recon.
You're buying lunch.

184
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,740
Okay, you got it, Mikey.
I'm starving, anyway.

185
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,132
Need a refill here, hon.

186
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:10,216
<i>BARRY THE MONEY LAUNDERER</i>

187
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,345
Oh, my god.

188
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,875
Hard man to find.

189
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,974
Just tell Mike it's not personal, okay?

190
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,975
Last time I saw him,
there was this kind of, you know,

191
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,980
"do this for me or
we're enemies for life" vibe.

192
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,637
It scared me a little.

193
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:27,319
- Barry, he just needs some information.
- All right.

194
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,821
We're looking for a tunisian
counterfeiter. You know any?

195
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:33,956
Tunisian? Where is Tunisia, even?
Is that next to Spain or something?

196
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:37,720
Listen, I got to be out of here.
I got a rubdown in, like, 10 minutes.

197
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:40,290
All right, all right. I got it.

198
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:42,217
Nefzi.

199
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:45,336
You're talking about Nefzi.
You don't want to deal with him.

200
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:46,009
Trust me.

201
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:48,708
He's the go-to guy
for all the hardcore stuff :

202
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:52,150
fake money for coke deals,
counterfeit passkeys for bank robberies,

203
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,953
stuff that gets people killed.

204
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:57,223
Plus, he's the most arrogant
son of a bitch in south Florida.

205
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,510
Where can we find him?

206
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,685
He operates out of a tv-repair
store down in south Miami.

207
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:06,015
Word is, Nefzi was part of
the security force for the tunisians

208
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,700
back in the early '80s.

209
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,580
Nasty. If he brings out
the electrodes, I'd leave.

210
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,000
You see, that wasn't
so hard, was it, barry?

211
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,044
We're done here? Okay.

212
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:19,329
'Cause if you want, I can arrange
a massage for you or something.

213
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:21,664
Dinner after?

214
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:26,635
Who needs electrodes when
you have one of these?

215
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:30,147
I was just asking.

216
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,554
You know, they stopped making parts
for this when nixon was president.

217
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,150
I'm gonna get you a new one.

218
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,756
You know, Michael...

219
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,186
I've started seeing a counselor.

220
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,945
And she said that there are
unresolved issues between you and me.

221
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:48,960
Really?

222
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,820
And she'd like you
to come to the sessions.

223
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,790
Counseling with you?

224
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,778
Yeah, uh, now's not a really good time
'cause I have a lot on my plate.

225
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,309
I'm just gonna throw this out.

226
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,389
You know, I've been waking up
with night sweats

227
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:08,942
ever since you sent me
to Fort Lauderdale

228
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:12,559
because of those men with guns
who were chasing you, Michael.

229
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,562
Fine. I will go with you.

230
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:20,372
I knew you'd think it was a good idea.

231
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:23,192
So I made our first appointment
for tomorrow.

232
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,794
I'm gonna take this.

233
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,184
- Yeah, Sam?
- Mike, I tailed Raul to his job.

234
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:33,687
Man, you got to see this.

235
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,828
- More guns. Great.
- Yeah.

236
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,416
Looks like Raul's in charge
of this operation.

237
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,972
Yeah? Hey, dumpling.

238
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,469
Oh, just taking care of
that thing for Sophia.

239
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:01,889
Well, Sammy will take whatever reward
you want to give him, baby.

240
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,814
Uh, pumpkin, let me call you back.

241
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,516
We need a better look,
see who we're dealing with.

242
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:09,962
You think you can handle that, pumpkin?

243
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:11,931
Yeah. I got it, Mike.

244
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,097
Wait, wait, wait a second.
Let... Let me see if I hear that right.

245
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:26,186
He says I'm uninsurable?

246
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:29,542
Well, that's a pretty big word for a guy
who can't read without moving his lips.

247
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:32,148
Relax, I'll handle this.

248
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,732
Here's what we do, then.

249
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:39,186
You tell Jerry, Jerry's not moving
my cargo anymore, okay?

250
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,572
Yeah, you tell him that. My god.

251
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,055
Hey, uh, you el jefe?

252
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,352
You ship stuff?
'Cause I got stuff to ship.

253
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:47,581
I'm talking pilates equipment.
A lot of it.

254
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,396
You know, it's those things that are
in gyms. They're like big beach balls.

255
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,164
All of a sudden, every joker
in Tampa's got to have them.

256
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:55,359
So I need to make this happen
like, you know, yesterday?

257
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,104
You have the wrong place.

258
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:59,630
Well, hear me out. I mean,
these are your trucks, right?

259
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,110
I'm just... I'm just looking
to rent a little extra space.

260
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,325
You know, uh, off the books, frankly.

261
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:06,245
Sorry. All of our spaces are taken.

262
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:07,955
Oh, I get it.

263
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:09,804
Okay, I'll play your game.

264
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:12,939
- How much you want ? Like 5 bucks a cub
- Leave... Now.

265
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,420
We'll just consider that
a down payment for the future.

266
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,675
Okay, thanks a lot.
You have a good one, now. Take care.

267
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:23,596
Okay, big opportunity
right out the window there.

268
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,414
See you, guys. Have a good one.

269
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,470
- Who are you?
- Who am I? What do you mean?

270
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,693
We stopped by Raul's work.

271
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:40,120
He's loading trucks full of
lidocaine and coffee cans.

272
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,460
I don't know.I
don't underst--

273
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,284
lidocaine is used to cut cocaine,
and coffee masks the smell from the dogs.

274
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:47,036
Dios mio. Drugs?

275
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,789
Drugs. Shocking.
You never saw anything, huh?

276
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,916
Now, it never occurred to you that most

277
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:55,930
trucking executives don't drive
in porsches and carry mac-10s?

278
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,150
Please don't hurt me.

279
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,040
You approached Sam at a cooking class
which costs more than you earn all week.

280
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,344
And then you happen to mention
a sad story about Raul?

281
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:05,805
What a coincidence...
Sam can help.

282
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,596
I'm telling you the truth.

283
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:08,599
Who are you?

284
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm D.E.A.

285
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:17,024
I'm a cop.

286
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:19,927
I've been undercover for two years,

287
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,196
making a case against
Raul's boss, Campos.

288
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,174
He runs a billion dollars in cocaine
through Miami for the Valdez cartel.

289
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:28,585
And Raul is his number-two guy
in charge of security.

290
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:29,721
Okay, look.

291
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:32,976
Is Raul really stalking you,
or was that a lie, too?

292
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,083
No, it's the truth.

293
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,685
The hostess job at Ernesto's
is my cover.

294
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,046
That's where Campos
likes to eat and talk business.

295
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:43,210
I tried not to draw attention to myself,
but Raul noticed me.

296
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,259
And if you went to the D.E.A.
with your problem,

297
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,704
they'd pull you off the job.

298
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:48,645
Yeah, my investigation would be over.

299
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:51,335
I've worked too hard to let that happen,
and that's why I came to you.

300
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,110
Nice touch, approaching me through Sam.

301
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,735
Well, I'm sorry I lied.

302
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,604
But I needed to be sure you'd help me.

303
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:58,570
You'd do the same thing.
I've heard the stories.

304
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,662
What stories?

305
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:03,059
There are rumors about a guy
who took on the cartel a while back.

306
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,597
I found the people you helped,
and they told me what you did.

307
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:07,297
Don't believe everything you hear.

308
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,868
Listen, I don't care who you were.
I just need help.

309
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,479
They have a big shipment
coming in a few days.

310
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,245
I'm really close to finding out where.

311
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:16,288
But not if Raul kills you first.

312
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:19,602
I could go to jail for involving you.

313
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,310
I'm out here alone. Do you understand?

314
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,745
Yeah, actually.

315
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:25,352
I have a pretty good idea
what that's like.

316
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,934
Ernesto's...
That's where I work.

317
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:35,561
There's Campos.

318
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,163
He and Raul meet every day for lunch.

319
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:40,441
<i>CAMPOS THE BOSS</i>

320
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,948
Is that kind of firepower normal,
or is this a special occasion?

321
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,993
Campos is in a turf war
with the mexicans.

322
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:53,633
They put a hit out on him last week.

323
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,331
- It's pretty ugly.
- Ugly's good. We can work with ugly.

324
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,246
How?

325
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:01,105
I need to get in with Raul quietly,
make myself useful, get some information.

326
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,001
Then I let Campos know that Raul

327
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:05,638
is spilling information to a new friend
behind his back.

328
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,217
Campos deals with Raul for us,

329
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:09,064
and it looks like
you had nothing to do with it.

330
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:11,638
- You make it sound so easy.
- That sounded easy?

331
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:30,700
Where the hell are you?

332
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,470
On the bus,coming to work.

333
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,150
I called you.Left you messages.

334
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,870
You didn't answer or call back...

335
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:37,831
Who are you with?

336
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,166
I'm not with anyone,Raul.

337
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,584
If you are lying -

338
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:42,002
I swear.There's no one here.

339
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:44,713
We'll talk about it when I see you.

340
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,509
You don't have to do this.

341
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:52,304
I know.

342
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,180
Sam told me about your latest client.

343
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,020
She sounds like a handful.

344
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,044
Just helping her with a job.

345
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,910
- Where did all these checks come from?
- Barry.

346
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,416
Whatever you said to
him must have been convincing.

347
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,931
These are leftovers
from a defunct shell company.

348
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:17,307
What are you doing with them?

349
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:19,120
Becoming a forger.

350
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,856
Approach the tunisian
with a few phony checks...

351
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:24,836
and you're not just a client,
you're a colleague.

352
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,684
Check fraud is more about technique
than high-tech equipment.

353
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,047
Some old checks, a roll of scotch tape,

354
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,314
some nail-polish remover,
and you're in business.

355
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:49,026
Nail-polish remover is mostly acetone,
which dissolves ink.

356
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:54,015
Get your hands on a check that's
been filled out by the account holder,

357
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:58,036
dissolve everything but the signature,
and you've got yourself a blank check.

358
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,143
Counterfeiters call it "check washing."

359
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,075
There may be no honor among thieves,
but there's a certain amount of respect.

360
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:14,455
Establishing you're in the same racket
is a great way to make an introduction.

361
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,265
- Nefzi, right?
- How did you find me?

362
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,591
Barry.

363
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,870
<i>NEFZI THE COUNTERFEITER</i>

364
00:18:23,096 --> 00:18:24,284
Barry referred you?

365
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,997
Ah, manner of speaking.

366
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:28,466
He called you a son of a bitch,
which, I figured,

367
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:30,760
anybody Barry doesn't like, cool by me.

368
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,747
Anyway, I took this job.
I got to dupe this.

369
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,785
Little out of my league.

370
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,059
I'm good with papers,
not with computers.

371
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,616
I think this is a computer thing, right?

372
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,724
Yes, it's a computer thing.

373
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,874
Why would anyone believe
you could do this?

374
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,214
Did I mention I'm good with papers?

375
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,253
Check fraud is for children.

376
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,565
Counterfeiting electronics
takes real skill.

377
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:01,472
No argument from me.
That's why I'm coming to you.

378
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:03,727
I can do this job, but,

379
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,493
- it'll cost you.
- Yeah.

380
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:09,274
I figured. Maybe we could do
a whatchamacallit... like the barter?

381
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:13,153
You know? I give you some of my work,
and you do the badge for me.

382
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,760
This is hackwork I can do in my sleep.

383
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,407
Cash only.
$10,000.

384
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,364
5 now, 5 on delivery.

385
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,329
Okay.

386
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,381
People who try to cheat me...

387
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,171
they regret it. You understand me?

388
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,719
I wouldn't dream of it.

389
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,263
When can I get the badge back?

390
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,090
I can have a basic knockoff by tomorrow,

391
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,684
but if you want a better quality,
it'll take a few days.

392
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,779
Take your time.

393
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,930
Yeah, mom?

394
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,995
Michael, I'm at the counselor's office.
You missed our appointment.

395
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,291
Oh, um, some... something came up.
I should have called.

396
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,270
Yeah, well, they have a very strict
cancellation policy here, Michael.

397
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,786
It's worse than the airlines.

398
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,547
I'll pay for the session.

399
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,655
That's not the point.

400
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,614
You look upset.

401
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,754
Is everything okay?

402
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,028
Yeah, everything's fine.

403
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,630
Just some personal issues.

404
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,010
Thanks for asking.

405
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,990
If you need to talk, Michael,
I'm here for you.

406
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,930
I appreciate that.

407
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,114
Why don't you give me your home number,
and I'll take you up on that?

408
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:43,107
I assume we'll be getting
our badges soon?

409
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,230
A few days.

410
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,230
That wasn't what was agreed to.

411
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,955
We were expecting them sooner.

412
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,570
Yeah, well, that's the best I can do.

413
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,265
I doubt that, Michael.

414
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:11,729
The man I'm looking for.

415
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,890
And why is that?

416
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,240
You're in... let's call it
the shipping business,

417
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,694
and me, let's call me a consultant.

418
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:23,053
Now, a guy moving your kind of cargo
is always looking to make it go

419
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:24,830
from point A to point B.

420
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,785
I can help with this job.

421
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,720
I can make your life easier...

422
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,414
a lot easier for the right price.

423
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,990
I don't know what you're talking about.

424
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,290
I import coffee.

425
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,264
Right, and I used to work for
the mexicans. Let's cut the crap.

426
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,190
You know, where I come
from, talk like that...

427
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,880
can get you killed.

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,478
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't want blood
all over that nice suit,

429
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:55,481
 so why don't you just hear me out?

430
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,899
Talk.

431
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,164
I busted my ass for the mexicans.

432
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,663
They didn't truly appreciate what I do.

433
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:04,782
And what is it exactly that you do?

434
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:06,742
I expedite things.

435
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,204
- I got a lot of friends.
- Who are these friends?

436
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,466
Police,

437
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:12,951
customs,

438
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:14,340
on the docks.

439
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,678
Anything beyond that,
I'd be giving away my trade secrets.

440
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:19,795
But I can assure you

441
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:23,200
that your deliveries would come
on time, hassle-free.

442
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,594
- How does that sound?
- Too good to be true.

443
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,318
Strange that you come to me,

444
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,080
not to my boss.

445
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,210
What do I want with your boss?

446
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,815
You'll be my boss.
I don't even want to meet Campos.

447
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:40,370
I mean, the way I see it, I'm just here
to make you look good, me to make money.

448
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,197
As long as I'm paid,
you can be the hero.

449
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,323
You know, if you're interested,

450
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:47,804
give me a call.

451
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,632
Sit.

452
00:22:51,644 --> 00:22:54,120
- Allow me to buy you a drink, no?
- Si.

453
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:01,839
My girlfriend.

454
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,330
Raul, I have to work.

455
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,650
Yes,yes my love.

456
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,971
We need a table for two
and a bottle of Dom.

457
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,478
Very nice girl, huh?

458
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,290
Catholic.

459
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:21,233
A volcano waiting to erupt.

460
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,696
She loves me more than her own life.

461
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,074
That's a lot.

462
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,444
Mom?

463
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,310
I wanted to apologize for, you know,
missing our appointment.

464
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,559
The new coffee maker.

465
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:45,190
Thank you.

466
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,595
That's more than enough apology.
Why didn't you wake me last night?

467
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:50,774
I was in a hurry.

468
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:53,349
Uh, excuse me.

469
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,227
You were here long enough
to read the paper.

470
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,090
Did your mom like the coffee maker?

471
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,932
I picked it out myself.

472
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,050
Built-in grinder,
integrated water filter.

473
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,630
Makes up to 10 cups.

474
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,300
Perfect for her weekly poker game.

475
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,218
Yeah, I'd stay away from her.

476
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:26,816
You were the one that told me
I needed to buy her a coffee maker.

477
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,920
- What about these? Do you like these?
- It depends on where you're staying.

478
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,137
They're nice for South Beach,
but if you're in Coral Gables,

479
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:34,380
I'd go with something conservative.

480
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,279
Always pushing. Always probing.

481
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,429
It's cute.

482
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,834
But you need to understand something.

483
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,540
Right now, you work for us.

484
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,180
And who would that be?

485
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,190
There's an easy way
to do this and a hard way.

486
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,400
I like my way.

487
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,190
Is that why you decided to take
your time delivering the badges...

488
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,162
to see how I would respond?

489
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,353
- Quality work takes time.
- Right, right.

490
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,320
Every puppy starts off
chewing the furniture, Michael.

491
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,016
Eventually they learn.

492
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,310
Next time I give you a deadline,
I expect you to meet it.

493
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,468
Don't test me again, or the next time
I leave a gift at your mom's house,

494
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,566
it's not gonna be a coffee maker.

495
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,720
If you want to make a friend,
solve a problem for them.

496
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,338
No problem to solve? Create one.

497
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,150
- Almost done, Michael.
- Make it look professional.

498
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,770
Yeah, I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

499
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:52,060
You getting friendly with Raul?

500
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,928
Yeah, friendly enough.
If I know my drug cartels,

501
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:58,410
it won't take much longer to make it look
like he's going behind the boss' back.

502
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,481
Got to go.

503
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,106
<i>He's searching your car.</i>

504
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,730
Relationships are about trust.

505
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,488
People trust you when
they have something on you...

506
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,996
like, say, the name and address
of a mistress in Orlando

507
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:19,828
or information about
a secret gambling habit.

508
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,915
It's all about making them feel secure.

509
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,960
- Money problems?
- That's my business.

510
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,253
Relax.

511
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,354
If things go well,

512
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,970
everything's okay.

513
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,683
If it doesn't...

514
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,387
we know where your friends
and your family are --

515
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,600
a little insurance in case
you get scared and run to the police.

516
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,531
Fine.

517
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,095
Maybe now you'll give me a route
and shipping information

518
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:47,564
so I can do my job.

519
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:49,343
That is not how it works.

520
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:51,501
Then how the hell am I supposed
to help you  with the mexicans

521
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:52,990
 and the police if you keep me in the dark?

522
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,700
You tell me what you know first.

523
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,406
Man, this is a waste of my time.

524
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,538
No.

525
00:26:58,513 --> 00:26:59,452
You sit.

526
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:02,412
People don't trust information
they get for free.

527
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:04,206
If you want to sell someone on a lie,

528
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:06,350
you have to make them
drag it out of you.

529
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,780
It's effective, but often painful.

530
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,420
You said you can be useful, no?

531
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:11,505
Fine.

532
00:27:11,665 --> 00:27:13,078
You tell me something.

533
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,884
It checks out, we talk. If not...

534
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,753
all right.

535
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:19,237
The D.E.A.

536
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,641
They got a gps tracking device
on one of your trucks.

537
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:25,203
I got a source in the D.E.A.'s office.

538
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,384
How could you be so stupid?

539
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,452
I've always liked to think that the "c"
in counseling stands for communication.

540
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:58,843
It sounds like what Madeline needs

541
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,310
is for you to share something
from that part of your life

542
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,974
that's been closed off.

543
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,936
Nothing's coming to mind.

544
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,606
- You're missing the point.
- You're right, ma. I am.

545
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,568
Let's try it this way.

546
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,028
Madeline, um,

547
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,240
you mentioned there were times

548
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:22,750
when you wanted more communication
but didn't get it.

549
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,174
Can you share an example with Michael?

550
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:31,262
Every year, Michael
called me on my birthday.

551
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:35,046
About eight years ago, he forgot.

552
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:36,856
I was very upset,

553
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:40,635
and I never understood
why he didn't communicate.

554
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,667
Michael, would you like to respond?

555
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,612
At the time, I was stationed overseas,

556
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:53,425
transporting a colleague
to a locked facility.

557
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:55,625
There were some individuals
who were trying very hard

558
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:57,615
to prevent me from doing my job.

559
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:00,572
I was injured and in a field hospital
for six weeks.

560
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,414
They didn't have a phone,
so I could not...

561
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:04,659
communicate.

562
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,069
Excellent.

563
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,611
Now it's your turn, Michael.

564
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,041
My turn?

565
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,380
When I was 9, I stole groceries
because dad blew his paycheck.

566
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,000
Go on.

567
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,720
The owner's son, Tommy Knox, the bag boy,
caught me while I was running out...

568
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:26,085
pounded me pretty good,
gave me a black eye.

569
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:27,724
But I got away with the groceries.

570
00:29:27,884 --> 00:29:30,419
When I got home,
you took the groceries, mom,

571
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,909
but you never asked me
about the black eye.

572
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:34,963
Any communication about that?

573
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,775
Boys fight, Michael.

574
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:40,603
I thought you'd bought the groceries.

575
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:42,822
Then why did we never
go back to that store?

576
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,558
Madeline?

577
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:55,626
Let's talk about the time
that we went to Disney World.

578
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,475
So, what made you pick her?

579
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,800
There was something about her I liked.

580
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,710
I don't know what I was thinking.

581
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,146
Really? I didn't think it was so bad.

582
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,167
- Yeah?
- It's Raul.

583
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,690
I've been thinking about your proposal.

584
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,566
Meet me at the restaurant.

585
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,951
Raul, what's going on?

586
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:30,244
What's going on?

587
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,330
Well, that is what I would like to know.

588
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,660
What are you talking
about? What is this?

589
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,630
A friend of mine used to be
in the secret service in Venezuela.

590
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,080
He knows how to find things,
like phone records.

591
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,280
I had him look in Sophia's cellphone.

592
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,112
You two were talking, no?

593
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,320
Did you think that I would not find out?

594
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,264
I don't know what she's told you.

595
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,880
She did not tell me nothing.

596
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,028
I had to figure it out for myself.

597
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,313
Now I will ask you
the same thing I asked her.

598
00:30:57,473 --> 00:31:00,441
How long have you and this puta
been sleeping together?

599
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,657
- You are out of your mind, Raul.
- Do you think that I am stupid?

600
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,285
No. I don't think you're stupid, Raul.
I know you are.

601
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:15,623
Inexperienced operatives abandon
a cover I.D. under pressure.

602
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,961
Experienced ones
just play their roles harder.

603
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,589
Stop wasting my time!

604
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,202
Of course I talked to Sophia!

605
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:29,220
I'm checking up on you!

606
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,270
You don't think I do my homework
on the people I'm doing business with?

607
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,058
I'm a professional!

608
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:35,364
Please, Raul.

609
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,339
I wish that I could trust you.

610
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,774
Nothing happened.

611
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,276
You know, she's right. Nothing.

612
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,870
She wouldn't give you up.

613
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,693
I tried to give her money.
She wouldn't take it.

614
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:49,198
But if you want to shoot her, go ahead.

615
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,200
- In fact, I'll do it myself.
- No.

616
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,079
You did that for me?

617
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:00,751
Why didn't you tell me?

618
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,629
I was scared.

619
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,217
You have nothing to be afraid of.

620
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:14,162
We're going somewhere nice tonight.

621
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,572
Can we talk now?
We done playing games?

622
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,674
No.

623
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,680
It is time for you to meet the boss.

624
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,621
Yeah. Remember we said no bosses?

625
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,760
That's not how I operate.

626
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,039
I don't care.

627
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,335
That is how i operate.

628
00:32:48,522 --> 00:32:50,490
Mike, that's gonna
screw up the whole plan.

629
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,700
I thought the idea here was to
make Raul seem like a traitor.

630
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,240
Well, how you gonna catch him
selling secrets behind his boss's back

631
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,310
when he's standing right
in front of the guy, introducing you?

632
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,960
If we can't make Raul a traitor one way,
we're gonna have to do it another way.

633
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,270
Fi, get me a sniper rifle and some C4.

634
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,640
Ooh, I like where this is going.

635
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,950
I just opened that.

636
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,487
We have work to do.

637
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,250
Morning, fellas! How you doing?
I'm back. Good to see you.

638
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,410
Most people think distracting a group
of guys is best done by a beautiful woman.

639
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,360
The problem with beautiful women
is people want them to stick around,

640
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,000
which can cause a lot of problems.

641
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,673
Ever seen one of these?

642
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,550
I got plenty more ready to go. Look.

643
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,662
I got to talk to your supervisor again.

644
00:33:33,782 --> 00:33:36,480
Tell him I'm offering some
real money, okay? Mucho...

645
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,516
Obnoxious guys
they just want to get rid of.

646
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:41,560
Dinero. See, that was
a good upper-body workout.

647
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,315
You know, you're just,... you truly
are bullies. Okay, okay. Got it.

648
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,158
Raul says you may be able to help us.

649
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,661
He told me about the gps device.
What else do you know?

650
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:02,664
I know your operation
has problems -- vulnerabilities.

651
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,650
Vulnerabilities?

652
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,711
You have problems with
your perimeter out there.

653
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,714
I know how the feds are
getting to your trucks.

654
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,176
Show me.

655
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:17,971
You see those boats?
They're an easy access point.

656
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,603
You ready, Sam? Go.

657
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,280
I'm not talking about fencing.
I'm talking about a wall...

658
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,750
You know, blocking the view
from the street.

659
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm in a meeting, Sophia.

660
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:42,160
I'm sorry.I don't want to bother
you...but I need your help.

661
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:42,910
What's wrong?

662
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,831
There's a man here...

663
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:46,341
He's drunk and keeps putting
his hands all over me.

664
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,920
Hey, come on over here, mamacita.
Come over here and meet chuck.

665
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,279
Give it up. Give me some.

666
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,839
Stay right there.

667
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,790
I have to go.

668
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,650
I need to handle something
with Sophia at the restaurant.

669
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,184
I'm sorry.

670
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,229
You don't think Raul would ever... Nah.

671
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:09,469
- What?
- I don't know.

672
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,755
Raul would never go to the cops.

673
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:15,659
- Of course not.
- No. I know.

674
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:17,780
It's just that Sophia's
not at work today.

675
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,593
So why is he going to
the restaurant to meet her?

676
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,497
Most assassinations involve the firing
of a single well-placed bullet.

677
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,290
Get down!

678
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:31,294
The trick to selling an assassination
attempt is to use a lot more firepower.

679
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,718
And an explosion or two doesn't hurt.

680
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,623
Raul set you up!

681
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:52,607
Find Raul!

682
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:54,375
Bring him to me !

683
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,290
Drug cartels have their
own internal justice system.

684
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,290
It doesn't involve courts or lawyers or
proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

685
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,127
If they think you might be a traitor,

686
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,210
they'll kill you just to be
on the safe side.

687
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,596
Run, Raul! Run, baby!

688
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,120
And we fit a half a kilo
of cocaine in every can.

689
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,410
I'm not talking anymore, okay?
Not until I'm

690
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,793
I'm sure that you can
protect me from Campos.

691
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:22,420
Don't worry.
You cooperate, we'll take care of you.

692
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,270
Just got to make sure
you're telling us everything.

693
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,275
So we're gonna have you talk
to one of our agents

694
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,351
someone who knows
your operation pretty well.

695
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,360
Hello, Raul.

696
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,787
How'd it go?

697
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,280
Raul took a plea.

698
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,460
He's headed to a maximum-security
facility for his own protection.

699
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,089
With what he gave us, Campos will
be going away for a long time, too.

700
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,347
I can't thank you enough.

701
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,427
- If there's anything
- There is.

702
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,327
The rumor you heard about me...
keep it a rumor.

703
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,098
Don't worry.

704
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,954
Can't even tell the difference.

705
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:21,160
Of course you can't.

706
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,243
It took three prototypes, but...

707
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,553
that one's my masterpiece.

708
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,093
- Now... the rest of the money.

709
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:33,076
Any way of telling
what these things are for?

710
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,460
Of course there are ways.

711
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,421
There's an extra 5 grand in the bag
if you could tell me.

712
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:42,884
You know, I got a guy who wants to know
what buildings these get you into.

713
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,875
I can find out.

714
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,516
Come back next week.

715
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:03,180
In intelligence, a good adversary
lets you think you're winning.

716
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,950
They know the best attack
is the one you don't see coming.

717
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,014
So you learn to be vigilant when
you think you've got the upper hand...

718
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:13,039
because that's when they'll strike.

719
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,098
If you walk in on a corpse
and can't catch your breath,

720
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:32,970
you might be suffering
from a panic attack,

721
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,563
or someone might be pumping nitrogen gas
into the room to displace

722
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:37,814
all the oxygen.

723
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,930
It's not a bad way to kill someone.

724
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,780
They suffocate before
they realize there's a problem.

725
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,781
It won't show up on a tox screen,
and there's no trail left behind...

726
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,367
unless you know where to look.

727
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,560
There are a lot of disadvantages
to being at the scene of a crime.

728
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,132
You can get arrested.
You can get yourself killed.

729
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:06,455
And no matter how many times
you've done it,

730
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:09,262
it's never fun hanging out
with a dead body.

731
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,166
But the advantage is there's
no one around to object

732
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,688
to a little intelligence gathering.

733
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,983
Hi, honey. Want some coffee?
I made a pot.

734
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,535
No, uh, we got to go.
Don't we have the session?

735
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,407
I decided to find another counselor,

736
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,329
someone who has better questions.

737
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:48,050
Mom, what I did while I was away,
I don't like to talk about.

738
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,637
But if you want to spend
time together, we can do that.

739
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:55,917
We can take a pottery class together.

740
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,750
No, thanks.

741
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,870
That's all I need is
another ugly ceramic ashtray.

742
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:14,911
I remember when you came home
with the groceries.

743
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:17,427
You said you bought them.

744
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:21,398
And you looked so proud...

745
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,993
that it broke my heart.

746
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:29,717
I thought that you didn't
want me to know, Michael.

747
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,643
I always hated that bag boy.

748
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,850
It's nice to know
I was right about him.

749
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:54,934
He was awfully good, don't you think?

750
00:40:55,054 --> 00:40:57,578
- Are you gonna kill everyone I talk to?
- Better them than you, Michael.

751
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:00,247
No more nitrogen gas,
no more high-powered rifles.

752
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:02,500
All right, fine.

753
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,999
Oh, look. You forgot your money.

754
00:41:06,852 --> 00:41:09,460
I'm never gonna work for you, Carla.
Not that way.

755
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,080
That's okay, Michael.

756
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,609
I'll hold on to it for you.

757
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,639
No coffee today?

758
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,685
Sorry,I have another meeting...

759
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,643
But we'll be in touch.

760
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,790
Hey, Mike. What's up?

761
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,153
Yeah, Sam. I think I got something.

762
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,526
Carla speaks arabic
with a kurdish accent.

763
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:37,570
You think she was stationed there?

764
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,870
I was hoping you could ask around.

765
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,470
Will do, buddy. But I got to
tell you, it's not much to go on.

766
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,660
I know, Sam. But it's more than we had.
