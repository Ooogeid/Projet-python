1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:01,750
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,179
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,751
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,818
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,125
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,771
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:16,139
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:19,040
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,440
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:28,318
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,696
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:33,115
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:35,325
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,953
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,830
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,495
<i>Previously on</i> Burn Notice.

18
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,254
- Name's Tom Strickler.
- What is it that you do, Tom?

19
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,670
A bit like an agent.

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,473
I told you before,
I'm not interested in your money.

21
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:54,261
It's all about the burn notice, 

22
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,720
I might be able to help.

23
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,182
The fact that he's a weasel
doesn't give you pause?

24
00:00:58,485 --> 00:01:00,976
It doesn't feel right.
Promise me you'll walk away.

25
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,085
I have to go.

26
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,896
You do this, and you have my word.

27
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,433
The powers that be will review
your burn notice.

28
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,652
For you. Happy birthday.

29
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,249
I just got a call from Washington.

30
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:18,452
There's been some movement
on your burn notice.

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,387
This is just the beginning,
superstar.

32
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,903
I just can't stay here in Miami

33
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:27,222
and watch.

34
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,144
<i>When you work as a covert operative,</i>

35
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:45,646
<i>there's no line between who you are</i>

36
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,834
<i>and what you do.</i>

37
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,695
<i>You are who you need
to be for the operation.</i>

38
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,368
<i>It makes you effective.
It keeps things simple.</i>

39
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:55,849
<i>But when you spend so much time
living as someone else,</i>

40
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:58,308
<i>sometimes the people
you care about most</i>

41
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,161
<i>begin to wonder who you really are.</i>

42
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,642
I'm upstairs, Fi.

43
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:09,879
What's that you're driving?
It didn't sound like your car outside.

44
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:11,432
It's a rental.

45
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,715
I sold my car.

46
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:14,413
Really?

47
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:17,470
Your car didn't exactly
have a pink slip.

48
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,093
The buyer didn't mind.

49
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:20,598
Not at that price.

50
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:25,204
This moving-out-of-town thing.

51
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,938
If you're trying to make a point...

52
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,227
I'm not trying to make a point, Michael.
I'm trying to make a change.

53
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,446
I'm going home.

54
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,156
I told my mother to expect me.

55
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,284
We had one fight,
and you decide to go back to Ireland?

56
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,812
This isn't about one fight, Michael.

57
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:46,406
If you didn't see this coming,
then you weren't paying attention.

58
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:50,046
You're too worried
about your own future

59
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,819
for there to be one for us.

60
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,589
I'm not doing this for me.

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,133
I'm out in the cold,
and the longer I stay there,

62
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:58,385
the more I endanger
everyone in my life.

63
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:01,387
Don't you pretend this is about us.
It's about you!

64
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:03,848
Which is fine.

65
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,942
It's just time
I did what I need to do,

66
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:11,351
too.

67
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,997
Have you seen my H&K USP compact,

68
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:22,757
the one with the silver slide?

69
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:25,621
I need to finish packing,
and I think I must have left it here.

70
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:33,002
I saw it around here somewhere.

71
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:34,922
I'll find it,
and I'll bring it to you.

72
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:37,279
You're not leaving today, are you?

73
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,030
Someone must have made themselves
a powerful new friend.

74
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,405
It's not every day the guy running
the agency warehouse in Miami

75
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,286
gets a call
from the deputy director.

76
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,788
- So?
- Your file just landed on his desk.

77
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,667
This is being taken seriously.

78
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,349
Over my strenuous objection.

79
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:14,962
But I seem to be
the only one who thinks

80
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,172
this is a waste
of the Agency's time.

81
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:20,134
Great. So will you be the one
running my review?

82
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,586
I'm just the liaison.

83
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,083
Various regional experts
will be doing your review.

84
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,147
They'll get
to tear apart the story of...

85
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,531
poor, misunderstood Michael Westen

86
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:31,020
and put you
on the blacklist for good.

87
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,356
If I were you,

88
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,523
I'd start
preparing myself for disappointment.

89
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:35,793
Funny.

90
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:37,568
I was gonna give you
the same advice.

91
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:41,530
I'll be calling you to set up
the first meeting soon.

92
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,527
- Don't you want to wish me luck?
- Not really.

93
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,730
But I'm supposed to tell you
to stay out of trouble.

94
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,457
You're tiptoeing
through a minefield.

95
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:06,391
<i>There's a reason
spies try to stay detached.</i>

96
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,813
<i>When you get emotional
about something,</i>

97
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:12,427
<i>even if it's just your ex-girlfriend's
.45-caliber handgun,</i>

98
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,002
<i>you get distracted.</i>

99
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:16,941
<i>And getting distracted
can be very, very dangerous.</i>

100
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,070
You remember my brother Sean?

101
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,951
You met back in Ireland.

102
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,019
Michael McBride.

103
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,615
It's been a while.

104
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:33,415
Last I saw you,
you were saving my sister

105
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,484
from those English bastards
that had her pinned down in Belfast.

106
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,379
Spies need to remember
every cover ID

107
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:40,774
they've ever worn

108
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,218
because you never know
when you might need to put one back on.

109
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,995
It's a good thing
they're such lousy shots.

110
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,867
Otherwise, we would have been saying
our last Hail Marys together.

111
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:51,317
Glad you're here.

112
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:53,297
We could use a man
who can shoot a gun.

113
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:55,922
- Why's that?
- It's bad news, McBride.

114
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,023
Someone's coming to kill my sister.

115
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,904
Yogurt
Team

116
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:10,272
This is it?
Don't you have any real guns?

117
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:12,933
I am in the middle of a move.
All of my big toys

118
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:15,369
are packed up on a boat,
waiting to be smuggled back.

119
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:17,073
America's taken its toll, sis.

120
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:19,420
You've lost your edge
and your accent.

121
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:22,251
O'Neill is looking for
an Irishwoman.

122
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,554
I'm not gonna hold up
a neon sign that says,

123
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,376
 "Here I am! Come blow my head off!"

124
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,137
Look, I'm way behind,
and it sounds like I can't afford to be,

125
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,804
so start from the beginning.

126
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,818
His name is Thomas O'Neill.

127
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:36,395
One of those ultraradical bastards.

128
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:39,568
The kind of man who would blow up
a church on a Sunday,

129
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:41,817
kind of man I'd love to kiss
with a chain saw.

130
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:43,902
And why does he want you dead, Fi?

131
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:46,864
- It's a long story.
- Talk quickly, then.

132
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,490
You don't need a history lesson.

133
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:51,930
All that matters is O'Neill's
supposed to be making his move today,

134
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,003
and we're not suitably armed.

135
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:57,087
I'll make a call.
I know someone who delivers.

136
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,793
We'll need a proper hardware.
How quick can they get here?

137
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,993
Not quick enough.
Is that him?

138
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:05,632
Thomas O'Neill.

139
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,413
Bloodthirsty hooligan got here
faster than I expected.

140
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,211
- We need to move now.
- No.

141
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,183
I'll teach the son of a bitch

142
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:19,479
how to breathe through
the top of his skull.

143
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:21,479
We're outnumbered. Do the math.

144
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:24,318
They think Fiona's alone.
We can dig in, surprise them.

145
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,236
No.
That's a trained extraction team.

146
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:28,321
We leave now or we die.

147
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,565
There's one on the corner.
He didn't see us.

148
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:47,534
Well, he's seen us now.

149
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,421
They came out the back.
She's on foot, and she's not alone.

150
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:55,426
Spread out, sweep the neighborhood.
Come on, come on, come on!

151
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:57,787
We need a car now.

152
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,561
I'll get us one.
Stay here.

153
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,069
- You never told him!
- No, Michael,

154
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:05,760
not even a Glenanne would forgive me
for working with an American spy.

155
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:08,465
Everyone at home still thinks
you're from Kilkenny.

156
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:11,114
- Sean can never know.
- Don't worry. He won't.

157
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,090
He better not.

158
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,030
<i>- Hey, Mike. How you...
</i>- Sam, We have a situation.

159
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,009
Someone's in town trying to kill Fi.

160
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:20,268
Her brother has come
into town to protect her,

161
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:22,760
- so we need a place to lay low.
<i>- Jesus. Okay.</i>

162
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,878
- <i>Let me make a call.</i>
- Thanks, and, Sam?

163
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,005
What have I told you
about my time in Ireland?

164
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:30,448
- <i>Not much, Mike.</i>
- Well, my name is Michael McBride,

165
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:32,742
and you're just gonna have
to roll with it.

166
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:47,025
You must be Sean.
I'm Sam Axe.

167
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:49,392
Okay, Sam.
What's your background?

168
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,952
We're doing background checks now?
McBride knows me.

169
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:54,101
- I don't know you. So...
- That's enough.

170
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,818
I trust him. Fiona trusts him.
Now so do you.

171
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,203
We good here?

172
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,313
It's a new foreclosure.

173
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,542
My real-estate buddy doesn't expect
anybody here for at least a month.

174
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:07,421
Better not take that long
to get rid of O'Neill.

175
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:12,121
So, why is this guy
so hot for you, Fi?

176
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:14,721
I thought you bit the heads off
all your old boyfriends.

177
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:15,804
I met O'Neill

178
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,140
while I was looking for
my sister's killer.

179
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:19,516
You had a sister?

180
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:22,140
You never mentioned that before.

181
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:23,812
I don't like to talk about it.

182
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,422
There were seven of us.

183
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:28,322
Five boys, two girls.

184
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,277
Claire was the youngest.

185
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,895
When she was taken,

186
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,531
I was angry and I was loud.

187
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:38,009
O'Neill thought
I was as radical as he was,

188
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,602
and he told me about a bombing

189
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:41,467
he was planning at a prep school.

190
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:44,875
And you made sure those explosives
never made it to the target.

191
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,585
A few years later,
he resurfaced and came after me.

192
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,671
It's one of the reasons
that I left home.

193
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,842
After Fi left,
O'Neill disappeared again.

194
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,427
I hoped he'd blown himself up,

195
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:56,929
but then word got out

196
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,889
Fi was in touch
with folks in Dublin.

197
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,934
Suddenly O'Neill's back on the grid
and on his way to Miami.

198
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:03,352
Right. Fiona?

199
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,354
You'll stay at home.
Sam and I...

200
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,833
To hell with that!

201
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,263
With four of us looking,
we'll find him much faster.

202
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,776
He knows you.

203
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,194
If you think you're dealing
with him all by yourself...

204
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,691
We'll discuss the dealing
when we do the finding.

205
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,824
But Sam and I are doing the finding.

206
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:19,251
First, you say run.

207
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:20,726
Now you say hide.

208
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:23,372
I crossed an ocean
to tear a man's limbs off...

209
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,859
There's no point
in fighting with him.

210
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:28,253
Trust me.

211
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,592
I am not one of your damn clients.

212
00:10:56,735 --> 00:10:58,500
Do we love this place or what?

213
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,660
I almost didn't go for it,
but then I thought, "I'm worth it".

214
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,993
You are, Strickler.

215
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:05,455
Look, my day just got crazy, so...

216
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,127
No time for a tour?

217
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,607
Well, whenever you're ready,
it'll be here.

218
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,920
So, you know how this is gonna work,
right?

219
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,835
Apparently,
they're gonna look at my activities

220
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,882
when I was regularly employed.

221
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,635
But I get
to set the record straight.

222
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,263
Well,
"straightish" might be a better term.

223
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,363
- What does it mean?
- They're delicate issues.

224
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,727
Phrases to avoid, phrases to employ.
It needs proper handling.

225
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,312
- Truth doesn't need handling.
- The truth?

226
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:30,647
Come on.

227
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,977
You are not in the truth business.
You never were.

228
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,306
Partners have to trust each other,
so trust me

229
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,680
when I say right now,
your reputation is valuable.

230
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:45,425
People fear you.
We can use that.

231
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,748
To make you money.

232
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,732
Did you think
rebuilding a reputation would be free?

233
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:52,719
Money greases palms,
opens doors, buys documents,

234
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:55,005
and it puts you
right back where you want to be.

235
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,647
Now, understand.

236
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,717
This project is very delicate,

237
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,136
so let's not break it.

238
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,700
I'll send you paperwork tomorrow.

239
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:06,083
Your side of the story.
Study up.

240
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,728
This is
Thomas O'Neill's interpol file?

241
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:23,907
You think a guy
who crossed an ocean to kill Fi

242
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,240
would have a file
with more meat on its bones.

243
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,365
That's it.

244
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,956
He was supposed to be this one-man,
ultraradical splinter group.

245
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:32,972
Well, he's got the reputation,

246
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:34,421
but not the rap sheet.

247
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,327
He's not tied to anything.

248
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,452
He isn't.

249
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:43,266
Interpol thinks he's freelancing.
For about 12 bombings in Europe,

250
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,515
all with the same chemical signature,
but nobody can pin anything on the guy.

251
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:49,496
O'Neill has known associates
in the States, they're money guys.

252
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,769
One of them
just bought a condo in South Beach.

253
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:55,190
My bet is it's not a vacation home.
We should get eyes on it.

254
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,957
What are you two doing?
Would you put those things away?

255
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:02,332
Mom, wait.
Mom.

256
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:04,157
Come on in.

257
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:06,499
Boys...

258
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,300
This is Tiffany.

259
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,497
Tiffany Ward.
Tiffany Ward realty.

260
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:14,960
Are you selling the house?

261
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,698
I was thinking about it.

262
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:20,807
And with you about to get
your old job back and Fi heading home,

263
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:24,094
I just thought maybe it was about time
that I made a change myself.

264
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,308
- Can we start in the bedrooms?
- Sure. Yeah, they're in the back.

265
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:32,170
I raised two boys here.

266
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,700
The way they behaved,
it was more like four.

267
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:37,580
So, I think a large family
can live here very comfortably.

268
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:40,260
This house is just filled
with so much love and...

269
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:42,070
Not now, Mikey. We got to go.

270
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,205
I'm just saying, Mike,
it's okay if your head is spinning.

271
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,210
I mean, first it's your girl,
now it's your childhood home.

272
00:13:58,335 --> 00:13:59,838
I never liked that house.

273
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,590
Yeah, but you like Fiona, right?

274
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,397
There's O'Neill.

275
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:23,069
Why does it look like the sons
of the revolution are ready for battle?

276
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:30,076
Because he knows Fiona is on his tail.
That's her in the Sedan.

277
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,244
Oh, crap.

278
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:33,920
She must have tracked him
through his connections.

279
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,495
She went around me!

280
00:14:35,695 --> 00:14:37,556
Mike, she thinks that he's alone.

281
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:40,795
She has no idea what she's getting into.
It's gonna be World War III down there.

282
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:45,842
O'Neill is mine.

283
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,599
I'll give you first shot,
but when you miss

284
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,598
because you broke a nail
or dropped your purse,

285
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,767
I'll step in
and clean him up for you.

286
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:55,785
She's not picking up.

287
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:00,941
Give me the keys.

288
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:03,735
- That's Miss Reynold's car.
- The keys! Now!

289
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,661
No, don't, Mike.

290
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,250
Hello, gorgeous.
I've been waiting for this.

291
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,834
They knew we were coming.

292
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,248
What the hell?

293
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:41,575
Back inside now!

294
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,812
Sorry about the Buick.
There was no other way...

295
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:52,687
Just... Don't.

296
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:05,755
What part of "Sam and I
will do the finding" was unclear?

297
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,341
You get on my page now,
or someone's getting killed.

298
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:11,011
No more ignoring your phone.
No more running off without...

299
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,388
McBride, stop your lecturing.
Why do you think we're here?

300
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:16,485
We came to apologize

301
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,018
and say thanks.

302
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,229
I mean, I'm not thrilled
that the bastard's still breathing,

303
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:23,064
but I'm glad that we are.

304
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:26,900
Please. I've been dodging
Miss Reynold's calls for an hour.

305
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,214
I'm sure the cops ran the plates
on the Buick, told her...

306
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,889
Oh, wait. Here we go.

307
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,805
That's her, again.

308
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,703
Now that we found O'Neill,
how exactly are we dealing with him?

309
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,342
Well, he needs to find you.

310
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,297
He'll talk to anyone
who could help him,

311
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:44,200
which gives me the in I need to get him
and his whole team busted by the police.

312
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,990
You can't just walk right up to him.

313
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,048
As soon as he hears you're Irish...

314
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,634
I'll approach him as an American
with a deal.

315
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:51,802
Really?

316
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,175
Sure you can pull that off?

317
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:58,732
I've gone undercover
as an American before.

318
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:00,280
I'll be fine.

319
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:02,854
I don't know.
Your accent's a bit dodgy.

320
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:28,338
The uninvited could at least
have the decency to introduce himself.

321
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:29,950
My name's unimportant.

322
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:32,650
You're sitting at the wrong table.
Fellas, get him out of here.

323
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:35,637
I'm not. This is the planning committee
for the Glenanne wake, right?

324
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:40,642
Easy.

325
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:44,813
What are you gonna do, play me a song?
What's he gonna do?

326
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Funny.

327
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:49,859
I want you to tell me
if you recognize this voice.

328
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:51,695
<i>O'Neill should be in the ground.</i>

329
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,280
<i>He and his bloody army
were ready for us.</i>

330
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,205
<i>We need to leave town now.</i>

331
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,630
I own a company. I'm an arms dealer.

332
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,453
If it goes "boom" or "bang"

333
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,440
or helps unhappy people
kill each other, I sell it.

334
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:04,624
She works for me.

335
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,524
Whatever, I couldn't care less.

336
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,670
I wanna know how you come
to have her voice on tape.

337
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,470
My line of work breeds distrust,
which is why I monitor communications.

338
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:15,460
What did I hear when I listened in
on Miss Glenanne?

339
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,335
An Irishman named Thomas O'Neill

340
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,410
has come with a small army to Miami
to kill her.

341
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,062
You got a lot of brass on you, fella.
I'll give you that.

342
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Now...

343
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:29,441
It won't surprise you to learn

344
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,009
I can make her appear whenever I want,
wherever I choose.

345
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,391
Mr. Magic Man,
if you make her appear now,

346
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,666
I'll buy you a mighty fine drink.

347
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,502
I wish it were that simple.
But she's doing a job for me.

348
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:45,290
If she disappears, I need someone
to do what she no longer can.

349
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:48,418
- I was thinking of you.
- I don't deal with people I don't know.

350
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,004
- You should get to know me.
- I don't think I will.

351
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:54,245
I found her once.
I'll find her again.

352
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:58,655
If that doesn't work out for you,

353
00:18:58,865 --> 00:18:59,865
call me.

354
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,651
I thought the Irish were impulsive.

355
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:17,238
Okay, so, where are we
if he doesn't go for your proposition?

356
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:20,575
- In need of a backup plan.
- Well, maybe we should ask Fi.

357
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:23,585
She might have a perspective
that we don't.

358
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:25,615
That's the real-estate lady!

359
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:29,167
Butch, sundance, cool it.

360
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:34,019
Make sure to tell her about the quality
craftsmanship in the new sun-room.

361
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,926
- You here about the house?
- No, I'm here about your son.

362
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:40,804
- Can Michael come out and play?
- What the hell are you doing here?

363
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,598
Exactly what I said I would do,
delivering your study materials.

364
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:50,585
Here it is.

365
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:54,926
Exactly what you're gonna tell
our friends at the CIA.

366
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:02,534
You want me to say I worked a job
helping a Somali warlord?

367
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,244
Somali businessman.

368
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,238
It's an intelligence asset.
It was a real operation.

369
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:10,583
Lucky for us, all the operatives died,
so nobody can say you weren't there,

370
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,857
Lines up perfectly
with your time in Africa,

371
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:16,089
and it helps me to set up a little
side project I have here in Miami.

372
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,298
What side job?

373
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:21,025
Too early to talk details.
Let's focus on the businessman.

374
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,428
He's agreed to vouch

375
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,557
for your unimpeachable conduct
on the job for a price,

376
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,100
which I will pay.

377
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:28,268
No sale.

378
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:32,105
I'm not clearing my name
by getting in bed with a murderer.

379
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:34,010
Stop being so naive.

380
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:37,610
You're replacing one lie with another,
and this lie washes you clean.

381
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:39,312
Nothing about this is clean.

382
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,971
You need to realize that
this isn't about telling the world

383
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:44,409
the truth about Michael Westen.

384
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,127
This is about getting
your old job back.

385
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,680
In the end, what does it matter?

386
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:53,490
And please tell your mom
sorry about the drapes.

387
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:56,365
They looked better
in the catalog, honestly.

388
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,883
You take that. We'll talk later.

389
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:05,125
<i>It's O'Neill.</i>

390
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:07,712
<i>I've had a change of heart.
Let's meet.</i>

391
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:09,745
He didn't say why?

392
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,995
He just said O'Neill called him
and we needed to be ready.

393
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,651
Why are you coming home
without McBride?

394
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:24,449
People are who they are.
They don't change 'cause you want to.

395
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:26,951
So, you're still in love with him.

396
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:32,743
- You ready?
- Of course.

397
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,130
- Where we headed?
- I need O'Neill to deliver a package.

398
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,865
- What package?
- A little gift

399
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,963
with a big prison sentence
attached to it.

400
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:43,988
Let's go.

401
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:45,525
You know,

402
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,935
I lost one sister.
I can't lose another.

403
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:52,226
I wanna thank you
for protecting Fiona.

404
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:56,805
You're an honest man, and I'm honored
to be fighting beside you.

405
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,935
I'm glad you came to your senses.

406
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,505
Well, we'll see.

407
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:13,373
- Now talk.
- It's simple.

408
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,501
I'll give you Miss Glenanne's location,
you get to kill her.

409
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,319
I deliver you the girl,
and in return,

410
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:20,964
you deliver a shipment of assault rifles
to one of my buyers.

411
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,082
I got a better idea.
Fellas?

412
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:26,290
I'm gonna shoot little bits off you
until you tell me where she is.

413
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:28,721
Where do you want it first?
Your elbow or your bloody kneecap?

414
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:31,875
I really don't have time for this.

415
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:35,186
Put the gun down,
or I'll have you put down.

416
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:39,273
I'm not sure you've taken stock
of the situation.

417
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:50,910
Well, there you go, eh?

418
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,400
You couldn't be trusted,
so I brought insurance.

419
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,581
Take your hands off me
and put the gun down.

420
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,255
Gun going down.

421
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:04,507
Very good. You can follow orders.

422
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,384
Now, tell me we have a deal.

423
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,718
If you stop lighting me up
like a little Christmas tree,

424
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:12,557
then just maybe
we will have a deal, yes.

425
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:17,256
All right, that's the signal.
Turn them off.

426
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:23,790
- Sean, what are you doing?
- I can take them all out.

427
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:25,545
That is not a risk you get to take.

428
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:27,945
I just agreed to your deal.

429
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:29,991
Simple miscommunication.

430
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:36,458
Sean, they're gonna kill McBride.

431
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:38,957
I can get them all.

432
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:41,965
Turn the laser off.

433
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,350
This is your last chance, partner,
or the deal dies right here.

434
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:47,675
So do you.
Get this thing off me.

435
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:01,955
- That wasn't so difficult, was it?
- Yeah, we'll talk soon.

436
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:12,145
That's everything on your list.

437
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:15,453
Time to bring
Thomas O'Neill's monster to life.

438
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,997
Meet O'Neill's signature bomb.

439
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,708
He's trotted that thing out 12 times
and never been caught.

440
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:24,378
Let's make lucky number 13 the one that
links him to all his uncredited work.

441
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,820
You remember Jack Tracey,
from the bicycle shop by the church?

442
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:30,480
Just got off the phone with him.

443
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:32,655
The old guy. He was good to us.

444
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:35,020
Right, real plugged in
to the underground.

445
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:36,425
Well, he's got bad news.

446
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,520
There's a rumor that O'Neill's taking
you home, putting you up for sale.

447
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,355
Sounds like there's a number of folks
with ample reason to hate you

448
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,450
- already showing an interest.
- That could be a lot of people.

449
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:47,985
It seems O'Neill's looking
to raise his profile back home.

450
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,280
Thinks you're his ticket.
I should have force-fed him a bullet.

451
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,783
If you had, you two would be having
this conversation alone.

452
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,155
I could have put them all down.
I had a clear shot.

453
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,923
Did you have five clear shots?

454
00:24:58,295 --> 00:25:01,207
I think you're overestimating
your ability to hit five moving targets.

455
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,333
You think so?


456
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,794
- Well, how about I...
- How about you shut up?

457
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,675
We have work to do.

458
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:15,100
<i>Bomb makers, like master chefs,</i>

459
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:17,225
<i>tend to have a signature dish.</i>

460
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:21,227
<i>If you can duplicate it, you can leave
their fingerprint wherever you want.</i>

461
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,440
<i>Some bombs are designed
to remove an obstacle,</i>

462
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,193
<i>some bombs are designed
to be loud and scary,</i>

463
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,521
<i>while other bombs are just designed
to kill and maim.</i>

464
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:36,525
Rat poison?

465
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,445
It contains an anticoagulant.

466
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:42,975
He likes his victims to hemorrhage
and bleed out.

467
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:45,501
He wants them to suffer.

468
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,005
He does it for the headlines and
the pictures splashed on the front page.

469
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,673
He blows up people
just to spread fear.

470
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:54,385
Go.

471
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,890
Pick up some screws
while you're there.

472
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,415
You two play nice.

473
00:25:59,055 --> 00:26:00,600
You think you can handle that?

474
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:02,435
Guess we'll find out, McBride.

475
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:11,932
Hey, mom. Sorry I missed your calls.

476
00:26:12,057 --> 00:26:14,507
I came by to see
if you need anything.

477
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:18,054
Sure, you did. That's why you're in here
stealing all my screws.

478
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,710
It's all right.
I don't need to know.

479
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:24,839
Let's pretend that you're helping me
clean my garage for my open house.

480
00:26:25,465 --> 00:26:26,660
That sounds good.

481
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,385
So, any other big life changes
you wanna tell your son about?

482
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:31,795
What?

483
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,750
I thought you'd be thrilled.

484
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,880
I know you never wanted
to come back to this house again.

485
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:38,554
No, I didn't, but that's me.

486
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,240
You're the one who always insisted that
every memory we had here was a good one.

487
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:46,369
- Or did you suddenly change your mind?
- Maybe I finally decided to move on.

488
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:50,066
It's something I learned
from my son, no doubt.

489
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:52,215
Anyway...

490
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,573
I didn't want to feel bad
about throwing this stuff out

491
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,464
without showing it
to you first, okay?

492
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,825
I ran across it
when I was showing Tiffany around.

493
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,316
My model airplanes.

494
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,288
There's another box just like it
inside in the closet.

495
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:07,708
- You don't want this stuff anymore?
- I was hoping that you would, Michael.

496
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:15,985
This isn't gonna make any sense to you,
but most people,

497
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:17,525
normal people,

498
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,179
go through their life
collecting boxes like this.

499
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:23,780
I just don't want you
to ever look back

500
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:26,055
and regret letting this stuff go.

501
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:28,690
Now, if you're convinced
that you never will,

502
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,765
I will throw it away for you.

503
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:33,479
I'll just... I'll take a look.

504
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:36,225
I'll go get the other box.

505
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:53,814
Well, this is gonna make
O'Neill look like

506
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:57,120
he's got one hell of an interest
in the basement of the State department.

507
00:27:57,245 --> 00:27:59,580
He's gonna have
a lot of explaing to do.

508
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:00,928
That's the noose.

509
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,535
You think this slippery Irishman's
gonna stick his head in?

510
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,420
If we want to get him busted, we need
to put him behind the wheel of this van.

511
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:09,702
And if he won't do it on his own,
we'll have to just gently encourage him.

512
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:16,245
- McBride, I'll be right there.
- Right, Sean.

513
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,406
That's the last of what you packed.

514
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,940
It's such a shame
to leave so much behind.

515
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:25,115
I was just getting comfortable.

516
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:28,560
I know you're trained
to walk away from everything

517
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:31,500
- in 30 minutes or less, but...
- It's not easy for everyone.

518
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:38,895
I can't believe in a few days,
I'm gonna wake up back home.

519
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:41,177
And you'll be you again, Fi.

520
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,555
I wonder what it will be like.

521
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:48,434
You'll have your friends there
and your family.

522
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:50,811
They don't know me anymore.

523
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,856
- You're still the same person.
- No, I'm not.

524
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,415
Who I am now

525
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,069
has so much to do
with what I've done here,

526
00:28:58,525 --> 00:28:59,987
what I've done with you.

527
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:11,405
It's okay, Michael.

528
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:13,959
We're so not good at this.

529
00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:17,546
- McBride, everything taken are of?
- Yeah, let's go then.

530
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,297
Sean, you have to stop parking
your stolen car in the side streets.

531
00:29:22,422 --> 00:29:23,590
It's too exposed.

532
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:26,055
What? I left it
in the parking lot this morning.

533
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:29,382
That's not your Toyota?
A block away, parked behind some trees?

534
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:50,996
Get the girl!
Get the girl out of here now!

535
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,574
No, he has to live!

536
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,794
You got some good friends, Westen.

537
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,597
Michael, thank god you're okay.

538
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,976
- Okay, just keep holding the pressure.
- I am holding the pressure.

539
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,857
- Damn it. I can't get it.
- Where is she?

540
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:18,197
Sorry about leaving you back there,
but broken ribs weren't a priority.

541
00:30:18,322 --> 00:30:20,109
- You were breathing steady.
- Where is she?

542
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:23,320
I don't know. I got here,
found Sean, called Maddie.

543
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:25,531
Sean wouldn't let Sam
take him to the hospital.

544
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:29,160
If we got caught up explaining this crap
to the cops, we'd never find Fi.

545
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,878
Push hard right here.

546
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,998
- Why won't it stop?
- How did O'Neill find the safe...

547
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:55,120
All right, walk the perimeters
and keep your radios on channel one.

548
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:58,240
Hello, sweetheart.
This way. That's right. Come on in.

549
00:30:58,365 --> 00:30:59,398
There you go.

550
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,616
Stop your nonsense, sweetheart!

551
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:04,335
There we go.

552
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,027
Where's Fiona?

553
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:18,167
You tell me where Fiona is now!

554
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:20,915
I'll call you back.

555
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,592
How would I know that?

556
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:26,467
Thomas O'Neill stopped one of his men
from executing me.

557
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:29,096
It sounded like he made a deal
with someone to keep me alive.

558
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,932
- I thought of you.
- Bravo.

559
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,640
Put that all together yourself?

560
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,100
No point in denying it.
You'd have figured it out eventually.

561
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,852
You sent Fiona to her death.

562
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:42,358
What happens after she gets there,
well, she's a big girl.

563
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,945
- Strickler, you have no idea...
- I did this the cleanest way possible.

564
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,437
Sure, the brother got clipped,
but you were spared.

565
00:31:48,562 --> 00:31:50,491
I'm your goddamn
white knight, Michael.

566
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,535
- You tell me where...
- Get back.

567
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,703
Get the hell back right now.

568
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:57,050
I'm getting a little sick
of your ingratitude.

569
00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:58,933
I'm the one trying to help you out.

570
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,634
You wanted back in? Guess what.

571
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:04,880
A gun-dealing, bomb-making girlfriend
wasn't helping your case. She had to go.

572
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,412
It was clear you were too attached
to do what needed to be done,

573
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:10,137
so, like a good partner
I did it for you.

574
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:13,932
What the hell are you doing?

575
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:18,403
You're staying put for the next hour.
By then, the cargo company I hired

576
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:21,160
will have Miss Glenanne and her fan club
in international waters,

577
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:23,176
heroic rescue attempts
will be impossible,

578
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:26,610
and you can move on, knowing
there wasn't a damn thing you could do.

579
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:28,946
I'll be the bad guy. You're welcome.

580
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:30,489
Tell me where she is.

581
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:36,412
- Get out of my way.
- You can't have the girl and the job!

582
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:39,510
She doesn't fit into your future,
our future.

583
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:42,626
So why don't you do yourself a favor
and just forget the past?

584
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,888
Fiona is not my past.

585
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:03,150
- <i>Mike, where are you?</i>
- Sam, listen to me.

586
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:06,760
Strickler arranged for O'Neill
to get out of the US on a cargo ship.

587
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:10,613
He's been making regular calls
to a fishing house on Key Biscayne.

588
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:13,050
<i>That must be where O'Neill has Fi.
It's perfect.</i>

589
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:15,410
<i>Those places are secluded.
They got private docks.</i>

590
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,707
Perfect place to load a prisoner
onto our transport boat.

591
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,623
- How's Sean?
- <i>He's fine, he's stable.</i>

592
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:22,525
I'm coming to get you.

593
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:43,187
This is the place.

594
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:45,731
- Fi's still here.
- You sure?

595
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:48,315
That's the fishing boat.

596
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,656
Let's get that bomb in the bag, get it
on the boat and call the coast guard.

597
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:56,795
Make sure the Feds
catch him with it this time.

598
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:05,915
God, I've waited a long time
for this moment.

599
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,637
Well, so have I.

600
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,130
In my version,

601
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,850
I'm stabbing you in the throat
with an ice pick.

602
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,625
Is that how you saw it?

603
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:16,530
I can't say I did, no.

604
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,516
No, it wasn't like that.
But don't worry.

605
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:22,184
You'll soon be spending a bit of time
with some sharp metal instruments.

606
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:24,616
You're putting me
on the auction block.

607
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:27,648
You're not man enough
to do it yourself.

608
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:30,725
If this was just about you and me...

609
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,228
I'd be holding a bloody hammer,

610
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:37,658
and you'd be choking on a mouthful
of teeth, them little teeth there.

611
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,526
The thing is,
it's bigger than us, you see?

612
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:45,965
When I set foot on Irish soil,
it's gonna be a whole new world for me

613
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,735
because there are
some very powerful men

614
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,210
who are gonna give me
anything I want

615
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:52,835
in exchange for you.

616
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:55,300
You see?
Even a seat at the table.

617
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:57,355
There's no place in Ireland

618
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,638
for a bastard like you.

619
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,808
There's always room for a patriot.

620
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:04,655
You're no patriot.

621
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:06,603
You're a monster,

622
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:10,107
who wraps himself in a cause
to justify murdering children!

623
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:12,151
Even your own country
wants you dead!

624
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:14,445
You're wrong!

625
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:16,755
You hit like a girl.

626
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:37,880
- If anything happens to me...
- I'm finishing this, brother.

627
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:40,330
I'm getting Fi out of there
no matter what.

628
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:42,639
Just don't ever tell her
I said that.

629
00:36:00,085 --> 00:36:01,685
O'Neill, get out here.

630
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:03,702
What the hell's going on?

631
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,838
Get to the boat.

632
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,521
Keep him covered!

633
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,926
Get to the boat!
Start the boat up!

634
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:40,572
Sam, Fiona's clear.
Get them on the boat.

635
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:44,637
Get in the water, you bastards!
Go get her!

636
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:46,078
She's gone! Forget her!

637
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,747
No, we need to get to the boat!

638
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,922
- Sam, you got eyes on Fi?
- <i>I don't see her, I'm calling it in.</i>

639
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:03,794
<i>Coast guard. Is this an emergency?</i>

640
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,224
I just saw a group of men with guns
loading something onto a boat.

641
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:04,698
How are they?

642
00:38:05,295 --> 00:38:06,295
Better.

643
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:08,345
They've been asleep for hours.

644
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,150
I was supposed to have
an open house here today.

645
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:12,975
- I'm sorry, mom.
- No.

646
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,418
I've decided to take the listing
off the market.

647
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:20,380
I don't think it's time for me
to leave yet.

648
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,507
If that's what you think
is best for you.

649
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,218
It's not just doing
what's best for me, Michael.

650
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:29,014
You hide your clients here.
You let your friends stay here.

651
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,967
I don't think you're ready
to say goodbye, either.

652
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:34,227
Maybe you're right.

653
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:37,945
Get over here.

654
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,090
So, it's Westen now, is it?

655
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:50,935
It has been for a while.
I owe you an explanation.

656
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,163
Back in Ireland,

657
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,170
there were a lot of questions
about whether or not you were one of us.

658
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:59,095
I always thought you were.

659
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,100
- Now I know I was right.
- Thank you, Sean.

660
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:07,425
The problem is
O'Neill outed you as an American.

661
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:10,300
You can never go back,

662
00:39:10,425 --> 00:39:11,890
and neither can she.

663
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,560
- Should I be looking out for anyone?
- No.

664
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,562
- I should be able to keep them at bay.
- I'll owe you for that.

665
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,815
The hell you will.
That squares us.

666
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,585
I heard what you did to Strickler.

667
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,945
If you need any help running...

668
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:28,155
Strickler's body was found
next to a certain type of bomb.

669
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,576
O'Neill will be charged with his murder
and the 12 bombings in Europe.

670
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:34,075
That's better than he deserves.

671
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:36,415
But it'll do.

672
00:39:49,645 --> 00:39:50,845
I wanted to...

673
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:55,235
I wanted to...

674
00:39:58,615 --> 00:39:59,615
Don't.

675
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:04,151
It's okay.
We're no good at this.

676
00:40:15,265 --> 00:40:18,200
- Diego, I thought you forgot.
- <i>Listen, Michael.</i>

677
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:20,375
<i>What were you doing
working with Tom Strickler?</i>

678
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,605
It's complicated.

679
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,380
You know the people he was in bed with,
the kind of stuff he was involved in?

680
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:28,190
- Diego, calm down.
- Strickler's dead, shot to death!

681
00:40:28,315 --> 00:40:31,815
Now someone's in town,
cleaning up the mess he left behind!

682
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:34,245
I don't know who I can trust,

683
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,720
even at the Agency!

684
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:37,851
- Wait. Who's in town?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

685
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:40,340
But I'm being followed, Michael.

686
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:43,195
Someone's coming for me,
and they're coming for you, too.

687
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,861
We're not safe.
We need to meet now.

688
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:51,305
- Where are you?
- 3732 Brighton Avenue.

689
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:53,875
- Apartment 412.
- I'll be right there.

690
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:01,453
<i>We got a 1-8-7 down here.</i>

691
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:04,230
<i>We need to set up a perimeter
and search the area for suspects.</i>

692
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:07,280
<i>When you realize
that an operation is compromised,</i>

693
00:41:07,405 --> 00:41:10,430
<i>that your enemies are on the move,
you're on a clock.</i>

694
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:13,929
<i>You have to move as fast as you can
to try to contain the damage,</i>

695
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,620
<i>and harden your defenses
before it's too late.</i>

696
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:18,517
<i>Sometimes you make it in time...</i>

697
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,825
<i>and sometimes you don't.</i>

698
00:41:25,355 --> 00:41:27,355
<i>When you work in intelligence,</i>

699
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:30,278
<i>the worst feeling in the world
is knowing nothing,</i>

700
00:41:30,975 --> 00:41:34,475
<i>being caught up in something
you don't begin to understand.</i>

701
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:39,675
<i>Because it's not the enemy you see
that gets you,</i>

702
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,450
<i>it's the one you don't.</i>
