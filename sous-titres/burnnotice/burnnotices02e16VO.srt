1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:01,917
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,104
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,214
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:09,802
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing.</i>

5
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,219
<i>No cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,674
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:16,307
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:19,268
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,647
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:25,608
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:28,486
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI.</i>

12
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,863
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:33,282
- <i>Family, too...</i>
- Hey, is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,493
- <i>If you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:38,037
<i>Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,</i>

16
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:41,575
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:43,834
<i>Previously on</i> Burn Notice...

18
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,478
Give us the man
who killed our operatives,

19
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,792
and you and I can have
a little chat about your future.

20
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,424
You didn't tell her it was Victor?

21
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,844
- The man has tried to kill you twice.
- He's the one enemy I know Carla has.

22
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,013
I'd like to talk to him
before I turn him in.

23
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:59,392
You tell Carla someone else went after
her operatives, and we're friends.

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,186
I have questions, and I have
a feeling you can answer them.

25
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:05,523
- Well, that's not on the menu.
- I'm asking for answers.

26
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:26,419
<i>The most dangerous time in any operation
is just as everything's coming together.</i>

27
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:29,338
<i>You never know whether
you're about to get a pat on the back</i>

28
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,173
<i>or a bullet to the back of the head.</i>

29
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:44,353
<i>Of course, there's not much you can do
but act like everything's fine.</i>

30
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:46,792
Hello, Michael.

31
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,762
Care for a chocolate-covered
pomegranate seed? Khava tea?

32
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:52,272
You drove all the way out here
to offer me a snack?

33
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:55,156
- I'm touched.
- It's a taste of your former life.

34
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:59,129
Good old days before the burn notice,
when Michael Westen was just a...

35
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:02,855
carefree spy
in the deserts of Afghanistan.

36
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:09,170
You know, I was like you once, Michael.
Lived for the job.

37
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:11,964
Eventually, I discovered
the job doesn't love you back.

38
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,682
- You got burned?
- Yes.

39
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:16,315
I was angry at first.

40
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,387
Then I found I didn't miss it.

41
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,432
You might find
the same thing, Michael.

42
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:23,893
And if I want my life back?

43
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,435
Well...

44
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,271
That's why I'm here.

45
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,983
Anything's possible
if you do your job.

46
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,778
- I'm working on it. You know me.
- This is serious, Michael.

47
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,112
Management's not happy.

48
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,823
They'll be in town shortly
to make sure everything's resolved.

49
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:40,702
These are not people
to be trifled with, believe me.

50
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,743
I'll do my best.

51
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,792
Remember, there are worse things
than being blacklisted.

52
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,831
Oh, I know.

53
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:47,905
I could be this guy.

54
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,607
- Hey. You sure you weren't followed?
- Sure as I can be.

55
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,232
Unless she's got an invisible
helicopter, I think we're fine.

56
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:16,615
I wouldn't put it past her.

57
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,902
She needs to back off
if I'm gonna solve her problem.

58
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:22,092
From what I can tell, she really
needs me to solve the problem.

59
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:24,092
Let's see how our guest is doing.

60
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:25,663
Last I checked, he was sleeping.

61
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:29,545
It's kind of tough to sleep
when you're cable-tied to a chair.

62
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:33,152
- How long's he been in there alone?
- A few hours.

63
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:34,672
You said not to open the door.

64
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,625
- What's in that?
- Oh, beanbag rounds.

65
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:40,427
At this range,
it'll break a few ribs.

66
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:48,644
Nice place.

67
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:51,735
I stayed in a bed and breakfast
like this once.

68
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,645
Glad you like it.

69
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:56,155
<i>When you're dealing
with a trained operative,</i>

70
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:58,654
<i>you have to assume
they're as good as you are.</i>

71
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:01,615
<i>If you'd have cut through
your restraints given a few hours alone,</i>

72
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,933
<i>chances are he had the same idea.</i>

73
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,378
That's enough rough-housing, boys.

74
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:26,695
It's always fun
until someone gets hurt.

75
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,100
Season 2, Episode 16:
Lesser Evil.

76
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,436
Synchro VO: S@lomon

77
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,105
<i>www.subbers-in-black.com</i>

78
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,774
So, now we're cozy.
What shall we talk about?

79
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,569
Why don't we start with
why you tried to blow me up?

80
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,737
You make it sound so personal.

81
00:04:41,535 --> 00:04:44,241
I was removing operatives from
the field. You were cogs in a machine.

82
00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:46,402
I just hit that machine
with a baseball bat.

83
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:48,585
Why'd you hit the machine, then?

84
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:52,166
You know, not to be rude, but
I'd just as soon skip to the end here.

85
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:53,965
- The end?
- If there's one thing

86
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:56,703
everyone knows about Michael Westen,
it's that he wants his job back.

87
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,570
And here I sit,
your shot at getting that.

88
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:01,882
It doesn't take an intelligence analyst
to see how this ends.

89
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:02,718
So,

90
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,145
wake me when Carla gets here,

91
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,641
or shoot me now
and save everyone some time.

92
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,075
You went after Carla's organization.
Why?

93
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,305
Why does it matter?

94
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:19,942
Nothing I say will change the fact
that I'm your ticket out.

95
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:23,364
Why is your curiosity
more important than my nap?

96
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,907
You're out of moves here.

97
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:28,118
Your only shot now is to trust me.

98
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:30,285
Trust you.

99
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,065
Just like that.

100
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,867
You have nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

101
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:45,585
I was CIA.

102
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:48,482
My family was stationed with me
in Mexico City.

103
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:49,974
An op went bad, and...

104
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,635
I lost my wife and son.

105
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,397
The burn notice went out the same day.
I was...

106
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,324
out on my ass, my family was dead,

107
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,275
not even enough money
for a bus ticket home.

108
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:02,277
And then you got a call from Carla.

109
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,245
Well, I was more enthusiastic
about the opportunity than you were.

110
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:09,762
It was a way back in,
a way to get payback.

111
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,695
Well, it took me some time,

112
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,305
but I found what I was looking for.

113
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:23,022
And the punch line,
the really, really funny part is,

114
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:24,255
it was Carla.

115
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:30,145
She had my family killed
as part of my recruitment.

116
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,435
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:35,686
By that time, I was...

118
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,932
I was inside.
I was an effective operative.

119
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:42,265
And I figured, "Hey, while I'm here,
why not gut the entire organization"?

120
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,845
Well, I took my shot.

121
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,405
And here we are.

122
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:54,204
Carla doesn't know you're here.

123
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,082
If you're telling the truth,

124
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,460
maybe we can work on this together.

125
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:07,912
I've got a boat docked out
at the end of Randall Key.

126
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,645
The cabin is booby-trapped
with a claymore.

127
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,875
Check under the bed.

128
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:18,187
If you want proof,
that's the best I can do.

129
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,702
You're trusting him?

130
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:38,882
How many times does someone have to try
to kill you before he crossed the line?

131
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,362
We came to an understanding.

132
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,295
You know, when I was a kid,

133
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:44,252
I adopted a dog that I found.

134
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:46,673
He had these big eyes,
and I used to rub his belly,

135
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,792
and I thought we had
something special.

136
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,664
Right up until he bit a chunk out of me.
I'll show you the scar if you'd like.

137
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:52,952
I'll be careful, Sam.

138
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:54,535
I'm coming with you.

139
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:58,582
Give him some air.
See what else you can get out of him.

140
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:00,615
Rub his belly if you need to.

141
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:49,085
Nice work.

142
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:53,505
Victor should probably teach
a class or something.

143
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:57,505
Clear.

144
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:00,164
He said to check under the bed.

145
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,975
Spam and Cap'n Crunch.

146
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,252
No wonder he's so erratic.

147
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:07,571
<i>Spies are supposed to travel light</i>

148
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,412
<i>with nothing
that could identify them.</i>

149
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:12,192
<i>Some do, but most find
that staying sane</i>

150
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:14,980
<i>requires staying connected
to something that reminds them</i>

151
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,861
<i>why they do what they do.</i>

152
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:20,732
<i>Pictures are particularly
dangerous to carry,</i>

153
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:23,437
<i>unless the people in them
are already dead.</i>

154
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:26,273
Michael, his little boy was only 4.

155
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:31,472
Who knew you could feel this bad
for a psychopath on the edge of sanity?

156
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:34,012
People don't get there
on their own, Fi.

157
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,325
Being under Carla's thumb,
it's a strain.

158
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:40,287
- Well, you've done all right.
- I never lost everyone I cared about.

159
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:47,922
You and I need to have
a little chat,

160
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,332
'cause you've got a long way to go
before I believe all this business.

161
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:53,008
Is this an interrogation?

162
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,795
No. That's such an ugly word.

163
00:09:56,755 --> 00:10:00,474
I just want you to show me
that you are who you say you are.

164
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,017
Establish your identity.

165
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,835
That's, what, number five
in the military interrogation manual?

166
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:09,952
Look, we don't have to play
any games here.

167
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:14,238
- Fact is, we're both on the same side.
- "Fear down". Approach 14, right?

168
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:17,712
Yeah. I believe it is number 14.
So how about this?

169
00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:19,832
Technique number one,
the direct approach.

170
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:22,462
My best friend Mike is out there
putting his butt on the line for you,

171
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:23,705
so I want some answers.

172
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:27,526
Now, the folks that you work for,
is this a government agency,

173
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:30,159
a foreign power?
What are we up against?

174
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,292
Well, they never gave me a peek
at the employee handbook.

175
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,134
All I know is they run black ops.

176
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,190
Could be multinational.
Could be work for hire.

177
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,847
They break jobs into pieces
so no one gets the big picture.

178
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,058
Well, that's not a good sign.
Why Miami?

179
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,952
They're in cities all over.

180
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,499
Although from what I can tell,

181
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,605
they may have to shut down
in Miami for a while.

182
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,952
- Well, I don't like the sound of that.
- You shouldn't.

183
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:55,685
If Michael doesn't hand me over,
Carla's gonna cut her losses,

184
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,155
starting with Michael's family.

185
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:01,868
She's gonna be a busy girl.

186
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:15,215
- What's wrong?
- I've talked to our unstable friend.

187
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,771
This doesn't sound good, Mike.

188
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:19,553
The big boys are coming into town,
and if we don't hand him over...

189
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,721
- We're not handing anyone over.
- I'm just saying,

190
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:23,954
we could have a war on our hands.

191
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,601
- Let me cancel my meeting.
- No, don't.

192
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:29,271
We need to keep everything
looking like business as usual.

193
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,064
Sam, can you pick up my mom?

194
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,401
Take her up to Orlando.
Make it look like a day trip.

195
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,870
I don't want her in town
if anything starts happening.

196
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:36,653
On it.

197
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,656
- You sure you don't want me to...
- Fi, go. I'll be all right.

198
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,090
<i>Stretch those arms out.
Get up. That's it.</i>

199
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,110
<i>Stretch way out, way out.
More.</i>

200
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:54,473
<i>What a great exercise it is
for your shoulders and your arms,</i>

201
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:57,142
<i>to help you when you wear
those sleeveless dresses,</i>

202
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,326
<i>you gals, to really help you look
like you should look.</i>

203
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,409
<i>And you guys out there, I want you
to look like a man's supposed to look.</i>

204
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:06,762
Sam!

205
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,285
You scared me.

206
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,584
Sorry. Listen, Madeline,

207
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,397
I hate to do this to you again,
but we got a situation.

208
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,821
- Why, what's wrong? Is Michael okay?
- He's fine. But is your stuff handy?

209
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,987
'cause it's time for
an emergency trip to Disneyworld.

210
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,355
Disneyworld?

211
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,824
Why in god's name would I want
to go to Disneyworld?

212
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:26,046
Because it's a magical kingdom with
lots of witnesses and great security.

213
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:28,062
So if you could just
get your bag, we'll go.

214
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:30,645
No. I'm not running
for Michael anymore!

215
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,642
And I think it's time

216
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:35,921
that all of you stopped treating me
like a baby and told me what's going on.

217
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:39,883
- That's a long story.
- Wonderful. I love stories.

218
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:43,002
But, see, it's the kind of story that's
best told on the way up to Orlando.

219
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,702
Do you know they have
a hotel up there

220
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:46,723
where the giraffes come
right up to your balcony?

221
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,809
Well, as much as I love giraffes...

222
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,402
I'm not uprooting my life again
to run from something...

223
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:56,435
I don't even know what it's about, Sam!
So I'm not going anywhere...

224
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,075
Till I get some answers.

225
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,489
Well, it's... it's complicated.

226
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,450
Well, the sooner you explain,

227
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:08,036
the sooner we'll be off
to Cinderella's castle.

228
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,355
Victor, I sympathize
with your situation.

229
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,528
But it's a little hard
to trust someone

230
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:18,380
when they've tried to kill you
four times.

231
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:20,385
Four? That seems high.

232
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:22,884
Oh, you're counting earlier
with the chair.

233
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,085
Listen, sport, relax.

234
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:29,766
This will all be over shortly
for you and for me.

235
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,395
Well, you told Carla to back off
so you could find me, yes?

236
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:35,340
Of course you did.

237
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:37,123
They'll run surveillance,
and check in.

238
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,276
- What time is it? 10:30 or so?
- About that.

239
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,390
I've been off long enough
to get them suspicious.

240
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:43,532
They'll have gotten
the go-ahead to hunt you,

241
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,794
set up a perimeter around
your last known location.

242
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:48,722
- If there's a major road around here...
- They'll be waiting at it.

243
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,537
- Wonderful!
- Look at it this way.

244
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,124
When Carla finds out you hid me,
all your questions will be resolved...

245
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:57,105
With a bullet to the head
for both of us.

246
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,907
You're gonna kill me.

247
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,185
Well, if you're gonna step to the bell,
you might as well ring it, huh?

248
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:09,476
Let's get out of here.

249
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,492
Wait, wait, you're gonna help me?

250
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:17,189
I get to be one of
Michael Westen's clients,

251
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,848
one of the desperate people

252
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:21,526
to whom you lend your razor-sharp mind
and fists of fury?

253
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:22,875
Lucky you.

254
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,652
Oh, looks like they were closer
than I thought.

255
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:36,291
Probably just waiting to see
our pretty faces before they moved in.

256
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,259
You drive.

257
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:41,546
<i>You don't last long as a spy
if you don't trust anyone.</i>

258
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,229
<i>If you're looking over your shoulder
to see who's coming after you,</i>

259
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:45,967
<i>you can't see where you're going.</i>

260
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:48,553
<i>Sometimes you just have
to trust your gut.</i>

261
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,975
These guys are pretty good. Looks like
they pulled out all the stops for us.

262
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,017
I'm flattered.

263
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,250
<i>In a firefight on the road,
you've got a few options.</i>

264
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:42,383
<i>Without something high-caliber,
you're not gonna be able</i>

265
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:45,026
<i>to penetrate the radiator
or the firewall behind it.</i>

266
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,894
<i>That leaves two options.</i>

267
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,122
<i>The windshield</i>

268
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:51,205
<i>or ricocheting bullets off the ground
up through the undercarriage,</i>

269
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:54,035
<i>which is one of the least
reinforced parts of the car.</i>

270
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,914
<i>For sheer panic, it's hard to beat
bullets coming up from the floorboards.</i>

271
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,435
Is that brake fluid?

272
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,061
Polyethylene glycol's not gonna
burn enough to do anything.

273
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:25,942
It will when it's mixed with
chlorine dioxide and some other stuff.

274
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,486
Someone's been
to the chemical store, I see.

275
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,549
I like you.
Have I ever told you that?

276
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:59,351
Here comes another one.
We got to get out of here.

277
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,692
We're gonna need to find
a parking garage.

278
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,191
We need a new ride.

279
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:13,495
Carla, not a good time!

280
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:15,659
- You think you're clever.
- <i>Clever?</i>

281
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,987
Well, I tested well in school,
but they say that doesn't mean...

282
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,698
You're trying to save the man
who tried to kill you.

283
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,090
Victor and I have known each other
for a long time.

284
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,139
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

285
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:27,921
You know, I know
it's been a short time,

286
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,201
but sometimes, you meet someone,
and you get that feeling.

287
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:31,284
Enough.

288
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,802
It's time you learned actions
have consequences.

289
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,971
Funny, I was thinking it was time
for you to learn the same thing.

290
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,659
She give you the "Actions
have consequences" speech?

291
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,187
As someone who's doled out a lot
of those consequences over the years,

292
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,231
she'll go after your family.

293
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,608
That'll be harder than she thinks.

294
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,324
Here. There.

295
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:19,180
How about this? Two guys, Miami,
cute convertible. Perfect camouflage.

296
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,392
Yeah, I'm looking for something
with a little more horsepower.

297
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:28,365
Here comes a second car.
This should get interesting.

298
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,472
Madeline, if I knew more,
I would tell you.

299
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:33,288
So you don't know
who these people are?

300
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:35,391
I mean, you have names.
Can't you just look them up?

301
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:36,674
That's not how it works.

302
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:38,842
If somebody's doing
something off the books,

303
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:42,173
they don't hand out decoder rings
and build a mountain fortress.

304
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:44,372
So it's Carla and Victor.

305
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:47,000
And Michael's in trouble with them.

306
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:50,516
- What does it have to do with me?
- It's all a way to get to Mike.

307
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,964
You're somebody he cares about.
It's leverage.

308
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,549
Please, I'm not leverage.

309
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,017
You want a beer?

310
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,262
No, Madeline!
I don't want a beer.

311
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:04,309
This is serious.

312
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,186
That's what I'm trying to say.

313
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:09,315
I'll get my stuff.

314
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,361
Crap.

315
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:28,666
Change of plans.

316
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,877
- Where's your shotgun?
- In the back.

317
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,086
Go get it, now.

318
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:44,815
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get down.

319
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,575
I guess this means
we're not going to Disneyworld.

320
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,752
They're not taking any chances
with the two bad boys in here.

321
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,755
They're doing it right, setting up
a perimeter and waiting for backup.

322
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:17,924
Well, we should get
some backup of our own.

323
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,718
Careful with that phone.
Chances are, it's a party line now.

324
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:26,675
Pleasure doing business with you.
Say hi to Paco.

325
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,462
Michael, you are not gonna believe
the deal I got today.

326
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:33,939
I am better at buying guns
than I am at buying shoes,

327
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,744
and I'm really good at buying shoes.

328
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:36,827
What?

329
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:41,239
Remember that drive past the factory
where we first met?

330
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:45,827
You think we could do something similar
where we picnicked last month?

331
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,038
- You'll be making this drive soon?
- As fast as I can manage.

332
00:20:59,515 --> 00:21:01,462
They're setting up a spike strip.

333
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:03,219
Oh, this is getting
better and better.

334
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:11,436
- I'm not getting Michael or Fiona.
- They probably ditched the phones.

335
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:14,497
- Should I call the police?
- No. That'll make it too easy for them.

336
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,962
Cops take us to the station,

337
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:18,245
they know where we are,
and they know that we are unarmed.

338
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:20,328
So what do we do?
Just sit here and wait?

339
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,442
No, they're gonna get more guys.

340
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,450
We got to create a distraction,
get out of here.

341
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,119
But they're all over my car,
and there's no way to get your car out.

342
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:29,829
We could borrow Mrs. Reynolds' car.

343
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:32,962
She lives over the back fence,
and I have the key in case of emergency.

344
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:35,001
Back fence, huh?
That could work.

345
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,421
Madeline, think you could find
some Christmas lights?

346
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,279
<i>When you're outmanned and outgunned,</i>

347
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:47,388
<i>the key is to appear bigger
and stronger than you are.</i>

348
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,956
<i>Take your enemy's expectations
and turn them against him.</i>

349
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,123
<i>To make a good-sized fireball
without a lot of ordnance,</i>

350
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:57,852
<i>you need a powder with
a high surface-area-to-mass ratio.</i>

351
00:21:58,175 --> 00:22:01,575
<i>Non-dairy creamer mixed
with gunpowder works nicely.</i>

352
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,621
I could put two or three of them down,
get one of their guns on the way out.

353
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,104
We're trying to keep the body count
a little bit lower than that.

354
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:22,799
This isn't about getting out of here.
We might have a shot right now.

355
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,367
I've worked with Carla for a long time.
I've put together...

356
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,747
insurance policy in case
she ever found out what I was up to.

357
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,807
- Insurance?
- She likes ops for personal errands.

358
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:33,935
Making extra cash, payback,
that kind of thing.

359
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:37,313
Now, I've got a file at a safe house.
Now, we get that...

360
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,148
We can blackmail our way to safety.

361
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,912
It's a distant second to dousing her
in kerosene and lighting a match,

362
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:44,988
but under the circumstances, it'll have
to do. Now, are we ready to use this?

363
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:47,192
I think we can get
further with this.

364
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:48,275
Let's go.

365
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:55,785
<i>A security perimeter is like
a defensive line in football.</i>

366
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,975
<i>You've got a couple of options.</i>

367
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,216
<i>You got to punch through the line
with brute force...</i>

368
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,722
<i>Or you can soften it up
with a little misdirection.</i>

369
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:18,938
Here they come.

370
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,315
Look out!

371
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,192
Get out of the way!

372
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,171
I'm liking your plan less and less.

373
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,757
Everything's fine, as long as
we keep them behind us.

374
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,768
- Fine?
- Relatively fine.

375
00:24:11,505 --> 00:24:12,533
Come on, Michael.

376
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:49,825
Where did you meet her?

377
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:58,735
Blackmail.

378
00:24:59,055 --> 00:25:00,182
That's the idea?

379
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,865
We're doing all this so we can throw
some paperwork at Carla?

380
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,875
It's the smart play here.
We're outgunned.

381
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,422
We'll get bigger guns.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

382
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:11,155
I saw what she did
to you and your family.

383
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:14,872
If the file is so great,
then why didn't you use it before?

384
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:16,755
This isn't just about her.

385
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,975
I want the guys who call the shots.

386
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:22,285
The file was just in case,
enough to force her to back off.

387
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:25,982
If it was about putting a bullet in her,
it would have been over a long time ago.

388
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:29,068
Still, putting a bullet in Carla
sounds awfully good.

389
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,946
If it comes to that,
you'll have to get in line.

390
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:33,823
Yeah, about that file?

391
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:36,185
Your safe house, not so safe.

392
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:40,555
She's good.

393
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:44,552
I was three deep with fake safe houses
trying to keep this place from her.

394
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:46,377
Sometimes I wish she'd get a hobby.

395
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,105
Which room is it in?

396
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:50,131
It's not in a room.
It's on the utility pole.

397
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,649
<i>A fake utility box
isn't a bad hiding place.</i>

398
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,939
<i>People don't touch things
labeled "High Voltage".</i>

399
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,706
<i>Repair crews leave them alone, too.</i>

400
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:00,683
<i>They're not real,
so they never need servicing.</i>

401
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:03,352
Too bad Carla's surveillance
is parked right in front of it.

402
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:07,899
Two cars, four guys.
Think we can handle it.

403
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:10,552
We each shoot one
and Rochambeau for the other.

404
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,930
Yeah, we don't know
it's Carla's guys.

405
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:15,656
It could be ATF, FBI,
working off of bad intel.

406
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:18,951
- They could be completely innocent.
- Please. No one's completely innocent.

407
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,205
Is that what you told yourself
when you tried to kill me?

408
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:23,655
Let's go.

409
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:33,561
<i>Thanks for calling Onstar.</i>

410
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:36,572
Yes, I need directions
to the closest hardware store.

411
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:40,355
I'd like to avoid major intersections
and government buildings.

412
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,396
<i>I found a hardware store
on Siebert Avenue.</i>

413
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,602
- <i>Would you like me to direct you?</i>
- Yes, please.

414
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,035
The party's starting.

415
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:54,672
You ready?

416
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:56,489
- Does it matter?
- Not really.

417
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:33,765
Do you think they saw us?

418
00:27:34,055 --> 00:27:37,488
No, they're busy with the team
out front. We're probably good to go.

419
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:42,702
If I knew that baby was here, I'd have
gotten us out of there a lot faster.

420
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:48,812
- Turn this way?
- Right down here.

421
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:52,044
- Why? It's shortcut where we're going?
- Telling you, I think the idea sucks.

422
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:54,338
- Just pull over in here.
- What, where? Right here?

423
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:59,005
- Why are we pulling over here?
- Don't ask questions. Do it, please.

424
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:04,348
- You saw what happened back there.
- Yeah, I did.

425
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,518
You think the best use of your time
is a three-hour drive to Orlando?

426
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,868
- Yeah. Do you have a better idea?
- Yeah, I do.

427
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:12,565
Okay, fine.
Well, let's hear your plan.

428
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:16,694
I take care of myself,
and you go save my son!

429
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,126
They sent men to me with guns, Sam.

430
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:21,309
God knows what they sent to him.

431
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:25,119
Listen, the one thing a woman my age
can do in Miami is blend in.

432
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:28,297
If they can pick me out of 10,000
other 60-something women

433
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,042
with bleached-blond hair,
I guess I'm done for, huh?

434
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:35,379
Can you find him?

435
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:40,066
Maybe. We got a few rally points
around Miami we use for emergencies.

436
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:41,761
But come on, Madeline. Are you sure?

437
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:45,389
He needs you more than I do, Sam.
Just go, please.

438
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:50,311
Bye, Sam.

439
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:55,555
Mike's gonna kill me.

440
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:04,265
<i>One of the most common cover IDs
for a spy is service personnel.</i>

441
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:07,330
<i>Of course, anyone
who works in intelligence</i>

442
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,413
<i>knows to check service personnel.</i>

443
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:11,874
<i>So a quick phone call
to the gas company,</i>

444
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,909
<i>and you've created
the perfect distraction.</i>

445
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:24,220
<i>The active ingredient in pepper spray
is the chemical capsaicin.</i>

446
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:27,014
<i>Mix the birdseed
with some alcohol and oil,</i>

447
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,725
<i>pressurize it
in a paint sprayer with CO2,</i>

448
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,519
<i>and you have
a homemade pepper grenade.</i>

449
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:39,988
<i>A few nails in the right places
on a car door blocks the lever bar,</i>

450
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:42,321
<i>making it impossible to open,</i>

451
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,815
<i>leaving you free to do pretty much
whatever you want.</i>

452
00:29:58,105 --> 00:29:59,835
I see why Carla
wouldn't want this out.

453
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:02,736
She'd send a black-ops team
to deal with a parking ticket.

454
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:03,690
Pretty much.

455
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:05,626
The higher-ups stay away
from most operations.

456
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:08,188
They have two rules, don't screw up,
and don't get caught.

457
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:10,599
They don't get involved
unless things go very, very wrong.

458
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,952
Well, I'd say
this situation qualifies.

459
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:16,397
Carla has a lot of enemies from her
spook days, and she's made more since.

460
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:19,314
And then she made the mistake
of vouching for you, big guy.

461
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:22,440
Those files should be more than enough
to earn her a retirement bullet.

462
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:25,973
Carla's entire work history.
This is pretty damning stuff.

463
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:28,796
- You think you can play this card?
- When we get back to my boat,

464
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:31,502
I've got the codes and comm lines
to go above her head.

465
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:35,582
If she knows I can get to them
with this, then she'll back off. Fast.

466
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:37,460
Then we get out of town,
maybe to Cuba.

467
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:38,628
Fabulous.

468
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:42,673
Great music,
lots of sexy unemployed men.

469
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,941
Fi, can I talk to you for a sec?

470
00:30:48,255 --> 00:30:49,582
I'm not invited to Cuba.

471
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,691
They're gonna follow us
with everything they have.

472
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:55,024
I need you to find Sam
and help him protect my family.

473
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,189
Can't Sam do it on his own?

474
00:30:58,485 --> 00:31:01,734
I know you don't like to hear this,
but you and Sam are a good team.

475
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,031
And do you think I...

476
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:08,335
The car.

477
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:11,932
I expect you to bring it back
clean with a full tank.

478
00:31:12,015 --> 00:31:13,915
- <i>Capisce</i>?
- I can do that.

479
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,176
It's not goodbye.
It's just... in case.

480
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:33,807
And that is to remind you
to be careful.

481
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:02,755
Looks like no one's around.

482
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,565
We'll scout the perimeter.
If it's clear, we'll go in.

483
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,752
All this time, you never found out
who burned you?

484
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:11,635
Who cares? Name in a file.

485
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:13,802
Behind that, another name.

486
00:32:13,885 --> 00:32:16,252
You know how it starts.
Someone runs an operation off the books.

487
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:17,984
It's supposed to be
a one-time thing,

488
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:20,379
but when it's over,
there's power to be had.

489
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:22,312
Takes on a life of its own.

490
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,326
It's the organization, not some guy.

491
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:27,975
Why me?

492
00:32:28,475 --> 00:32:31,425
Don't tell me my name
was picked out of some hat.

493
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:37,065
It was no secret
you were good at your job.

494
00:32:38,815 --> 00:32:41,265
The machine wanted you,
so it took you.

495
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,435
Now you're part of it.

496
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,945
And I'm part of it.

497
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:48,591
But that's what we're trying
to destroy here, sport.

498
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,375
There you are.

499
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:01,816
I haven't been able to get
anybody on the phone for ages.

500
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,752
- Where's Mikey? Is he here?
- No.

501
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:06,108
He decided to go on a trip
to Cuba with Victor.

502
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:08,652
They're going after Carla
with documents.

503
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:12,781
- What are we supposed to do?
- I promised him I'd protect the family.

504
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,325
Well, I promised Madeline
I'd help protect Mike.

505
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:18,405
So I guess the question is...

506
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:20,475
Which promise do we keep?

507
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,475
Looks like we're all clear.

508
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,375
We have enough fuel
to make it to the island,

509
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:53,222
as long as we don't have to do
too much detouring on the way.

510
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:55,705
You start the engines,
I'll cast off.

511
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:18,586
Carla?

512
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:22,132
Bad day for a cruise, Michael.
A very, very bad day.

513
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,190
You think so?

514
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:25,437
And here I was
hoping you came to see us off.

515
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:28,293
I took the precaution of having
the local marinas searched

516
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,292
when I lost contact with Victor.

517
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,601
<i>Seemed like a long shot.</i>

518
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,717
<i>Hated to think
my two favorite operatives</i>

519
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,906
<i>might be making
nasty little plans together.</i>

520
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,424
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- <i>Well, not to spoil the fun,</i>

521
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:41,662
but the boat's wired with C-4.

522
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:43,902
Can't have you leaving
before we have a chat.

523
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:46,585
Great. Come on board. Let's talk.

524
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:48,877
I'm fine here, thanks.

525
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:54,884
Management's on the way.

526
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,386
<i>They're gonna want to know
what happened here.</i>

527
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:00,097
Any story I tell them has to begin
with Victor's dead body.

528
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:03,225
Afraid of what he might share
about your history together?

529
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:04,445
Not important.

530
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:07,004
What's important is that
this story needs a hero.

531
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,387
It could be you.

532
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:11,335
Kill him or send him out,
and I'll do it.

533
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:16,182
If you leave me no alternative,
there's always the C-4.

534
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:18,631
You want to explain
blowing up your entire team?

535
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:20,568
Doesn't speak well
for your management skills.

536
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:24,632
I'd have to explain two dead bodies.
You'd have to be one of them.

537
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:26,165
Just end this, Michael!

538
00:35:26,395 --> 00:35:27,875
He's a killer. You know that.

539
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,253
- He's what you made him.
- <i>Time is up, Michael!</i>

540
00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:34,185
Finish it off,
or I will finish it for you!

541
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:43,426
Finally.

542
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:46,727
I know you want to savor the moment,
but we got to get out of here.

543
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:01,033
Looks like whoever's in that chopper
brought some backup.

544
00:36:02,485 --> 00:36:04,285
<i>Standing by for clearance.</i>

545
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,163
<i>Secure your perimeter. Stand by.</i>

546
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:08,575
Move it.

547
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:11,304
<i>They're heading into the trees.</i>

548
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,115
<i>Clear for landing.</i>

549
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,575
We got to talk, big guy.

550
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:37,655
You have to get out there

551
00:36:38,325 --> 00:36:40,904
and get on top of this
before her body cools.

552
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:45,285
Take the file. Tell them
when you found me, I turned on Carla.

553
00:36:46,005 --> 00:36:49,373
You lured her here, had your team
take her out, and then killed me.

554
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,395
- Killed you?
- It's over.

555
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:55,671
The only question is...

556
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:58,695
Whether you're a traitor
who helped me

557
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:00,717
or the ace operative who shot me.

558
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:06,675
Help me out.

559
00:37:09,785 --> 00:37:11,542
I'm dead one way or the other.

560
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:14,439
They get me alive,
and they're gonna take me apart.

561
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,024
You know it has to be like this.

562
00:37:25,055 --> 00:37:27,355
It was good playing with you, sport.

563
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,015
Now you get out.

564
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:33,955
Get out while you can.

565
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:18,525
<i>He's coming out.</i>

566
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:20,545
Drop it!

567
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,241
Hey, there!
Took you guys long enough.

568
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:25,825
Put down the gun.

569
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:32,142
Want to get those out of my face?
Could have used you guys earlier.

570
00:38:34,595 --> 00:38:36,495
No, this is for the big guy.

571
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:16,685
Good luck, Mike.

572
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:19,893
<i>In intelligence work,
your most important tool,</i>

573
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:23,702
<i>more important than any combat
technique, any technical skill,</i>

574
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:28,323
<i>is your ability to twist the facts
of a situation to your own advantage.</i>

575
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:32,265
<i>The worse the facts are,
the more you've got to sell it.</i>

576
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:37,135
Two rogue operatives in one day?

577
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:39,660
- Lucky us.
- You're welcome.

578
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:43,845
You know, I think you need to talk
to the folks in human resources.

579
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:47,329
- You have some staff issues.
- I agree completely.

580
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,902
Tell me, Michael, since you know
so much about our problems,

581
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:53,922
what should I do about
our new recruit, Michael Westen?

582
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:58,117
Wonderfully effective,
terrifically resourceful,

583
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,023
truly the best I've ever seen,
but he just doesn't seem happy.

584
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:04,055
Maybe it's the threats
against his family.

585
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,532
Maybe it's the people
trying to kill him.

586
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:11,042
Maybe it's the fact that he had to use
his people to clean up your mess.

587
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,994
- Your operatives...
- Are dead. And you're not.

588
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:17,873
You've created
a job opening, Michael.

589
00:40:18,395 --> 00:40:19,833
And I have to fill it.

590
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:23,125
You want money?
We can do that.

591
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:28,091
- You want to get out of Miami?
- I want you people out of my life!

592
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,609
Out of your life?

593
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:32,987
Tell me, Michael. All your old enemies
from your spy days,

594
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,670
all the people who have scores
to settle with Michael Westen.

595
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,602
Where do you think they've been?

596
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:40,364
Did they just forget about you?

597
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:42,773
Or has someone
been keeping them at bay?

598
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,492
You think you've been
under our thumb?

599
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:49,364
You've been under our protection.
Think about that.

600
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,952
- Yeah, I'll be fine, thanks.
- You really think so?

601
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:53,915
Tell you what.

602
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:56,682
We'll leave you alone if that's
what you want. Your family, too.

603
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:58,265
See how you like it.

604
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:01,075
You want out?

605
00:41:02,995 --> 00:41:04,169
There's the door.

606
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,038
But hear this.

607
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:10,116
You have no idea
what hell will rain down

608
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,219
if we stop watching out for you.

609
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:20,936
I'll take my chances.

610
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:53,572
<i>As a spy working for a government,
you're protected.</i>

611
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:57,462
<i>You may work solo, but you have
agreements with other spy agencies.</i>

612
00:41:57,545 --> 00:42:01,042
<i>Even when you're surrounded
by your enemies, that protects you.</i>

613
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,829
<i>When your entire career
consists of making enemies,</i>

614
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:07,462
<i>there's no greater danger
than being totally cut off, alone.</i>

615
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:19,487
<i>When you find yourself
out in the cold,</i>

616
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,920
<i>all you can do is put your head down
and try to survive.</i>
