<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...

2
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,691
The world will have to
deal with us.

3
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:47,328
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:49,244
Say hello to
the new head of NTAC.

5
00:00:49,355 --> 00:00:50,673
- Meghan Doyle.
- Hi.

6
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:52,719
The news isn't good...
your father's had a relapse,

7
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,732
and I think it's time we start
preparing ourselves for the inevitable.

8
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,158
- <i>Who's Cassie?
- <i>I'm not what you'd call real.

9
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,508
I'm Kyle's ability.

10
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:02,818
A Messiah who rises from the dead,
who passes on a sacred elixir?

11
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:04,780
The healer who lays his hands
upon the sick?

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,561
And don't forget about the Shaman.
The Shaman is you, Kyle.

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,950
Of course, Heather Tobey...

14
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,333
I teach at the school here now.

15
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,408
<i>I finally found a place where
they won't run me out on the rails

16
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:13,605
<i>for being a 4400.

17
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:15,830
Whatever you were given
to take away your abilities,

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,133
it induced a permanent allergy
to promicin.

19
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,976
You will never get
your abilities back, Miss Tyler.

20
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:22,714
Does that mean
I'm getting out of here?

21
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:25,885
- One of the names was April Skouris.
- My sister took the shot?

22
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:27,410
You're going back
to Seattle.

23
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:30,821
I was... thinking about asking
for temporary reinstatement.

24
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,123
She's never coming back here.

25
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:34,073
This is my sister.
I'll do whatever it takes.

26
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:39,042
<i>At first, my story may sound familiar.

27
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:41,744
<i>It's all about a life
lived on the surface,

28
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:44,800
<i>careless youth that believes
it will last forever...

29
00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:49,480
I'll get that.

30
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:58,431
You must have broken
a lot of hearts back then, Miss Parker.

31
00:01:58,564 --> 00:01:59,664
St. Tropez.

32
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:02,184
August, 1955.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,184
The owner of that yacht
proposed to me, you know.

34
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,159
I turned him down.

35
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,925
You turned them all down.

36
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,123
Are you ready
for your morphine shot?

37
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,057
Your dinner's in the fridge,

38
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,210
and I prepared
another dose of morphine

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,366
if the pain in your hands
gets bad again.

40
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:27,898
Mom?

41
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:30,639
You said we'd be here for 15 minutes.
I'm late for my shift.

42
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,441
I'll be done in a minute, Lucas.

43
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,585
You wanted me to take this job,
so if they fire me, it's on you.

44
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,085
Can I get you anything else?

45
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:42,923
- Would you mind?
- Of course not.

46
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:53,622
<i>In the end, all I was left with
were frivolous memories

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,486
<i>and no one to share them with.

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,353
There you go.

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,536
So beautiful.

50
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:04,639
<i>Life had become nothing
but a tedious string of pointless days.

51
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:08,689
<i>Until I decided
to do something about it.

52
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,761
<i>I took that shot...

53
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:12,180
<i>Promicin.

54
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,189
<i>And it changed everything.

55
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,680
<i>My soul, my consciousness,

56
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,392
<i>whatever you'd like to call it,

57
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:19,906
<i>can leave my body.

58
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:21,856
<i>I can leave my body,

59
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:24,381
<i>and I can be young again.

60
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:27,215
<i>You can't see me, or hear me,

61
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:28,795
<i>but I'm there.

62
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:32,078
<i>In the blink of an eye,
I can go wherever I want,

63
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,740
<i>see anything, or anybody,

64
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,761
<i>like a young woman about to realize
how gifted she really is.

65
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:43,375
There you are.
Vanessa, you've got to get out there.

66
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,452
Everyone wants to
meet the artist.

67
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:48,035
What if they hate it?

68
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,485
What if they hate me?

69
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,394
You're kidding, right?

70
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,586
You've already sold
five paintings.

71
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:55,786
You're a hit.

72
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,870
Come on.

73
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,332
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vanessa Martin!

74
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,332
<i>This ability of mine

75
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:08,564
<i>has truly changed my life
for the better.

76
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,293
<i>I feel more free, and...

77
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:14,379
<i>more connected
to the world around me,

78
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,045
<i>to other people.

79
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:20,403
<i>I get to be
a fly on the wall,

80
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:25,456
<i>and I get to see the side of people
that they try to hide from the world.

81
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:29,356
Yes, I am Vanessa's agent.

82
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:34,643
I don't mean to take credit.
I mean, she's the artist, but...

83
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,359
I really helped her
get out there.

84
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:39,496
Maybe I could help you.

85
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:42,540
Would love to see your work,

86
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:43,797
especially the nudes.

87
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,600
<i>I thought my story
was going to end

88
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,076
<i>with me withering
into bitter regret

89
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:49,281
<i>and desperation.

90
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:53,528
<i>Instead, life has handed me
another chance,

91
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:57,181
<i>and I intend
to make the most of it.

92
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,414
<i>Taking the shot has given me
a new will to live,

93
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,730
<i>a gift that allows me
to do and feel things

94
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,441
<i>that no one else on earth
has experienced before.

95
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,196
<i>Yet all you hear is the government
saying how bad promicin is...

96
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:14,996
"How no one should take
the shot.

97
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,920
"If you're reading this,
you should know,

98
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,345
"it hasn't been bad for me.

99
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,314
"For me,
it changed everything.

100
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,270
Maybe it could for you, too."

101
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,344
That's the last entry.

102
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,597
Whoever's writing this
posts the blog anonymously.

103
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:28,706
We take it down,
it goes up someplace else.

104
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,720
I have to admit,
it's well written.

105
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:32,969
If I were on the fence,
and I read this,

106
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,537
I might take the shot.

107
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:37,703
That's exactly why this journal
is making people in DC nervous.

108
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,462
The author doesn't sound
like a radical.

109
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:40,657
She sounds like...

110
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,675
- somebody's aunt.
- And if your aunt's

111
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,900
willing to take a chance on
getting an ability, why shouldn't you?

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,955
Assuming the woman is telling
the truth about what she can do,

113
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,594
I mean, okay, it might be irresponsible
that she's writing about it,

114
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:52,910
but it's not a threat.
Isn't that what we do here?

115
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:55,341
We track down threats?
We're not the thought police.

116
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,082
Taking promicin
is illegal.

117
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:59,179
Not to mention
potentially fatal.

118
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:01,913
If that blog inspires 20 people
to take promicin,

119
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,427
10 of them are going to die.

120
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,346
Don't forget about the ones
who survive.

121
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:07,785
Do you really think they'll all
be lovely people, too?

122
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:10,667
Do you think their abilities
will be as benign as hers?

123
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,987
This woman has to be stopped,

124
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,420
and we can find out exactly
what her intentions were,

125
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,208
just as soon as you find her.

126
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,523
- Bring her in.
- I'll go put on the riot gear.

127
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,799
Get the tear gas.

The public library.

134
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,896
A hotbed
for treasonous activity.

135
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:30,656
Be careful what you say, Tom.

136
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:32,622
How do we know
they're all not in on it?

137
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:35,582
Excuse me.

138
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,049
I'm Tom Baldwin.
This is my partner, Diana Skouris.

139
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,817
- We're from NTAC.
- NTAC?

140
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:41,650
How can I help you?

141
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:43,864
Someone's been uploading
sensitive material to the internet

142
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,095
from an IP address
inside this library.

143
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,319
The branch manager told us
that you were the volunteer docent

144
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:51,764
- in charge of the computers here?
- Well, that's right.

145
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:54,638
The post we're interested in
went up around 11:15 yesterday.

146
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:56,306
Is there some way
we could...

147
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:58,706
track down who was using
the computers at that time?

148
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,557
Do you have a warrant of some kind,
or did you just bring your badge?

149
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,724
No warrant...

150
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:05,074
yet.

151
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,897
We were hoping you'd want to cooperate.
This is part of

152
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:11,656
- an important investigation, Miss...
- Parker.

153
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:15,784
And if I didn't think
it would make trouble for this library,

154
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:17,663
I wouldn't give you
anything at all.

155
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:20,628
Whatever happened to
people's right to privacy?

156
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:23,350
Well, I appreciate
how you feel, Miss Parker,

157
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,283
but we're just trying
to keep people safe.

158
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:26,425
- That's all.
- There...

159
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:29,274

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,890

161
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:32,893
- Happy hunting.

Benjamin Franklin.

At least, you're an educated tyrant.

166
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:49,287
Thanks again.

167
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:58,693
James is doing very well
so far.

168
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,769
If he sticks with the program
for the whole 10 weeks,

169
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:02,727
I'm sure his concentration
will improve.

170
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:04,353

There's not much to tell.

After the 4400 center
shut down,

174
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,220
the only work I could get
was volunteering

175
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,841
at the child development
clinic here.

176
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,521
It's okay.
Fills the days.

177
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:28,068
But if I use my ability, if I draw out
whatever talent these kids have,

178
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,491
I go to jail.

179
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:30,941
It's crazy.

180
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,058
I know.

181
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,916
Jordan put the shot out there,
and now we're all a threat.

182
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,163
Ever since I woke up in the hospital,
I've been thinking,

183
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:39,221
"what are the 4400s
supposed to do now,

184
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:40,454
join the revolution?"

185
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,481
It's that, or we just pretend we're
no different than the rest of the world.

186
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,307
That's just the times we live in,
I guess.

187
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:47,996
No, see, I can't accept that.

188
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:51,235
I've been thinking of starting
my healing foundation again.

189
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:52,886
Maybe even reopening the center.

190
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:55,562
I'd be putting my own money up,
to get things started.

191
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,862
Someone has to show people
that we can...

192
00:09:57,979 --> 00:09:59,012
we can do good.

193
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,606
That we are good.

194
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,735
I can heal people,
and you make kids better.

195
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,956
You give them a talent.
You change their lives.

196
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,692
There's nothing wrong
with any of it.

197
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,298
If you try to become
a public figure again,

198
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:12,137
the government is going to
come down on you.

199
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,539
- Maybe...
- They'll have to.

200
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,093
Maybe.
I was just...

201
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:18,093
I was hoping
I wouldn't be doing it alone.

202
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:32,967
Hi, Kyle.

203
00:10:33,418 --> 00:10:35,129
Sorry,
didn't mean to startle you.

204
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,124
What are you doing here?

205
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:39,854
What are you?

206
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:44,374
Look, I know you're not real,
but are you part of my thoughts?

207
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,202
Just think of me as your guide,

208
00:10:46,635 --> 00:10:49,342
Right now, I need you to go back
to that house on Barclay Court,

209
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:50,961
- to the book.
- Why?

210
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:53,678
I've already read it.
It said collier's supposed to be...

211
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,789
God's messenger.
I'm some kind of Shaman.

212
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,835
- It's nuts.
- You've read the book,

213
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,902
but you don't believe it yet.

214
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:02,087
To do that,
you have to study it.

215
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:04,354
Own it.

216
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:08,275
Let me ask...

217
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:11,737
What if I don't listen to you?
Do you just keep showing up?

218
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,782
Kyle, you took that shot
for a reason.

219
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,475
You wanted something to happen.

220
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,892
Well, I'm what happened.

221
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:19,914
I'm your ability, and I'm telling you,
get that book.

222
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:22,186
It's going to change
everything.

223
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,975
Philip Delacroix?

224
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:33,525
I've been hoping
to speak to you.

225
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,792
Do I know you?

226
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:37,876
No, but we've both taken
an interest in the same person.

227
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:39,687
Vanessa Martin?

228
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:42,771
She's a very talented artist,
don't you think?

229
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:44,764
Of course.

230
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,392
"Delacroix"...

231
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,075
"Delacroix"...

232
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,387
That's a good choice
for an agent's name.

233
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:54,157
It has a nice exotic ring to it.

234
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:55,575
Do you think

235
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,956
that Vanessa might
find it interesting

236
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:01,683
if I tell her that
your real name is Philip Wilson?

237
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:05,475
That you pretended to be
a real estate agent in Arlington, Texas,

238
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:08,689
and talked old couples
out of their retirement savings?

239
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:13,050
That you have an outstanding warrant
for your arrest there,

240
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:14,915
and in Florida as well?

241
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:17,110
I think she'd say you're crazy.

242
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,280
Vanessa trusts me.

243
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,546
Of course, she does,
but that's your game, isn't it?

244
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,970
Now, what were you going to do,

245
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:26,351
convince her to let you
handle her money,

246
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:28,372
and then pull up stakes...

247
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:30,922
when you felt
you'd bled her dry?

248
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:32,451
Who are you?

249
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:35,415
I'm someone who wants to protect
Vanessa's future.

250
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,404
When I was her age,
I was interested in art, too,

251
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,340
but I didn't have
Vanessa's gifts,

252
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,973
so I intend...

253
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,753
to make sure that she has a chance
to make the most of them.

254
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:47,202
To do that,

255
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:48,768
she has to be
free of you.

256
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,782
So you have a choice,
Mr. Wilson.

257
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:55,107
Leave Vanessa alone

258
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,959
and drive away from Seattle...

259
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,460
forever,

260
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:00,179
or stay...

261
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,079
and I'll report you
to the police.

262
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:16,999
We interviewed everyone
from that computer log today.

263
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:20,701
We're waiting for the results
of their promicin tests,

264
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:22,479
but I don't think any of them...

265
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,090
are the blogger.

266
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:28,168
We'll review the journals
in the morning, see what shakes loose.

267
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:36,942
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, fine.

268
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:38,338
Thanks for the update.

269
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:41,188
Actually...

270
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,882
Everything's not okay.

271
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,751
I came home from graduate school
for christmas one year.

272
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,434
I knew right away there was
something wrong with my dad.

273
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,303
He had these...
tremors.

274
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:58,853
Weird tics.

275
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,563
He was diagnosed
with Huntington's disease

276
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:02,752
about a month later.

277
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,071
- I'm sorry. that's awful.
- It was...

278
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,591
more than a decade ago.

279
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:10,655
His doctor just told me
he has pneumonia... again.

280
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:13,123
Who knows if he'll be able
to fight it off?

281
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:14,924
I called DC this morning.

282
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,698
I asked them if...

283
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,894
maybe...

284
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:21,644
if I could convince
your nephew, Shawn, to see him,

285
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,836
maybe, he could heal my father.

286
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,741
Shawn's a generous guy.

287
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,091
I'm sure he'll do it.

288
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:29,848
They said "No".

289
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,874
As the head of NTAC,
I have to set an example.

290
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:35,208
I can't...
benefit personally

291
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,166
from the application
of a 4400 ability.

292
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:40,881
My dad's been dying
for 10 years.

293
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,236
There's no cure
for Huntington's.

294
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:46,286
And then I met your nephew.

295
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,586
If you want me to talk to shawn,
I will.

296
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:51,675
Okay?

297
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:54,838
Thank you,

298
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:56,940
but I don't know
if I can ask you to do that.

299
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,340
I took this post...

300
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:01,823
because it seemed like
the most important thing I could do.

301
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:04,357
I knew
there would be sacrifices,

302
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,098
but I never thought
my bosses would tell me

303
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,535
that if I want to keep my job,
I have to let my father die.

304
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:28,119
Hi there.

305
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:29,703
- Ben! Oh my God!
- Surprise!

306
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,903
It's great to see you.

307
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:34,673
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Shh...

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,297
Maia's asleep in her room.

309
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:38,551
How did you get here?

310
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,083
Well, we hopped a flight.

311
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:42,424
Maia wanted to stay up
and say hi,

312
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,263
but she was out cold
by the time the cab dropped us off.

313
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,626
I had no idea you were coming.

314
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,605
The lease in San Sebastien
was up.

315
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,067
It's going to take you a lot longer
to find April than you thought, so...

316
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,283
It's been slow going.

317
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:59,519
I've been interviewing people,
making phone calls, no one has seen her.

318
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:02,761
I am not going to add
any more pressure to you,

319
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,118
but, me and Maia missed you very much,
so we figured...

320
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:07,751
Surprise !

321
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,448
Oh, well...

322
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,945
- It worked. I'm surprised.
- Diana...

323
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:18,166
You have gotten involved
with a very spontaneous guy.

324
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:21,182
Reap the whirlwind.

325
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,415
It's great to see you.
Don't get me wrong, I just...

326
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:31,926
I was kinda hoping that
this was only going to be a short trip,

327
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:34,347
and having you over there meant
I had something to go back to.

328
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:35,730
Well, you still do...

329
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,920
We all do...

330
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,809
As soon as you find your sister.

331
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:40,685
Okay?

332
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:42,889
In the meantime,
we're trying to be a family.

333
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:45,577
And families are not supposed
to live on separate continents.

334
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:47,230
Right?

335
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:57,670
<i>Solitude can be every bit
as exhilarating as companionship.

336
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:02,735
<i>Of course, I had to find companionship
before I figured that out.

337
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,385
Listen to this.
It's from the blog.

338
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,783
"All mankind is divided
into three classes,

339
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:11,318
"those who are immovable,
those who are movable,

340
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:12,718
and those who move."

341
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:15,500
That's very poetic. The blogger's
a good writer. We already know that.

342
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,366
But that's a quote.
You know who wrote it?

343
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,351
Benjamin Franklin.

344
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:22,261
The woman from the library.
The volunteer.

345
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:23,575
She's the one writing this.

346
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:25,592
Good work.

347
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,156
Looks like an overdose.

348
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:56,916
Lividity hasn't set in yet.

349
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:59,018
I'd say she died
about an hour ago.

350
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:22,758
We just got done
looking at her computer.

351
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:26,341
The techs found the entire journal
saved in a file on her hard drive.

352
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,457
Audrey Parker was our blogger.

353
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,652
One of the back windows was open,
but there's no sign of forced entry.

354
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,754
Nothing missing
as far as we can tell.

355
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:35,657
She had a prescription
for morphine,

356
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,849
so her arthritis
must have gotten pretty bad.

357
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:39,654
Her nurse usually injected her,

358
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:43,091
but occasionally would leave behind
extra shots for Audrey.

359
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,361
The ME thinks it was
an accidental overdose,

360
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:47,462
that it happens with older people.
They get confused,

361
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:50,757
take the wrong dosage,
forget that they've injected themselves.

362
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,311
What do you think?

363
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:55,933
It might have been an accident,
but, you know, she had taken promicin,

364
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,037
she knew NTAC
was breathing down her neck.

365
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,086
The thought of a prison sentence
at her age and in her condition?

366
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:04,941
Maybe she figured she'd rather
just drift off to sleep.

367
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:06,483
You think she committed suicide?

368
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:09,716
If she did,
she did it because of NTAC.

369
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:10,853
Because of us.

370
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:14,042
I didn't kill myself.

371
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:15,750
I... didn't kill myself.

372
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,610
Somebody did this to me.
Hanna...

373
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:22,475
Hanna, you have to help me, please.
Somebody did this to me!

374
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:23,939
Somebody did this to me!

375
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:05,721
You're back for more?

376
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:09,051
I'm doing my thesis on cults
from the early 20th century.

377
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,468
It's due soon, so...

378
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,401
Just let me know
when you're done.

379
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:14,835
And don't forget
to feed the kitty?

380
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:15,144
What do you mean,
you need to leave town?

381
00:21:15,244 --> 00:21:17,689
Philip, we have an appointment
with a buyer in an hour.

382
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:19,097
You can handle it yourself,

383
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,682
but I need to leave, now,

384
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,964
and, I need to borrow some cash.

385
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,417
I'll pay you back
when I see you again.

386
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,843
You're scaring me.
Sweetie, calm down.

387
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:28,641
Tell me what's going on.

388
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,674
Vanessa,
something happened last night.

389
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:33,364
I can't tell you about it,

390
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:35,686
but I promise you,
I did it to protect us.

391
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:37,966
Protect us from what?
What are you talking about?

392
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,528
I can't tell you right now.

393
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,054
I'll call you in a couple days
and I'll explain everything

394
00:21:42,154 --> 00:21:43,256
but right now
I need that money.

395
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:44,860
Can we please
just go to the bank?

396
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:47,565
It was you.
You did it.

397
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,923
I threatened you
and you killed me.

398
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:51,827
You killed me!

399
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,946
That's the ME's
preliminary report

400
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,295
on the death of Audrey Parker.

401
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:58,530
There's no note.
Nothing in her journals that indicates

402
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,103
she was considering suicide.

403
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:02,469
He's going to rule it
an accidental death.

404
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,299
Do you know
she lived in France

405
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,238
for three years in the 1950's?

406
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:08,948
Like, just pulled up
all the stakes and moved there?

407
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:10,608
She met Samuel Beckett at a party.

408
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,912
He complimented her
on her dress.

409
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:13,203
You admire her, don't you?

410
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:14,939
Yeah, in a way,
because she just...

411
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,392
lived her life
without compromise,

412
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:19,880
and that was no easy thing
for a woman of her generation,

413
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:22,325
and to be honest,
it's really no easy thing now.

414
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:25,093
I gave up my career to move
to Spain for my daughter.

415
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,514
I gave up Spain to come back
here to look for my sister,

416
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:29,244
and right now
my entire life just feels like

417
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:32,355
a bunch of compromises
all just strung together.

418
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,229
Anyway, no, no, I...

419
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,105
I'm not going to
demonize Audrey Parker

420
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,368
because she took
a promicin shot.

421
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:40,305
Diana,
I'm not saying you should.

422
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,503
But as far as what happened
to her, why she died,

423
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,788
that's for the Seattle police
to figure out.

424
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:47,563
Our involvement in this ended

425
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:49,595
as soon as we learned
she was behind the blog.

426
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:50,990
No...

427
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:52,230
you can't just file me away.

428
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,609
I didn't kill myself!

429
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,299
I was murdered!

430
00:22:56,753 --> 00:22:57,946
What the hell was that?

431
00:22:58,249 --> 00:22:59,581
- A power surge?
- I don't know,

432
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,899
but that's the second time today.

433
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,400
Remember all the radios
freaked out at Audrey's house.

434
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:08,495
Good morning.
Thank you all for coming.

435
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,356
Four months ago,

436
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:14,119
the US government
shut this building down,

437
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:15,728
along with
many other buildings like it

438
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:16,933
across the country.

439
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,465
In two days, I'm going to be
reopening its doors.

440
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,046
I will be starting up
my healing foundation again,

441
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:25,741
and I plan on using
this building

442
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:27,459
as its base of operations.

443
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:29,857
I would like to remind
everyone out there

444
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:32,674
that the 4400
aren't all revolutionaries.

445
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,812
We are not at war with society.

446
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,393
We want to help it.

447
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:39,727
We can help, and will not
be forced into silence

448
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:42,781
by the government's
so-called war on promicin.

449
00:23:44,302 --> 00:23:46,415
As a show of good faith
to the world at large,

450
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,141
I will heal anyone who is
present on our first day open.

451
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:51,873
The 4400 have been silent
for a long time.

452
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:53,698
Too long.

453
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,148
We look forward to
meeting the world again.

454
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,748
It's currently illegal
to use a 4400 ability

455
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:00,894
without special dispensation
from the government.

456
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:02,089
Have you made
arrangements with them?

457
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:03,809
There are no arrangements
to be made.

458
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,394
The people who run the country
aren't in a very...

459
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:07,867
accommodating mood right now.

460
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,863
So you haven't discussed
your plans with them?

461
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:10,997
Not exactly,

462
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:12,947
but I'm sure
they will be in touch.

463
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:15,264
<i>Why are we
going to the funeral of a woman</i>

464
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:16,635
<i>that you've only met once?</i>

465
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:18,971
I think someone has to pay her
some respect.

466
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:21,153
Okay, but...

467
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,286
I don't know, I'm trying
to make sense of this

468
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:25,569
to see what this has to do
with tracking down April.

469
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:26,730
What?

470
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:28,600
What?

471
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:30,743
Diana, that's why
you came back here, right?

472
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:32,142
I mean,
that's why we had to leave Spain.

473
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:33,438
Yes, and while I'm looking for her,

474
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,700
I have to work cases.

475
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,868
That's the deal,

476
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:38,699
and I just feel badly for her,
you know?

477
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:40,492
She died alone.

478
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:42,683
She might have
committed suicide.

479
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:45,402
What is going on?

480
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:48,533
Everywhere I go today,
I just keep hearing that static.

481
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:51,021
At work,
in the car on the way home.

482
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:52,325
Yeah, that's kind of weird.

483
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:56,631
You left me a voice message
on my cell phone today, right?

484
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,846
- Oh, yeah.
- I couldn't hear a thing.

485
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:02,049
It was all staticky and garbled.

486
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:06,015
That cell phone message
I left you...

487
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:08,589
Did you save it?

488
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:11,565
I just want to say,
this is really weird.

489
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:13,409
I ran that cell phone message
you brought me

490
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:15,539
through about six different
audio filters.

491
00:25:15,755 --> 00:25:17,367
There was nothing there,
just static.

492
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:18,869
Well, why would you expect
anything different?

493
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,550
I mean, come on, guys,
what are we even doing here?

494
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,677
Hey, I thought it was
a little crazy, too.

495
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:24,940
But then I tried
dropping everything out.

496
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,855
I tried listening to the message
in what, theoretically,

497
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:29,384
should have been
total silence.

498
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:31,349
This is what I found.

499
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:36,340
<i>Murdered!</i>

500
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:38,151
<i>Murdered!</i>

501
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,490
<i>Murdered!</i>

502
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:54,919
We think Audrey Parker's
ability was...

503
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:57,854
Well, I guess you'd have to
call it "astral projection."

504
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,427
She could send her consciousness
out of her body.

505
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:03,057
That's a kind of broadcast, right?

506
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,841
She's sending a signal.

507
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:08,109
It's a real thing. I mean,
it could disrupt electrical fields.

508
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:09,655
So if she died

509
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:11,677
while she was using her ability,
then...

510
00:26:11,777 --> 00:26:13,543
Then her body's gone,

511
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:15,535
but the signal is
still out there.

512
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:19,193
So Audrey's mind, or soul,
or whatever you want to call it,

513
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,227
has been following me around,

514
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:23,803
and that recording
has caught a fragment

515
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:25,268
of what she's trying to say?

516
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:27,893
Exactly. It obviously
thinks it was murdered.

517
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:30,304
- She, Brady, she...
- Just hold up a second, okay?

518
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:32,614
That tape gave me chills, too,

519
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:34,617
but it's not necessarily
proof of anything.

520
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,381
Audrey wrote everything down.

521
00:26:36,481 --> 00:26:39,069
Let's just go back
over the journals one last time.

522
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:41,376
If there's anything in there,
anyone who seems suspicious,

523
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,872
we'll just track it down.

524
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:47,335
Vanessa Martin?

525
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:50,944
Excuse me.

526
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:53,289
Hi. I'm Tom Baldwin.

527
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,825
This is my partner,
Diana Skouris.

528
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:55,929
- We're from NTAC.
- Hi.

529
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:57,656
We're looking for
Philip Delacroix.

530
00:26:57,806 --> 00:26:59,423
Why is NTAC looking for Philip?

531
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,840
We've been reviewing the journals
of a possible murder victim

532
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,228
named Audrey Parker.

533
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:05,622
There were repeated references
to you and your agent.

534
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:08,307
I'm sorry, I don't know anyone
named Audrey Parker.

535
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:10,437
Philip Delacroix
is not who he claims to be.

536
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:12,141
His real name is Philip Wilson,

537
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:15,023
and there are warrants out
in several states for his arrest.

538
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:17,295
- Philip?
- Do you know where Philip went?

539
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:20,147
We've already been by his apartment,
and it's cleared out.

540
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,063
He came to see me yesterday,

541
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:26,185
said he was leaving town.

542
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:28,213
He needed money.

543
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:31,367
You don't think he had anything to do
with that woman's death, do you?

544
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:32,535
We'll let you know.

545
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:33,670
Thank you.

546
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:37,341
Looks like Audrey confronted
the wrong guy.

547
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:39,458
Let's put out an APB
on Philip Wilson,

548
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:40,966
and all his known aliases.

549
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:43,122
Yeah, go back to the office,
put it on the wire,

550
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:44,305
call me if anything pops, okay?

551
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:45,543
I've got to be somewhere.

552
00:27:49,498 --> 00:27:51,727
Well, I have to say, I expected
a visit from you guys,

553
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:53,661
but I didn't think that
they'd send the head of NTAC.

554
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:55,188
I wanted to do this in person.

555
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:56,836
I had to emphasize
the seriousness

556
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,221
of the government's position.

557
00:27:59,354 --> 00:28:01,520
You know, you guys are
sure happy to call me

558
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,942
when you need me
to bail you out of a jam,

559
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:05,654
but the moment I want to go public,
you break out the fire hose?

560
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:07,341
I'm just healing some people.

561
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:08,533
There's nothing to be afraid of.

562
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:09,908
It's not a political statement.

563
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,234
Not a radical act.

564
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,045
I'm afraid
you're misreading the climate.

565
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:14,367
As far as DC is concerned,

566
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:17,721
any unsanctioned use of
a 4400 ability is a radical act.

567
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,265
I'm not misreading the climate.

568
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,574
I'm trying to change it.

569
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:23,194
There's too much fear
out there right now.

570
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:24,470
I think I can help.

571
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,235
I have to ask you,

572
00:28:26,514 --> 00:28:28,528
you keep talking about
the government's position,

573
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,497
but how do you feel
about what I'm doing?

574
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:34,820
No one's questioning
your motives, Mr. Farrell.

575
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:37,270
Personally, I think you've done
some amazing things...

576
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,598
But it doesn't matter,
really, what we believe.

577
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:42,063
If you go through with this,
it won't be us stopping you.

578
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:43,781
They're talking about
sending riot squads down.

579
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:45,795
There won't be anything
I can do, Shawn.

580
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:47,122
They will arrest you.

581
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,590
I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

582
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,787
It's going to be interesting.

583
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:01,034
Come on.

584
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,285
I told you, I was trying
to take advantage of Vanessa.

585
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,958
All those arrest warrants,
that's me. I did those.

586
00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:14,061
I'm admitting that to you,

587
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,697
but I never murdered anyone.

588
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,246
Then why did you run?
Why were you trying

589
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:18,873
to cross the border into Canada?

590
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,991
That woman knew who I was.

591
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,938
How did I know she wasn't going
to expose me

592
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:25,707
to the police
no matter what I did?

593
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:29,252
I didn't even know her name
until you told me.

594
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:33,359
I swear,
I didn't kill Audrey Parker.

595
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,967
- What was that?
- Maybe it's broken.

596
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,361
Maybe it just doesn't
believe your story.

597
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:52,531
He's telling the truth.
He didn't do it.

598
00:29:53,248 --> 00:29:56,019
The ME says that Audrey died
between 7:00 and 8:00 in the morning.

599
00:29:56,172 --> 00:29:58,143
I just checked out Philip's alibi.
It holds.

600
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:00,369
He was at a coffee shop
that whole time.

601
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:02,820
He met a woman for breakfast.
She was another mark.

602
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,050
He had her on the line
for a phony real estate deal.

603
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,885
He was with her for two hours
trying to get money out of her.

604
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:09,406
Well, maybe she's lying.

605
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:11,727
If she knows him,
she might be covering for him.

606
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:14,852
The sales clerk at the coffee shop
confirms it, too, so does the manager.

607
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:16,403
Diana, we'll...

608
00:30:16,503 --> 00:30:18,242
We'll hand him over
to Seattle PD,

609
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,608
have him arrested
on the outstanding warrants.

610
00:30:21,532 --> 00:30:22,621
But...

611
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,565
If Audrey Parker was murdered,

612
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:26,565
Philip Wilson didn't do it.

613
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:33,862
Come on.

614
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,361
No... no, he's lying.

615
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,670
He has to be.

616
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:43,786
What's happening to me?

617
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,805
I'm fading away.

618
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,408
There's nothing there.
I've listened again and again.

619
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:55,622
It's just static.

620
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:58,384
I know that Audrey was following
me around all last night.

621
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:00,012
My cell phone,
answering machine,

622
00:31:00,112 --> 00:31:02,216
television,
just breaking up constantly.

623
00:31:02,355 --> 00:31:04,114
I mean, she's trying
to tell me something.

624
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:06,398
She probably is,
but it's like I told you,

625
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,444
whatever's left
of Audrey is energy,

626
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,855
you know, a kind of signal,
and signals fade.

627
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:12,152
You think she's getting weaker?

628
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:13,380
Each time she talks to you,

629
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,007
it costs her a little
of whatever energy she has left.

630
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,404
If she stays silent,
she'll be around longer.

631
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:19,770
Maybe she could muster enough

632
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,484
to communicate with you
one more time,

633
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,629
but it might be
the last thing she ever does.

634
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:24,889
She could disappear forever.

635
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:26,966
All right, we'll just go back
into her journals.

636
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:28,392
We'll interview everyone in them...

637
00:31:28,492 --> 00:31:29,516
Diana, stop.

638
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,960
I know you respect Audrey Parker,
and to tell you the truth,

639
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,090
after reading about her
yesterday, I do, too.

640
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:36,637
She took promicin, but look
what she did for Vanessa Martin.

641
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:37,856
She was trying to help people.

642
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:40,433
But we've done
what we agreed to do.

643
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:43,289
We looked through the journals,
we still can't be sure she was murdered,

644
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:46,099
and even if she was,
it still wouldn't be our case.

645
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,344
Now, I'm sorry.
It's time to let this go.

646
00:31:58,431 --> 00:31:59,431
I'm sorry, Audrey.

647
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:15,203
So is it starting to
make sense yet?

648
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,668
No, not really.

649
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:19,427
I mean, yeah,
the guy they talk about

650
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:20,534
could be Jordan Collier.

651
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,181
Some of the details do match up.

652
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:24,006
Or it could be a coincidence.

653
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:25,452
They left it vague enough
that anyone could

654
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:26,844
read into this
whatever they want to.

655
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,256
Well, you can't just dismiss it.

656
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:29,989
That book is a blueprint

657
00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:31,553
for how Collier's going to succeed.

658
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:34,497
Oh, yeah? Jordan Collier
needs the handbook of a cult

659
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:36,803
that hasn't even had
a living member in 80 years?

660
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,041
He does.

661
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:39,718
- And he needs you.
- For what?

662
00:32:39,818 --> 00:32:41,366
To tell him some
crazy guy predicted

663
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:43,139
he was going to be
God's messenger?

664
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:45,272
To guide him.
to be his Shaman.

665
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:47,681
You keep saying that.
How can I guide him?

666
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:49,050
I don't know anything.

667
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,396
Well, that's what
you've got me for, Kyle.

668
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:54,138
Everything in that book
is going to come true.

669
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,282
Collier will lead the human race
to salvation.

670
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:58,652
You will help him.

671
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,681
You don't believe me yet.

672
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:05,024
It's okay.

673
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:06,299
I'll show you.

674
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,106
I'm going to be at the intersection
of Forbes and Shady tonight

675
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:10,628
around 2:00 AM.

676
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:12,017
I hope you'll show.

677
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:13,463
That's where
it's all beginning.

678
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:15,115
If you're not there,

679
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:16,884
you'll never see me again,

680
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:19,493
but if you come,
you'll see it all begin,

681
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:21,099
and I promise,

682
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,990
you will believe.

683
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:28,729
Are you sure
you want to do this?

684
00:33:29,294 --> 00:33:30,755
I'm probably gonna get
into a lot of trouble.

685
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:32,543
Doesn't mean
you have to join in on the fun.

686
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:34,552
Nothing changes on its own,
right?

687
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:37,732
And besides, you said
you didn't want to be alone.

688
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:05,134
I left you money, Hanna.

689
00:34:05,324 --> 00:34:07,296
My house, too.
Almost everything I have.

690
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,704
You'll find out
in a couple of days.

691
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,066
You were always so kind to me.

692
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,901
Lucas, lunch is ready!

693
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,117
Come on, you've got
to eat before work!

694
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,861
Yeah, I'll be down in a minute.
Hold on!

695
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:27,581
You need to be kind
to your mother, Lucas.

696
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:28,819
She loves you,

697
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,067
and she's trying to raise you
all on her own.

698
00:34:31,627 --> 00:34:32,656
No, I already told you,

699
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:34,560
I don't know
how many carats it is.

700
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:40,732
Well, I'm sure it's worth
a couple grand at least.

701
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:42,000
My necklace...

702
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:44,132
That's my necklace.

703
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,965
Well, seriously,
how soon can you meet me?

704
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,173
I screwed up really bad.

705
00:34:47,276 --> 00:34:48,872
That's my necklace.
It was you.

706
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:50,891
Well, I need
to get rid of this thing.

707
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,205
You killed me.

708
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:54,557
This building stays closed.

709
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:55,882
Those are my orders.

710
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:57,112
All right, not a problem.

711
00:34:57,212 --> 00:34:58,782
I can do my work right here.

712
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:00,059
Excuse me.

713
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:01,624
Hi.

714
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:03,120
What's your name?

715
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,853
Kathy. I have cerebral palsy.

716
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,542
Step away, Mr. Farrell.

717
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:10,108
Well, I think that there's
something we can do about that.

718
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:21,229
You're in our custody now.

719
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:23,151
Right, go home now!

720
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:24,497
This is all over!

721
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,398
You can go home!

722
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,328
Please!
You've got to let him go.

723
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,167
He's not doing anything wrong.

724
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:33,358
Step aside.

725
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,140
Look, we don't want
to hurt anyone,

726
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:37,092
but this is an illegal assembly!

727
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,968
- Stop! Stop...
- Step aside.

728
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,309
I'm from NTAC.

729
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,601
Can't you see these people aren't going
to let you just walk him out of here?

730
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:50,799
Now, look around you.
There are sick people here.

731
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:53,342
They're the mainstream. They're
who we're trying to protect.

732
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:55,623
Listen to me!

733
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,171
Tell your men to stand down.

734
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:04,922
Sir, the situation's
out of control.

735
00:36:05,523 --> 00:36:07,429
I've got NTAC
telling me to back off.

736
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,959
Yes, sir.

737
00:36:10,811 --> 00:36:11,844
I understand.

738
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,583
Let him go!

739
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:29,447
Everyone... If I could
just have a little space?

740
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:33,212
Now...

741
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:34,601
Where were we?

742
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,249
I guess I haven't really
thought much

743
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:49,668
about why I've let Audrey
under my skin.

744
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:51,413
- I...
- Come here.

745
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,692
I guess I just...
I identify with her, you know?

746
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:57,112
If I had made different choices,

747
00:36:57,212 --> 00:37:00,008
or chosen a different path,

748
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:02,984
I could the one
who's dying alone.

749
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,739
Maybe,

750
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:07,185
but you didn't,

751
00:37:07,645 --> 00:37:08,735
and you won't.

752
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:12,532
No, no, no, come on.

753
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,738
Let it ring.

754
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,374
<i>Leave a message and we'll get
back to you as soon as we can...</i>

755
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:22,236
That's her.

756
00:37:23,147 --> 00:37:24,255
That's Audrey.

757
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:29,437
I didn't mean for her to die.

758
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:30,651
I swear I didn't.

759
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:33,479
I just wanted her stuff.

760
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:36,508
I gave her the morphine shot

761
00:37:36,608 --> 00:37:39,173
so that she would stay asleep
while I looked through her house.

762
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:42,638
I've seen my mom inject her
so many times,

763
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:44,232
I figured it would be okay.

764
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,582
It was an accident.

765
00:37:48,794 --> 00:37:50,653
You'll take that into account,
won't you?

766
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,902
I swear to god,
it was an accident!

767
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:58,322
Not exactly
a master criminal.

768
00:37:58,422 --> 00:38:00,491
No, but if Audrey hadn't
have left his name

769
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:01,618
on my answering machine,

770
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:02,963
who knows
if we would've found him?

771
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:04,244
She was a brave lady.

772
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:05,916
She must have known
that communicating again

773
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:07,775
would use up whatever
time she had left.

774
00:38:08,146 --> 00:38:10,447
I haven't heard any static
since last night.

775
00:38:11,714 --> 00:38:13,820
I guess she went out
the way she lived,

776
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:15,512
with style.

777
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:23,892
You think
that this is how you feel

778
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:25,102
after a marathon?

779
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:26,674
I wouldn't know.

780
00:38:28,414 --> 00:38:29,906
But you'd better get
a good night's sleep.

781
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:32,686
We're not even halfway through
the list of people who showed up.

782
00:38:34,114 --> 00:38:35,156
Hey, Shawn.

783
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:37,173
Hey, uncle Tommy...

784
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,791
I'm sure you're tired,
so I hate to even ask, but...

785
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,147
Are you up for one more?

786
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:44,039
Yeah, sure.

787
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:54,240
His name's Donald.

788
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:55,677
He's my father.

789
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,740
I'd be grateful
if you could help him.

790
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,780
Hello, Donald.
Let's go into my office, okay?

791
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:17,391
The head of NTAC benefiting
personally from a 4400 ability?

792
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,733
You sure you're up
for the fallout?

793
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:22,122
They let this place stay open.

794
00:39:22,504 --> 00:39:23,622
They blinked.

795
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:26,013
Let them fire me.

796
00:39:36,993 --> 00:39:39,030
This is Audrey's favorite song.

797
00:39:40,097 --> 00:39:42,454
She mentioned it a couple times
in her journals.

798
00:39:43,485 --> 00:39:44,649
Makes sense.

799
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:47,964
I think this song was written
back in the '30s.

800
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,897
Oh, my God.

801
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,079
It's her.

802
00:39:56,155 --> 00:39:57,253
She's still here.

803
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:59,359
Where's that little tape recorder?
We've gotta get this.

804
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:00,894
No, we don't need
to record this.

805
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:02,696
I already know
what she's saying.

806
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:04,557
She's saying goodbye.

807
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:10,467
It's so beautiful.

808
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:13,111
I'm ready.

809
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:54,020
You can stop.

810
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:55,586
This is the spot.

811
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:58,877
I'm glad you showed.

812
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,351
Yeah, me too.

813
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:01,873
A great view of nothing.

814
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:03,517
It's all about to happen.

815
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:06,169
What do you mean?
What's going to happen?

816
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:13,952
Gotta take this turn, baby!

817
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:35,939
<i>Let's go, let's go, come on!</i>

818
