The world
will have to deal with us.

00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,297
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:48,963
You're
the alternative we need

5
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:51,782
to collier and his
promicin-pushing radicals.

6
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:53,659
Does that mean you'll run
for city council?

7
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:55,833
It means I'm going to run
and I'm going to win.

8
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:58,000
Promicin...
is out there.

9
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,118
People are gaining abilities,
and...

10
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:01,919
nothing can be done about that.

11
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,553
- Who's cassie?
- I'm not what you'd call real.

12
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,216
I'm Kyle's ability.

13
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,464
<i>Everything in that book
is going to come true.

14
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:10,620
Collier will lead the human race
to salvation.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,812
You will help him.

16
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:18,545
Isabelle Tyler...

17
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,114
<i>I've done bad things,

18
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:22,630
and I'm supposed to do more.

19
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:24,329
I was sent
to help you get away.

20
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:25,919
This is all happening
for a reason.

21
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:28,001
Do you believe that
Jordan Collier is a Messiah,

22
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:29,658
and promicin's
gonna save the world?

23
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:32,292
Kyle, listen to me,
if you're involved in something...

24
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,924
The lab report you asked for,
samples came back positive for promicin.

25
00:01:58,476 --> 00:01:59,672
Hey, dad, what's up?

26
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:00,926
<i>Where are you, Kyle?

27
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:02,876
Is something wrong?

28
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,761
I need to talk to you, buddy.
It's important,

29
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:08,241
but we have to do it in person.
Can you come home now?

30
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:11,525
Sure, yeah. I can be home in, like,
20 minutes or something.

31
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,824
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- 20 minutes. I'll be here.

32
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,817
You can't go
back there, Kyle.

33
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:20,392
He knows.

34
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,208
Knows what?

35
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:23,858
What do you think?

36
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:26,315
Your father knows
you took the promicin shot.

37
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:33,539
What's he going to do?

38
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,862
Is he going to tell NTAC?

39
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:39,058
If I can't go home, what am I supposed
to do? Where do I live?

40
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,368
You can move on now.

41
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,630
Move where?

42
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:43,691
You're heading north.

43
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:44,941
Take highway 99

44
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,900
until it crosses
with rural route 57.

45
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,363
Follow that, and you'll find
an old logging pass.

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,234
When it ends, get out
and start walking due west.

47
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:53,901
What am I looking for?

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Go there.

49
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:56,814
Enjoy the surprise.

50
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:09,715
I heard talking.

51
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:11,148
Is everything okay?

52
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:17,316
You have to get ready, okay?
We're leaving.

53
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,583
Don't let them take me!

54
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:51,555
Oh, sweetie.

55
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:52,822
It's okay.

56
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:56,307
Sweetheart, it's okay.
Nobody's taking you anywhere.

57
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:58,267
You just had a nightmare.

58
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,967
It's like a prison.

59
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:04,040
All the people with abilities
are there.

60
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,156
They make us
line up,

61
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,356
then they take us away,

62
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:10,212
someplace bad.

63
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:11,995
What kind of place?

64
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,591
You've had
this dream before.

65
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:20,841
That was the second time.

66
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,191
I thought
it was going to go away,

67
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:25,262
but it didn't.

68
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,478
It's okay, sweetie.
Come here.

69
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,942
It's okay, baby.

70
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,629
What are we even supposed to be
looking for?

71
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,297
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

72
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:41,081
Cassie said to come here.
That means there's something here.

73
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,983
That cell tower services
the entire area.

74
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,087
And you're positive, that's the final
signal from my son's phone?

75
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,599
All right.
all right, thanks.

76
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,946
God, just for once,
I'd like to beat you in here.

77
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,994
Listen, I have to leave for a while.
Kyle's in trouble.

78
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:58,339
Is he?
What's wrong?

79
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:00,238
I can't get into it,
but I have to find him,

80
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:01,634
and I need you to cover for me.

81
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,071
I just got off the phone
with Kyle's wireless carrier.

82
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,501
The last signal from his cell phone
came from about four hours away,

83
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,135
so it could be a while.
Maybe even a day or two.

84
00:05:08,235 --> 00:05:09,894
Tell me what's wrong.
I'd like to help.

85
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,506
The best help you could give me
is to cover my back.

86
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,651
Tell anyone who asks I'm in the field
on one of our cases, all right?

87
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,051
I'll call you
when I find him.

88
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:20,626
Good luck.

89
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,435
Thanks.

90
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,219

Oh, my God.

97
00:06:57,787 --> 00:06:59,837
You trapped me.
You led me right to him.

98
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,443
How did you find this place?

99
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:12,826
I took the shot.

100
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:16,085
I've been having these visions.
they led me to you.

101
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,610
They told me
I have to bring you something.

102
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,011
It's just a book, man.

103
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:22,243
It's important.
It's about you.

104
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,099
You have to read it.
There was this...

105
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,801
religious movement
about 90 years ago.

106
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:27,612
White light,
they called it a cult.

107
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:29,237
This book was their prophecy.

108
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:31,779
It's all about promicin,
the movement.

109
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,204
It's the reason
I'm supposed to find you.

110
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:35,304
And her?

111
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:40,738
Were you supposed to lead
Isabelle Tyler to me as well?

112
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,828
I was guided to her
the same way I was guided to you.

113
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:46,311
She's going to help us
with the movement, Jordan.

114
00:07:46,977 --> 00:07:48,177
I'm not a threat to you.

115
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:51,489
I don't have
my abilities anymore.

116
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,106
What could you possibly do
for me?

117
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,038
I don't know.

118
00:07:58,917 --> 00:07:59,917
That's you.

119
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,750
I'm telling you,
it's all about you.

120
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:12,897
Bring them.

121
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:24,048
<i>Mr. Farrell has been handed
this remarkable ability, but...

122
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,616
<i>he himself...

123
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:28,282
<i>is simply not that
distinguished of a young man.

124
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:31,622
<i>Now, even if he was
the second coming of robert kennedy,

125
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:33,931
<i>I would still say that a 4400

126
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,715
<i>has no business
running for public office.

127
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:42,801
Today's clippings.

128
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:44,434
Do I wanna read
today's clippings?

129
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:47,539
Everyone respects
your healing work,

130
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:50,386
but... they're calling you out
on your age,

131
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:53,108
your inexperience,
your lack of education,

132
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,725
- your connections with Jordan Collier.
- I get it, I get it.

133
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:57,942
It's just, do I really have to study

134
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:00,017
my own shortcomings?
That's what I want to know.

135
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,001
Your campaign manager
thinks you do.

136
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:05,209
She got you a meeting
with Gabriel Hewitt later today,

137
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,642
and you're gonna have to be able
to refute his...

138
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:10,288
talking points.
One by one.

139
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,039
I have to have a sit-down with the man
that's been badmouthing me

140
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,843
to anybody that'll put
a camera in his face?

141
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,834
I think the idea
is to win him over.

142
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:18,927
Tell him
about the foundation.

143
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:21,834
Convince him you are not
some pawn of Jordan Collier.

144
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:29,779
I admire you, Kyle.

145
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,788
Given your background,
it must have been difficult

146
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,046
to take the promicin shot.

147
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:35,757
But I've read your book.

148
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,242
It's wrong.

149
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,193
- I'm no Messiah.
- I know how it sounds.

150
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,862
It was hard for me to believe, too.
I'm nobody's religious nut,

151
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:46,227
but these visions I have
are never wrong, not once,

152
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,441
and if they say that book is important,
I have to believe it.

153
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,616
I have to believe
what's in there.

154
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:52,506
Promicin
isn't just here

155
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,380
to improve
the world, Jordan.

156
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,585
It's here to bring
heaven to earth.

157
00:09:57,862 --> 00:10:00,129
I don't know
exactly what that means, but...

158
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:03,087
You're supposed to make it happen,
and I'm supposed to help you.

159
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,371
It's like it says in the book.

160
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,479
You are going to lead us all...

161
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:08,739
to God.

162
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:15,762
Untie him.

163
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:20,646
We'll continue this
somewhere more comfortable.

164
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,639
What about me?

165
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,416
I'll deal with you soon enough.

166
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:57,835
Goodness me,
a customer I don't recognize.

167
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:59,668
Will wonders ever cease?

168
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:03,192
I guess you don't get many visitors.
This town isn't even on my map.

169
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,730
That highway two
went in a few years back.

170
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,831
Since then, we've been
a little short on visitors,

171
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,535
but it's a treat to have one
as handsome as you.

172
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:13,944
Kathy, would you stop flirting
with the poor man,

173
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:15,194
see if he wants
some lunch?

174
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:17,543
I'm good.
Thanks.

175
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:20,993
You don't come all this way
to skip my famous apple pie.

176
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,761
Tell the man, will you, Shannon?

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,574
Kathy makes a mean apple pie.

178
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:26,251
It's the house specialty.

179
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,544
I'm sure she does.

180
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:30,345
I wish I had time. Actually,
I was hoping to find the sheriff.

181
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:31,821
There was a note on the door.

182
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:35,228
He should just move
his office in here.

183
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,578
Thanks.

184
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:38,828
My son's driving a green Saturn.

185
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,567
Well, there's not much reason
to come out here,

186
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,714
but if I do see it,
I'll definitely give you a call.

187
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:46,647
Now, if your boy
did pass through here,

188
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,047
I'm sure he's moved on by now.

189
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:51,126
But you're welcome
to have a wander, ask around.

190
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:53,439
- I appreciate that, sheriff, thanks.
- Not a problem.

191
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:58,572
Is there anything we can get you
for the road?

192
00:11:58,672 --> 00:11:59,955
You should try
the pie, Mister.

193
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:01,059
It's really good.

194
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,406
I'll pass, but thanks.

195
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:04,886
You sure?

196
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:14,313
So I guess the question is
are we just talking about

197
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,751
a kid's recurring nightmare,
or is it something worse?

198
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:20,098
Well, obviously,
I'm pulling for nightmares.

199
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,638
Maia's visions don't usually
happen while she's sleeping,

200
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:25,131
and she wasn't seeing this
while we were in Spain.

201
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:28,395
The headlines aren't exactly reassuring
and they're a lot more immediate

202
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:30,706
when your mom brings you back
to the front lines.

203
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:33,735
Maybe so, but we can't really
rule out visions either,

204
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,210
- can we?
- But we're talking about prison camps.

205
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,660
Maia hasn't broken any laws.

206
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,941
She is a 4400.
She didn't take promicin.

207
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,378
I'm afraid that distinction
doesn't mean much these days.

208
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:44,569
People are scared.

209
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,028
A lot of them want to lock up
every p-positive out there.

210
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,044
The wrong leader comes to power,

211
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,321
someone who exploits all that fear
everybody's feeling,

212
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:56,271
and suddenly this doesn't seem
so farfetched.

213
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:58,846
There's a more productive way
to look at this.

214
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,696
I mean, if they are visions,
at least we've got some warning.

215
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:03,629
You know,
if we had more specifics,

216
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:05,580
maybe we can make sure
they don't come true.

217
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,330
I'm trying to stop my daughter
from having these nightmares,

218
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,574
not encourage her
to have more specific ones

219
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:11,941
so that you can
analyze them.

220
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,724
Thanks for your help, though.

221
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,299
Excuse me?

222
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,162
Sorry, I didn't
see you there.

223
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:42,837
Can I get you something?

224
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:45,974
Yeah, look, I'm on my way out of town.
Any chance I can fill up? Your...

225
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:47,474
pumps don't seem to be working.

226
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,648
I haven't had a gas truck around
in a while,

227
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,993
but I think I got
a spare gas can in the back.

228
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:53,318
Just give me a sec?

229
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,296
What are you doing, Mister?

230
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:15,287
- That's my son's car. Where is he?
- Calm Down.

231
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,781
- What you're talking about ?
- Where's kyle?

232
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:19,629
- What you're talking about, man?
- Now, you hold it right there.

233
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:21,360
Take your hands
off that man right now.

234
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,549
Sheriff, this man
has my son's car.

235
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,959
- Tell him!
- Don't know what you're talking about!

236
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,130
He's been messing
with this vehicle for months.

237
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:31,488
You said yourself your boy
just drove through here today.

238
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:35,746
That's my son's car,
I know it is.

239
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:39,607
I am sorry for your troubles, Mister,
but you're wrong,

240
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:43,476
and I don't think we can help you here,
so maybe it's time you just moved on.

241
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,978
Starter's on the fritz.

242
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,208
Give me a hand here?

243
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:24,288
You shouldn't have seen that,
Mister.

244
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,404
Who are you people?
What is this place?

245
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:51,326
You say you deciphered this?

246
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,550
Isabelle did.

247
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:54,826
It's a list
of names,

248
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,732
but it's people
who are alive today.

249
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:59,358
Politicians, religious leaders,
scientists.

250
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:00,792
The book says that...

251
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,953
once these people
all take promicin,

252
00:17:05,032 --> 00:17:07,288
everyone will.
It's like a domino effect.

253
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,225
And that's when...

254
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:12,058
when God comes.

255
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,600
I know it sounds
crazy, but...

256
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,311
Only if you take the book
literally.

257
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,411
"God" could mean...

258
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:19,849
any number of things.

259
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:22,736
If these people saw a world
healed by promicin,

260
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:25,203
they could have interpreted that
as heaven.

261
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:28,244
I don't know. The only way
we'll know is if we just follow the book

262
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:29,622
and see what happens, right?

263
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:32,064
We've allowed the government
to characterize the movement

264
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:33,839
as a revolution.

265
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:37,469
Revolutions divide,
destabilize, spread fear.

266
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,300
Religions...

267
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:41,613
Religions unite.

268
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:53,352
Apparently there's an NTAC agent in town
looking for his son.

269
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,705
My dad knows I took the shot.

270
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,997
He must have tracked me here.
He would have come on his own.

271
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,930
He's just looking to protect me,
that's it.

272
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:09,352
Jordan,
be careful with him, okay?

273
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,069
He's my father, and...

274
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:15,086
He's the last name on the list.

275
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:21,397
The book says your father
has to take the shot?

276
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:25,331
Interesting.

277
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:37,024
So, the application process
for the healing foundation is blind.

278
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:38,772
Helps to avoid favoritism,

279
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:42,098
and we average about a dozen
treatments a day now.

280
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:46,617
Well, the work you do here is...

281
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:47,800
remarkable.

282
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,093
But then I already knew that.

283
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,993
Well, does that mean
you're going to stop slinging mud at me?

284
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:54,908
Quite the contrary.

285
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:58,584
I intend on attacking you
right up until the day of the election.

286
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:02,287
You seem to be taking this as if it's
a referendum on your character.

287
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:03,527
I assure you
that it isn't.

288
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:06,527
Personally, I think
you're an exceptional young man,

289
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:10,187
but there are a lot of people out there
that are afraid of what you represent,

290
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:11,561
so going after you...

291
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:13,508
that's just good politics.

292
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:17,275
So you don't think I'm a threat,
but you're gonna say that I am anyway?

293
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:19,469
You...

294
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:21,334
You look so shocked.

295
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:23,284
Look...

296
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,423
I have my eyes on something greater
than just city council.

297
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:29,083
When you declared for the race,

298
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:31,232
you brought the national
media spotlight with you,

299
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,533
and if I didn't
take advantage of that, well...

300
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:37,217
I wouldn't be much
of a politician, now, would I?

301
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,621
Don't make a sound.

302
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:52,548
Now open the door.
Open it up.

303
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:57,901
Whatever you can do,
whatever your ability is,

304
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:00,327
- don't try to use it.
- I can't hurt anybody. Please...

305
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:01,443
put the gun down now.

306
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:02,559
What is this place?

307
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:04,509
What did you people do
to this town?

308
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:06,192
It was an old timber mill town.

309
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,239
It was abandoned years ago,
so we came and made it our own.

310
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,228
- Who's we?
- All of us.

311
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,376
Everyone who lives here
has taken the shot.

312
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,678
We just wanted a place

313
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:17,404
where we could live peacefully
without fear of being arrested.

314
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:18,970
That won't work here.

315
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,891
We have someone who can disrupt
electrical signals.

316
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,237
What did you do to my son?

317
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:26,037
Nothing. He came to us.
He's safe.

318
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:28,605
- He's being taken care of.
- Then take me to him.

319
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:29,722
Now.

320
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:32,822
No, I wouldn't say that
my meeting with Mr. Farrell did...

321
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,372
anything to convince me
that a 4400

322
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:36,973
should hold public office.

323
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,564
Maia, what are you doing up?

324
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:43,104
I'm not tired.

325
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:44,729
Is that true,

326
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:46,378
or are you just...

327
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,699
worried about what
you might dream?

328
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,449
Sweetie, it's okay to be scared.

329
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,697
You know, you're upset,
we've...

330
00:20:54,931 --> 00:20:56,585
and we've been through
a lot of changes.

331
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:57,991
Why are we back here?

332
00:20:58,575 --> 00:21:00,041
Why do I have to find
a new school?

333
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:01,548
And why is Ben gone?

334
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:05,111
And why do you always
call me sweetie when I get upset?

335
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:06,808
I'm not a little kid anymore.

336
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:09,719
No, okay, Maia, you're right.
You're not a little kid,

337
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:13,036
and I understand
if you're mad at me.

338
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:16,103
I mean, we've
moved around a lot.

339
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:17,922
But this city...

340
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,242
as scary as it can be,
is the one place

341
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,779
where your mom can do the most good,
and that's important.

342
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,927
I tried to pretend
that it wasn't,

343
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:28,476
and I hope
you'll appreciate that one day.

344
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:30,859
But, sweetie...

345
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:33,876
Maia,
you can't stay up forever.

346
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,503
It'll only make you feel worse.
Do you think I could have that can?

347
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:36,436
Here.

348
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:45,990
Kyle, you all right?

349
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,366
I'm fine, thanks...

350
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:49,862
but I'm not Kyle.

351
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,221
Collier, get down
on the ground!

352
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,177
Hello, tom.

353
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Welcome to my town.

354
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,571
That bacon smells good, huh?

355
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:51,880
Okay, so to make
scrambled eggs...

356
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:53,575
Do you want to crack the egg?

357
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:56,251
Oh, I hope we didn't wake you.

358
00:23:56,547 --> 00:23:59,111
We figured you would want
to sleep after last night.

359
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:00,887
How do you like your eggs?

360
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:05,659
Morning, Tom.

361
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:14,684
What did you do to me?

362
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:16,415
Well,
we've taken steps to ensure

363
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:19,016
that you behave yourself
while you're our guest.

364
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,850
That bracelet you're wearing,

365
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,850
our town mechanic created that.

366
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:24,411
Dalton. I believe you met him.

367
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:25,749
It's quite a device.

368
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:27,969
It allows us to track you
wherever you go.

369
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:30,644
And that...
that pain in your head,

370
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:31,816
he did that.

371
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,410
He's capable of worse.

372
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:35,158
So, if you...

373
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,896
become violent while you're here,
or make any attempt

374
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,606
- to leave Evanston...
- Where's Kyle?

375
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,018
Kyle is fine.

376
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:44,985
We've been talking.

377
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:46,774
He's a very brave young man.

378
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,164
Where is he?
I want to see him.

379
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:50,453
Not yet. Kyle and I agree,
you're not ready.

380
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:52,017
You don't understand
what we're...

381
00:24:52,306 --> 00:24:53,491
trying to accomplish here.

382
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:55,410
All right, then tell me,
what is this place?

383
00:24:57,152 --> 00:24:58,704
It's a model for a better world.

384
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:01,213
I gathered these people.

385
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:04,751
They all took the shot
and left their old lives behind.

386
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:07,934
They've created something better
here in Evanston.

387
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:12,357
Have a walk around.

388
00:25:12,716 --> 00:25:13,739
See for yourself.

389
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:28,484
Maia's dreaming
about Gabriel Hewitt?

390
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:31,197
In her nightmares,
he's some kind of leader.

391
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:32,743
President, vice president,

392
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:34,064
cabinet member,
I don't know,

393
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:35,977
but he seems to be overseeing

394
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,917
some extremely repressive
measures against the 4400.

395
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:40,714
Nobody respects
your daughter's ability

396
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:43,412
more than I do, and I'm sorry
that she's seeing these things,

397
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:45,779
but Hewitt,
he's on the seattle city council.

398
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,052
That's a long way away

399
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:48,688
from pulling
these kinds of strings.

400
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:49,796
No, please understand,

401
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:52,638
I think you've taken
a very brave step

402
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:54,103
by declaring for public office.

403
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:57,033
It's exactly the kind of gesture
this country needs, but...

404
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:59,318
I mean, you have to consider
that you may...

405
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:01,320
inadvertently
be giving a platform

406
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,771
to a very dangerous man.

407
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:04,668
What are you asking me to do?

408
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,938
Drop out?
Because that's not going to happen.

409
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:08,635
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

410
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,024
I just want you
to have the facts.

411
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:12,769
But these aren't facts,
they're dreams.

412
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,460
Even if they are visions,

413
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:19,931
I stop them from happening
by staying in the race,

414
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:22,867
by taking a stand against hatred
and proving Hewitt wrong.

415
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:25,796
I hope that's what happens,

416
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,776
but right now...

417
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,086
That's not what Maia's seeing.

418
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:38,819
We're not the enemy, you know.

419
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,959
We just think
people deserve a choice.

420
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:45,560
I was in a...

421
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:49,325
bad place
when I took the shot.

422
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:51,467
Most of us were.

423
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:53,950
But now I can do
something wonderful,

424
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,321
something no one else can.

425
00:26:56,663 --> 00:26:57,728
What is it?

426
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,390
Your ability?

427
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:01,251
I guess you could call me

428
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:03,231
an anxiety extractor?

429
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:04,893
I talk to people.

430
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,307
Actually, they do
most of the talking,

431
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:09,099
but when we're done,

432
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:11,543
they feel better.

433
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:14,605
All their worry's just gone.

434
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:16,790
What's that,
like a souped-up shrink?

435
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:18,423
I don't have any advice,

436
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:20,085
believe me,

437
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:22,278
but...

438
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,103
it works.

439
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,774
I talked to just about
everybody in town.

440
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:30,556
Would you want to try it?

441
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,840
I don't think so.

442
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,848
Think of it
as a good faith gesture.

443
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:40,326
You'd be one step closer
to seeing your son.

444
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:42,608
Plus, no offense...

445
00:27:43,857 --> 00:27:45,213
But I think you could use it.

446
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,837
Kyle says you're essential
to what I'm doing.

447
00:27:58,272 --> 00:27:59,585
He's a very forgiving young man.

448
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:01,927
He wasn't there
when you killed 4400s.

449
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:04,020
Why shouldn't I be rid of you
forever?

450
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:06,260
I don't know.

451
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:10,858
I'm not in that book,

452
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:12,783
but...

453
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,004
when I first got older,

454
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:18,539
I was told I existed
to stop the 4400,

455
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,954
and that's what I tried to do.

456
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:22,805
You beat me.

457
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:25,401
I thought I'd spend the rest
of my life in prison,

458
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,925
thinking about what I'd done,

459
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:29,422
and then Kyle found me.

460
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:33,519
He told me I have a purpose.

461
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,975
He told me I could
still be good.

462
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:37,806
You have no idea

463
00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:39,668
how much I want that
to be true.

464
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:43,700
So if helping you is the way

465
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,389
to make my life
mean something,

466
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,379
I want to try.

467
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:51,990
If I accept what Kyle says
about our movement,

468
00:28:52,674 --> 00:28:54,476
I have to accept
what he says about you,

469
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:57,093
but the first moment
you make me nervous,

470
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:59,577
your invitation is rescinded,

471
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:02,464
and you can guess
what that means.

472
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:03,948
Cut her down.

473
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,686
Every move I make,
it seems like there's some

474
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:10,940
kind of loss
that comes with it,

475
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:12,651
and the woman I love is gone,

476
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,595
I'm losing my son
to Collier, and I...

477
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:19,970
Are you done?

478
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:24,185
How do you feel?

479
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,579
Wow, I actually feel better.

480
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,144
It's not permanent.

481
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:32,379
We would need to have
follow-up talks.

482
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:33,975
It...

483
00:29:38,113 --> 00:29:39,135
What is this?

484
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,646
Whenever I talk to someone,

485
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,491
at the end,
there's one of these.

486
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:44,343
I think it represents

487
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:46,342
all of the bad stuff
inside of you.

488
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:48,358
The fear,

489
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,729
anxiety...

490
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,895
You should keep it.

491
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:56,876
A little reminder
of what we do here.

492
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:05,146
Kathy, you weren't lying.

493
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:06,420
This pie is delicious.

494
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:08,421
Yeah, the pie's pretty good,

495
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,585
but the aftertaste
is a killer.

496
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:14,052
Aftertaste?
What aftertaste?

497
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:15,668
<i>You'll see.</i>

498
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,049
<i>He's getting scared.</i>

499
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:20,130
<i>Shannon, tell him it's okay.</i>

500
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,495
It's all right, Tom.

501
00:30:21,745 --> 00:30:23,007
Just relax.

502
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,297
The pie had
a little something in it.

503
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:27,956
<i>Something, what do you mean?
What something?</i>

504
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:29,844
<i>It's a special ingredient,</i>

505
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,729
<i>courtesy of
one of our residents.</i>

506
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,309
<i>After we take it,
we share one mind.</i>

507
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:36,355
<i>We can see
each other's memories.</i>

508
00:30:36,722 --> 00:30:38,224
<i>It's how we know
each other better.</i>

509
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:40,825
<i>It's amazing,
if you just relax.</i>

510
00:30:57,487 --> 00:30:59,206
This was Billy's last birthday,

511
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:01,844
before his parents were killed
in a plane crash.

512
00:31:11,276 --> 00:31:12,826
That's Paul and Kathy.

513
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:15,164
They were so cute
when they were young.

514
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:18,437
He popped the question
after three weeks.

515
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:20,059
He said he just knew.

516
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,580
They can't see us?

517
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,542
We're not even really here.

518
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,568
It's just a memory.

519
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:31,487
I've never seen this before.

520
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:32,924
This is me.

521
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:35,380
Oh, my god, that's me.

522
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,225
We won the league
championship that year.

523
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:48,107
My father actually
came to the game.

524
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:55,845
I, uh...

525
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:58,137
I don't know what to say.

526
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:04,351
Another satisfied customer.

527
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:09,852
That was amazing.

528
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:12,773
You know, I feel like
I know you all now.

529
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:14,895
It's pretty intense, isn't it?

530
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,926
I'm just glad you finally
accepted the invitation.

531
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,069
Yeah, me too.

532
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:22,709
Hey, dad.

533
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,935
Glad you got to spend
some time in this place.

534
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:31,704
These people,
they're not evil.

535
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:34,085
They're just looking to make
a better life for themselves,

536
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,218
and they did.

537
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:38,445
How could you take the shot?

538
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:40,090
How could you
risk your life like that?

539
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,440
It was worth it, dad.

540
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:43,327
It brought me here.

541
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:46,228
In a weird way,
it brought us together.

542
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:48,677
I know our relationship
has always been complicated,

543
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:51,147
but this place is simple.
It's good, dad.

544
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:53,940
And the life they're living here,
dad, that could be our life.

545
00:32:54,164 --> 00:32:55,780
We could live here,
you and me.

546
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:58,566
Isn't that what you want?
For us to be together?

547
00:32:58,679 --> 00:32:59,833
Of course.

548
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:01,495
More than anything.

549
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:03,563
If you want to stay here,

550
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:07,091
if you want to
live here with me...

551
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:10,631
You have to take the shot.

552
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,105
Kyle, you know I can't do that.

553
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,710
Are you afraid of dying, dad?

554
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:18,614
Because I promise you,

555
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,810
if you take the shot,
you will live.

556
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,507
How could you know that?

557
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:24,888
Everybody here has
an ability. So do I.

558
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,554
I can't talk to you
about it right now,

559
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:28,907
but I know that you'll be okay.

560
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,061
That's a lot to take in right now.

561
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:38,436
You don't have to give me
an answer right away. Just...

562
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:39,624
sleep on it.

563
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:47,888
I know I haven't
said this to you in a long time,

564
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:51,399
but I love you.

565
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:03,786
Do you think he'll do it?

566
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:05,570
Part of him wants to.

567
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,290
I could see it in his eyes.

568
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,781
He knows this place is good,

569
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,218
but his whole life
has just been about duty.

570
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:14,533
The FBI, NTAC.

571
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:17,202
I'm not sure he'll be able to
just turn his back on all that.

572
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:18,428
And if he says no?

573
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:20,882
His name's in the book?
That's pretty much a guarantee

574
00:34:20,982 --> 00:34:22,333
that he can survive the shot.

575
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:27,130
Can we just make him take it?

576
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:30,397
I've never forced anyone
to take promicin.

577
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:32,782
The movement's
always been about choice.

578
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,837
But your relationship
with your father, it's...

579
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:38,591
intricate...

580
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,947
So if you think it best
to give him the shot,

581
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,928
I'll respect your decision.

582
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:49,745
So if I stay in the race,
I'm creating a monster.

583
00:34:50,144 --> 00:34:51,515
You don't know that for sure.

584
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,511
Remember, we're
talking about dreams.

585
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:54,779
No, these aren't just dreams.

586
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,677
This girl predicted
that Jordan would be shot.

587
00:34:56,777 --> 00:34:57,882
She can tell the future,

588
00:34:58,118 --> 00:35:01,007
and Hewitt said it himself
when he was here.

589
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:03,657
He's using me to get
attention for his career.

590
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,605
I can't just sit on this.

591
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:08,864
I have to do something.

592
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:10,549
If Jordan found out
that some guy

593
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:12,125
was rising
to power on his back,

594
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,966
and he could become
some kind of...

595
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:15,765
home-grown Hitler,

596
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:18,750
he wouldn't just sit around
wringing his hands. He...

597
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,544
He'd act.

598
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:38,400
Good morning, Tom.

599
00:35:39,423 --> 00:35:40,681
You're donating promicin?

600
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:42,411
Every week.

601
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:43,791
We all do.

602
00:35:45,817 --> 00:35:47,320
I hate needles,

603
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:50,008
but Jordan's given us all
so much.

604
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,286
We figure the least we can do
is give something back.

605
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,812
I rigged up this machine here.

606
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:57,471
You want to see how it works?

607
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:13,025
I'm glad I saw this place.

608
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,786
I know how much it means to you,

609
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:16,574
and for the first time, I...

610
00:36:16,804 --> 00:36:19,326
I feel like maybe I understand
what Collier's trying to do.

611
00:36:21,276 --> 00:36:22,526
But I can't be a part of it.

612
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,262
You're just holding onto
this idea of yourself

613
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:27,720
as our opponent, our enemy.
You can just let go of that.

614
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,061
- It'd be so easy.
- It's not about that, Kyle.

615
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:32,209
This town,
it's like a little utopia,

616
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:35,050
but it exists to send promicin out
into the streets,

617
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,441
and no matter
how you look at it,

618
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,901
half the people who take
that shot are going to die,

619
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:41,061
- and I can't live with that.
- You have to.

620
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:44,375
We all have to, dad.
Forget 50-50, okay?

621
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:45,998
If the movement
doesn't succeed,

622
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:47,718
nobody has any chance.

623
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,082
I don't believe that.

624
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:52,054
I can't.

625
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:59,384
I get it. You have
to follow what you believe,

626
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:01,455
and so do I.

627
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:02,801
No, wait, Kyle.

628
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:06,998
You are the only thing
that could tempt me to do this.

629
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:13,328
I love you.

630
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:22,468
Get out of my way.
I'm leaving.

631
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:25,562
I'm sorry you've declined
our invitation, Tom.

632
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:28,677
I'm sorry your lack of faith
will cost you your son.

633
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:29,815
I'm walking away.

634
00:37:30,196 --> 00:37:31,831
Go ahead and give me
a stroke if you have to,

635
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:33,392
but I'm walking out
of this town.

636
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:35,132
You know
I can't let you do that.

637
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,885
I told you.
I'm not taking the shot!

638
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,781
It's not just
about the politics, is it?

639
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:03,663
What the hell
are you doing here?

640
00:39:03,861 --> 00:39:07,006
Everything that you said to me
in my office that day was a lie.

641
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,452
This is private property.

642
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:10,848
You know that I could
have you arrested for trespassing.

643
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,553
The truth is you hate us all.

644
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,648
You hate all the 4400.

645
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:15,811
So what if I do?

646
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:17,719
I mean, what difference
does it make?

647
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:20,350
Now, I'll ask you again,
why are you hanging around

648
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,108
outside my garage?
What are you doing here?

649
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:23,743
I wanted to see you
without the cameras

650
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:26,386
when you put your public
face up for the night,

651
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:27,869
have a look at your eyes.

652
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,181
I have reason to believe

653
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,944
that you're capable
of terrible things,

654
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:34,132
and that you have an evil
living inside of you.

655
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,616
What if you did see evil?

656
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:37,819
Then what?

657
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,649
Honestly, I don't know
what I would do,

658
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:44,865
but the truth is,
I can't see anything.

659
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:47,782
You may be full of fear
and hatred,

660
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:49,086
but you're just a man.

661
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,745
For now.

662
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:53,412
Listen, you might not
know it yet.

663
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,575
You wouldn't make
a very good leader.

664
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,354
I'm not going to let you
become one.

665
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:06,798
But your promicin test
came back negative.

666
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:10,920
I'm so sorry about Kyle, Tom.

667
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:14,739
We need to call Meghan,
issue a new APB.

668
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:17,461
Jordan Collier,
his followers...

669
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:20,935
And my son.

670
00:40:47,007 --> 00:40:49,315
I couldn't force him to take it,
Jordan. I'm sorry.

671
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:52,394
Well, I left
the choice up to you.

672
00:40:53,597 --> 00:40:55,028
Anyway,
the sedative we gave him

673
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:57,306
gave us enough time
to get out of Evanston.

674
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:00,269
But he's gone. I lost my dad.

675
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:01,568
We lost my dad.

676
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:04,011
His name is in the book.

677
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,243
If he doesn't take the shot,
we don't succeed.

678
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:09,266
Then you need to have faith
he will.

679
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:13,647
But it won't happen
because we forced it on him.

680
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:16,380
One day, Kyle,

681
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:19,267
I believe
your father will come to us.

682
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:23,160
We lost Evanston
because of me.

683
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,812
I cost us paradise.

684
00:41:26,202 --> 00:41:27,310
It's all right.

685
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:29,929
Evanston was never meant

686
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:32,308
as a permanent settlement.
It was only a...

687
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:34,233
a dress rehearsal for paradise.

688
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:36,478
So what do we do now?

689
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,600
You've got all these
people here.

690
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:41,681
What are you
going to do with them?

691
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,258
None of you

692
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,512
should lose hope.

693
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:57,405
There is a next step.

694
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,578
There is a home waiting
