2
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,800
The world
will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:48,149
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:51,149
- What the hell are you doing?
- <i>Diana's not quite herself right now.

5
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:52,849
<i>She'll do whatever
tess tells her to.

6
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,949
<i>Tess is schizophrenic.

7
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,249
The strain of hiding out,
the guilt over what we did,

8
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,449
she can't handle it.
It's caused a break.

9
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:01,249
<i>She needs medical care.

10
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:04,016
<i>I will not sacrifice
Tess to you.

11
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:06,094
<i>You made your choice,
but you're my daughter.

12
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:07,841
<i>If you quit this now,
I'll stand by you.

13
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:13,586
Daddy?

14
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:15,757
<i>What about my father?
Has anybody heard from him?

15
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:18,149
<i>They did something to me
last night.

16
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:21,049
<i>Those people who came into my room
were dressed for an operation.

17
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,400
<i>They put something into me.

18
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:24,428
<i>Matthew Ross...

19
00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:27,249
<i>What if they took whatever
is inside of him and put it into me?

20
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,982
- Please tell me that you're still you.
- I think so.

21
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:02,249
Sorry. I know it's late.

22
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:05,182
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No, I was just...

23
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:07,332
Good, because I didn't know
where else to go.

24
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,749
I was out with friends.
The rep is doing a revival of "Arcadia".

25
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,000
You know that...
Tom Stoppard play?

26
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:17,174
Anyway, when the show let out,
I found this on my windshield.

27
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:19,300
Every car on the block
had one.

28
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:23,049
So basically, if you want
to be cool, take promicin.

29
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:25,899
Today on the news, I heard
a story about two middle school kids

30
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,849
who took the shot.
12 years old.

31
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,349
Both died.

32
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:31,400
We're losing the war, Tom.

33
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,209
<i>My God, thank you...

34
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,349
This one's my favorite.

35
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:23,774
Come on, everyone.
Let's dance.

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,949
Hello. This is Shawn.

37
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,749
<i>Shawn,
it's Kevin Burkhoff.

38
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,282
Listen to me,
I don't have much time.

39
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,849
It's tess, all right?

40
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,549
<i>Her schizophrenia
is out of control.

41
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,949
<I>I have tried every combination of meds
I can think of.

42
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,049
Nothing works.

43
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:05,282
So you have to help her.
Or heal her.

44
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,416
Before she hurts someone.

45
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:08,049
Can you get her
to the center?

46
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,423
<I>No, listen to me.

47
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:12,449
She's taking over a diner,
all right?

48
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,382
<I>She won't allow
anyone to leave.

49
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:15,899
<i>We're trapped here.

50
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,666
Put down the phone.

51
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:20,999
<i>Dr. Burkhoff?

52
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:23,300
Where are you?
Where's the diner located?

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,666
<i>So this is the last one
and then I'm really leaving.

54
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,049
<i>I've kept you up long enough.

55
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,082
<i>Maybe I should put on
some coffee.

56
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,849
<i>You let me sit here
for hours,

57
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,549
<i>ranting about promicin
and Jordan Collier, and...

58
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,299
<i>instead of kicking me out,
you're offering me coffee?

59
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,599
That's so... sweet.

60
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,800
I don't know about sweet.
Selfish maybe.

61
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:50,549
Since kyle left,
it's been pretty lonely around here.

62
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,982
Besides, I know how
stressful the job can be.

63
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:56,432
I'm the guy who thought he was possessed
by some entity from the future.

64
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:59,349
I had a perfectly harmless mole
removed for no good reason.

65
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:00,832
But it's healing, though, right?

66
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,500
- Let me look.
- Yeah, I think so.

67
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:12,073
Sorry.

68
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,766
I don't know
why I did that.

69
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:17,800
Maybe we could both
use some coffee.

70
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,950
Maybe later.

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,849
Tell me again
why we're doing this

72
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:32,499
at 6:30 in the morning?

73
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,800
Because I like to have
fresh tomatoes with my eggs.

74
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,967
Besides, I love
working in the garden.

75
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,624
It makes me feel like I'm contributing,
even though I don't have an ability.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,724
I've got to admit,
it's pretty amazing.

77
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,266
A week ago, this place
was a toxic wasteland, and now we're...

78
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,500
having our first harvest.

79
00:05:56,712 --> 00:05:58,900
Well, you're amazed now.

80
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,700
Wait till we get
to actually eat them.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,707
Okay. Very funny.

82
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,000
Who's doing that?

83
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:26,383
Dad?

84
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,900
Hello, Isabelle.

90
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,109
So...

91
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,200
What's it been now?
Six months?

92
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,624
Something like that.

93
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:44,500
I have to say, all that time,
you don't seem so glad to see me.

94
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,433
The last time I saw you,
you tried to kill me.

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,249
Isabelle, I'm not here
to hurt you.

96
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:52,566
How'd you get in here?

97
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:54,316
I have friends.

98
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,482
4400s
who live here now,

99
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,699
left a key for me
under the mat.

100
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,807
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like
a moment alone with my daughter.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,057
Kyle, it's okay.

102
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,012
- You sure?
- Yeah.

103
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Why are you here?

104
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,300
I wanted to apologize.

105
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,983
To tell you how sorry I am
for being such a lousy father.

106
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,900
I guess I wasn't exactly
the best daughter.

107
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,749
You needed guidance.

108
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,624
Someone to teach you
right from wrong.

109
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:28,000
And I wasn't there for you.
I tried, but didn't do a very good job.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,107
You were so powerful,
even as a baby.

111
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:33,049
I was never comfortable
with that.

112
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:35,100
And then you grew up
overnight.

113
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,982
And your mother aging
the way she did.

114
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:40,532
I tried to deny it, but...

115
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:43,298
I guess part of me
blamed you for her death.

116
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,300
Maybe I was responsible.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
I still don't know.

118
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:52,674
- But I never meant to hurt her.
- I know that.

119
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:54,503
But all the other
bad things I did...

120
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,800
They were my fault.

121
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
My decisions.
Not yours.

122
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,267
You weren't ready to make
those kinds of decisions.

123
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,300
You were used
by the future,

124
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,849
by Dennis Ryland.

125
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,616
If I had been stronger,
I could have prevented all that.

126
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:14,249
But instead, I allowed things
to get ugly between us.

127
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:15,749
And we both
paid the price.

128
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,407
All I want is for us
to be father and daughter again.

129
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,100
I want that, too.

130
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,207
You'll stay, right?

131
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,657
I want you to.

132
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,107
So do I.

133
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,257
Hello, Richard.

134
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,600
Welcome to Promise City.

135
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,424
Oh, sorry.

136
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,670
Tom, the second time we did it
with the lights on, it's not like

137
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,602
there's anything you haven't seen.
Could you help me with this zip?

138
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:55,382
I'll have to make
a quick stop at home to change.

139
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:58,207
Good. Then we won't be
showing up at the same time.

140
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,249
This is only going to be weird
if we let it.

141
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:03,266
- And we're not going to, right?
- Right.

142
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,499
Last night was...

143
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:07,282
Fun.

144
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:10,716
It's been a rough couple of months.
We both needed a little...

145
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,857
distraction,
a little comfort,

146
00:10:13,357 --> 00:10:15,957
But it doesn't have to be
anything more than that. Okay?

147
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:18,770
So, you're saying last night
was just a...

148
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:20,304
one-time thing?

149
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Well, yeah.

150
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:24,783
I think so.

151
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,000
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

152
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,925
You have that list I asked for?

153
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,249
Every diner
in the greater Seattle area

154
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,632
that has a jukebox.

155
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:37,324
You sure
it was '50s music you heard?

156
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:38,957
Pretty sure,
I heard Chuck Berry.

157
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:42,349
You're gonna have to cancel all
my appointments for today and tomorrow.

158
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:44,816
Are you sure you should be
going after Dr. Burkhoff?

159
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:47,608
He's a wanted man.
You could get in a lot of trouble.

160
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,464
Kevin saved my life,
and the lives of all the other 4400s

161
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:53,432
after the government's inhibitor program
almost killed us all.

162
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,828
And besides, if there's anyone that can
reduce the risk of taking promicin...

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,007
It's him.

164
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:01,357
He's worth it.

165
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:23,400
What's wrong
with everyone?

166
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,949
Why aren't they dancing?
Are they trying to ruin my party?

167
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:30,766
They've been dancing
for two days.

168
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,649
They're exhausted.
They need sleep. So do you.

169
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:36,749
Sleep? Why would anyone
want to sleep? It's a party.

170
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,400
What would Bobby think
if he showed up and I was sleeping?

171
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,700
I love you, Bobby.

172
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,600
He has eyes
like Montgomery Clift.

173
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,707
Soulful, you know?

174
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,695
Where is he anyway?
Why isn't he here yet?

175
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,900
Maybe he's not coming.

176
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,549
You're just jealous.

177
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,649
Because Bobby's my boyfriend
and you're not.

178
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,249
- That's not why.
- No, I don't want to hear it.

179
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,699
Bobby cares about me.
He's so sweet.

180
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:04,482
He'd do anything for me.

181
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:07,600
Everybody, get up.
Everybody, dance.

182
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,807
So...

183
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:27,603
One fugitive to another,

184
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:30,216
tell me how you managed
to stay off NTAC's radar

185
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,316
all these months.

186
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,200
I had lots of help.

187
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,500
4400s who risked
their freedom to...

188
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,941
to give me shelter,

189
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,007
money, pretty much
anything I needed.

190
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,082
These friends of yours...

191
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,449
How do they feel about promicin?
About people developing abilities?

192
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,407
The world's changed.
You changed it.

193
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,349
They're just trying to
figure out where they fit in.

194
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:55,816
I'll tell you
where they fit in.

195
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:57,200
Right here in Promise City.

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Everyone with an ability
belongs here.

197
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,300
This is a pretty amazing place
you've created here.

198
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:14,500
Oh, I didn't do it.
Not alone, anyway.

199
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,749
Everyone here...

200
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:19,132
has helped to make
Promise City a reality,

201
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,700
including you.

202
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,300
No, I'm serious.

203
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:28,174
All the work that you did
for me at the center,

204
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,149
everything that
you accomplished,

205
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,399
it all led to us being here.

206
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:34,666
If you say so.

207
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:36,549
But there is work
yet ahead of us.

208
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,700
Plenty of it.

209
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,191
And I could use
your help, Richard.

210
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,749
I guess telekinesis could come in handy
In case the government ever decided...

211
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:46,249
That's a remarkable ability, yes,

212
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:48,382
but it's your leadership
I could really use.

213
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:51,349
These people, they respect you.
They listen to you.

214
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,100
You can make
a big difference.

215
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,133
I'm here to reconnect with my daughter,
not join the movement.

216
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,467
Well, I hope you'll
consider doing both.

217
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,649
Kyle says they're
throwing you a welcome party.

218
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,157
I guess I should
feel honored.

219
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,391
Mr. Tyler!

220
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:23,300
It's so good
to have you with us.

221
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Thank you.

222
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,549
You see that?

223
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,582
Everyone's glad
you're here.

224
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:33,257
Including me.

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,257
Jordan's been great,
and Kyle, too,

226
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:39,449
but... I'm the only person
here without an ability.

227
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:41,041
I still feel
like I don't belong.

228
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,100
I was kind of hoping
you could help me find my way.

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
That's why I'm here,
Isabelle.

230
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,600
To help you all I can.

231
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,800
Starting right now.

232
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,783
You're going to feel a little dizzy,
Isabelle. Don't be scared.

233
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,850
Daddy?

234
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,007
It's okay.

235
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,900
Everything's going to be
just fine.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,841
Richard's gone.
I think Isabelle's with him.

237
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:42,100
Wait for it.

238
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,699
No doubt about it.
The man is a genuine badass.

239
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,116
Maybe when we catch him,
you can ask for his autograph.

240
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:56,040
Now we know why
we never caught up with him.

241
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,849
- He's hiding out with Jordan Collier.
- I don't think so.

242
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:00,749
If Richard was with Collier,
we would've known about it.

243
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:02,349
He's too important
to be kept in the background.

244
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:05,040
Somehow, he managed to get into
Promise City without us even knowing,

245
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,294
which means he could have left
just as discreetly.

246
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:08,599
He looked like
he was in a hurry.

247
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,932
I couldn't tell if isabelle
was unconscious or dead.

248
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:12,849
He did try to kill her
once before, right?

249
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:15,249
If she were dead,
why carry the body away?

250
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,249
I think it looks like
a kidnapping.

251
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:19,449
Well, I guess we won't know
for certain until we find him.

252
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:22,049
Well, we could start
by talking to Jordan Collier.

253
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,949
He did say he was willing
to keep the communication lines open,

254
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,599
so let's see how serious he is.

255
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:28,132
Knock on his front door.

256
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,500
See if anyone answers.

257
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:43,774
Take it easy.

258
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,337
Your head's going to hurt
for a little while.

259
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:48,649
Drink some water.

260
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:49,874
You'll feel better.

261
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,907
What did you do to me?

262
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:56,257
Stopped the flow of blood
to your brain.

263
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,900
Only for a few seconds.

264
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,624
Just enough
for you to pass out.

265
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Why?

266
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,100
Where are you taking me?

267
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,707
Away from Collier's war.

268
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:09,549
Away from Promise City.

269
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,100
We don't belong there.

270
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,700
That's the only place
we're safe.

271
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,349
The government, NTAC,
they're all going to come after us.

272
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,732
They're not going to find us,
I promise.

273
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,507
I'm sorry I had to do it like that,
but it's for the best.

274
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,067
From now on, we're going
to be a family again.

275
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,550
We've got a long trip ahead of us.
You should eat something.

276
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm not hungry.

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
I want to go back.

278
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,500
That's not going to happen.
You have to accept that.

279
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,800
Come on.
You got to keep your strength up.

280
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,300
At least drink some water.

281
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:09,274
Please.
I can't do it anymore.

282
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,500
It's been two days.

283
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,174
I need to stop.
Rest.

284
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,200
I don't believe this.
Wake him up.

285
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:26,923
The rest of you, keep dancing.

286
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,715
I'll get him some water.
Come with me.

287
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:34,649
You are torturing those poor people
and it's going to stop right now.

288
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:38,149
This is my big night, Kevin.
A girl only turns 16 once.

289
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:41,349
You turned 16
back in 1953.

290
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:42,649
That was a long time ago.

291
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:45,049
And you never even had
a sweet 16 party.

292
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:48,207
You told me you had your first
schizophrenic attack the night before,

293
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:49,649
and your parents called it off.

294
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,249
- No, that's not true.
- Yes, it is.

295
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:52,949
This is my party!

296
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,632
I want Bobby.
Where's Bobby?

297
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:58,149
Listen to me. Even if Bobby were alive,
he'd be, like, what?

298
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,466
- 70?
- That's a lie.

299
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,182
You don't know
what you're saying.

300
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,349
Look at those people.
Look at them.

301
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:05,100
You see
what you're doing to them?

302
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,833
Get your hand off me.

303
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:16,091
Don't!

304
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,683
I'm afraid
there's not much to say, Tom.

305
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,000
Richard Tyler
was only here for a few hours.

306
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,474
I'm afraid he didn't inform me
of any plot to kidnap his daughter.

307
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,607
Do you have any idea
where he's taken her?

308
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,832
Did he mention where he's been hiding
the last few months?

309
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,202
Safe house?
Friends?

310
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,949
Sorry, dad.
He didn't tell us anything.

311
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,119
There is one name.

312
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,702
Michael Ancelet.

313
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:45,184
Ancelet?

314
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,451
I remember that name.
He's an original 4400.

315
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,564
When Richard was running
security at the center,

316
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:50,916
Michael was his deputy.

317
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:54,011
If Richard goes to anyone for help,
it might well be him.

318
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:55,606
Thanks for the lead.

319
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,456
I hope it pans out.

320
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,331
Jordan,
why would you help them?

321
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:06,533
My dad'll throw
Richard and Isabelle in prison.

322
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,670
We welcomed Richard Tyler
into our home.

323
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,980
We trusted him.

324
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:12,683
He broke that trust.
We owe him nothing.

325
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:14,937
Besides,

326
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,672
helping NTAC
apprehend a fugitive

327
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,470
puts your father in our debt.

328
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,092
That could prove useful.

329
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,377
What about Isabelle?
Do you care what happens to her?

330
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,608
Kyle, I understand
you two have grown close,

331
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,639
but Isabelle's role in the movement
has never been clearly defined.

332
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,329
Neither the book nor Cassie...

333
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,511
have made any mention
of her importance.

334
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,711
She's important to me.

335
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:40,143
I'm going to find her
before my father does.

336
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,227
A rescue attempt

337
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:45,495
is reckless at best.

338
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:48,057
Losing you

339
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:50,846
vastly outweighs the
benefit of finding Isabelle.

340
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:53,320
Don't do anything foolish.

341
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,032
How long
have you been planning this?

342
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:15,404
Ever since I found out
you moved to Promise City.

343
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,285
You could probably use some sleep.

344
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:22,128
Your room is at the top of the stairs
through the door.

345
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:30,894
Dad, this is a kid's room.

346
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:34,737
There's no way I'm going
to fit in that little bed.

347
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,364
Don't worry about it.

348
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:38,091
I've got that covered.

349
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:41,642
You're going to be happy here.

350
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:43,098
Safe.

351
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,079
I'll be sure of it.

352
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:26,929
<i>Daddy!</i>

353
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:33,990
Everything's okay.

354
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:36,077
Don't be scared.

355
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:39,300
Something's wrong.
I think I'm shrinking.

356
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,867
What did you do to me?

357
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:44,164
I told you, Isabelle,
we're starting over.

358
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,308
You're not get smaller,
you're getting younger.

359
00:22:48,071 --> 00:22:49,273
What?

360
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,665
Daddy, what am I?
14? 15?

361
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:57,151
For now, anyway.

362
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:58,987
What is that supposed to mean?

363
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:00,523
How much younger
am I gonna get?

364
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:02,259
I'm just trying to help you,
Isabelle.

365
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:04,438
Find a way to make
things better for you.

366
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:06,326
For month,
it's all I could think about.

367
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:07,988
Then I met Cora.

368
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:10,277
She has an amazing ability.

369
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:12,233
She can actually
make people younger.

370
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,235
That's what I could give you.

371
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:16,973
A chance to start over,
to have a normal childhood.

372
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:19,145
Soon, you'll forget about
all those terrible things you did,

373
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,767
all those regrets
weighing you down.

374
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:22,927
Daddy, I was doing fine on my own.

375
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,816
You don't have to do this, daddy.
Please.

376
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:32,069
Do you know what the happiest
day of my life was?

377
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:35,439
It was back
when we were living at the center.

378
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:39,325
Your mother was working for the
healing foundation with Shawn.

379
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:42,321
I took you to Madison park.
To the playground.

380
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,933
I put you on my lap,
and we sat on one of the swings,

381
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:46,956
and I rocked you back and forth,
it must've been 20 min.

382
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:48,349
You laughed the whole time.

383
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:50,990
It was a perfect day.

384
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:56,441
The next morning,
you woke up 20 years older,

385
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,268
and your mother was
dying in front of my eyes.

386
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:00,977
I want us to be able to start over,
and now we can.

387
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,709
I have started over.

388
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:07,714
I have my own life now.
It might not be perfect, but it's mine.

389
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,944
Please don't take
that away from me, daddy.

390
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:11,475
I know this is scary for you,

391
00:24:12,277 --> 00:24:14,404
but soon,
you won't remember any of this.

392
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:32,962
This is the water
you gave me in the car.

393
00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:36,596
That's how this all started,
isn't it?

394
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:38,512
It's in the water?

395
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,165
Is that how you're doing this?

396
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,345
Kevin, I brought you some butter.

397
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:06,458
My mom said it's good for burns.

398
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:08,454
Thank you, but my hand's fine.

399
00:25:09,387 --> 00:25:11,810
How could that be?
It was all black and blistered.

400
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,716
I can heal myself, Tess.

401
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,700
It's my ability from
when I took the shot.

402
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:21,377
Just like you can compel people
to do things against their will.

403
00:25:26,313 --> 00:25:28,292
Sometime, Kevin,

404
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:30,408
you say the craziest things.

405
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,810
I guess that's why I like you.

406
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,362
Oh, my goodness!
That must be Bobby.

407
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:39,356
Everybody,
look like you're having fun.

408
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:43,775
Hey, Tess.

409
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:45,161
Bobby?

410
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:47,216
It's about time, Bobby.
Tess was worried.

411
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:49,451
She was afraid
you weren't going to show up, Bobby.

412
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:51,173
Where you been?

413
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,552
I'm sorry. I had some car trouble.

414
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,033
Well, you're here now.

415
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,842
- That's all that matters.
- What are you doing?

416
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:00,974
Bobby is gonna help you, Tess.

417
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:02,524
He's gonna make you
feel better.

418
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:03,663
I feel fine.

419
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:05,612
Believe me, you're not fine.

420
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,855
But that's okay.
I can make that all better.

421
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:09,672
All you have to do
is take my hands.

422
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,031
- It's real easy.
- No. Don't touch me.

423
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:13,893
You're not Bobby.

424
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:15,648
You two are playing a joke on me.

425
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,714
A horrible, nasty joke.

426
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:22,757
You're right, I'm not Bobby,

427
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:24,589
but I really am here to help you, Tess.

428
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:25,926
You're sick, Tess.

429
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:27,360
Shawn is a healer.

430
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,820
There's nothing wrong with me.
Stop saying there is.

431
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:33,338
- Listen to me.
- No. Gloria needs a partner.

432
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:37,126
- Tess, listen to me.
- No talking. Just dancing.

433
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:39,919
And you...

434
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,790
You're not my friend anymore.

435
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,452
You're mean.

436
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:45,471
I hate you.

437
00:26:57,851 --> 00:26:59,513
Why are you still her, Kyle?

438
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:01,561
Isabelle needs you.

439
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:03,601
I promised Jordan.

440
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,771
Jordan is wrong.

441
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:06,783
Don't look so surprised.

442
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,225
Even Messiahs
make mistakes sometimes.

443
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:11,092
Do you know
where Richard took her?

444
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,087
As a matter of fact, I do.

445
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:18,744
I'll be right with you.

446
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:20,771
I just have
to get this thought down.

447
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:24,791
Seems like you've had
a lot of those lately, Mr. Ancelet.

448
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,358
It's my autobiography.

449
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,365
You must have had a busy life.

450
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,963
I'm about to start on fourth grade.

451
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,964
What are we talking about here?
Some kind of total recall?

452
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,842
That's right.
I remember

453
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:39,188
people, events,
dreams, thoughts even.

454
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:41,441
If I experienced, I remember it.
All of it.

455
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:43,708
- You're writing it all down.
- Only thing that keeps me sane.

456
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,097
Otherwise, it just...

457
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:48,955
builds up in my head, until it feels
like my brain is gonna explode.

458
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:50,844
Mr. Ancelet,
you know why we're here?

459
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:56,921
- Richard Tyler.
- Do you know where he is?

460
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,381
I know he's my friend.

461
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:02,612
I understand.

462
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,109
Friendship's important.

463
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:06,796
But, Mike,

464
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,433
aiding and abetting a fugitive?
A 4400?

465
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:11,747
That's a...
That's a prison sentence.

466
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:14,632
And in that prison,
you're not gonna get computers,

467
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:16,080
or pens, or paper.

468
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,924
It'll just be you.
Alone...

469
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,354
with your thoughts.

470
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:28,957
Where are you?

471
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:33,717
How's that soup?

472
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,180
I like the noodles.

473
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,624
That boy?

474
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,922
The one at the center.

475
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,724
The one I liked so much?

476
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:46,837
What was his name again?

477
00:29:47,448 --> 00:29:48,559
Shawn Farrell.

478
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:50,718
I was mean to him...

479
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,436
Wasn't I?

480
00:29:53,955 --> 00:29:56,405
I'm having a hard
time remembering things.

481
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,931
That's okay.

482
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:02,939
We'll make new memories.

483
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,600
Better ones.

484
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:09,683
All it takes is...

485
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:11,223
one big sip,

486
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,128
then we're done.

487
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:14,668
And then what?

488
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:17,146
I won't be me anymore.

489
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,798
It'll be like I never existed.

490
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,520
If your mother were here,

491
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:23,498
she'd want us to do this.

492
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,921
She'd want us to be
a family again.

493
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,470
Be together.

494
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:31,695
Stay here.

495
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:55,994
What did you do to her?

496
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:58,435
It's a 4400 ability.

497
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:01,037
He wants to turn me
into a baby again.

498
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:02,823
Richar, this is crazy.

499
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,286
You have to stop this.

500
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:07,106
This is between me and my daughter.
It has nothing to do with you.

501
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:08,733
Daddy, don't.

502
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:10,808
Kyle is my friend.

503
00:31:10,993 --> 00:31:13,472
He's the first person
who ever believed in me,

504
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,771
believes that I could change.

505
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,542
She's not
the same person you knew.

506
00:31:17,662 --> 00:31:19,372
If you'd spent more time
in Promise City,

507
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,233
you'd have seen that.
Come on, Isabelle.

508
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,890
Where do you think
you're going?

509
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,148
Away from here.

510
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:27,195
We'll fix this, okay?
I promise you.

511
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:38,743
Can I talk to you for a second?

512
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:42,215
It's about Bobby.

513
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:44,038
He's here.

514
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:46,414
No, he's not.

515
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:48,052
Yes, he is.
He's right over there.

516
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:52,765
That's just Kevin.

517
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,497
Hey, Bobby loves you, right?

518
00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:57,832
He's always there for you.

519
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,766
He'd do anything
to make you happy.

520
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,005
Yes, he would.

521
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,976
Then I'm telling yoy, that's Bobby.

522
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:04,970
Go over to him.

523
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,641
Look into his eyes.
See for yourself.

524
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:26,674
Bobby?

525
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:28,754
Is that really you?

526
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,236
I've been waiting for you
a long time.

527
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,906
Well, I'm here now.

528
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:03,786
Promise
you'll never leave me again.

529
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:06,019
I promise.

530
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:33,302
I'm so tired.

531
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,225
I know you are.

532
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:40,870
Shawn can help.

533
00:33:42,134 --> 00:33:43,730
He can make you feel better.

534
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,697
Would you like that?

535
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,445
That would be nice.

536
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,656
You ready?

537
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:34,683
Kevin?

538
00:34:35,336 --> 00:34:36,557
I was so scared.

539
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:38,888
And sick.

540
00:34:40,032 --> 00:34:41,750
I hurt these people, didn't I?

541
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,018
It's all right.

542
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,962
You're better now.

543
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:48,375
And you're going to be
better from now on.

544
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:50,233
I'm so sorry.

545
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:52,134
We should go.

546
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,341
Wait.

547
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,626
They're not gonna remember
any of this, right?

548
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,020
Not if I don't want them to.

549
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,043
Backup's five minutes out.

550
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:22,488
We should go in now.

551
00:35:22,648 --> 00:35:24,390
- What?
- If we go in hot,

552
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,149
we'll be forcing Richard
to fight back.

553
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:28,642
And you was what he did to
the guardsmen outside Promise City.

554
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,362
You really think
you can talk him down?

555
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:31,558
It's worth a try.

556
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:46,633
I'm not gonna hurt him, Isabelle.

557
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:48,096
You have my word.

558
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:53,723
Richard.

559
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,347
Look, it's over, all right?

560
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:57,380
Dad?

561
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,341
We have to go, Isabelle.

562
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,319
Oh, boy.

563
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:47,999
You okay?

564
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:50,487
- Kyle?
- Yeah.

565
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:56,379
Diana, do me a favor,

566
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:58,020
make sure
everyone's okay out there.

567
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,638
And stall them
as long as you can, okay?

568
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:02,650
I'll see what I can do.

569
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:04,633
Where's your car?

570
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:06,111
- Out back.
- Come on.

571
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,183
NTAC doesn't know you're here.
This way.

572
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:11,645
But I'd stay off
the main roads just to be safe.

573
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,917
You're letting me go?

574
00:37:14,578 --> 00:37:15,959
Yeah, it looks that way.

575
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:19,241
You going to be able
to get back to Promise City?

576
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:20,676
I got out, didn't I?

577
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:22,277
Thanks, dad.

578
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:26,631
Okay, go. Just go.

579
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:31,963
Promise City?

580
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:35,207
That's the last place
I'd want to live.

581
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:37,581
I thought that you and Jordan
were close.

582
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,098
Not anymore.

583
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:40,440
He scares me.

584
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,277
He always has.

585
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:46,633
Yeah, this messiah
complex he's developed.

586
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,203
Very disturbing.

587
00:37:48,354 --> 00:37:50,125
And all this talk
about heaven and Earth,

588
00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:52,292
frankly, I don't buy it.

589
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:54,376
You guys can stay
here as long as you like.

590
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:56,712
Well, that would be wonderful,
but we're fugitives.

591
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,724
If they track us here,
you could be in a lot of trouble.

592
00:38:00,182 --> 00:38:01,882
That's a risk iI'm willing to take.

593
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,731
You can use
our medical facilities

594
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:05,213
to continue your research.

595
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:07,062
Find a way to make promicin safer.

596
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:09,100
Tell him, Kevin.

597
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:10,820
What?

598
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:14,146
It's really only
a theory at this point.

599
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:15,397
Well, I'd like to hear it.

600
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:18,660
Well, I'm putting together profiles
of the people

601
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,007
who have taken the shot,

602
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:22,371
the ones we know of anyway,
to see if I could discover

603
00:38:22,546 --> 00:38:24,676
why some survive
and others don't.

604
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:28,094
And the initial research

605
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:30,100
is promising.

606
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:32,968
Pretty soon, Kevin thinks
he'll be able to predict

607
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:35,238
who will survive the shot
and who won't.

608
00:38:35,702 --> 00:38:38,378
And if people know for certain
that promicin will kill them,

609
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,586
they won't take the shot.

610
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,521
And a lot less people would die.

611
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:51,492
Isabelle, did you hear
what I said to you?

612
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:57,004
You don't have to drink the rest of it
if you don't want to.

613
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,289
And if I don't, then what?

614
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:02,289
I start my life over
again as an eight-year-old?

615
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:04,416
We could go see Cora.

616
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:08,381
Maybe she could reverse
the process.

617
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:10,573
Age you back
to where you were.

618
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:16,905
That boy, Kyle,
risked his life to come find you.

619
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:18,999
Someone cares
that much about you.

620
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:21,673
It says a lot about him.

621
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:23,996
And about you.

622
00:39:36,118 --> 00:39:37,527
Maybe you have changed.

623
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,149
Maybe you're a different person now.

624
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,901
But you still want me to drink it,
don't you?

625
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,003
I just want us to have
more perfect days, Isabelle.

626
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:50,364
But like I said,
it's up to you now.

627
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:11,793
I'm scared.

628
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:20,562
I'm right here.

629
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:27,505
You know iI had him?

630
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,886
He was standing right there
in front of me, and I let him go.

631
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:34,535
What else could you do,
arrest him?

632
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:37,029
I thought if I ever
got him out of Promise City,

633
00:40:37,149 --> 00:40:38,743
that's exactly
what I would have done.

634
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,396
Or if I didn't want
to bring him into NTAC,

635
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:41,861
at least I would've
brought him back here

636
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,267
until I figured out a next step.

637
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:45,768
And what would you have done?
Locked Kyle in his bedroom?

638
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:48,273
He would've taken off the moment
you'd turn your back.

639
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,993
Tom, you had a choice
between Promise City and prison.

640
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:55,170
If it was my kid,
I would've done exactly the same thing.

641
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:58,367
Am I making you
feel any better at all?

642
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:00,888
Yeah.

643
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:02,297
Sorry.

644
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:04,773
Thank, by the way, for...

645
00:41:05,117 --> 00:41:07,183
for coming over here
and letting me ramble.

646
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:09,868
Sure.
We're friend, right?

647
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,228
Yeah.

648
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:13,708
Friends.

649
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,549
Okay, we're good friends.

650
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:23,136
Good friends.

651
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:29,312
- What?
- I felt something behind your ear.

652
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:31,035
- What?
- Turn around. Show me.

653
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:33,965
Your mole is back.

654
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:02,424
Daddy!

655
