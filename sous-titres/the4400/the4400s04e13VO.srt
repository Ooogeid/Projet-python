<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,073
I took the shot.
I'm fine.

5
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:50,670
Mom, what's wrong?

6
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:52,653
Someone help, please!
Mom!

7
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:54,330
Isabelle's in Promise City.

8
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:56,414
<i>As soon as she gets close
to Collier, she'll move.

9
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:57,881
<i>She knows
not to damage him, right?

10
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:59,809
For a while there,
I believed you'd changed.

11
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,268
- So did I.
- <i>We're not gonna make you

12
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,947
a martyr to your cause, Jordan,

13
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,093
we're going to make you
a traitor to it.

14
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:07,122
<i>Once you're marked,
you'll single-handedly

15
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:08,621
<i>destroy the movement
you created.

16
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:11,416
I don't know what lessons you
took in bodysnatching school, but...

17
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:13,002
you make
a terrible Tom Baldwin.

18
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:15,785
If we really want to kill
that thing inside him,

19
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,087
we're gonna have
to kill Tom, too.

20
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,310
- Don't make me shoot you.
- You going to fix me, Diana?

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,863
- Going to get your old Tom back?
- Goddamn it, Tom, stop!

22
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:37,502
Oh, my god, Tom?

23
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:39,375
He pulled a gun.
I had to fire.

24
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,182
- Where's Shawn?
- He's waiting in the car. I'll get him.

25
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:42,278
We can't do it here.

26
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:44,261
He's in bad shape.
We have to move him.

27
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:48,928
Uncle Tommy?

28
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:52,364
I need to heal him now.
He's losing blood too fast.

29
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:53,676
Not yet.
That's not Tom.

30
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,534
We need to get rid of that thing
inside of him first.

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,608
- Everybody out.
- Here's the polonium...

32
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,026
We need to inject it
directly into his spine.

33
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:05,976
I can't lie to you, Tom,
this is going to hurt.

34
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:09,342
But it's going to kill
that thing inside you.

35
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,696
We lost pulse.

36
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:31,112
Mom?

37
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,159
Is she dead?
Is my mom dead?

38
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,494
We don't know yet.
Sir, you need to let us work.

39
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:37,663
You can wait inside.

40
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:47,077
You did everything
you could.

41
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,087
I think you need to prepare yourself
for some bad news.

42
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,659
- Your mom's a textbook case.
- A textbook case of what?

43
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:54,402
- Promicin death.
- No...

44
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:56,211
She landed
on the wrong side of 50-50.

45
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,703
My mom didn't take the shot!

46
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:01,485
Are you okay?

47
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,052
Sir?

48
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,388
Are you okay? Help!
Wait... Sir!

49
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:24,916
Come on, uncle Tom.

50
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:34,633
Dammit!

51
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:38,235
I can't.

52
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:40,332
It's too late.

53
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:10,641
I think I killed people.

54
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,268
I think I killed people, Diana.

55
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:17,318
We can talk about that later.

56
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:19,534
Right now,
you need to rest.

57
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:26,039
Don't know what happened.

58
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,906
I was talking to the guy
and he collapsed.

59
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,822
Kind of like what
happened with my mom.

60
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,368
Mr. Farrell...

61
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,434
I need some information.

62
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:37,417
Do you know who your mother's
insurance carrier is?

63
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:38,541
No.

64
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,875
Ma'am?

65
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:44,608
Oh, my god, ma'am!

66
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,069
Somebody!

67
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:10,807
Are you okay?

73
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,023
What happened?

74
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:33,823
I can barely
remember anything.

75
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:36,057
And the few things I do,
they're all...

76
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,386
They're all bad.

77
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,244
How am I supposed to live
with what I did?

78
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:44,344
How can I even be positive
that thing is gone?

79
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:47,198
Well, we're going to
watch over you until we're sure.

80
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:50,017
You're going to
recover yourself,

81
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,563
and when you do,
you'll tell us who the Marked are.

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,670
All of them.

83
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:58,288
And after that,
whatever you did...

84
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,926
We'll deal with it, okay?

85
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:07,562
Nobody's getting into
or out of St. Ambrose.

86
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:09,552
Seattle police have it
under strict quarantine

87
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:11,719
and we have tactical agents
reinforcing them.

88
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,040
No one knows exactly
what happened in there yet, but...

89
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,556
I did manage to get on the phone
with a doctor who's trapped inside,

90
00:07:16,656 --> 00:07:18,621
and he has personally seen
dozens of deaths.

91
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,618
How is that possible? There's no way
all those people took the shot.

92
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:24,573
Maybe someone's going around
injecting patients, like...

93
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,103
an orderly or a doctor.

94
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:28,195
No, it'd take time to force the shot
on all those people.

95
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:31,002
- This is spreading way too fast.
- What if it's a virus?

96
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,490
You know,
someone took the shot,

97
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,366
and the ability they developed
is to spread promicin like...

98
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:36,532
I don't know, the flu.

99
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,153
- God...
- Well, if that's true,

100
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,586
we have more than just a bunch
of victims on our hands.

101
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:42,994
50-50. For everyone who died
in that hospital,

102
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:46,136
someone else survived, Someone
who'll develop a brand new ability.

103
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:48,758
How many people do you think
are trapped inside that hospital?

104
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,582
500?
1000?

105
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:53,305
Whatever the number,
we'll deal with it,

106
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,468
but at least there haven't been
any reports of deaths

107
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,719
outside the hospital.

108
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,042
Your brother danny's outside.

109
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,607
Tell him to come in.

110
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,230
I can't.

111
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:09,094
He's out in the gardens,
and he won't come inside.

112
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:11,493
It's a little strange,
to be honest.

113
00:08:11,593 --> 00:08:13,244
He's not letting anybody
near him.

114
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:26,577
What's going on?
You're making everybody nervous.

115
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,224
Everyone's dying, Shawn.

116
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:32,113
- Everyone around me is dying.
- What are you talking about?

117
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,338
That hospital?

118
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,265
I killed all those people.

119
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,572
Danny, what do you mean?
How? What?

120
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:38,675
It's the shot.

121
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:40,608
My ability.

122
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,545
I think I'm infecting people
with promicin.

123
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,350
And I don't know
what to do.

124
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,196
I've been hiding out
all night in a park,

125
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:50,129
and I can't even turn myself in
without making more people sick.

126
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:54,507
Okay, you can't infect anyone
who's already promicin positive, right?

127
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:55,653
I don't think so.

128
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,779
So you're going to come inside.
I'm going to clear everyone else

129
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:58,979
out of the building.

130
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,840
Dr. Burkhoff can probably get his hands
on some of the inhibitor.

131
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,759
Come inside.
We're going to suppress your ability.

132
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:10,126
We'll figure this out together.

133
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Okay?

134
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:14,763
Come on...

135
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:19,779
Mom's dead, Shawn.

136
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:22,472
What?

137
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:25,114
It happened last night.

138
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,466
It was my fault.
I killed her.

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,333
I'm sorry, Shawn.

140
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,149
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,549
I didn't mean to hurt her.

142
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,043
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

143
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:50,903
I wanted you to hear something
while you're still you.

144
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,721
When Kyle brought me to you,
I wasn't lying.

145
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:56,242
I really did want to change.

146
00:09:58,094 --> 00:09:59,094
I tried,

147
00:10:01,115 --> 00:10:03,165
but I'm not meant to lead
a normal life,

148
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:05,500
and it was stupid
to think I could.

149
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:08,310
Isabelle, everyone is in charge
of their own destiny.

150
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:11,158
You may not have liked
the choices you had.

151
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:13,291
Still, you made one.

152
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:15,028
I was created to do a job.

153
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:17,612
I fought it for a while, but...

154
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,813
now I know
I have to do what they want.

155
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:24,531
Kill me.

156
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:27,475
Kill me right now.

157
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,910
Don't let them use me
to end this movement.

158
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,615
You were told
not to speak to Collier.

159
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,777
Don't worry.
It won't happen again.

160
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:46,716
Because I'm ready
to get out of here.

161
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:48,098
You've got collier.

162
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:50,283
I did what you asked me to do.

163
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:52,419
Now you can let
my father go.

164
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,875
No.

165
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,381
Not yet.

166
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:58,087
Your father will be released

167
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:00,597
when everything's arranged
exactly as we want it.

168
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:02,114
That is not what we agreed to.

169
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,761
I don't really feel
like arguing about it.

170
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,751
I like having
my abilities back.

171
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,601
I'll go get
my father myself.

172
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:10,568
I don't think so, Isabelle.

173
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:14,985
I think you're forgetting.

174
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:17,732
We took out a little
insurance policy on you

175
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:18,962
while you were in prison.

176
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,296
You remember that kill switch
that Tom told you about?

177
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,230
You're feeling it right now.

178
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:27,922
If you insist on disobeying us,
I won't hesitate to use it...

179
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:29,176
Fully.

180
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,693
<i>I wanna make a statement on behalf
of everyone who lives in Promise City.

181
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:37,598
We had nothing to do

182
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:40,398
with the deaths
at St. Ambrose hospital.

183
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,611
Forcing people to take promicin
goes against everything...

184
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,677
Jordan Collier stands for.

185
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:50,111
If Jordan were here,
he would tell you himself.

186
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,319
But, unfortunately,
he is missing.

187
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:56,077
He was abducted
by enemies of the movement.

188
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:00,509
We are working to find him,
but while we do,

189
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:02,795
we'd like to extend
a gesture of goodwill

190
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:04,045
to the city of Seattle.

191
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,892
The residents of Promise City...

192
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:10,117
are already promicin positive.

193
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:12,873
We're not vulnerable
to what's happening in the hospital.

194
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:16,206
We'd like to offer our services
to the authorities.

195
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,734
<i>We will not move out into the city
without an invitation,

196
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,383
<i>but we do stand ready
to help.

197
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:25,561
<i>All the government
has to do is ask.

198
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,700
So, ready to hand over
control of the city to Collier's army?

199
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,392
We might need them
before this is over.

200
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,359
I'm not sure, Meghan.
I didn't even know Collier was missing

201
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,467
until just now.

202
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:36,089
Has Tom been able
to tell you anything?

203
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:41,111
Let me know if he starts to remember.
I'll call you if anything changes here.

204
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:43,610
<i>Everything's gone silent
within St. Ambrose

205
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,823
<i>and we just had word
that authorities

206
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:48,675
<I>are considering sending in
the first relief team.

207
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:50,772
How would you like to have
that job, huh?

208
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,823
- How are things at the hospital?
- It's quiet.

209
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:55,049
Whatever happened in there,
I think it's over.

210
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,911
At least, the screaming has stopped.

211
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Guys...

212
00:12:58,623 --> 00:12:59,640
Look at this.

213
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,939
<i>Authorities tell us that...

214
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,217
- What just happened there?
- I'm not sure.

215
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:16,806
We need to talk
to the agents on site, right now.

216
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,987
They told us
it was contained.

217
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,453
Everybody,
get away from her!

218
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,082
Get away from her.

219
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,656
We need to
seal this place off, now!

220
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,792
It's not fair.

221
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:40,938
I didn't even take the shot.

222
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,012
Ok! Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

223
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,046
I was five feet from him...

224
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,666
and I lived.

225
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,140
It doesn't seem right.

226
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,875
What's going to
happen to us now?

227
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,498
I mean, everyone
who survived...

228
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:04,532
are we going to
develop abilities?

229
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,223
You two okay?

230
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:11,526
What's going on out there?

231
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:12,964
We're picking up the pieces.

232
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:15,979
The worst is over,
for us, anyway.

233
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:18,738
Someone must have gotten out
of that hospital

234
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,115
and infected everyone
on the perimeter.

235
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:21,772
The sickness is spreading
through the neighborhood

236
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:22,914
near St. Ambrose.

237
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,492
And the police,
emergency services,

238
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:26,299
their people must have
brought the virus back

239
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,492
from the barricade, too.
They've been devastated.

240
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:30,416
So who's watching over the city?

241
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:31,530
Right now, no one.

242
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:33,697
The army has Seattle surrounded.

243
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:36,074
The entire district
is under quarantine.

244
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:38,128
How far is this thing
going to spread?

245
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:40,841
We don't know.
But right now,

246
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:44,366
I want to keep focused on this building.
Marco, we gave everyone promicin tests.

247
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,666
- Have the results come in yet?
- Yeah, um...

248
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,709
They're preliminary, but...

249
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:51,030
It looks like everyone
who survived is positive.

250
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,140
Except for one person.

251
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:55,565
You.

252
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,102
Me?

253
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:58,986
Why?

254
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,269
It's just a guess, but...

255
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:06,250
you know, last year, Dr. Burkhoff forced
an early version of promicin on you.

256
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,108
You didn't get an ability, but...

257
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,533
it looks like your body developed
a resistance to promicin exposure.

258
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,740
There's no chance
that I could infect anybody?

259
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,590
No.
I mean, I don't think so.

260
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,919
How do you feel?

261
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:20,554
Tired.

262
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,667
What did you give me?

263
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:26,204
I included a sedative in the sample of
the inhibitor I mixed up.

264
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:28,938
We won't know
if your ability's suppressed for...

265
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,276
a few hours.

266
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:31,809
I don't want to sleep.

267
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,459
I want to help.

268
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,554
There's nothing
you can do right now.

269
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:37,271
Just close your eyes, buddy.

270
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,252
Have you given any thought

271
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:53,648
to what you want to do?

272
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:55,804
I'm gonna give Danny to NTAC.

273
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,171
I think I have to.

274
00:15:58,607 --> 00:15:59,657
I think so, too.

275
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:02,493
They have to study your brother.

276
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,793
He may be the only way
to find an antidote.

277
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,681
Once the government has him,

278
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:08,414
who knows
if they'll ever let him go.

279
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:11,931
I don't want to lose my brother
and my mom on the same day.

280
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,487
Jesus, my mom is gone...

281
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,484
The virus got into city hall.

282
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:34,993
The mayor's down,
half the city council,

283
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:36,784
police, paramedics.

284
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:39,068
People are abandoning
their posts in droves.

285
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,299
I think we need to take
Kyle Baldwin up on his offer,

286
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,515
see if his positives
can't restore some order.

287
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,031
Are you ready
to cross that line?

288
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:47,386
We don't have a choice.

289
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:49,310
The federal government
is focused on containment.

290
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,085
They're basically
writing Seattle off.

291
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:52,982
We can't let that happen.

292
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:55,661
I'm going to Promise City.

293
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,318
Well, you can't just
drive across town. Let me go.

294
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,426
I'm the one who's supposed to be
resistant to this thing.

295
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,710
That's why you're going
to the 4400 center.

296
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:04,079
You could be the key
to ending this.

297
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:06,378
If someone could figure out
why you're not vulnerable,

298
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:08,820
maybe they could replicate the effect
and create a vaccine.

299
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,529
Okay, well,
we're not doing it,

300
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,308
Because NTAC medical's
shut down.

301
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:15,313
Shawn farrell is not developing
that compatibility test on his own.

302
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:18,700
Someone is doing the research,
someone with a scientific background.

303
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,162
Someone like Kevin Burkhoff.

304
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:21,863
My sister's dead.

305
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,875
That was shawn.
Susan was in that hospital. She's dead.

306
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,236
Oh, my god, Tom.

307
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:28,676
I'm so sorry.

308
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:32,927
You should lie down.

309
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:36,177
I can't imagine
what you're feeling now.

310
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,823
No, no, I'll mourn later.

311
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:41,420
Where'd you put my gun?

312
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,107
I remember it all now.
Everything.

313
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,650
The marked have Jordan Collier.
I know where they're keeping him.

314
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,221
OK, tell us where he is,
and I'll put together a task force.

315
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,906
It has to be me. Isabelle's there.
She has her abilities back.

316
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:53,457
They think I'm one of them.
I'll walk in, I'll get Collier,

317
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,255
I can find out what they're planning
next. Let me do this, please.

318
00:17:57,194 --> 00:17:58,358
I have to.

319
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:10,545
I've been authorized to accept
your offer of assistance.

320
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:12,935
What did you have in mind?

321
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,546
We need to restore order
to the streets.

322
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:19,530
I would like to use your people
as a temporary security force.

323
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:21,934
The first thing we need to do

324
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,559
is write a list of all the abilities
at your disposal.

325
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,274
Then we can figure out
how to deploy them.

326
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:30,631
Look, there's no reason to make a plan.
Jordan already has one in place.

327
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,709
I know exactly what we have
at our disposal,

328
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,831
and I know where to send them
to take control of the city.

329
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:41,265
I'm glad you're so prepared
to take over Seattle,

330
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:44,680
but when this is over,
I want my city back.

331
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:49,931
The whole world is terrified
of what's happening here.

332
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:51,362
That's an opportunity.

333
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:52,649
Once this is over,

334
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:54,948
we use all our influence,
here and abroad,

335
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:57,307
and push for all-out
war against the positives.

336
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,505
This time, we will be heard.

337
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:01,239
Yes.

338
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:02,654
Great.

339
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,410
Funny how things happen.

340
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:07,517
You've got Collier,
but you're losing Seattle.

341
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,048
You're wrong.

342
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:12,199
I'm not going to stand by
and watch a militia

343
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:14,707
of positives
take command of this city.

344
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,580
We thought the movement would
fall apart. Once we had Collier,

345
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:18,960
but that didn't happen.

346
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,449
Someone stepped in and took his place.

347
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:23,880
- You're talking about Kyle?
- That's right.

348
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:25,739
He has to be stopped.

349
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:27,726
You have to stop him.

350
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:30,496
You're going back
into Promise City

351
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,803
and you're going
to kill Kyle Baldwin.

352
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:38,305
Kyle's your only real connection

353
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:42,715
to your past, this idea of yourself
that you've been hanging onto.

354
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,718
Once he's gone, you'll let it go.

355
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,366
You want him dead.
I'm your weapon.

356
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,655
I get it.

357
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:59,145
You've been out of contact
for a long time.

358
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:01,210
- Where have you been?
- I was doing damage control.

359
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,131
Skouris has been telling people
I'm marked.

360
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:04,352
Do they believe her?

361
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:06,511
My boss doesn't.

362
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,391
Meghan Doyle cares about Tom Baldwin.

363
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:09,747
I brought her around.

364
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:11,764
Anyway, their hands are full.

365
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:13,453
The virus got into NTAC.

366
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:15,275
It killed Baldwin's sister, too.

367
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,682
I had to shed a few tears
just for appearance's sake.

368
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:21,606
This thing has gotten out of control.

369
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:23,399
Half of NTAC is developing
new abilities.

370
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:24,670
How are we responding?

371
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:26,375
Collier's been marked.

372
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:29,329
We're waiting for him to turn.

373
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,312
In the meantime,
I sent Isabelle to Promise City,

374
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:35,343
to deal with the new
leader of the movement,

375
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:37,638
Kyle Baldwin.

376
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:43,720
Good.

377
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:49,096
Your body produces
abnormal amounts

378
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:51,710
of an enzyme
called Ubiquinone.

379
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:54,727
It's a compound that
boosts the immune system,

380
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:59,584
and overproduction of it
made you resistant to promicin.

381
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,850
If we replicate that effect,
can we make a vaccine?

382
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,848
People are dying right now.
We don't have time

383
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:08,533
to mass-produce some enzyme
and get it to people.

384
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,763
We don't have to
mass-produce anything.

385
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:14,303
Ubiquinone is already
available as a supplement.

386
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:17,077
They sell it in pills in health
food stores, pharmacies.

387
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,997
If you take enough of them,
can you develop a resistance quickly?

388
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:24,792
I just checked in on your brother.
He doesn't look good.

389
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:30,133
We have to get word
out about these pills.

390
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,512
You go.
I'll start making phone calls.

391
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,558
The inhibitor is working.

392
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:39,854
You're no longer contagious,

393
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,149
but your body is still
producing promicin, and...

394
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:49,698
since it can no longer disperse it
into the air via your ability,

395
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:52,528
it's building up in your system.

396
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:54,544
I'm choking on the stuff.

397
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:57,243
It's all right, Danny,
we're going to figure it out.

398
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:58,947
So, what can we do to help him?

399
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:04,045
We could take him off the inhibitor.

400
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,644
Physically, he'd be fine.

401
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,325
But I'd be contagious again.

402
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,563
- Exactly.
- No way.

403
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,475
- That's not an option.
- Danny!

404
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:14,664
No, Shawn.

405
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,903
What happens
if I stay on the inhibitor?

406
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,877
You saying I'll die?

407
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,525
I'm getting you out of here.

408
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,853
That thing inside you.
There's a way to get rid of it.

409
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:46,294
How?

410
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:48,856
You can worry about that
once you're out of here.

411
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:51,133
No matter what happens to me,
don't stop

412
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:53,911
until you're through the front door.
My car's right outside.

413
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:56,701
If anything happens to me,
you need to call Kyle right away.

414
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:58,874
Parrish sent Isabelle after him.

415
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,240
If you're an NTAC agent again,

416
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,431
what happens once we're outta here?

417
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:06,051
You mean, am I going to arrest you?

418
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,502
I'd love to,
but that's not the plan.

419
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:11,790
As much as it hurts me to admit it,
this city needs you right now.

420
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,878
Are you ready?

421
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:38,414
You flinched when I told you
Isabelle was going after your son.

422
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:41,801
No one's ever managed
to get rid of a mark before.

423
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:43,873
You're going to have
to tell me how you did it.

424
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,328
Later.

425
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,784
All our teams are in place.
We already have Ravenna under control.

426
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:49,915
Beacon Hill's quiet, too.

427
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:52,135
Good, let's move some of
your people into Northgate.

428
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:54,418
See if we can stop the looting.
We can't start distributing

429
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,945
these Ubiquinone supplements
until the city is calm.

430
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,575
Hi, Kyle.

431
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,170
Close your eyes.

432
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:27,387
No.

433
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:30,809
If you're going to do
what I think you are,

434
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,428
you have to look me in the eye.

435
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:14,895
You couldn't kill me.

436
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:17,561
You're human.

437
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,132
There's so much of
the world that I never saw.

438
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:23,786
So much that's beautiful.

439
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:27,601
You have time.

440
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,573
You can see whatever you want.

441
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:31,393
We can.

442
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:35,005
You have a good heart, Kyle.

443
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,519
Goodbye.

444
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:03,447
These pills are the way that
we can stop anyone else from dying.

445
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:05,952
I'm proud to say
that the 4400 center

446
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:07,910
is working in conjunction
with the government

447
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,575
and residents of Promise City

448
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:11,810
to distribute this
over-the-counter product

449
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,744
to every neighborhood in Seattle.

450
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:17,272
If you haven't already been infected,
these will either save your life,

451
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,349
or they will keep you
from getting an ability.

452
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:22,068
The goverment is also working
with relief agencies

453
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:24,972
to air-lift supplies
of Ubiquinone into the city,

454
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:26,972
so there'll be enough for everyone.

455
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,584
People are wondering what
seattle is going to look like

456
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:31,607
when this is all over,
how many people...

457
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:33,490
will have lost their lives,

458
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:36,872
how a city with so many unwanted
new abilities Is going to function.

459
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:38,695
The truth is,

460
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,336
we don't have any answers,

461
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,707
but this city has survived a lot,

462
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:45,731
and it will survive this.

463
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:49,629
Thank you all for coming.
You risked a lot to get this message out

464
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:51,379
and do not forget
to take your pills.

465
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:54,635
Shawn... Thank you.

466
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:57,843
None of this is going to mean anything
unless that air-lift happens right away.

467
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:00,019
We're working on it.
I'm coordinating distribution

468
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,727
between the CDC, FEMA
and the Red Cross.

469
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:05,266
Look, I know that you're
dealing with a lot,

470
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:07,028
but you helped keep this contained,

471
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:09,695
and you were the right face
to put in front of the public.

472
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,570
Yeah, buddy, I'm right here.

473
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,215
It really hurts.

474
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:29,327
It hurts to breathe.

475
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:35,493
I'm going to fix that.

476
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,910
- Make you feel better for a little bit.
- No...

477
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:39,958
Don't.

478
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,452
You did that an hour ago.

479
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:44,114
Look at me.

480
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:46,450
Danny...

481
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:48,425
we're going to take
you off the inhibitor,

482
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:50,581
and we're going to put you
in isolation...

483
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,336
- It's too dangerous.
- Not anymore.

484
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:53,874
We know about those pills now.

485
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:55,774
What if they don't work around me?

486
00:27:57,027 --> 00:27:59,872
Or what if in a week from now,
my ability gets stronger?

487
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,376
The whole thing could start again.

488
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:05,736
Too many people are
dead because of me, Shawn.

489
00:28:06,674 --> 00:28:07,792
It's not your fault.

490
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,404
I know, but I have to live with it.

491
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:18,571
I'm not going to make
it through this, Shawn.

492
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:20,393
I know it.

493
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:22,563
You're not going to die, Danny.

494
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:25,013
- I'm not going to let you.
- It's okay.

495
00:28:27,128 --> 00:28:28,940
But I need you
to do something for me.

496
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,710
Just make it stop hurting.

497
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,945
Just make the pain go away
for good, okay?

498
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:38,452
Oh, Danny, no,
I'm not going to do that.

499
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:40,908
I'm not going to do that.
You're my little brother.

500
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,872
Then I'm begging you, brother.

501
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:45,309
- Don't.
- Please, Shawn.

502
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:48,706
Let me be the last victim.

503
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:52,340
Please do it.

504
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:54,330
Please...

505
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,208
Please, Shawn, I beg you.

506
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:04,771
Please, shawn, do it.

507
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,085
I love you.

508
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,734
Please! I can't breathe.

509
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:44,484
You made your choice.

510
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:47,320
You were our only hope
for the future!

511
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:49,478
Your future's dead now.

512
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,901
You're free now.

513
00:31:38,288 --> 00:31:40,298
Make this world
better than it is.

514
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:02,732
You understand what you have to do
to get rid of that thing inside you?

515
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,445
You'll have to mend fences
with Shawn.

516
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,427
Well, I'm more than willing.
I hope he will be, too.

517
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:10,715
Jordan...

518
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:12,471
there's one more thing.

519
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:15,326
There's seven names there.
The rest of the marked.

520
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:17,495
They're going to need
the same treatment you get.

521
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,631
These are powerful people.

522
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:24,071
That's why NTAC can't handle it.

523
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:26,728
We'd never be able to get
them through official channels.

524
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,193
I can't help but wonder
when we walk back into the city,

525
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:34,839
who's going to be in charge,

526
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:36,933
my side or yours?

527
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:40,906
I think, soon...

528
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:43,544
that distinction
won't mean a thing.

529
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:48,640
Be well, Tom.

530
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:03,368
We are gathered here
today to pay our respects

531
00:33:03,468 --> 00:33:05,221
to Susan and Danny Farrell,

532
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,906
a wonderful mother
and a loving son.

533
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:09,399
They will be missed,

534
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,939
as will so many others.

535
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:13,823
The entire city is
grief-stricken today.

536
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:16,734
We're all asking ourselves
the same question...

537
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:20,436
Are we going to deal with
all this lost, all this pain?

538
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,351
But I believe that in that question,

539
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:25,140
relies our answer to salvation.

540
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:28,049
Because it is a shared lost,
it is a shared pain,

541
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,460
that only together,
with your sympathy,

542
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,687
with your understanding,
with your love,

543
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,902
we could realize all this tragedy.

544
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:03,314
Shawn, I'm sorry.

545
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,176
I'm so sorry, man.

546
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:18,538
Thank you.

547
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:22,440
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

548
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:25,139
Jordan told me everything
that happened.

549
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:27,194
You okay?

550
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:29,663
Yeah, I'll get there...

551
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:34,324
And I know you cared about Isabelle.
I'm sorry she's gone.

552
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:48,139
I know how you're feeling
right now, Shawn.

553
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,514
You're thinking that everyone's gone,
that you're alone.

554
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:53,602
But you're not.

555
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:55,630
I'm here.

556
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:57,425
So's Kyle,

557
00:34:57,815 --> 00:34:59,942
And we're going to help
each other get through this.

558
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,379
We're going to figure out
how to be a family, okay?

559
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,923
I just got a revised
estimate of the tally so far.

560
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:22,434
We know the city's
lost 9,000 people.

561
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,043
That's just confirmed dead.
It's not a final count.

562
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:30,252
So we're looking at 9,000
new abilities at the very least.

563
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,984
A lot of those abilities are gonna
belong to people we know.

564
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:34,940
NTAC, police, paramedics.

565
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:37,618
I mean, we were the first
ones exposed to this thing.

566
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:39,435
What are we gonna do,
arrest ourselves?

567
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,022
No one's arresting anybody right now.

568
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:43,313
Every city agency's
operating on a skeleton crew,

569
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,088
and we won't have federal
help until they lift the quarantine.

570
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:47,946
That'll be a week, maybe more.

571
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:49,505
So we're still on our own.

572
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,217
The loudest voice
of authority in Seattle

573
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,920
right now is Jordan Collier's.

574
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:57,336
Well, his p-positives are the most
effective law and order we've got.

575
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,972
And when quarantine's lifted,
what happens?

576
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,340
Are Collier's people gonna stand down?
Will they give the city back to us?

577
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:05,128
Would you?

578
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,370
The time has come...

579
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,576
for this city to begin healing.

580
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:55,236
I never intended...

581
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:57,424
promicin to spread this way,

582
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:01,073
but the sacrifices
of the past few days

583
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:03,256
have not been in vain!

584
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,922
This tragedy,

585
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:08,410
terrible as it may have been,

586
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,570
had meaning,

587
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,220
and those who died...

588
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,679
are the heralds of a new age!

589
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:32,766
Thousands upon thousands
of you have new abilities,

590
00:37:33,842 --> 00:37:36,668
and in time, you will all
contribute to this movement,

591
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:38,867
a movement...

592
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,951
that now claims all Seattle
as its home!

593
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,363
Who are you?

594
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:45,792
I'm Jed Garrity.
Who the hell are you?

595
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:25,963
We stood by the city...

596
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:28,263
in its hour of need,

597
00:39:29,407 --> 00:39:32,881
and we will now guide
this city into the future.

598
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,135
<i>We're all miracles.</i>

599
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:37,474
<i>Every one of us,</i>

600
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,963
<i>and together,</i>
<i>we will do wondrous things.</i>

601
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:44,240
See?
I told you he was a good guy.

602
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,257
Maia, can't you see
what's happening?

603
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,031
Jordan Collier is naming himself
dictator of Seattle.

604
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:54,785
There's nothing good about that.

605
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:56,981
You're wrong, mom.

606
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:00,311
We're in charge now.

607
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,650
It's better that way.

608
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,416
I've spoken to the world before...

609
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:11,008
of heaven on Earth.

610
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:13,429
Many of you thought it impossible,

611
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,258
But now,

612
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,587
I'm convinced...

613
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:21,290
we will see it in our lifetimes!

614
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:02,881
There's a way to live with it.

615
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:06,677
You killed people.

616
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:10,855
Even though it wasn't really you,
you still feel responsible.

617
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:12,450
Believe me, I have been there.

618
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:15,401
2 people are dead. They're not Collier.
They're not coming back.

619
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,138
But you're still here.

620
00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:19,979
You have to figure out
how to move on.

621
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:25,946
How?

622
00:41:41,344 --> 00:41:42,677
Dad, it's time.

623
00:42:07,749 --> 00:42:08,641
