00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,226
The world will have to
deal with us.

00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:46,846
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:48,612
These shots are free.

5
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:50,454
Give them to anyone
who wants them,

6
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,733
but be careful
to explain the risks.

7
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:57,727
I couldn't save her.

8
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,494
There are no guarantees.

9
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,385
There never are.

10
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:05,390
Cassie... Dunlevy.

11
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,036
Maybe I'll see you around.

12
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:08,868
You ever go visit
your cousin, Shawn?

13
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:09,968
Is he getting any better?

14
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:12,968
Maybe someone should try injecting him
with a big old dose of promicin.

15
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:15,523
It'd be like giving him
a jump start, right?

16
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:21,482
Ever since the 4400 came back,

17
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,740
it's been one sacrifice
after another.

18
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:25,823
It has to stop.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,973
It worked, right?
I'm not dead.

20
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:31,473
Not this time, no.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,990
Next time,
you might not be so fortunate.

22
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:36,465
They told you to kill me.
You didn't do it.

23
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:38,856
You ever think maybe
that's why your girlfriend is gone?

24
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:41,998
I know you've been looking
for Alana for three months.

25
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,465
You must have considered the possibility
that she was abducted again.

26
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,516
I'm sorry, I...

27
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,283
I didn't see you there.

28
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,724
Excuse me,
how did you get in here?

29
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,207
I don't understand.

30
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,439
This is too weird.
I'm getting off.

31
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:25,089
Excuse me.
I need to get out of here.

32
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:28,310
I need to get out of here.

33
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:29,626
No, please...

34
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:34,526
No, I can't handle tight spaces!
I can't breathe!

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,543
I got to get out of here!

36
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:39,417
Get me out of here, please,
I can't breathe!

37
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:41,351
Help me, I can't breathe!

38
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:44,858
I can't breathe!

39
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,450
Help me, please, I can't...

40
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:47,724
I can't...

41
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,469
Leave me alone!

42
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:07,805
He's...

43
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:09,364
He's going to kill me!

44
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,916
Leave me alone!

45
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,399
Stop, please!

46
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,866
Leave me alone!

47
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,986
- Hey...
- Hello, Tom.

48
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,286
I heard about your sister.
I figured you might be showing up.

49
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:55,295
- Ben and Maia with you?
- No, they're in spain,

50
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:58,247
which is where I'll be as soon as
I figure out what happened to april.

51
00:03:58,347 --> 00:03:59,551
You working any leads?

52
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:01,409
No one's seen
or spoken to her in months.

53
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,367
I don't even know
if she's alive or dead.

54
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:05,888
Just because she got her hands
on a promicin shot,

55
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:08,438
- doesn't mean she took it.
- This is April we're talking about.

56
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,355
If she got the shot,
she took it.

57
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:12,712
Look...

58
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:16,161
if there's anything I can do,
anything you need,

59
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,727
you just say the word.

60
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:19,744
Actually,

61
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:23,057
I was hoping you could tell me
a little bit about your new boss.

62
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:25,724
Meghan Doyle?
She's young, inexperienced,

63
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,478
think-tank smart. Spends a lot of time
in the theory room. Why?

64
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:32,205
I was thinking about asking
for temporary reinstatement.

65
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,569
Just hoping access
to NTAC's resources

66
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:35,933
will speed up my search.

67
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,360
I'm not sure she'll go for
the temporary assignment.

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,886
Then I guess I'll just have to tell her
that I'm back for good.

69
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:41,992
So you're going to lie?

70
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:44,669
This is my sister.
I'll do whatever it takes.

71
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:48,727
I'm so sorry for
dumping all this on you.

72
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,576
Because I know you've got other things
on your mind. Any news on Alana?

73
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,613
I have to admit that the resemblance
is striking,

74
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:04,312
and there's nothing about her
in any of these art books?

75
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,412
All I know is that from june
to september, 1885,

76
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:10,895
Claude Pierrot painted six portraits
of a woman named Alana.

77
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,849
Who she was,
what happened to her afterwards,

78
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,442
is all a blank, but that...

79
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:17,532
That's her, Diana,
that's Alana.

80
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:19,221
You think they sent her
back into the past

81
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:21,986
as some kind of punishment
for you not killing Isabelle?

82
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:25,300
I think the future gave her to me
and the future took her away.

83
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:28,195
I guess there's no way
of ever finding out.

84
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,478
Maybe there is.

85
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,312
I know how to contact the future,
I've done it before.

86
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:37,895
Please, tell me you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

87
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:45,427
I will always be grateful for you
for getting Maia back,

88
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:48,668
but you attempted suicide.
The only reason they saved you last time

89
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:51,176
was because they needed you.
That's not the case this time.

90
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,476
It's been three months.
I don't know what else to do.

91
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:55,501
Wherever Alana is,
whatever happened to her,

92
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:57,101
she does not want you dead.

93
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:06,903
Yeah. Baldwin.

94
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,303
Don't let them get me!

95
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,769
Please,
they're going to kill me!

96
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,485
What you're looking at
is a highly elevated fear response.

97
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,677
In Mr. Kopelow's case,
it's a fear of clowns.

98
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,386
But to have that kind of reaction,
doesn't there need to be...

99
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,685
You know,
actual clowns?

100
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,819
That's what makes these cases
so unusual.

101
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,843
There's no
external stimuli present.

102
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:27,785
How many cases
are we talking about?

103
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,327
Eight in the last two hours,

104
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,010
which is why I called you.

105
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:35,230
We all have things
that we're afraid of...

106
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:37,543
insects, heights,
but we learn how to cope with them.

107
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:40,110
In these people,
those coping mechanisms are turned off.

108
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,343
They've seen their worst fears
come to life.

109
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,743
And you think
a 4400 ability's behind this?

110
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:47,166
Someone or something
is turning their...

111
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:50,042
preexisting fears
into unmanageable phobias.

112
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,430
- Excuse me.
- Well, eight cases in two hours.

113
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,997
I'd say someone's been
pretty busy.

114
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:57,730
For all we know,
they're just getting started.

120
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,526
You think one of my employees
drove those people crazy?

121
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,355
All we know is that
5 of our 8 victims

122
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:03,063
had receipts
from your branch's ATM.

123
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:05,727
According to the transaction slips,
they all used the machine

124
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:08,118
some time between 7:12 and 7:28
this morning.

125
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:09,760
The bank isn't even
open then.

126
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,143
That means no one on my staff
is responsible, right?

127
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,614
We're still going to need everyone

128
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:15,609
to submit to a promicin test,
just to be sure.

129
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:19,234
Look at this.

130
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,500
Max Kopelow.

131
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,278
And look who's right behind him
in line... Jacqui Glendon.

132
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:26,808
Our claustrophobia victim.

133
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,404
Check this out. There's no audio,
but looks like there's

134
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:32,379
some kind of commotion just outside
of camera range, right there.

135
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,328
- What do you think?
- We'll need a list of

136
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,145
everyone who used
that ATM this morning.

137
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:37,965
- I can get you that.
- Great.

138
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,671
Hey, sleeping beauty.

139
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:46,688
How does it feel to be awake?

140
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:48,171
It feels
pretty good.

141
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:49,834
They're kicking me
out of here today.

142
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:52,053
You going home?
That's fantastic.

143
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,586
It'll make those media hounds
outside very happy.

144
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:57,029
I might disappoint them
and sneak out the back.

145
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,153
I don't know.

146
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,874
I cannot believe how much catching up
I have to do.

147
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,058
So much...

148
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,874
crazy stuff has happened
the last three months.

149
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,210
Change is painful.
It comes with a cost.

150
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:10,794
You're quoting
Jordan Collier now?

151
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:12,894
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

152
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:17,802
I didn't think
he'd go through with it,

153
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,585
hand out all the promicin?

154
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:20,977
He knew what would happen.

155
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,911
He knew it would kill
all of those people.

156
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,494
And I feel bad for those people,

157
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:29,911
but I've seen promicin
do some amazing things.

158
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:34,243
I guess I should be
thanking you, huh?

159
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:36,427
- For what?
- Come on, Kyle.

160
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:39,401
I overheard the doctors talking.
They said that there was some kind of

161
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,926
spike in my promicin level,
and that's what woke me up,

162
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:44,551
and it was you and my mom
in the room when it happened,

163
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,485
and I kind of doubt...

164
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:49,268
That my mom
could get her hands on a shot.

165
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,535
It had been three months, man.

166
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:55,087
The doctors weren't sure
you were ever going to wake up.

167
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:56,820
Somebody had to try something.

168
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,070
What about your dad?
He's going to figure out it was you.

169
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:01,354
Probably.

170
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,036
San Sebastian is one of the most

171
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:08,195
beautiful cities in the world,
and that view of the bay at night...

172
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:09,928
It's pretty spectacular.

173
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:12,353
Which is why if I dropped
everything and moved there

174
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:14,007
with my daughter and boyfriend,

175
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,340
I might find it a little hard
to give up.

176
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:18,298
Well, it wasn't
an easy decision.

177
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:21,020
No, but knowing
the separation was only temporary,

178
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,257
must have made it easier.

179
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:24,230
I'm not really sure
how long I'll be staying.

180
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,876
It could be quite some time.

181
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:28,018
At least
until you find your sister.

182
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:30,618
Look, Diana,

183
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:34,115
I know you've been trying to track April
on your own and you've hit a brick wall.

184
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:35,616
But you flash an NTAC badge,

185
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,774
it's amazing how fast
those walls come down.

186
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:41,182
It's clear what you get
out of this arrangement, but...

187
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:42,507
but what's my win?

188
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,807
Me.

189
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,123
I'm your win.

190
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:49,081
Temporary or not, you could use
another experienced agent here.

191
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:52,480
That's pretty much
what your former partner, Tom, said.

192
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:54,647
Smart guy.
you should listen to him.

193
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:00,997
Let me ask you a question.

194
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:02,989
Have you ever seen
<i>La Dolce Vita</i>?

195
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,556
Dubbed or subtitled?

196
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:08,822
Do I look like I watch
dubbed movies?

197
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:10,597
Do I?

198
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,338
Welcome back, agent Skouris.

199
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:18,338
I'm being reinstated
because I like foreign films?

200
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,922
Of course not,
but it doesn't hurt your cause.

201
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,030
Transferring me?

202
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:26,830
Where?

203
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:28,138
It's a brand-new facility

204
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:30,088
for people who've
developed abilities

205
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,533
that the government
considers non-threatening.

206
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:35,650
They're...

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,095
kept on the inhibitor,

208
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,691
but otherwise, it's...

209
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:41,033
less like a prison,
and more like a...

210
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:42,349
An internment camp?

211
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,249
There's an exercise yard,
a library that you can use,

212
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:48,516
and, of course, you'll be allowed
to interact with the other inmates.

213
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:50,282
Sounds nice.

214
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:52,332
Nicer than this place, anyway.

215
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:55,252
Then we'll arrange
for your transfer.

216
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:57,885
But first,
we need you to sign this.

217
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:01,460
It's a consent form,

218
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,935
giving us permission
to test your tolerance for promicin.

219
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:07,601
You want to see if I can get
my abilities back?

220
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:10,859
We want to make absolutely sure
that you can't.

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,092
The substance that your father injected
you with negated your abilities,

222
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:16,408
but before we can move you
to another facility,

223
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:19,658
we need to be positive
that they're never coming back.

224
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,349
What if they do?
What then?

225
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:25,832
We're prepared to deal with
that contingency as well.

226
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,546
This morning,
when you were in line at the ATM,

227
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:34,696
- do you rember seeing this man?
- I wasn't really paying any attention.

228
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:36,479
I was on a business call.

229
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:39,626
Does NTAC cover
your life insurance?

230
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:43,721
Did you notice anything unusual
while you were there?

231
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:45,675
Anyone's behavior
strike you as odd?

232
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:46,831
There was this one guy.

233
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:49,654
I think he was complaining
about the line. How long it was taking.

234
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:50,855
What did he say exactly?

235
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:53,780
He was yapping
about the bank being too cheap

236
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,614
to spring for another ATM.

237
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,564
He's right about that,
by the way.

238
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:58,880
What did he look like?

239
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,700
20-something. He was wearing
kind of like a baseball cap.

240
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,663
He was just a regular guy.
When do you ever notice people at banks?

241
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,530
Unless they're robbing
the place, right?

242
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:09,365
We got a no-show.

243
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:11,965
Thank you.

244
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:17,565
Mr. Kennedy!

245
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,181
I'm agent Garrity, NTAC.

246
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:22,547
Stop!

247
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:31,989
Okay, stairs.

248
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:34,956
I made up
your old room for you.

249
00:13:35,206 --> 00:13:37,631
Danny, why don't you
take your brother upstairs

250
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:39,389
while I make
some lunch?

251
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:43,106
How does
a tuna melt sound?

252
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:44,648
That's my favorite.

253
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:46,814
All right...

254
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:50,397
Come on, Troy,
talk to us.

255
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,388
Why did you attack
those people, huh?

256
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:54,672
You got a problem with
Columbia fidelity bank, huh?

257
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:56,363
Or maybe you did it
for a laugh.

258
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:59,155
You think screwing with people's heads
is funny? Is that it ?

259
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,730
No, look, I admit I took promicin.

260
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:04,980
I lost my job, I couldn't pay off
my credit cards,

261
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,738
my girlfriend dumped me.
I...

262
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,205
I was desperate.

263
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:10,304
I took the shot
to make my life better.

264
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:12,288
Better, better.
better how, huh?

265
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:14,096
By driving
a bunch of people crazy?

266
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:15,925
They're at Abendson
psychiatric hospital,

267
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,622
writhing around
in strait-jackets.

268
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:19,772
It wasn't me, I swear.

269
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,922
My ability's harmless.
I play music.

270
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,585
I pick up any instrument,
and I'm like a virtuoso.

271
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:25,697
Really?

272
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,681
Well, I'll go home
and get my clarinet.

273
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:30,122
Guys...
Can you step out for a sec?

274
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:40,120
I just got off the phone with
the seattle P.D. There's been another...

275
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:43,119
I don't even know what
to call them, phobia attack?

276
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:45,386
- Pretty much says it.
- Anyway, a 911 call came in,

277
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,805
10 minutes ago from an apartment
over on lakemont.

278
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:50,329
Seems the building manager
has been screaming like a madman

279
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:52,146
about how the place
is covered in germs.

280
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:54,129
We've had kennedy in custody
for hours.

281
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,317
Then he's not our guy,

282
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,313
which means whoever's doing this
is still out there.

283
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:00,046
Great.

284
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:01,479
All right.

285
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,595
When do you have to get
the applications in?

286
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,679
I've got another
month or so,

287
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,805
that's even
if I apply.

288
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:11,115
What do you mean "if?"

289
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:14,040
I thought that you were going to be
the next Clarence Darrow.

290
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,665
Yeah, I thought so, too,

291
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,248
but now,

292
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:19,465
with everything that's going on,

293
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:21,548
the world's a different place.

294
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:24,030
You know, law school
just seems so meaningless.

295
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,847
Just because world's changed
doesn't mean that you have to.

296
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:28,375
Well, maybe I want to.

297
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:30,483
The world's made up
of two different classes now.

298
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,313
You got people with abilities,

299
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:35,120
who are capable of amazing things,
people like you,

300
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,670
and then you got the regular schmucks,
who just have to...

301
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,853
deal with the fact they're a little less
special than they could be.

302
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:46,887
You know...

303
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:50,737
I've been thinking about it
a lot, and...

304
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,087
I want to take
the promicin shot.

305
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,158
Those shots are killing people.

306
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,754
I know all about the risks.

307
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:01,105
I think they're worth it.

308
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:04,755
They're not worth it, not when you have
as much to live for as you do.

309
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,221
Think about the odds, okay?

310
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,421
There's a 50-50 chance

311
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,438
that you would be
committing suicide.

312
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,729
What are you really
afraid of, Shawn?

313
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:15,955
Me dying,
or me getting an ability?

314
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,395
Cause that'd put us on equal
footing, we can't have that.

315
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,487
- This isn't about you and me.
- It's always about you and me!

316
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,761
I thought  you'd be
excited about this.

317
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:26,102
I thought you'd be supportive,
but I guess I was wrong.

318
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,527
- Please, listen...
- Shawn. I'm glad that you're back

319
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:30,952
I really am, but I'm not asking
for your permission.

320
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:34,127
The stuff is out there, and I'll get it,
with or without your help.

321
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:42,131
I have to clean.
I haven't finished.

322
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,101
I haven't finished.
I've got to clean.

323
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,422
The germs are everywhere.

324
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,156
Just stop...
don't touch me.

325
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,256
What happened
to his hands?

326
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:51,872
Paramedics found him scrubbing them
with a brillo pad.

327
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:53,456
Well, I just checked his apartment.

328
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,197
According to his records,
this guy banks at Washington Prime,

329
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:58,500
- and not columbia fidelity.
- So this is a separate incident

330
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,607
from the one at the bank.

331
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:01,872
Or maybe he knows the victim
in some other way.

332
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,814
Let's canvass the building,
talk to the tenants,

333
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:06,805
- see if we can find a link.
- Right.

334
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,101
Can I help you?

335
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:32,568
So is this about Ray?

336
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,123
I saw him being loaded
into an ambulance.

337
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:38,523
Did you see him before that?
Maybe earlier this morning?

338
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:40,506
No, but my husband did.

339
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:42,197
Our bathroom faucet's
been leaking for a week,

340
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:44,481
and Ray still hasn't gotten around
to fixing it.

341
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,272
What time do you expect
your husband home?

342
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:48,489
Why?

343
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:51,064
It's not like they had a fight
or anything.

344
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:56,737
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to play with trains, too.

345
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,937
- Just like...
- Don't worry, it's not your fault.

346
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:02,837
Brandon's autistic.
He likes things in a certain order.

347
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,408
There we go. See?
It's okay.

348
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,606
Excuse me?

349
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:23,022
- Is this your husband?
- Yeah, that's Ryan.

350
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:24,865
Why?

351
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,648
Isn't he one of the guys
from the ATM line?

352
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,248
I think we found our link.

353
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:33,648
You want me
to talk to Danny?

354
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,673
You might be able
to talk some sense into him,

355
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:38,477
convince him that he'd be,
you know, crazy to take that shot.

356
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:40,427
I can't do that, Shawn.

357
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:44,190
If Danny wants to take promicin,
I say, give it to him.

358
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,627
Kyle, this isn't just
some guy on the street

359
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:48,786
with nothing to lose.
This is my little brother.

360
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:50,291
That shot could kill him.

361
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:52,276
It didn't kill me.

362
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,760
You took promicin?

363
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,410
Kyle, you took
promicin?

364
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,343
Three months ago.

365
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,293
My hand was shaking so bad,
I could barely hold the syringe,

366
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:10,001
but I survived.

367
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,559
I didn't get an ability, but...

368
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:16,442
I survived.

369
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,129
Since when do you care about
getting an ability so much?

370
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:22,504
It's not just about getting an ability,
it's about making a difference.

371
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:26,233
What Collier's trying to do, change
this world, man? That's important.

372
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,250
I wanted to be
a part of that,

373
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:30,674
and I bet Danny feels
the same way.

374
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:33,374
Kyle, I don't think
that Danny cares about Jordan,

375
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:36,386
or changing the world. He's trying
to prove something to himself,

376
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,348
or to me.
It's a jealousy thing.

377
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:40,423
That may be true,

378
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,222
but the reason doesn't matter.
If Danny wants to take the shot,

379
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:45,918
I don't think you or anyone else
has a right to stop him.

380
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:48,911
I'm sorry, Tom,

381
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:51,206
but Ryan Powell
tested negative for promicin.

382
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,056
I had no choice
but to release him.

383
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:54,722
Same with
the ATM customers

384
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,826
and the bank employees,
they all came back clean.

385
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:59,796
That can't be right. Powell's our
only link between the bank victims

386
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,521
and Ray Haugen. You're telling me
that's just a coincidence?

387
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:03,925
I don't know what it is.
But Ryan Powell didn't take promicin,

388
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,854
he doesn't have an ability,
and he's not the guy we're looking for.

389
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:08,970
Did you lose a filling
or something?

390
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:17,379
My tooth...

391
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:18,679
It just fell out.

392
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,279
Jed, there's nothing
in your hand.

393
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:25,415
Just calm down,
calm down.

394
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:31,748
Get somebody in here.

395
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:34,698
This is Meghan Doyle. I need
a medical team up here right away.

396
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:46,285
I'm coming apart!

397
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:49,026
- Don't let me die!
- It's okay...

398
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,430
Somebody, get in here!

399
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,659
Aren't you going
to say hello?

400
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,226
You headed some place
in particular,

401
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:05,084
or were you combing the city
hoping to find me.

402
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:07,934
Where have you been, huh?

403
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,775
That school you said
you were going to?

404
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,475
I went there.
They never heard of you.

405
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:13,417
Does it really matter
where I go to school?

406
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,817
The important thing is
Shawn's okay.

407
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,275
He is, isn't he?

408
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:21,591
How'd you know
the promicin would wake him up?

409
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:24,382
- Who are you?
- Come on, I think you know that.

410
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:26,315
What's that
supposed to mean?

411
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:28,849
Huh, what's that
supposed to mean?

412
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:31,065
You said
you wanted answers.

413
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,482
I'll take you
to them.

414
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,034
Are you coming or not?

415
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:44,842
He looks fine to me.

416
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,767
Oh, trust me, he's not.

417
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:51,411
Well, I don't understand.
You've been together all day.

418
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:52,843
Yeah, pretty much.

419
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,911
The bank, the apartment building.
We had contact with the same people.

420
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:57,096
That's a bit odd, isn't it?

421
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,040
That he would be affected
and not you?

422
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:03,298
It was that kid.

423
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:08,192
It was that kid, Diana.
It has to be.

424
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:11,797
When we were at
Ryan Powell's apartment,

425
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,079
I was interviewing the wife.

426
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:14,834
Garrity spoke to the son.
He's autistic.

427
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,862
He started screaming at him
and rocking back and forth.

428
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,734
That's when it happened.
It has to be.

429
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:23,386
Jess, come on. Come on.
Come on, please!

430
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:25,023
Just... let's get out of here.

431
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:26,941
Just throw some stuff together
and let's go.

432
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,382
Brandon what do you say buddy?
Wanna go on a little road trip?

433
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:30,505
We're not going anywhere.

434
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:32,724
Just tell me
why NTAC is after you.

435
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:34,521
It's not me they're after.

436
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:39,836
It's Brandon.

437
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:41,057
Why?

438
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:43,295
Brandon hasn't done
anything wrong.

439
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:45,697
Has he?

440
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:48,828
I swear, I was only
trying to help him.

441
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,435
Okay, Jess, just I...

442
00:22:51,944 --> 00:22:53,634
I did... something.

443
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:55,760
I couldn't tell you.
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:57,608
You did something?

445
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,557
You gave him one of those shots.

446
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:03,452
You gave him
one of those shots?

447
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,360
You bastard!

448
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,567
What did you do to my son?

449
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:12,107
Baby...

450
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:24,221
You're too late.

451
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,231
They're gone.

452
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:29,847
Where are they, Mr. Powell?

453
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:32,084
I don't know where Jess is taking him.
She didn't tell me.

454
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:35,143
We need to find your son before
he hurts anyone else. Where are they ?

455
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:38,993
Do you know what it's like
to have a... son who won't...

456
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,692
hug you, or smile at you?
Won't even...

457
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:44,008
Won't even look you in the eye?

458
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:47,276
Clear.

459
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,705
Is that why you gave him
promicin?

460
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:53,619
I thought if Brandon
got an ability,

461
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,913
it would make him better,

462
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,307
at least help him
to communicate.

463
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:58,534
I don't even know

464
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:02,292
what my own son is thinking,
or feeling, you know?

465
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,501
That's no way for a kid to live.

466
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:05,668
All he does is...

467
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:08,779
play with that goddamn train.

468
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,050
Mr. Powell, we're going
to need you to think.

469
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,956
Where would your wife
have taken Brandon?

470
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,626
Look, I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

471
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:17,221
Please...

472
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,383
Please none of this is his fault.
He doesn't know.

473
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,597
He has no idea what he's doing.

474
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:23,426
If anybody's to blame, it's me.

475
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:26,067
So your wife...
She didn't know you injected him?

476
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:33,083
Are you kidding me?

477
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:34,295
50-50?

478
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:35,835
She'd never agree to that.

479
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:38,173
But you were willing
to take the risk.

480
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,160
I see other parents...

481
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,377
with their own kids,

482
00:24:45,477 --> 00:24:48,343
and the warmth,
and the joking around...

483
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:53,984
I wanted some of that.

484
00:24:55,715 --> 00:24:56,851
I...

485
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,641
I wasn't trying to kill Brandon.

486
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:01,593
She has to believe that.
I just...

487
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,134
I just...

488
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:06,289
I just wanted him
to have the chance at a...

489
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:07,738
at a normal life.

490
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:43,569
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mrs. Tyler.

491
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:46,424
We'll be in contact shortly.

492
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,734
- Get me a copy of the lab report.
- Is that all? We're done?

493
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,249
Did I pass?

494
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:56,373
Hello!

495
00:25:59,498 --> 00:26:01,189
Well, you wanted answers, Kyle.

496
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,916
You'll find them in there.

497
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,466
Are you
coming with me?

498
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,544
It's better if I don't.

499
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:25,135
What do you know
about white light?

500
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,463
Not too much, actually.

501
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:30,610
My great-grandfather
founded the group

502
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,834
back in 1918.

503
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,889
Even at its height,

504
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:38,654
the membership never exceeded
a few dozen people.

505
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:42,619
The whole thing only
lasted a few years.

506
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,029
They all died.

507
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:47,827
Burned to death in a fire.

508
00:26:48,513 --> 00:26:49,996
What did
these people believe?

509
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,866
They believed that a messiah

510
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:54,418
would return from the dead

511
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,701
and lead the world
to salvation.

512
00:26:57,735 --> 00:27:01,153
Not the proudest branch
on my family tree.

513
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,807
But people are interested
in this stuff,

514
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:05,435
so I keep it around.

515
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,472
This was their scripture,

516
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:10,322
and this...

517
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:13,257
was the messiah
they were waiting for.

518
00:27:20,477 --> 00:27:22,740
Yeah, that looks like
Jordan Collier.

519
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:24,989
You're not the first person to...

520
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:26,594
mention a resemblance.

521
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:29,017
I don't know, maybe.

522
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,032
Feel free to...
thumb through the book

523
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:34,162
if you'd like.

524
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,205
A few of the chapters
are too charred to read,

525
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:39,426
and one of them
is written in a...

526
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:42,348
Oh, I don't know,
a code or something,

527
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:45,815
but there's enough for you
to get the gist.

528
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:47,521
That's great, thank you.

529
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:57,990
Oh, Brandon...

530
00:27:58,384 --> 00:27:59,922
Please, not now, okay?

531
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,572
Um... are you hungry, honey?

532
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:04,154
Do you want a snack?

533
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:09,709
Uh.. No? Okay.

534
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:11,793
Uh... how about your train?
You want your train?

535
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:14,059
I got your train right here,
sweetie, okay?

536
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,759
Honey,
I've got your train over here.

537
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:17,276
Brandon, please not now.

538
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:19,472
XX, mommy.

539
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,938
Brandon, I've got your train, sweetie.

540
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,165
Come on, come on.

541
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:26,309
Do you see them?
are they gone?

542
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:27,614
Is what gone?

543
00:29:27,714 --> 00:29:30,182
The snakes! They're here
somewhere, I know it.

544
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,785
Don't let them get me, please!

545
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:33,144
Mrs. Powell, just calm down.

546
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:34,588
Everything'll be okay, I promise.

547
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:35,860
Did you see the direction

548
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,780
your son was headed,
Mrs. Powell?

549
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,276
No, I must've blacked out.

550
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,841
When I opened my eyes,
he was gone.

551
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:43,790
You have to find him.
Please you have to find him.

552
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,585
He's out there all alone.
He must be so scared!

553
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:46,831
All right, Mrs. Powell.

554
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,569
If you were Brandon,
if you were your son,

555
00:29:49,757 --> 00:29:50,855
where would you go?

556
00:29:56,365 --> 00:29:57,567
Hey, Diana!

557
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,575
Hey, kid, shouldn't you be at home?

558
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:26,483
Where are your parents, bud?

559
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,986
Do they know you're out here?

560
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:32,624
Whoa, buddy.

561
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:35,385
Take it easy.
Take it easy!

562
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,555
So, what did you think?

563
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:42,368
Pretty interesting reading, huh?

564
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:44,672
That's why you brought me here,
to read that book?

565
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,284
A messiah who rises from the dead,

566
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,641
who passes out a sacred elixir
that changes the world?

567
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:51,316
I know that sounds
just like Jordan Collier,

568
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,249
and that healer who lays
his hands upon the sick?

569
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,765
I'm guessing
that's supposed to be Shawn.

570
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:56,126
Don't forget about the shaman,

571
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,856
whose visions guide the messiah
down the path to enlightenment.

572
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:00,988
Want to take a stab
at who that is?

573
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,096
The shaman is you, Kyle.

574
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:06,576
Me...

575
00:31:07,652 --> 00:31:09,546
I know it might sound
a little intimidating...

576
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:11,019
Intimidating? Try insane.

577
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,486
All right, I admit that book

578
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,481
got few things right,
about Jordan, about promicin,

579
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,765
but the rest of it's kind of vague,

580
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:17,310
there's that whole
chapter that's in code.

581
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:18,835
What about the part that says,
the messiah

582
00:31:18,947 --> 00:31:20,362
will show us
the face of god?

583
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,255
"And all will know his face,

584
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,105
"and he will smile down upon us

585
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:25,263
"and walk among us,

586
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:27,079
"and the earth and heaven
will be as one..."

587
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,218
And Collier's gonna make
that happen, huh?

588
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:30,458
With your help.

589
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:32,367
It's a prophecy, Kyle.

590
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:33,775
I don't believe that.

591
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:37,148
Look, you helped me
wake up my cousin.

592
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:39,232
For that, I am grateful,
but this is over.

593
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,095
No, Kyle, it's just beginning.

594
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:42,482
Look, this cult, "white light"

595
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:44,578
it's still around, isn't it?
You're one of them.

596
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:47,774
You're trying to use Jordan to start
some kind of crazy religious revival?

597
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:49,236
I won't be a part of that.

598
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:51,471
- You already are...
- I don't want to hear anymore.

599
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:52,936
Just stay the hell away from me.

600
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:12,345
What changed your mind?

601
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:14,091
Nothing changed my mind.

602
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:20,175
I don't agree
with taking promicin.

603
00:32:20,476 --> 00:32:21,725
I think it's a mistake.

604
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:26,235
50-50, those are lousy odds.

605
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:30,592
But you were right about
one thing, it's your decision,

606
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:33,728
and I don't want you getting arrested
trying to find the stuff yourself.

607
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,896
They're throwing people
in jail, Danny, no trial.

608
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:39,940
I don't get it.

609
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:42,754
You were with Collier
from the beginning.

610
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,647
He put this out there.
I mean...

611
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,512
if you don't agree with it,

612
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,062
where does that leave
you and him?

613
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,193
I wish Jordan
had buried that stuff somewhere.

614
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:56,076
These abilities cause
as many problems as they solve.

615
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:07,505
Just do me a favor, okay,
and just hold off for a while.

616
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:10,560
Maybe if you read the paper
for the next few weeks,

617
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,343
law school won't seem so bad.

618
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:15,397
Yeah, okay.
I can do that.

619
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:30,475
Please, don't look at me!

620
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:32,419
I don't like people
looking at me!

621
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:34,422
Okay, I'm going to call this in.

622
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,626
Don't worry, sir,
we're gonna get you help.

623
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,241
Are there going to be
people there?

624
00:33:38,545 --> 00:33:39,869
I don't like
people seeing me.

625
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:42,475
At least Brandon's
giving us a trail to follow.

626
00:33:56,982 --> 00:33:58,728
I hate that
we have to sedate him,

627
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,955
but I don't know how else
to get him back into NTAC.

628
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:06,511
I'm starting to remember why
I gave this job up in the first place.

629
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:15,939
Diana, I wish
there was another way,

630
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:18,079
but his ability's
too much of a threat.

631
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,094
If only Jordan Collier wasn't
the most wanted man in the world.

632
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:23,454
He could take his ability away,
couldn't he?

633
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:32,601
We can't cure him
of his ability,

634
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:36,011
but maybe there's a way
we can help him control it.

635
00:35:04,331 --> 00:35:05,673
It's okay, Brandon.

636
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:08,362
Everything's going to be okay.

637
00:35:08,462 --> 00:35:10,431
Can we just do this, please?

638
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:13,260
He's been given the inhibitor,

639
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,973
so hopefully there won't
be any kind of danger,

640
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,606
but there's still
some risk involved.

641
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,798
So if you want to back out,
we'd understand.

642
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:21,393
It's not that,

643
00:35:22,211 --> 00:35:23,234
it's just...

644
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:26,832
I haven't healed anyone
in months,

645
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:31,151
and autism is developmental.

646
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:33,861
I haven't had a lot of success
with that in the past.

647
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:35,495
But you will try?

648
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:38,959
Yeah.

649
00:36:22,608 --> 00:36:24,402
Is that it?
Did it work?

650
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:28,896
Brandon?
Brandon, look at me.

651
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:33,502
Da...

652
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:35,244
Da...

653
00:36:35,502 --> 00:36:36,507
Da...

654
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:38,442
Dad.

655
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,851
That's right.

656
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:43,944
I'm your dad.

657
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,305
That... That was incredible.

658
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,262
I forgot how much I liked this.

659
00:36:58,297 --> 00:36:59,537
Look at you.

660
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:09,593
I can give you
a few minutes, Mr. Powell,

661
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:12,113
but then I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with us.

662
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,194
My son has been...

663
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:18,222
in a prison his entire life.

664
00:37:21,945 --> 00:37:24,029
I'm happy
to trade places with him.

665
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:43,472
Your test results came back.

666
00:37:44,148 --> 00:37:46,491
Whatever you were given
to take away your abilities,

667
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:48,856
it induced a permanent allergy
to promicin.

668
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,539
if you were to take the shot,

669
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,716
it would be fatal.

670
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:55,406
You will never get
your abilities back, Miss Tyler.

671
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,016
Does that mean
I'm getting out of here?

672
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,983
The transfer should take place
within two weeks.

673
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,483
Does this how you spend
your saturdays?

674
00:38:32,094 --> 00:38:33,418
Most nights, too.

675
00:38:34,002 --> 00:38:35,974
I thought you might want to hear
some good news.

676
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:38,048
Dr. Clayton says
the people Brandon affected,

677
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:40,286
they're beginning to show
signs of improvement.

678
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,687
You think putting him on the inhibitor
had something to do with it?

679
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,262
As soon as we muted his ability,

680
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:45,935
their symptoms
began to dissipate,

681
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:49,119
which means Garrity should be
back in rotation soon.

682
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,749
Unless you'd prefer
to stick with Skouris.

683
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,475
Look, nothing against jed,
but if Diana's gonna be around,

684
00:38:57,578 --> 00:38:58,667
she's my partner.

685
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:03,532
So what happens to Brandon now?

686
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,357
As long as his mother brings him in

687
00:39:05,457 --> 00:39:07,206
for weekly injections
of the inhibitor,

688
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,026
he should be able to live
a fairly normal life...

689
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,552
More normal than he has
up to now anyway.

690
00:39:14,403 --> 00:39:16,393
That was an amazing thing
your nephew did.

691
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:18,720
Yeah, these abilities
people get,

692
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,160
they come in handy sometimes.

693
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,793
It's worth remembering.

694
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:30,240
So is it really her?

695
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:31,858
Alana?

696
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,182
I keep trying
to convince myself it's not,

697
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:36,317
but, yeah, it's her,

698
00:39:37,403 --> 00:39:39,562
and all I can think about
is how do I get her back.

699
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,393
Maybe all you can do is...

700
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,942
let her go.

701
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:51,852
I really need to take this.

702
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:06,425
Dr. Sawyer?

703
00:40:09,148 --> 00:40:10,218
The news isn't good.

704
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,877
- Your father's had a relapse.
- Pneumonia?

705
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,910
His breathing's been
severely compromised.

706
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,359
He's beaten this before.

707
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:18,854
I know, but I think it's time

708
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,223
we start preparing ourselves
for the inevitable.

709
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:23,395
I'm sorry.

710
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:53,947
How did you get in here?

711
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:55,065
It was easy.

712
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:56,266
Where you go, I go.

713
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:58,031
You're stalking me now, is that it?

714
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:00,182
Come on, Kyle, think.

715
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,143
I don't go to the art institute.

716
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:03,918
There's no record
of me anywhere.

717
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,787
I show up wherever I want to.

718
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:07,254
What does that tell you?

719
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,595
You up for some dinner?

720
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:13,848
I don't feel like
eating alone tonight.

721
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:17,296
Dad, I want you to meet Cassie.

722
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:20,577
Who's Cassie?

723
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:25,587
Is she someone you met at work?

724
00:41:26,742 --> 00:41:28,441
You find yourself
a girlfriend already?

725
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:31,103
Well, that would be
a little bit awkward.

726
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:33,778
See, I'm not
what you'd call real.

727
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,421
I'm Kyle's ability.

728
00:41:37,722 --> 00:41:40,173
Hey, I... I don't mean to pry.
Sorry.

729
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:44,221
You should bring her
by the house some time.

730
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:49,914
So... we on for dinner?

731
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:54,818
Yeah. Yeah, just give me
a couple of minutes, okay?

732
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,220
Yeah. Great.

733
00:42:11,557 --> 00:42:13,624
