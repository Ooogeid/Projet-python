00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,400
The world
will have to deal with us.

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,916
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:48,715
<i>Promicin is out there.

5
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:52,182
<i>People are gaining abilities,
and nothing can be done about that.

6
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,516
Kyle, listen to me.
If you're involved in something...

7
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:57,432
Collier will lead the human race
to salvation. You will help him.

8
00:00:57,532 --> 00:00:59,849
- What is this place?
- Cassie said we should come here.

9
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:01,449
You are on the wrong path here.

10
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:03,057
And you've always
been rebellious,

11
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:05,719
but I think
you're afraid of change, Shawn...

12
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,916
or is it just me?

13
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:10,149
<i>You don't really
know this girl at all, do you?

14
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:11,399
Baby...

15
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:13,600
Get your hands off of me.

16
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:18,049
I share an office with two of the most
annoying guys on the planet.

17
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:20,566
I don't understand why Collier
would risk coming back to Seattle.

18
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,244
It's like he's daring us
to catch him.

19
00:01:22,344 --> 00:01:23,949
This is a message of hope

20
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,649
<i>for a better tomorrow,</i>

21
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:28,865
<i>and it begins here,</i>
<i>in Promise City.</i>

22
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:31,949
I was going to ask you if you wanted
to be a part of this operation.

23
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,949
Believe me, I want Collier
as much as anyone.

24
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,649
It's not Collier
I was thinking about.

25
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:38,424
He's my son. I've got to believe
I can still reach him.

26
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:34,802
Diana, what the hell's going on?
Where is everyone?

27
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:36,449
I don't know.
You're the first person I've seen.

28
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,549
I just woke up
on the floor of the break room.

29
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:39,916
Why were you sleeping
in the break room?

30
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,166
- I don't know.
- Why was I sleeping at my desk?

31
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,666
The last thing I remember
was going...

32
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,616
- to bed at home.
- The last thing I remember,

33
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,766
I was going over case files
in my living room.

34
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:54,366
Why did I just wake up
underneath my office chair?

35
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:57,149
Please tell me
you know how we got here.

36
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,682
<i>Possibility one,
we're under attack.

37
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,649
Someone with a grudge
against the NTAC,

38
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,566
used a 4400 ability against us.

39
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,349
- Maybe more than one.
- That would explain the memory gaps.

40
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:08,616
But if a 4400
were coming after us,

41
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,098
why are we still alive?

42
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,315
Are we the only survivors
in the building?

43
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:13,765
Maybe,

44
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:16,546
or maybe the attackers haven't
gotten down to our level yet.

45
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,299
Let's not ignore
possibility two...

46
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,549
The world at large
is under attack.

47
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:23,049
The building's reacting to
a security situation out there.

48
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,500
So, what, we're the only
survivors in the world?

49
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,349
Could we come up with a possibility
that doesn't involve an attack?

50
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:33,149
It's not responding.

51
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:35,232
We're locked out of
the building's network.

52
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:36,732
I can't even
access the system.

53
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:41,048
Maybe we can do it from OPS.
Try to get in through the mainframe,

54
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:43,444
establish some kind of contact
with the outside world.

55
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:45,644
Or maybe we could just
walk out the front door.

56
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,416
Do you hear that alarm?

57
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:51,149
That means the building's sealed,
and it's going to stay sealed

58
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:53,432
until someone overrides
the security protocols.

59
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,449
We could be the only ones here
who know how to do that.

60
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:58,515
All right.

61
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,174
Get yourself ready to go.

62
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,549
I don't care
if this building is crawling

63
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:05,107
with every p-positive in Seattle,
we're getting to OPS.

64
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:08,124
First, wake up P.J.

65
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,321
Wake up, man.

66
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,608
No phones, no email.
Even the emergency radio doesn't work.

67
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,340
Internal surveillance is down, too.

68
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,007
I can't find a sidearm
anywhere.

69
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,369
Good to see we're not alone.

70
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:35,036
God, tell me
you've got some answers.

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,557
You got into the network.
Good job, Brady.

72
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,532
That wasn't me.
I'm still locked out.

73
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:41,899
The alarm just went silent.

74
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:45,174
The phones are still dead.
If the security system is down,

75
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:47,349
that could mean the exits aren't sealed.
We could get out of here.

76
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:49,940
It's worth checking out.
Tom, you and I will scout ahead,

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,049
make sure there's
a safe path to the exit.

78
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:54,507
Oh, and, Diana, make sure
you stick with these guys.

79
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,257
Watch their backs while they work
on establishing communications.

80
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,707
Wait.

81
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,149
- Let's go. No one's there.
- There's no one anywhere.

82
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:08,200
We haven't seen a soul
since we left OPS.

88
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,499
Collier, what the hell
did you do to this place?

89
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:25,607
Dad?

90
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,507
Kyle?
What's going on here?

91
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:33,341
- Answer me!
- Kyle, run!

92
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:35,474
Hold it!

93
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,949
Kyle, no!
Kyle, wait!

94
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,749
Wait, kyle!
Open the door.

95
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:46,249
Open the door, Kyle!

96
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,482
Whatever you're doing here,
you have to stop.

97
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:50,349
You have to convince Collier
to stop.

98
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,457
Open the door!

99
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,266
What are you doing here?

100
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,316
Where are we?
What did you do to me?

101
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,572
What the hell is going on?

102
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:16,161
It wasn't me.
I didn't do anything.

103
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,067
This looks like NTAC.

104
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
Did we get arrested?

105
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,191
I was working late
in my apartment.

106
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,557
I don't remember anything
after that.

107
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,600
Maybe the government's
rounding up 4400s.

108
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,449
They have soldiers with abilities.
They could've messed with our memories.

109
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,357
Why would they put
you and me together?

110
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Hello?

111
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,348
I don't understand.
Collier has just built

112
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:33,682
a huge settlement for himself
in the middle of Seattle.

113
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:34,882
That's a huge win for him.

114
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,882
Why would he risk everything
and attack the building?

115
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,949
He didn't stick around
to explain himself.

116
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,782
Whatever he's planning,
we have to be ready to defend ourselves.

117
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:42,882
Guys...

118
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,366
Can we lower the blast doors
over the entrances to this room?

119
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:48,016
They're controlled by the computer,
and we still can't access the system.

120
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,366
We could move the furniture
and build a barricade.

121
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:52,749
Great, we'll make a wall
made out of desks and chairs.

122
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,449
I'm sure that will be really helpful,
especially if they've got somebody

123
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:56,940
who can melt our brains
from around the corner.

124
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,316
- Do you have a better idea?
- Wait, there's a weapons locker

125
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,149
a few floors down. That's where
we store all the assault rifles.

126
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,049
Maybe Collier hasn't
gotten to it yet.

127
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,482
Believe me, I don't want to
point a gun at Kyle, but...

128
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:08,316
if Collier
is leading some kind of attack,

129
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,191
we need something more than
office supplies to fight back with.

130
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:24,149
- What's happening? Why am I here?
- We checked that room. It was empty.

131
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:26,574
You're okay now.
You're with me. You're safe.

132
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:31,199
My dad and his boss seemed
just as surprised as we were.

133
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:33,349
It sounded like they thought
Jordan brought us here.

134
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:34,453
Did he?

135
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,532
Jordan had nothing
to do with this.

136
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,766
He doesn't always
share his plans, Kyle.

137
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:41,182
- Guess you haven't learned that yet.
- My relationship with him

138
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,448
is different from the one you two had.
He doesn't hide things from me,

139
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,569
and he sure wasn't planning
an assault on NTAC.

140
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,749
You guys, wait.

141
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:48,516
We can't fight,
not now.

142
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:50,982
We've got to find Jordan.
He's trapped in here, too.

143
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,549
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

144
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,432
You guys do whatever you want.
I'm going to find my way out of here.

145
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,049
What, Isabelle?
What?

146
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:00,032
Listen,
whatever's going on here,

147
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,849
we have a much better chance
of getting out if we stick together.

148
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,149
Now, stay with us.

149
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,700
We'll find Jordan,
and we'll leave as a group.

150
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,671
It's not responding.

151
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:14,049
These locks are supposed
to run on reserve power.

152
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,749
What good is a weapons locker if you
can't get into it during an emergency?

153
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,949
Maybe we can find a crowbar
or something. Try to force the door.

154
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:20,049
Hold on.

155
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:23,932
If we can pry that face-pad off,
I might be able to short-circuit it.

156
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,249
Really?

157
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,682
You're going to...
hotwire the door open?

158
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:29,632
Don't look so surprised.

159
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:32,149
I worked in a think tank
for years.

160
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,357
You'd be amazed at the things
I picked up around the water cooler.

161
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:36,474
Try this.

162
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,774
- Where'd you get that?
- My desk drawer.

163
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,200
You said we might have to defend
ourselves with office supplies, so...

164
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,247
What?

165
00:10:58,882 --> 00:10:59,899
Nothing.

166
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,199
Nothing, I'm just...

167
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:02,849
wondering how you do it.

168
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:05,416
We all wake up in the middle of NTAC
with no explanation,

169
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,249
and now we're down in the basement,
trying to break into a weapons locker

170
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,716
so we can fight off an attack
by God knows how many people

171
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:13,649
with 4400 abilities.
It seems pretty hopeless, right?

172
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:17,871
But you,
you just keep moving forward.

173
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:21,749
If I stopped cold
every time a situation looked hopeless,

174
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,849
I wouldn't have lasted
very long in this job.

175
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:26,282
All I do is focus on
what's in front of me.

176
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:29,149
In a few years, you'll look back,
and you'll realize that you survived

177
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:30,849
by doing exactly the same thing.

178
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:34,099
A few years? I'm flattered
you think I'll last that long.

179
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:36,338
Here, come on,
give me a hand.

180
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,226
Right now, I'll twist,
and you pull, all right?

181
00:11:42,474 --> 00:11:43,474
There.

182
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:44,724
All right.

183
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:49,467
There we go.

184
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:55,567
Jordan...

185
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:01,083
And none of you has any idea
how we got here?

186
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,374
But everyone's all right?
Nobody's hurt?

187
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:07,691
I'm fine.

188
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:10,049
- What are you doing here?
- All the exits are sealed,

189
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,649
so I looked for this place.

190
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,349
NTAC imprisons 4400s here,

191
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:17,149
and those who have taken the shot.
I was looking for allies.

192
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,674
The entire wing's empty,
so I guess you're out of luck.

193
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,807
No.

194
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,149
I'm not out of luck. I found you three.
That should be enough.

195
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:26,349
Enough for what?

196
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,582
Their operations center's
on the second level.

197
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,216
Communications gear,
security controls.

198
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,266
We get there, we can contact
Promise City, send for help.

199
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:36,449
That's where my dad's office is.
They're all going to be there.

200
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,549
Likely,

201
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:40,499
There's no other way.
We need control of that room.

202
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:43,849
You're talking about overpowering
a bunch of government agents, Jordan.

203
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:45,499
What are we gonna do,
take hostages?

204
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,949
Shawn, they brought us here
against our will.

205
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:49,832
They're the aggressors.

206
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:53,482
I'll walk out of here peacefully
if I can, but I will walk out of here.

207
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,366
And any of you
not wanting to spend

208
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:58,033
the rest of your life in one of
these cells should join me.

209
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:15,749
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

210
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:17,416
Yeah, it's fine.
It's fine.

211
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,857
Prepare to be impressed.

212
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:25,688
Guess the shock was worth it.

213
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,471
I'm impressed.

214
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:32,857
There's nothing here.

215
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:34,900
It's empty!

216
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,740
What happened?
Are you all right?

217
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,849
<i>I'm fine.

218
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:44,049
I don't know what happened.
I'll try and get the lock open again.

219
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:51,749
Are you there?

220
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,649
My God, Meghan.

221
00:13:58,661 --> 00:13:59,661
Look at me.

222
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,161
I don't understand
what happened.

223
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:23,549
It's like that door closed by itself.
We were only apart for a few seconds.

224
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,149
It was an accident, Tom.

225
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:26,749
Maybe.

226
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,549
But we wouldn't be stuck in here
if it wasn't for Collier.

227
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,032
Meghan's death is on him.

228
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:34,182
We can add it to the list of thousands
he's responsible for.

229
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:35,999
<i>This doesn't make any sense.

230
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:38,482
<i>She shouldn't be dead.

231
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:41,282
<i>We have to get
the computers back online.

232
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:42,800
<i>Let's just focus on that.

233
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:53,641
What exactly are we
supposed to be looking for?

234
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,374
Anything we can use
to defend ourselves.

235
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:14,398
Kyle, this is crazy. Are we supposed
to use these on someone?

236
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,098
I hope not.

237
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,615
This was all I could find.

238
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:29,840
A broom handle?
What am I supposed to do with this?

239
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,765
Use it, or don't,

240
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:34,049
but I'm not inclined to give up
without a fight.

241
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:36,049
See, why do you think
that we need to fight?

242
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,141
Didn't you say that
when you ran into my uncle

243
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:40,220
that he thought
that you were behind this?

244
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:42,557
You think that they are.

245
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:44,524
Does that not beg the question,

246
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:45,924
what if it was neither of us?

247
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:47,774
What if something else
is causing this?

248
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:51,026
First, we control that room,
then we ask questions.

249
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,424
No, let's ask them now.

250
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,566
What you seem to be forgetting
is one of those NTAC agents

251
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,057
that you are so intent
on battling is my uncle.

252
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,399
Kyle's father.

253
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,916
There's gotta be some way
that we communicate with him.

254
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:04,899
I'll go.
You three can wait here for me.

255
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,209
What?

256
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,916
It's just the future gave you
the right ability.

257
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:14,349
You're always looking for
the peaceful solution, for healing.

258
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:17,032
I admire that,

259
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:19,691
even if it means you can't be
part of the movement.

260
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,148
What's going on?

261
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,853
Come on, we need to go.

262
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,567
Get down!

263
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,017
You know, it doesn't have to be
so weird and quiet in here.

264
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,446
You guys
can talk to each other.

265
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:27,613
What?

266
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,596
It's not weird and quiet.

267
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,282
Your mom and I talk to each other
all the time.

268
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:34,449
I guess,

269
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,732
but you used to come over
almost every night.

270
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,449
We'd play games.

271
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:40,574
It was fun,

272
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,899
and you don't come over anymore.

273
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:47,949
It's like we're supposed to pretend
nothing ever happened.

274
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:51,732
It's complicated,
sweetie, but...

275
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:54,003
Marco and I, we are friends.

276
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:57,532
Aren't friends supposed to
see each other sometimes?

277
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,508
Everybody, get out here!
They're coming!

278
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:04,557
You keep the door locked

279
00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:06,284
and stay down,
no matter what you hear.

280
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:08,115
Everyone, stay back!
just stay back!

281
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,640
Whatever you're here to do,
whatever you want,

282
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,089
- it's not going to happen.
- Dad, we're not doing this.

283
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:17,174
Please let me in.

284
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:18,846
We don't want to fight.

285
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,734
Meghan Doyle
is dead, Kyle.

286
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:28,556
Do you understand?
She's dead.

287
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:32,078
- How could you do this?
- I told you, it's not us, all right?

288
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,443
We just woke up here.
We don't know what happened.

289
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:36,449
- It's the truth.
- You're lying...

290
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:37,581
Oh, God.

291
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:39,393
You're hurt?

292
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,792
What happened?

293
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,453
A window blew out.

294
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:45,416
I got cut.

295
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,576
- And shawn...
- Shawn?

296
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:51,985
Oh, no...

297
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:03,746
This isn't right.

298
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:05,821
This isn't how it's
supposed to happen.

299
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:08,051
He's dead.

300
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:09,296
Because of you!

301
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,403
Two people lost their lives
because of you!

302
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:12,763
I had nothing to do with this!

303
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:14,765
- The hell you didn't!
- Stop!

304
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:18,118
He's telling the truth!

305
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:20,906
He didn't
bring you here.

306
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,301
I did.

307
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,922
I made this happen.

308
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:29,706
I took the shot.

309
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:33,067
We're all here
because of my ability.

310
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:41,890
I took the shot
about two months ago.

311
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,533
Once promicin got out there,

312
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,648
I knew it was going to
change everything forever.

313
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:52,623
Science, politics, religion.

314
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,881
I just wanted
to be part of it.

315
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:57,727
I had to be part of it.

316
00:19:58,639 --> 00:19:59,700
Then one night,

317
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,001
my fiancee and my mother

318
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:05,794
had this huge fight
about the guest list at our wedding.

319
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,230
I went to bed

320
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,297
wishing there was
something I could do

321
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,320
to smooth things over
between them.

322
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:14,777
When I woke up,

323
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:17,506
I was someplace else.

324
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,257
Me, my mom, Sara.

325
00:20:21,494 --> 00:20:23,111
We didn't know
how we got there, but...

326
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:26,002
we were trapped
in this huge traffic jam

327
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:27,594
on the Spokane street bridge.

328
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,834
It was an hour away from when
we were supposed to get married.

329
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,147
We had to work together
to get across town,

330
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:35,648
and when I say "work",
I mean, work.

331
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:39,051
There were earthquakes,
floods, a fire.

332
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,280
It was crazy.

333
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,698
But we survived together,

334
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:45,866
and we got to the church
just in time.

335
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:49,920
I kissed Sara
at the end of the ceremony,

336
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:52,695
and then we all woke up at home.

337
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,358
The game was over.

338
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:55,559
The game?

339
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:01,294
I figured out how it works
since then my ability.

340
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:02,971
It's like a game.

341
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:05,590
P.J., stop using the word "game".
There are two people dead.

342
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,790
I'm not sure about that.

343
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:09,599
No one's ever died before.

344
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:12,128
I don't know what that means
for the real world.

345
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,927
Why NTAC?
Why did you pick this place?

346
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:17,143
I didn't pick it.
You did.

347
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,349
We all did.

348
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:22,339
But I have no control
over anything else.

349
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,024
We determine where we go,

350
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:27,609
all of our mind, together.

351
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:30,423
It's a subconscious thing.

352
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:32,612
NTAC means something
different to each of us,

353
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,242
but it matters to everyone?

354
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:36,020
That's how we got here?

355
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,165
Exactly,

356
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:40,086
and there's always an obstacle...

357
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:43,758
Something all the players
have to work together to overcome.

358
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:47,743
I know this sounds weird,
but in this case,

359
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:50,801
I think the obstacle
is the building itself.

360
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:53,139
You're saying NTAC
is trying to kill us?

361
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,706
That makes sense.

362
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,319
The building electrocuted Meghan.

363
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,248
The building caused the wind burst

364
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,756
that shattered that window
and killed Shawn Farrell.

365
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:04,522
So, what are we supposed to do?

366
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,160
Just sit here
and wait for it to pick us all off?

367
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:11,957
We're supposed to work together.
That's the whole point.

368
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:15,231
I sit in my office every day,

369
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:17,930
and I read about how
things are getting worse,

370
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,860
about how it's just a matter of time
before everything blows up.

371
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,110
A war between
positives and negatives.

372
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:29,403
That's why I brought
people from both sides here.

373
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:30,778
I wanted to help.

374
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:32,984
I wanted to bring
the two camps together.

375
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,685
So we get to watch
each other die one by one?

376
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,509
That's a hell of a valuable lesson.

377
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,281
You haven't just
put our lives at stake.

378
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:43,485
If I die, if Kyle dies here, that could
mean the end of the movement.

379
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,698
You've jeopardized
everything we've worked for.

380
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:50,209
Let's not make it easy
for this place to hurt us.

381
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:53,018
We should move all the computers
outta here. Anything electronic...

382
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,814
No, there might be a way out of this.

383
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:56,836
The last couple times I played,

384
00:22:56,956 --> 00:22:59,987
I figured out that
there's always a back door.

385
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:01,558
If I find it,

386
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:04,066
I can walk through it,
and if I do,

387
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:05,907
the game ends.

388
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,852
We all wake up.

389
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:10,767
Hopefully,
Shawn and Meghan do, too.

390
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:11,913
Where is it?

391
00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:15,663
It's usually at the far
edge of the playing field.

392
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:17,409
Wherever I woke up in the game,

393
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,756
it's as far away from there
as possible.

394
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,230
Wait, wait, you came to
in the theory room, right?

395
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,143
Marco, find some maps
of the building.

396
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:26,076
Figure out where this
back door should be.

397
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:28,887
Everyone, get to work,
and be careful.

398
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:33,302
Do you think Shawn's really gone?

399
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:37,815
I don't know. Let's hope not.

400
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:44,825
Look, I know you think
taking the shot was wrong.

401
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:47,946
But I knew what I was doing.

402
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:54,884
I mean, I knew that
following Collier meant

403
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,973
I had to get used to people dying,

404
00:23:58,571 --> 00:23:59,989
maybe even people I knew.

405
00:24:02,962 --> 00:24:04,314
I kept saying, you know,

406
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:08,904
these deaths weren't meaningless.

407
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:11,659
They were sacrifices.

408
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:14,809
I still believe that.

409
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:17,617
I do.

410
00:24:21,816 --> 00:24:23,387
But seeing Shawn lying there...

411
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:25,085
You might want to remember that feeling

412
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:27,427
the next time Collier
hands down orders.

413
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:31,741
Look, I don't want to lecture you,

414
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,691
but you don't know what it is
to worry about you the way I do.

415
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:37,554
Every time I hear something
about Collier on the news,

416
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:40,775
every time I pick up
the paper in the morning,

417
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:43,166
I'm afraid that I'm going
to learn that you're in jail,

418
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:44,475
or that you're dead.

419
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:50,014
I don't see how it could
end any other way for you.

420
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:54,898
We could win.

421
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:57,560
We could save the world.

422
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,625
Well, I want a son,
not a martyr for Collier's cause.

423
00:25:06,723 --> 00:25:08,253
Dad, that's enough gauze.

424
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,289
I'm sorry.
I guess I never stop being a dad.

425
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:23,415
I think Marco's got something.

426
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:27,938
That's it. The dead end
of this hallway on sub-level 11.

427
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:30,117
That's the farthest point
in the building from our office.

428
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,088
If P.J.'s back door is anywhere,
that's the spot.

429
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,833
- All right, I'll go.
- Not alone, you won't.

430
00:25:34,953 --> 00:25:36,138
This whole building is one big trap.

431
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,734
We're not sending you
out there on your own.

432
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:39,065
He won't be alone.

433
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:41,607
As far as I know,
I'm the only one who can end this.

434
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,109
I have to be the one
to walk through that door.

435
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:49,491
All right, get yourself ready.
We're leaving in 2 min.

436
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:50,857
I'm going with you.

437
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:53,892
This is supposed to be
an exercise in cooperation.

438
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:56,219
I think it's fitting
we divide the risk.

439
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,116
I'm thinking
we should take the stairs.

440
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,880
You cared about Shawn, didn't you?

441
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:34,301
Shawn was just a little kid
when his father left my sister.

442
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,944
I tried to take an interest in him,

443
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:44,656
do what I could
to help raise him.

444
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,739
Well, you did a fine job.

445
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:49,537
He was an extraordinary...

446
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:52,871
He is...
an extraordinary young man.

447
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,614
He and I have grown apart.

448
00:26:57,412 --> 00:26:59,562
It's difficult,
losing someone you've...

449
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:03,149
You've invested so much time in.

450
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,571
You made that bed for yourself.

451
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:09,354
Shawn broke off from you because
he didn't agree with what you believe in

452
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,193
and you were too rigid to change.

453
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:13,545
Isn't that why Kyle
pulled away from you?

454
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,676
Hey, don't compare
the two situations.

455
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:19,663
For one thing if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be standing here

456
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:21,523
wondering whether
Shawn was alive or dead.

457
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:24,239
You put the shots out there,
which is why he could take one,

458
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:26,568
and that's why two people
I care about might be dead.

459
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,625
The spread of promicin is not to blame.
The fear of it is.

460
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:32,049
Your government prevents
people who've taken the shot

461
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,198
from learning
how to control their abilities.

462
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:36,031
You've criminalized the gifted.

463
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:38,816
So what? We should all just step
aside and let you run the world?

464
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:41,648
Can you two ever stop arguing?

465
00:27:41,805 --> 00:27:44,257
You are literally going
to get us all killed!

466
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:45,689
If you can't calm down,

467
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:47,893
you both might as well
go back to OPS right now.

468
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:49,620
I'll find the way out myself.

469
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:56,810
These are the stairs. Let's go.

470
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:02,677
Would you mind going first?

471
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:07,763
I got your back.

472
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:13,474
If this back door thing doesn't work out
we're gonna need another plan.

473
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:15,987
We already know we can't
get to the generators, so...

474
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:20,893
Maia, what are you doing?

475
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:24,012
I'm just helping kyle.

476
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:25,751
We don't know this
place as well as you guys,

477
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,222
but we might as well pitch in.

478
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:29,335
I mean, who knows?
Maybe we'll come up with something.

479
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:31,907
Okay, that's great.
Maia, will you go stand with Marco?

480
00:28:32,186 --> 00:28:34,289
- Mom, we're just trying to...
- Go now.

481
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:50,259
You know, I want to get out of here too,
just the same way you do.

482
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:53,205
I know you hate me.

483
00:28:54,238 --> 00:28:57,327
Tell you the truth, I don't blame you,
but you do need to work with me.

484
00:28:57,748 --> 00:28:58,893
That's the game.

485
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:04,254
You threatened my daughter's life.

486
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,707
I know.

487
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:07,671
You shot me for it, remember?

488
00:29:07,803 --> 00:29:10,979
Yeah, six times,
more if I could have reloaded.

489
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:15,848
I really don't care what this little
exercise is supposed to be about.

490
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,822
You just stay the hell away
from Maia.

491
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:28,694
Maia, come over here.

492
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,486
That's it.

493
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:43,553
If we can get through that door,
that should be the way out.

494
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:02,053
Let me try.

495
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,465
That's me.

496
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,419
My bedroom.

497
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:28,615
Looks like we found our back door.

498
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:36,574
I know I'm going to jail
when we all wake up.

499
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,462
Just...

500
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,609
make sure everyone knows
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:58,755 --> 00:30:59,985
He's dead.

502
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:02,262
It's gone.

503
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:03,689
The way out, it's gone.

504
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,175
That won't work.

505
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:16,910
P.J. said he's the only
one who can end this early.

506
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,996
Yeah, well, I'm not giving up.

507
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:21,355
Neither am I.
The back door was just that,

508
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,760
a way out, one option.
There is another.

509
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:26,117
We play out the game.

510
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:27,666
Try to survive. Win.

511
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:29,463
- Win?
- P.J. said there was

512
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,349
a goal to every game,
an end point.

513
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:34,522
- We don't know what that is.
- Not yet,

514
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:38,045
but I doubt we'll find it down here.
We head back up to the operations room,

515
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:40,078
we stick together,
figure out a way to live.

516
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,698
Wait a second.

517
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:43,773
Is it me or is it
getting hotter in here?

518
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:49,496
That air's got to be
well over a hundred degrees.

519
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:53,897
So this place is going to cook us all?

520
00:31:54,017 --> 00:31:55,777
I don't know about you guys,
but personally

521
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:58,089
I'd rather be electrocuted
than fricasseed.

522
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,810
Nobody's getting cooked.

523
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:02,327
The environmental controls
are just a few floors down.

524
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:04,505
We can change
the temperature manually.

525
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:07,246
It won't work.
The temperature control

526
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,970
runs through
the main computer network,

527
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:10,808
and we still can't access the system.

528
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,049
We need to kill the building.

529
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,136
This place runs on power.

530
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,965
We take that away,
it can't hurt us anymore.

531
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,127
We shut the building down, we win.

532
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:25,529
Cut the power, you don't think
we've thought about that?

533
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,003
The emergency generators
are sealed off.

534
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:31,978
Well... it's actually
not that bad of an idea.

535
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,696
Look, we can't shut the generators down
because we can't get to them,

536
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,725
but if we could find a way
to create an electrical surge...

537
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,048
big enough to overload
the emergency systems...

538
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,429
There'd be a power outage.
This place would go black.

539
00:32:44,975 --> 00:32:47,942
There's two major power relays that
run throughout this entire building.

540
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:50,146
Our everyday system
and the emergency line.

541
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:53,401
If we can find a place where
the 2 relays run close to each other...

542
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:54,937
Connect the two lines and "zap"!

543
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:56,318
Short the building out.

544
00:33:02,718 --> 00:33:05,409
There. We keep all the computer
servers in that room.

545
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:07,770
Every power conduit in the building
runs through there.

546
00:33:09,897 --> 00:33:12,090
If P.J. hasn't gotten us
out of here in two minutes,

547
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,052
Marco, you and I
are heading to that room.

548
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,670
You find the longest
power cord you can

549
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,354
and strip the insulation off of it.
You're coming with us.

550
00:33:22,024 --> 00:33:23,188
It's your idea.

551
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,553
You should have
a chance to see it through.

552
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:30,358
What is that?

553
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,894
Um, the building.

554
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:33,434
I don't think it likes our plan.

555
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:36,525
What's happening?

556
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:38,628
It's not blowing air
into the room anymore.

557
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:40,114
It's sucking it out.

558
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,921
Okay, guys,
we're not waiting two minutes.

559
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,348
We're all going now.

560
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:57,784
The blast doors are down.

561
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:02,078
- <i>Hello!</i>
- Stay there.

562
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:06,453
- <i>Dad!</i>
- Kyle, what's happening?

563
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:09,787
The building shut us off!
Sucking all the air out of the room!

564
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:13,177
<i>Tom, I don't think
we've got much time!</i>

565
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:17,496
You have to try
and short-circuit the building's

566
00:34:17,703 --> 00:34:19,027
<i>power supply!</i>

567
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,722
- This was all I could find.
- We need to run that cord

568
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:34,258
between these two power relays.

569
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:36,689
If Marco's right,
that'll shut this place down.

570
00:34:40,238 --> 00:34:41,643
This is not nearly long enough.

571
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:43,064
Then find more!

572
00:34:45,814 --> 00:34:47,288
These power lines are all...

573
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,081
They're all sealed into the wall.

574
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,238
If we could rip these
out of the ceiling.

575
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:55,633
No, they're dying in that room.
We don't have time.

576
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:00,466
There is one way

577
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,097
to complete the connection
between these relays.

578
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:05,454
Us.

579
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:07,567
We complete the circuit ourselves.

580
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,246
You're talking about...

581
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:15,889
running thousands of volts
of electricity through our bodies.

582
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,966
We'll die.

583
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:19,580
We will,

584
00:35:20,263 --> 00:35:22,009
but if your colleagues are right...

585
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:25,861
We'll end this thing.

586
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,049
So how about it?

587
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,223
You don't strike me
as a man afraid of a sacrifice.

588
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:55,783
I keep telling myself it's just a game,
but you know what?

589
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,392
I still don't feel like dying.

590
00:35:57,832 --> 00:35:59,898
It's not an experience
I'm looking to revisit.

591
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:03,185
Well, I guess it's like
you're always saying...

592
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,550
Just have to have faith.

593
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:15,992
- On three?
- On three.

594
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:19,277
One...

595
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,810
Two...

596
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:26,281
Three!

597
00:36:57,393 --> 00:36:58,464
Mommy!

598
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:05,183
Sweetheart, you okay?

599
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,517
You're okay.

600
00:37:26,637 --> 00:37:27,830
You're not hurt.

601
00:37:32,462 --> 00:37:33,598
I'm fine.

602
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,004
Is Jordan here?

603
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:42,591
Have you seen him?

604
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,690
Can I talk to Tom Baldwin, please?

605
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:11,662
Hi.

606
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:15,924
We, uh... we picked up P.J.

607
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:18,938
After he woke up,
he tried to make a run for Promise City,

608
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:20,260
and, uh, we...

609
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:29,950
I'm fine, really.

610
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:31,789
It's okay.

611
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,216
I'm sorry.
It's just...

612
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,428
I watched you die last night.

613
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,888
You have no idea how good it is
to see you right now.

614
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:46,159
I'm sorry that things got...

615
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:47,971
so out of hand,

616
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:51,293
and I know I'm going to jail
for taking the shot,

617
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:54,729
so it's probably
the wrong time to say this,

618
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:56,440
but...

619
00:38:57,351 --> 00:38:59,191
if everything you told me is true,

620
00:39:00,175 --> 00:39:01,461
maybe it'll be worth it,

621
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:03,177
playing the game.

622
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:05,813
How could you say that?

623
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,940
It was scared,

624
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:11,672
but my ability worked.

625
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:15,969
Jordan Collier and Tom Baldwin

626
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:17,574
actually cooperated.

627
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:21,847
They sacrificed themselves
to save the other players.

628
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,664
That has to mean something, right?

629
00:39:26,086 --> 00:39:27,270
Let's hope so.

630
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,663
I'd hate to think you gave up
your freedom for nothing.

631
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:33,564
Someone will be here shortly
to take you downstairs.

632
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:52,696
Are you okay?

633
00:39:54,202 --> 00:39:57,113
It's going to be strange
not having P.J. in the office anymore.

634
00:39:58,008 --> 00:39:59,920
Yeah, I know it's not P.C.,

635
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,299
but I kind of admire what he did.

636
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:04,322
You know, I know Jordan Collier

637
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:06,472
a hell of a lot better
than I did a day ago,

638
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:09,430
and he knows us.
That's got to be a good thing.

639
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,037
Yeah, well...

640
00:40:11,427 --> 00:40:12,845
We'll see about that.

641
00:40:15,342 --> 00:40:16,731
Marco, I...

642
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,456
Was Maia right?
Have things gotten weird between us?

643
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,769
Kind of hard to avoid, right?

644
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:29,658
You broke up with me,

645
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:31,699
and I still have to see you
every day.

646
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:35,844
Well, if you're up for it,

647
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:38,040
I really would like to be friends,

648
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:39,931
and I promised Maia

649
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:42,226
that I would cook a meatloaf
tomorrow night, and...

650
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,245
Maybe you could come by.

651
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:45,977
I know that
she would really like that.

652
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:47,196
So would I.

653
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,061
The infamous Skouris meatloaf.

654
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:53,451
It's gotten better, I promise.

655
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,556
Will I see you then?

656
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:09,448
<i>Your son's fine.</i>

657
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:11,538
<i>We all are.</i>

658
00:41:15,277 --> 00:41:16,554
I wanted you to know.

659
00:41:20,304 --> 00:41:21,653
Well, I appreciate that.

660
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,581
I've been leaving
him messages all morning.

661
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:27,217
I talked to shawn a while ago.
He's...

662
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,276
He's doing all righ, too.

663
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:31,865
I don't want
any misunderstanding.

664
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:33,977
Nothing's changed between us.

665
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:38,146
I'm still gonna give promicin to anyone
who wants to make a difference.

666
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,668
<i>And I will still build Promise City.</i>

667
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:42,396
And you're gonna wind up
in handcuff,

668
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:44,397
and I'm gonna be
the one putting them on you.

669
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:49,090
You called me Jordan just then.

670
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:58,109
I guess I did.

671
00:41:59,962 --> 00:42:01,680
P.J. accomplished that much, anyway.

672
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:05,870
So... Tom...

673
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,164
Would you like to hang up,
or shall I?
