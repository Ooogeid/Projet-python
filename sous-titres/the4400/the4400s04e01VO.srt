00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,772
These shots are free.

4
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:50,364
Give them to anyone
who wants them,

5
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,163
but be careful
to explain the risks.

6
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:54,697
Handing out promicin like candy
changes everything, Shawn.

7
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:57,420
Nobody can predict what's going
to happen once people everywhere

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,689
start developing abilities.

9
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:01,111
How's it going, sibling?

10
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,256
April Skouris,
black sheep of the family.

11
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,164
You don't really
know this girl, do you?

12
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:06,652
While we were planning
our wedding,

13
00:01:06,752 --> 00:01:08,593
you were working with Ryland,
betraying me...

14
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,013
- Where's the promicin?
- Get your hands off of me.

15
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:12,746
He's stable.
that's the good news.

16
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:15,574
But he hasn't regained consciousness.
They don't know when he will.

17
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:16,908
I have a job offer
in Spain.

18
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:18,145
If you come with me.

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,683
If Collier's right, if moving
into this new world of his

20
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:22,562
means more upheaval
in the here and now,

21
00:01:22,662 --> 00:01:24,707
I'm going to find myself a place
where I can live

22
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:26,591
at peace with my daughter
as long as I can.

23
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:28,265
Alana's picture's gone out
to every hospital

24
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:29,699
and law enforcement
agency in the country.

25
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,719
Nobody's seen her, Tom.
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:40,886
Hey, Kyle!

27
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:43,122
You ready? Come on, buddy.
It's starting soon.

28
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:44,769
You think
I'd be late for this?

29
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:46,482
I'm as psyched
as you are, dad.

30
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:47,899
Good,
let's do it, then.

31
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:20,245
I saved you
some seats.

32
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:21,462
Sorry.

33
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:24,570
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, Maia.

34
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,203
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:28,444
You said you'd be late,
so I held things up for you.

36
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:39,873
Hey, guys.

37
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,417
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

38
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:43,779
Hi, Tess.
Hi, honey.

39
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,931
Good to see you.

40
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,688
- Kevin...
- How are you?

41
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:49,507
I thought
you'd never make it.

42
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,160
Well, I had a little help.

43
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:58,872
Thank you.

44
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:00,655
I appreciate the applause,

45
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,622
even though I know
who it's really for.

46
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:04,951
We're all here to give thanks
to one man,

47
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,402
a man who took
a dark and dangerous world...

48
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:08,518
and healed it.

49
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:10,944
A man who eliminated
disease and war

50
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:13,630
and changed our ideas
of what it is to be a human being.

51
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,765
He made 4400 abilities
available to everyone,

52
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:19,152
and all of our lives
are better for it.

53
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:20,865
Some call him
a savior,

54
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:22,515
some call him a messiah.

55
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,268
He's all that and more.
Ladies and gentlemen, M. Jordan Collier.

56
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:38,174
Today,
this morning,

57
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:40,640
here and everywhere,

58
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,107
it is good to be alive!

59
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:51,195
United, like humanity
has never been united.

60
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:53,774
Through promicin,
the gift I brought you,

61
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:55,923
and that you... accepted.

62
00:03:57,273 --> 00:04:00,140
Together, we have created
heaven on earth,

63
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:01,789
a time of joy,

64
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:03,722
endless joy,

65
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:06,072
that we share
as one.

66
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:08,472
And for that,

67
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,756
I say let us bow our heads
in thanks.

68
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:07,100
It's okay.

69
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,208
It was a dream.

70
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:12,377
You were dreaming...
again.

71
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,529
What was it about this time?

72
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,610
I handed out the promicin.

73
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,143
I stopped the catastrophe.

74
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,993
It was the right thing to do.

75
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,055
We saved the future from...

76
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:30,271
I know...

77
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:32,705
what kind of world I prevented.

78
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:37,138
But is the world I created
any better?

More, please.

85
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:06,579
That is
so disgusting.

86
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:08,996
You said you wouldn't do that
in front of me anymore.

87
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,096
It's gross.

88
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,029
It's not disgusting.
It's love,

89
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:15,613
and one day,
you'll understand.

90
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:20,017
So, mommy,
when are you going to tell us?

91
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:23,475
Tell us what?

92
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,225
Mommy got the job offer.

93
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,350
The job with the european union
came through?

94
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,900
She'll be advising them
on all things 4400.

95
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,067
They said we could live
anywhere in the E.U.

96
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,091
The benefit package
is unbelievable.

97
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,237
Is there anything
the job doesn't come with?

98
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:40,672
Yeah, a gun,

99
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,939
which makes it
just about perfect.

100
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:45,001
If I take this,

101
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:47,768
it means that we're not
just on vacation anymore.

102
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,760
We have to settle down
somewhere.

103
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:52,964
So how about it?

104
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,224
Is everyone ready
to put down some roots?

105
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:21,162
- Hey, dad.
- When did you get back into town?

106
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,079
Why didn't you call me?

107
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:24,179
Honestly?

108
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:28,895
The way things left off, I wasn't sure
you wanted to hear from me.

109
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:32,904
You said you wanted some distance.
I was trying to respect that,

110
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,433
but you should
know you...

111
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,316
You can talk to me any time.

112
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,038
I start this new job tomorrow.

113
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:40,180
It's a legal aid thing
helping out the 4400.

114
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,329
I was going to get a hotel, you know,
while I looked for an apartment,

115
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,413
but it just seemed kind of stupid
you being here all by yourself.

116
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:48,857
Still no word
on Alana?

117
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:56,473
I could use some company.

118
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,463
I'm sorry she's gone, dad.

119
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,671
I really liked her.

120
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:11,238
She loved you.

121
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:12,905
Yeah, I know.

122
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,079
I keep hoping
that I'll come home some day,

123
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:19,754
and she's just going to be here.

124
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,302
I'm going to go unpack. OK?

125
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:26,894
I want to go
see Shawn later.

126
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:33,923
Welcome home.

127
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:37,073
Thanks.

128
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,443
<i>The good news is
I'm not dead.

129
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,901

<i>Such a stupid geek.

140
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,355
All right, guys, get in here.

141
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,487
Time to pick teams.
Come on, move it.

142
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,130

Graham.

146
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,537

147
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:51,940
Me?

148
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:54,157
Wait a minute.

149
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,482
- I'm taking Graham.
- Guys...

150
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,340
come one,
stop messing with me.

151
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,640
Everyone knows
I suck at basketball.

152
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,748
Listen up.

153
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,398
If Graham doesn't want to
shoot hoops,

154
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,598
then hoops is off the menu.

155
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:10,248
So how about it,
Graham?

156
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:11,923
What do you
want to play?

157
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,273
You're serious?

158
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,907
Absolutely.

159
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,614
We can play
whatever you want.

160
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:19,830
Tell us what to do.

161
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,763
- Thumb wrestling?
- All right...

162
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:24,813
thumb wrestling it is.

163
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:26,139
Pair up!

164
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:28,447
You two over here,
come on, come on, move it!

165
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:31,098
You two guys, over here.
Mike, you and Billy over here.

166
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:46,637
What's going on?

167
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,903
Say hello to
the new head of NTAC.

168
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:51,361
I don't get it.

169
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,988
The woman doesn't have a single day
of law enforcement experience.

170
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,982
She works in a think tank
for a few years,

171
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,487
so they give her a gun and a badge
and tell her to go play sheriff?

172
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,399
I heard she managed
the flow of refugees

173
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,764
after the hurricanes
in texas,

174
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:04,821
- and did a good job of it, too.
- She's a political appointment.

175
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,018
Probably smiled at the right person
at some cocktail party,

176
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:09,194
so they passed over
all the qualified people.

177
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:10,489
Oh, and, Tom...

178
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,056
she said she wanted to see you
as soon as you got in.

179
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:23,265
- Hi. I'm...
- ... Tom Baldwin.

180
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:25,611
I know.
Meghan Doyle.

181
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,311
Does that look
straight to you?

182
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:32,089
Sure. That...

183
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:33,488
It looks good.

184
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,055
You must like subtitles.

185
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,839
Have you ever seen
<i>La Dolce Vita</i>?

186
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,122
Honestly? No.

187
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,502
I'm getting the distinct impression
no one else around here has either,

188
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:44,691
but that's okay.

189
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,207
You should check it out, though.

190
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,008
Okay, I'll do that.

191
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:50,387
Relax, Tom.
It's not homework.

192
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,620
Please, come
and sit down.

193
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:58,089
There's something
I want you to see.

194
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:01,223
Something to get us off
on the right foot.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,803
Open it.

196
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,153
It's interesting.

197
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,961
You do know I'm not cleared
to read this?

198
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:10,865
Of course,
but I've read your file.

199
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:14,019
You don't seem like the kind of agent
who'd let that bother you.

200
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,116
Go ahead.

201
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:17,866
I won't tell if you won't.

202
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,990
This is all about Isabelle Tyler.

203
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,790
- Why are you showing me this?
- She can have visitors now.

204
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,990
I figured you might
want to see her.

205
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:36,115
I know you've been looking for
Alana Mareva for three months.

206
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,182
I also know
that you're at a dead end.

207
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,475
You must have considered the possibility
that she was abducted again.

208
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,147
Of course, people don't just fall
off the edge of the planet.

209
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:46,064
Isabelle Tyler
is the one person alive

210
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:48,198
with a tangible connection
to the future.

211
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,303
If they did take Alana,

212
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,107
maybe Isabelle will be able to
tell you something.

213
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,991
You sure this isn't going to
blow back on you?

214
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,632
You just started.
I don't want to get you in trouble.

215
00:13:56,732 --> 00:14:00,174
If I succeed in this job,
if I bring in Jordan Collier,

216
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,137
no one's going to mind
if a few rules are broken along the way,

217
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:04,265
and if I don't,

218
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,205
no amount of toeing the line
will save me.

219
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,278
I appreciate this.
Thanks.

220
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:16,890
You know those posters.

221
00:14:18,177 --> 00:14:20,948
You have a taste for foreign films,
people think you're intellectual

222
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:22,139
or a radical.

223
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:25,339
The truth is,
I just like the movies.

224
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:30,565
Are you sure you don't like
that they make people uncomfortable?

225
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:32,815
Maybe that, too.

226
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:49,509
Hey, buddy.

227
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:50,892
Can you hear me?

228
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,334
My dad says
when I was in a coma,

229
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,213
he used to talk to me
all the time.

230
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:03,591
I don't remember any of it,
but...

231
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:05,374
who knows?
Maybe it helped.

232
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,048
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

233
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:13,315
I tried.

234
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:17,486
Three months ago,
I took the shot.

235
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,953
I was so scared,
but I just did it anyway.

236
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,553
I was thinking
maybe I could wake you up.

237
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,362
Same as you did for me.

238
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,529
Want to hear the punch line?
Nothing happened.

239
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:36,596
Three months, no ability.
Nothing. I mean, nothing.

240
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,810
Nothing's changed at all,
really.

241
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:46,127
That's weird, huh?

242
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:50,522
I tried.

243
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,255
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:17,842
Hello?

245
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,966
Excuse me.

246
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,633
Are you lost?

247
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,124
Help me.

248
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:37,507
Help me.

249
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,613
<i>There are dead people
everywhere I go.

250
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:48,247
They hate me.

251
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:51,713
I made them dead.

252
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,113
We made them dead.

253
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,921
Tess, we gave them a choice.

254
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:57,188
We didn't force
the shots on anyone.

255
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:02,848
I want you to take
your medication.

256
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:05,864
All right?
It'll make you feel better.

257
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:07,331
Come on,
come on.

258
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,611
She'll calm down
once she's had her pills.

259
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:20,761
Is that your medical opinion?

260
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,561
Tess is schizophrenic.

261
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,327
The strain of hiding out,
the guilt over what we did,

262
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:28,485
she can't handle it.

263
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:31,280
It's caused a break.
She needs medical care

264
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,527
beyond what
we can provide.

265
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:34,627
Till I find a doctor
sympathetic to us,

266
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:37,611
you'll have to administer
her medications yourself.

267
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:41,216
Well, you just remember,

268
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:43,666
Tess' ability...

269
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:45,881
is what keeps you safe.

270
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,848
If it wasn't for her, you'd have
been arrested a long time ago.

271
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:50,015
And I promise you,

272
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:53,048
I don't care
if the fate of the world is at stake,

273
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:56,455
I will not sacrifice Tess
to you.

274
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:00,730
Or your cause.

275
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,630
Our cause, Kevin.

276
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,430
Ours.

277
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:38,261
Hey, guys.

278
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,413
- What's up?
- All of us were talking,

279
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,554
and we just want you to know

280
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,333
we're with you.
All of us.

281
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:47,980
We believe.

282
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:50,405
- In what?
- In you.

283
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,574
We're not the only ones.

284
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:54,848
We brought someone.

285
00:18:58,703 --> 00:18:59,811
Oh, my god.

286
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:03,325
Amber?

287
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:05,953
What are you doing here?

288
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:07,511
I came to be with you.

289
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:16,604
What the hell is going...

290
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:20,711
Amber, wait a minute.

291
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:25,870
You know those shots
you always hear about on the news?

292
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:30,324
I took them.

293
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:34,116
I think maybe
it's screwing you guys up.

294
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:35,872
No, Graham, it's you.

295
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:37,750
We want to be close to you.

296
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,440
We want to be close
to the light.

297
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:42,139
- What light?
- The one that shines out of you.

298
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:43,999
I didn't see it until today,

299
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:45,392
but now I do.

300
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:47,043
It's beautiful.

301
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,699
You're beautiful.

302
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,513
Are you sure
you want to do this?

303
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:15,557
They told you to kill me.

304
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:18,196
You didn't do it.

305
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:21,655
Did you ever think maybe
that's why your girlfriend's gone?

306
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,704
It's your punishment.

307
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:26,291
Is that something you think,
or is that something you know?

308
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:33,432
How's Shawn?

309
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:35,695
Any change?

310
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:40,135
He's in a regular hospital now.
Long-term care.

311
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:42,508
What about my father?
Has anybody heard from him?

312
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,395
No, he's on our list,
and we'll find him.

313
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:45,536
Now, Isabelle,

314
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:48,592
if you know anything
about Alana, please tell me.

315
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,620
Just tell me, please!

316
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:57,804
You want to have hope,
don't you?

317
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,626
You want to believe
she's coming back.

318
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:01,247
Of course.

319
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,229
Then you don't want to know
what I know.

320
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:07,857
I'm sorry, Tom.
I really am,

321
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,005
but they used you.

322
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:12,828
The same way they used me.

323
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:24,433
- <i>Hola</i>?
- <i>Hey, Diana.</i>

324
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,831
It's me, Marco.

325
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,521
<i>Are you having
a good time in Spain?</i>

326
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:29,942
Yeah, hey, Marco!

327
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:31,836
Yeah, no, everything's good.

328
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,444
Are you okay?

329
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,326
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

330
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:38,482
Uh, something came up, though.

331
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:42,240
<i>A couple days ago,
some agents raided an apartment.</i>

332
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:44,352
<i>There was a lot of promicin there.</i>

333
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,026
One of the guys they brought in
gave up a whole bunch of names.

334
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:48,606
People they'd given syringes to?

335
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:50,723
Okay, so what is it
you want to tell me, Marco?

336
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,959
One of the names
was April Skouris.

337
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:00,680
My sister took the shots?

338
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:02,864
<i>The guy didn't know
if she actually injected them,</i>

339
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:04,560
<i>but she definitely had them.</i>

340
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,582
<i>Have you heard from her?</i>

341
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,772
No, I haven't heard from her
in months.

342
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,744
She didn't call me on my birthday,
but I...

343
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,816
figured, April, you know?

344
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:14,895
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

345
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:17,861
Look, I'm sorry, Di.

346
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:19,880
I just... You know,
I thought you should know.

347
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:21,319
I appreciate it.

348
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:23,244
Thanks.

349
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,038
Bye.

350
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:28,442
You're going back to Seattle,

351
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:30,314
aren't you?

352
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,606
That used to be a statue
of our namesake.

353
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:37,613
Last night,
a dozen students tore it down

354
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,205
and put that thing up.

355
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:41,449
When we asked them why,

356
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,026
they said it was a statue
of Graham Holt.

357
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:46,611
Who's Graham Holt?

358
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,654
He's a junior.

359
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:52,335
C student.
Basically unremarkable in every way.

360
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:55,254
So this kid pulls a prank,
and you call NTAC?

361
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:58,605
I called NTAC because I think maybe
this kid took some of those shots.

362
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,708
I mean, what's going on around here
isn't normal.

363
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:02,479
The posters, the statue.

364
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:05,108
Last night, our valedictorian

365
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,700
revised her application essay
to Stanford.

366
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:11,022
She read it to her guidance counselor
this morning.

367
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,855
It's 500 words
on how Graham Holt

368
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:15,791
is the most important
spiritual leader

369
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,357
since the time of Christ.

370
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:20,644
I called him into my office
earlier this morning.

371
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:23,907
He claims to have no idea
about what's going on.

372
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,496
I think we need to meet
this Graham Holt.

373
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:28,198
From now on,
everyone's favorite band

374
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:29,541
is <i>TV on the Radio</i>.

375
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,539
Got that?
<i>TV on the Radio</i>.

376
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:33,172
They're the best band out there.

377
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:35,018
Excuse me. Graham?

378
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:36,817
These gentlemen'd like
to have a word with you.

379
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,602
I'm agent Baldwin.
this is agent Garrity.

380
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:39,719
We work at NTAC.

381
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,551
We're gonna have
to ask you to come with us.

382
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:45,778
We're gonna bring you in to NTAC
and give you a test

383
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:47,521
to see if you're
promicin positive.

384
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:50,082
- Why?
- Look around you, Graham.

385
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:51,303
I think you know why.

386
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:52,803
Do I have a choice?

387
00:23:52,903 --> 00:23:54,734
You have a choice whether or not
you do it in handcuffs.

388
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:55,844
If you haven't taken the shot,

389
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:58,168
you don't have anything
to worry about. Come on.

390
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:24,938
You're sitting in my spot.

391
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:31,572
I didn't realize
these benches were assigned.

392
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:32,716
Well, they are.

393
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:34,297
Literally.

394
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:36,718
I'm in my first year
at the institute.

395
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:38,314
Art and design?

396
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,727
I'm supposed to do
a charcoal sketch

397
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,396
of a view from the park
every day for seven days.

398
00:24:43,603 --> 00:24:44,682
You're in my spot.

399
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:47,334
Okay. I'll move.

400
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,865
- I'll move.
- Thanks, Kyle.

401
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:52,076
I appreciate that.

402
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:55,844
How do you know my name?

403
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:58,072
Honestly?

404
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:01,025
I recognized you
as soon as I walked up.

405
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,575
I read a lot about the 4400.

406
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:05,772
Which means I read a lot about you.

407
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,842
I guess you know all about
me and Jordan Collier?

408
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,082
Yeah, I do.

409
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:11,818
Kind of hard to avoid.

410
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,381
You know it wasn't me
who shot him right?

411
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:17,535
Not really me.

412
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:20,098
I didn't really believe it was you.

413
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,714
You didn't look like a killer to me.

414
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,511
I guess that's a kind of compliment.

415
00:25:25,638 --> 00:25:26,708
Thank you.

416
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:28,797
I have to get back to work,

417
00:25:28,897 --> 00:25:30,694
but good luck
with your assignment.

418
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:33,157
Cassie...

419
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:34,472
Dunleavy.

420
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:41,018
Maybe I'll see you around.

421
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:44,294
I'll be here
for the next seven days.

422
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:50,028
Seems to me there's
a very simple explanation

423
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:51,696
for what's going on
at Stevenson High.

424
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:53,476
This kid, Graham,
took the promicin shot,

425
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:55,525
and now everyone who meets him
thinks he's god.

426
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,487
Come on, come on.
I've heard you tend to move

427
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,511
directly to the point, Marco,
but really, god?

428
00:25:59,652 --> 00:26:02,554
Well, obviously,
he's not <i>the</i> god.

429
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:05,875
At best, he's <i>a</i> god,
a minor deity.

430
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:08,164
Whatever. These kids
are building effigies of him.

431
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:10,029
They're willing to fight us
to protect him.

432
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,211
Sounds like worship to me.

433
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:12,811
You are lucky
you weren't turned.

434
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:14,935
Seems like you only need
a couple minutes around Graham

435
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:16,144
before you find religion.

436
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:17,476
Maybe they're unlucky.

437
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,729
Absolute devotion is
a rarity in the modern age.

438
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,800
It might bring a real sense
of purpose to life.

439
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,400
- A clarity.
- Guys, what do we do with this kid?

440
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,483
We go back with more people.
We isolate him.

441
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:29,182
- Hope the effects wear off.
- But I'd do it fast.

442
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,443
Sounds like Graham's
pretty much focused

443
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:32,740
on being king of the school.

444
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:34,642
Imagine what happens
if he learns to think

445
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:36,254
a little more ambitiously.

446
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:42,435
What the hell is that?

447
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:03,280
Are you here
to give yourselves

448
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:05,646
body and soul
to Graham Holt?

449
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,114
Not exactly.

450
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:10,485
Then I suggest you leave.

451
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,692
These streets are his.

452
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:15,518
We'll defend them
with our lives.

453
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:30,202
Just take your men
around that way.

454
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:37,137
This is me, Graham.

455
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:39,583
- What do you want?
- <i>I want you to end this, Graham.</i>

456
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:41,615
If you don't come out,
these people are gonna get hurt.

457
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:43,973
- That what you want?
- <i>No, of course not.</i>

458
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:45,908
These people are just
trying to protect me.

459
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:48,849
You're forcing them to be here.
You've taken away their free will.

460
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:50,927
- Their lives are in your hands.
- <i>I understand.</i>

461
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,265
<i>I don't want anything bad
to happen to them either,</i>

462
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,697
but you just need to
give me some time.

463
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:58,022
<i>Like, a night to figure this out.</i>

464
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,398
<i>Okay? One night.</i>

465
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,601
I just bought us some time.

466
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:07,479
We've got planning to do.

467
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:18,086
Try not to look so gloomy, okay?

468
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,761
And who knows?

469
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:22,864
She might not even be able
to get into Seattle.

470
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:25,421
She'd be right back here
in a couple hours.

471
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:29,669
She's never coming back here.

472
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:34,334
She said she is, Maia,

473
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,740
and I really need
to believe that.

474
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,836
So, Kyle,

475
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:54,302
tell me,

476
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:56,254
you ever go visit
your cousin, Shawn?

477
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,296
Hasn't been much in the paper
about him lately.

478
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:02,094
- Is he getting any better?
- No, he's not.

479
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:04,302
Which is weird
cause the doctors say

480
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:05,543
there's no reason
why he shouldn't be awake.

481
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,735
His brain's active,
his vital signs are okay.

482
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,083
That's so sad.

483
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:12,029
He seemed like
a really good guy.

484
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:13,654
Everyone's just given up.

485
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,374
Settling in for the long haul.

486
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:20,596
Didn't I read something
about the promicin in his system?

487
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:22,799
The doctors think it's all out of whack?

488
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:24,632
That's right.
They think that's why he...

489
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:28,208
His body shut down but I don't think
that made it into the papers.

490
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,324
Well, it must have.

491
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:31,305
How else would I know about it?

492
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:35,835
Okay, I know I'm not a doctor,

493
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:38,573
but maybe someone
should try injecting him

494
00:29:38,673 --> 00:29:40,258
with a big old dose of promicin.

495
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,309
It'd be like giving him
a jump start, right?

496
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,170
Shawn's a 4400.

497
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,654
- Probably wouldn't hurt him.
- I've thought about that.

498
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:50,312
The doctors won't even consider it.

499
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:51,940
Promicin is seriously illegal.

500
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:55,476
Too bad you can't
get your hands on any.

501
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,863
You might be the only person
in his life who cares enough

502
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:01,211
to actually take a shot
at waking him up.

503
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:41,426
They've just been standing here
staring at us for hours.

504
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,091
Don't they ever have to
use the bathroom?

505
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:47,526
Head's up.

506
00:30:50,336 --> 00:30:51,425
Don't shoot!

507
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:53,488
My name's Graham Holt.
I want to surrender.

508
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:54,857
It's about time.

509
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:56,664
Hands up.
keep your hands up.

510
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,739
All right, on your knees.

511
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,238
Easy...

512
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:03,126
It's not him!

513
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,409
It's not holt!

514
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:06,349
Don't shoot!
My name's Graham Holt.

515
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:08,415
On your knees!
Now! On your knees!

516
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:11,492
Don't shoot!

517
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:13,989
I'm Graham Holt...

518
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,324
Don't fight me.

519
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,855
Join me.

520
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:04,360
<i>Hey, everyone.
my name's Graham Holt.</i>

521
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:06,510
<i>I just wanted to say,</i>

522
00:32:06,768 --> 00:32:08,280
<i>you have nothing
to be afraid of.</i>

523
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:11,404
<i>Believing in me doesn't
make you a different person.</i>

524
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:13,418
<i>You'll still love your family.</i>

525
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,494
<i>You'll still wake up
in the morning</i>

526
00:32:15,594 --> 00:32:17,690
<i>and go do
whatever it is you do.</i>

527
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:19,991
<i>You'll just have more purpose,</i>

528
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:23,045
<i>and everyone will believe
exactly what you do,</i>

529
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,725
<i>and you'll believe
what they do.</i>

530
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,832
<i>It's all going to be very cool.</i>

531
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,875
- <i>I promise.</i>
- She's gone.

532
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,584
She must have left
in the middle of the night.

533
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:35,429
Did you hear me?
She's gone.

534
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:40,506
What are you doing?
We have to find her

535
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:41,765
before someone picks her up.

536
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:44,109
You'll have to go without me.

537
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:47,698
What do you mean,
"go without you"?

538
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:49,153
This is Tess. You owe her.

539
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:51,025
I did not give out promicin
to the world

540
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:54,400
to have it unite
under a 16-year-old boy.

541
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:57,041
He has to be stopped.

542
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,419
<i>It's all going to be very cool,
I promise.</i>

543
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:02,519
I see.

544
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:05,251
You're having messiah envy.

545
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,790
How are you going to stop him,
Jordan?

546
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:12,379
Anybody who gets near that kid
winds up praying to him.

547
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:13,806
What makes you any different?

548
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,446
And even if you could
get close to him,

549
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:17,991
what do you expect to happen?

550
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:19,618
A miracle?

551
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:22,773
I guess I need one, don't I?

552
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:25,242
<i>...you'll just have more purpose,</i>

553
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:28,322
<i>and everyone will believe
exactly what you do,</i>

554
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,017
<i>and you'll believe
what they do.</i>

555
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:34,177
<i>It's all going to be very cool,
I promise.</i>

556
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,098
Are you guys nuts?
I'm an NTAC agent!

557
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:39,535
We're on the same side!

558
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,028
Hey, come on, come on!

559
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,094
Guys, guys...

560
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:02,535
They're arresting
everybody at NTAC.

561
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:04,058
What are you talking about?
Why?

562
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:06,070
Our orders are
to bring you all downtown, sir.

563
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:08,251
Graham wants to bring
NTAC into the fold.

564
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:11,762
Fine. Fine. Sounds good.

565
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,968
What choice do we have, huh?

566
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,464
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

567
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,643
Graham converted
a couple of police stations.

568
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:21,179
The cops are arresting people,

569
00:34:21,348 --> 00:34:22,869
bringing them to him
by the hundreds.

570
00:34:57,784 --> 00:34:59,924
I'm the king of Seattle!

571
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:09,725
Why aren't you picking up
the phone?

572
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:11,641
I told you it's dangerous
outside right now.

573
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:12,766
Now, call me back.

574
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:15,041
Still no word from your son?

575
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:16,834
- No. What did D.C. say?
- Nothing good.

576
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:18,850
They're already talking
acceptable losses,

577
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:21,323
air strikes, sending
an army division into the city.

578
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,898
They're gonna invade an american city?
Sounds a lot like civil war to me.

579
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,231
I know. Best I could do
was buy us a couple hours.

580
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,207
- To do what?
- We have to gather everyone from NTAC

581
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:30,307
that hasn't been converted,
make our way downtown,

582
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:32,107
fight our way downtown
if we have to.

583
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,722
We'll try to get close to Graham.

584
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:35,946
We'll see if we can get to him
before he gets to us.

585
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,581
Oh, my god. Shawn!
What happened?

586
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,343
I don't know. He was just lying there
and he started convulsing.

587
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:31,997
Oh, my god...

588
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,254
Hey, come on.

589
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:47,629
Hey, Shawn. Hey...
Hey, it's us.

590
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
It's Kyle.

591
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:52,377
Say something if you're okay.

592
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:54,002
Come on.

593
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:57,095
Mom?

594
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:00,571
How did I get here?

595
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:36,482
Mr. Collier...

596
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:38,294
You did the right thing
coming to me.

597
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,986
It would've been a shame
if I had to track you down.

598
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,624
Seems the world
is falling at your feet.

599
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:46,618
I wanted to see why.

600
00:37:46,842 --> 00:37:47,873
Don't worry.

601
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:50,044
Soon, it's all going to make
perfect sense to you.

602
00:37:57,454 --> 00:37:58,835
I gave you promicin.

603
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:00,534
I can take it away.

604
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:20,127
What did you do to me?

605
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:23,507
I made you ordinary.

606
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:27,998
Shoot him!
Shoot him now!

607
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,759
The world
doesn't need you anymore.

608
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,041
It has me.

609
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:49,188
Get on with your lives.

610
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,827
Graham shouldn't have converted
so many cops.

611
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:20,261
One of his former followers
arrested him right there,

612
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:21,427
on the steps of the courthouse.

613
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,817
And there's no trace of promicin
in his system? Nothing?

614
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,865
No, he's just a high school kid
with a lot to answer for.

615
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:30,086
I guess we can all stop
wondering if Collier has an ability.

616
00:39:30,218 --> 00:39:31,496
He can neutralize promicin.

617
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:32,604
I don't get it.

618
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:36,005
Shawn never said anything about Collier
doing that to one of the original 4400.

619
00:39:36,637 --> 00:39:38,098
Maybe it doesn't work on them.

620
00:39:38,403 --> 00:39:40,374
Maybe he can only do it
to the extra crispies.

621
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:43,995
Extra crispies,
you know, like,

622
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:46,065
not the original recipe 4400?

623
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,745
People who took the promicin shot
and then got an ability.

624
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:49,856
So Collier...

625
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:52,461
walked into what was essentially
an occupied Seattle,

626
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:54,407
laid hands on this kid,
and solved a problem

627
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:56,436
that had the entire
U.S. government in a panic.

628
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:59,072
If I was sitting at home
watching this story on the 6:00 news,

629
00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:00,729
you want to know what I'd be thinking?

630
00:40:01,688 --> 00:40:03,275
People were praying
to the wrong guy.

631
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,195
Collier just posted a message
on the Internet.

632
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:10,668
<i>We all had a scare today.</i>

633
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:13,218
<i>We'll have others
before we're done.</i>

634
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:16,704
<i>We...</i>

635
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,184
<i>We're walking a difficult
and a dangerous path,</i>

636
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,796
<i>but we're walking it together.</i>

637
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,757
<i>Whether you've chosen
to join me or not,</i>

638
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,774
</i>we're all, every one of us,</i>

639
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,516
<i>making history now.</i>

640
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:36,773
I got a call from the warden
at kurland prison.

641
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:38,982
There's a message for you
from Isabelle Tyler.

642
00:40:41,102 --> 00:40:42,117
That's it?

643
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:43,645
The Powell museum?

644
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,323
She said your answer's there,

645
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:46,936
and you'll know it
when you see it.

646
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:52,181
<i>The time for
sitting on the fence is over.</i>

647
00:40:53,195 --> 00:40:55,289
<i>The time for greatness is now.</i>

648
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,413
<i>Each of you has a role to play.</i>

649
00:40:57,513 --> 00:41:00,468
<i>Your only choice
is whether you accept it</i>

650
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:02,422
<i>or have it thrust upon you.</i>

651
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:04,901
<i>Promicin is out there.</i>

652
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:06,532
<i>People are gaining abilities,</i>

653
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,222
<i>and nothing can be done
about that...</i>

654
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:10,714
I'm sorry, sir. There's no student
named Cassie Dunleavy

655
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:12,954
- registered at this school...
- She said she's a student here.

656
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,147
I really need to talk to her.

657
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:16,117
Can't find in the phonebook
can't find her anywhere.

658
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:17,957
Maybe she didn't give you
her real name.

659
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,624
Have you thought of that?

660
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,893
<i>The genie will not go back
into the bottle.</i>

661
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:25,869
<i>I know it's tempting...</i>

662
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:28,352
<i>to think that we can hold on
to the past,</i>

663
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:31,573
<i>to everything
that's safe and easy,</i>

664
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,558
<i>but we cannot,</i>

665
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:35,914
<i>and safe and easy,</i>

666
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:39,418
<i>are what set us on the path
to catastrophe in the first place.</i>

667
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:41,584
<i>The chains of comfort...</i>

668
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:45,110
<i>are what keep us from reaching
for a better world.</i>

669
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:47,977
<i>This new era, it's not coming,</i>

670
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:49,979
<i>it's not on the way,
it's here,</i>

671
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:54,511
<i>and we are now separated
from our old lives</i>

672
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:58,276
<i>by a gulf that can never again
be bridged.</i>

673
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:01,379
<i>So all of you, out there,</i>

674
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,603
<i>need to ask yourself one thing,</i>

675
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:08,447
<i>are you ready?</i>
