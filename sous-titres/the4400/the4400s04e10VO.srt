2
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,413
The world will have to
deal with us.

00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,681
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,732
Jordan, you've done
great things for the 4400,

5
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,516
but you are on
the wrong path here.

6
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,564
And you've always
been rebellious.

7
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:56,047
But I think
you're afraid of change, Shawn.

8
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:58,345
Or is it just me?

9
00:00:58,445 --> 00:00:59,970
I'm shrinking.
What did you do to me?

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,730
I met Cora.
She has an amazing ability.

11
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,600
She can actually
make people younger.

12
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:05,604
- Isabelle?
- Daddy!

13
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:07,824
If your mother were here,
she'd want us to do this.

14
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,408
She'd want us to be
a family again.

15
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,558
When your wife fainted
this morning,

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,795
she was a young woman.

17
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:16,160
When she woke up
less than a minute later,

18
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:18,315
she was 50 years older?

19
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:19,848
Richard, I'm dying.

20
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,541
There's a faction of elites

21
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:25,160
who want the future
to stay exactly as it is.

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,981
I call them "The Marked."

23
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:30,425
When we need him...

24
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:32,775
he'll be there for us.

25
00:01:35,122 --> 00:01:36,122
Mr. Tyler,

26
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:39,150
can you hear my voice?

27
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,838
He's been under
for almost 20 minutes.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,210
We should have begun
the procedure already.

29
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,138
Where have you been?

30
00:01:58,346 --> 00:01:59,346
Who are you?

31
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,171
We have to work fast.

32
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:12,005
This is our only chance.

33
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:14,588
I've practiced enough...

34
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:17,560
with plenty of time.

35
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:23,283
Tonight, Richard Tyler
becomes a father.

36
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:37,387
Are you okay?

37
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:39,711
Yeah, I'm fine.

38
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,511
Just had a... weird dream.

39
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,487
You wanna talk about it?

40
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:46,460
No, I'm okay.

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,810
You should go back to bed.

42
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,208
I'll be right there.

43
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:07,973
Ready, you're ready ?

44
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:23,855
Daddy loves you.

45
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,355
It's nice to see you happy,
sweetheart.

46
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,483
Daddy's been wanting that
for long time.

47
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:22,082
Who are you?

48
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,049
Who am I?

49
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:29,506
I'm Lily... your wife.

50
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:34,836
Who else would I be?

<i>You're not lily.
Lily is dead.</i>

57
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:41,637
- Dead?
- You got old. You passed on.

58
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:43,152
No, you're wrong.
I'm...

59
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,752
I'm right here.
I didn't die.

60
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:48,663
Where have you been?
How did you get here?

61
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,443
Well, I woke up
about an hour ago. I...

62
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,999
I wasn't sure where I was.
Not exactly, but...

63
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,937
Somehow knew
you'd be home soon,

64
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:00,434
and you'd have Isabelle.

65
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:06,204
That's the last thing I remember.
I was...

66
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:09,404
I was looking for her at the Center,
and she wasn't in her crib.

67
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,520
You look different, Richard.
You look sad.

68
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,004
- You are not real.
- You keep saying that, but I feel real.

69
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:18,467
I mean I remember
everything about my life,

70
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:20,002
about us.

71
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,252
I can pick things up.

72
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,904
I can touch things.

73
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:28,904
You.

74
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:33,105
You can feel that, right?

75
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,812
I can't explain
where I've been, Richard,

76
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:39,912
or how I got here, but...

77
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,769
I'm not questioning it, either.

78
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,669
I'm here.

79
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,735
Isn't that enough?

80
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:07,745
<i>Can I ask you
a question?

81
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:08,992
Sure.

82
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,059
You're left-handed.

83
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,549
Of course.

84
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,730
- Is there a question coming?
- You already answered it.

85
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:22,831
I've been studying the reports
on who survives the promicin shot,

86
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:24,528
and who doesn't.
Did you know

87
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:27,678
nine out of ten
left-handed people

88
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,676
who take the shot,
survive?

89
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:32,560
- No, I didn't.
- Well, it's true.

90
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,194
I learned that a couple weeks ago,
but I didn't know...

91
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:36,610
what it meant...

92
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,651
until now.

93
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,435
There.

94
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,675
There's a small part of the brain
called the corpus callosum.

95
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:50,024
It's like a bundle of wires
that connects the two hemispheres.

96
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,946
It's usually slightly larger
in lefties than it is in righties.

97
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:56,471
That's why the lefties survive.

98
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,297
The size of that part of the brain
helps determine whether or not

99
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:02,955
you'll be able to integrate
a new neurotransmitter.

100
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:05,591
Well, how big
does it have to be?

101
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:07,939
I don't know... yet.

102
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:10,952
But I think I can figure it out.
And if I do...

103
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:13,821
A simple cat scan will tell me

104
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,712
how anyone's body
will react to the shot.

105
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:19,518
And you'd know in advance
whether or not you'd live or die.

106
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:22,335
The shot wouldn't have to
kill anyone anymore.

107
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:24,617
How long do you need?

108
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:27,387
A couple of months,
maybe less.

109
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,594
This is huge.

110
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:34,514
Keep working.
I'll get you anything you need, okay?

111
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,136
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get in contact with Collier.

112
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:39,352
If this test is really
only a few months away,

113
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:41,496
all he has to do
is make an announcement,

114
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,046
telling people that are
thinking about taking the shot

115
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,596
to simply wait.

116
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:47,467
This is great.

117
00:09:58,733 --> 00:09:59,733
Hey, Tom.

118
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,283
What are you doing standing
in the middle of the hallway?

119
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:10,549
Is everything all right?

120
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,024
Yeah, I'm... fine.
I've just...

121
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:21,764
had a strange morning.

122
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:23,464
Well, join the club.

123
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:25,904
We've just had a surprise visit
from Rebecca Parrish.

124
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,395
Some might say an ambush.

125
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,636
The director of national
intelligence is here?

126
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:33,538
She's been in Meghan's office
the past 20 minutes, and that's not all.

127
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,338
She's asked to see us.

128
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,672
I don't think she likes to wait.

129
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:46,847
Morning, agent Baldwin,
agent Skouris.

130
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,305
I'm Rebecca Parrish,
and it is a pleasure to meet you.

131
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:50,897
The pleasure's all ours.

132
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:55,343
I know that you have difficult jobs
here at NTAC.

133
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:58,123
But lately,
it seems that we've had

134
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:00,500
nothing but bad news
coming out of Seattle.

135
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,490
Promicin use is growing.

136
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:06,740
The founding of Promise City
was a major defeat for this agency,

137
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,390
and in the administration.

138
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:10,291
It's temporary.
We'll arrest...

139
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,237
Collier,
and we'll shut that place down.

140
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:14,755
I like your attitude,

141
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:16,667
but you'll forgive me
if I'm not reassured.

142
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,454
Because recently,
it seems like we're...

143
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,002
even botching the little things.

144
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:25,187
We had Richard Tyler and his daughter
surrounded, outnumbered.

145
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:28,737
The situation was in hand,
and we lost him anyway.

146
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:30,537
Well, with all
due respect,

147
00:11:30,654 --> 00:11:34,304
I was there, and that situation
was anything but "in hand."

148
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:37,429
Richard Tyler has become
an extremely powerful man.

149
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,472
I understand,
but we can't simply just

150
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:41,184
throw our hands up,
now, can we?

151
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:43,928
In two weeks,
I'm being asked to testify

152
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:45,524
before a congressional subcommittee

153
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:48,124
on the progress of the war
against promicin.

154
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,112
I'll be here for the entire week
to prepare,

155
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:54,129
and I would like to go back
with a victory.

156
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:56,256
So, you want us
to bring in Richard.

157
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:00,076
Ms. Parrish asked to meet
my two best agents.

158
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,384
That's why you're here.

159
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:04,861
That's also why you're heading up
a task force to find the Tylers.

160
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,969
I will be checking in
on your progress.

161
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,852
I trust this won't be a problem.

162
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:16,370
Agent Baldwin?

163
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,062
Did you have something
you needed to say?

164
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,887
I'm...

165
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,769
sure Tom just wants
to get to work.

166
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,426
We'll find the Tylers for you.

167
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:38,949
I don't know
what's happening, Diana.

168
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,709
It's like I'm seeing myself
in the future, only it's not me.

169
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,958
I'm doing things
I would never do.

170
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:45,550
What if
they're not just dreams?

171
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,357
What if
they're someone else's memories?

172
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,674
What if they really did put something
inside me when I was in that hospital?

173
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:52,469
What if it's starting
to affect me?

174
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:54,119
I'm becoming
one of the marked.

175
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:57,369
Listen,

176
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,485
Even if you're right,

177
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,238
it hasn't happened yet.
You're still you.

178
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,917
- Okay, so we can fight it.
- How?

179
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:08,109
Well, have you been to see a doctor
since these dreams began?

180
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:10,567
- No.
- Okay, well, why don't you start there?

181
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,784
Go find yourself a private physician,
get yourself checked out.

182
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:15,792
We're supposed to be
looking for Richard.

183
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,387
Just go.
Go.

184
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,830
I'll cover for you.

185
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:22,238
Go.
Okay.

186
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:34,768
She looks so much older.

187
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:43,615
How long
have I been gone?

188
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:46,915
A little while.

189
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,368
More than a year.

190
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:53,525
Tell me what happened.

191
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:55,329
I want to hear it all.

192
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,903
Why do you look so sad?

193
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:05,857
I buried you, Lily.
I mourned you.

194
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:09,324
I never imagined
I'd be sitting beside you again,

195
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,874
and I don't wanna waste
the time we have with explanations.

196
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:15,257
We have all the time
in the world, though.

197
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:16,808
Why wouldn't we?

198
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,586
You still don't believe
I'm real, do you?

199
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:24,882
I don't know.

200
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:29,880
If I let myself believe it,
and I turn out to be wrong...

201
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,757
I'm not sure
I could live with that.

202
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:40,262
Let's just see, okay?

203
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:44,117
We'll just lay here
for a while...

204
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:49,079
and if I'm still beside you
when we wake up...

205
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:51,660
I guess we're real.

206
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,732
- You saved these pictures of us.
- Of course I did.

207
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,615
Who's this?

208
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,035
She's a friend of mine.

209
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,285
She lived at the 4400 Center
after you were gone.

210
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,559
She's pretty.

211
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:32,942
She looks nice, too.

212
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,220
I can see why
you saved the picture.

213
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:45,287
I don't know.

214
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,570
There's nothing different
about me, Diana.

215
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:50,457
I had every test
they could give me.

216
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,564
They all say
I'm in perfect health.

217
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:56,164
I'll call you back.

218
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,674
- What's going on?
- Sorry for the intrusion.

219
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,787
My security detail
is nothing if not thorough.

220
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,496
They have to be.
The administration has enemies

221
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,254
- everywhere these days.
- What are you doing here, Ms. Parrish?

222
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:16,508
I wanted to have
a word with you in private.

223
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,750
Gentlemen...

224
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,057
Gentlemen, agent Baldwin and I
need the room.

225
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:24,389
Thank you.

226
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:26,517
Damn it, this is my house...

227
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:29,067
I'm going to pay you
the respect of being frank.

228
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:31,357
I was a little concerned
with your...

229
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,874
outburst in Ms. Doyle's office
this morning.

230
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:37,315
Are you quite sure you're up to the job
of tracking down Richard Tyler?

231
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:39,587
- I'm fine.
- That's good to hear.

232
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:41,951
This might surprise you,

233
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,834
but I think I have an idea
of what you're going through.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,717
Right after I took this job,

235
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,469
I felt like I was on the verge
of a breakdown myself.

236
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:54,924
I was overwhelmed at work,
and I was...

237
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,824
having these strange moments
where I was seeing things.

238
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:01,120
It was almost like
I wasn't myself.

239
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,954
Like... someone else
was in my head.

240
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,487
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

241
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:08,978
I think I do.

242
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,635
Let me ask you something,
Ms. Parrish.

243
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:14,169
If I look behind your left ear,
would I find a mark there?

244
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,717
A mark?

245
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,550
You mean like a mole?

246
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:19,774
That's hard to say.

247
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,091
Once you turn 40,

248
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,208
your skin changes all the time.

249
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,387
I remember how nervous I was
in those days.

250
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,717
I thought I was going to
lose myself forever.

251
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:32,617
I fought it.
My God, how I fought it.

252
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:34,000
And then one day,

253
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,487
I just couldn't fight it
anymore.

254
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:40,370
I gave in.
I accepted my situation.

255
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:41,972
And you know what?

256
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:46,122
Things have been
much better for me since then.

257
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,454
I'm happier.

258
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,220
My friends tell me
that I'm like a new person.

259
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,887
You should relax, Tom.

260
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,719
Whatever you're going through,

261
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,084
just...

262
00:17:58,917 --> 00:17:59,917
let it happen.

263
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,029
You'll feel better.

264
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:04,396
I promise.

265
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:13,857
You're saying Rebecca Parrish
is one of these people?

266
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:16,068
- She's marked?
- Yeah, I think so.

267
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:18,657
She never came out
and said it.

268
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:20,565
But you haven't had
any more hallucinations,

269
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:23,054
so, maybe she was talking
about something else.

270
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,517
What do you think?

271
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:27,350
I think it's crazy,

272
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,942
and I doubt we'll be able
to prove any of this, but...

273
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,257
I have to go with Tom.
I think that there's a very good chance

274
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:34,338
the director of national
intelligence is marked.

275
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:39,612
We're going to have to be very careful
with how we proceed.

276
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:42,077
NTAC would be looking for
Richard Tyler no matter what,

277
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:43,560
so we'll keep doing that.

278
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:46,237
I'm passing the case over
to Garrity and Ashmore.

279
00:18:46,637 --> 00:18:48,630
Tom, you're taking
a personal day tomorrow.

280
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,587
Diana and I
will keep an eye on you.

281
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:52,238
We'll watch over you
in shifts.

282
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,620
I'm sorry, Shawn,
are you really asking me

283
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,387
to tell people
not to take promicin?

284
00:18:58,487 --> 00:18:59,887
Only for a few months.

285
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:02,617
Jordan, I know that
we have had our differences in the past,

286
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,867
but this is good for both of us.

287
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,587
All we have to do is be patient.

288
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,057
It's not the need for patience
that concerns me.

289
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:11,102
It's the worldwide implications
of this test.

290
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,143
Shawn, there would be millions of people
with abilities

291
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,202
and millions without any chance
of having them.

292
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:17,635
Yes, but they would be alive.

293
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:20,043
And living in a world
with two classes of human being.

294
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,512
Positives and negatives
cannot live side by side.

295
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:30,080
Those without abilities
will tear down the ones who have them.

296
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,885
Or, the positives will simply
use their powers

297
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,523
to rid themselves
of the negatives.

298
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,006
Inquisition, or holocaust.

299
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,037
Either way, it's a recipe
for hell on earth.

300
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,912
What's your alternative?
Do you really want

301
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,861
- the entire world to take promicin?
- Yes.

302
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,103
Yes, I do. It's what I've always said
has to happen.

303
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,054
Half of the planet will die!

304
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,687
- You're talking about mass suicide!
- I am talking...

305
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,957
about a single generation
of sacrifice.

306
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,717
And at the end of it,

307
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,329
a more fully-evolved species.

308
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:03,162
All of our failings
as human beings

309
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:05,209
will be addressed
when we are all gifted.

310
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,799
I am not making
any announcement.

311
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:16,018
And no one who cares about
what's right for the world would.

312
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,523
Somebody got so big!

313
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:24,635
Oh, she got heavy, too.

314
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:27,407
Yeah.

315
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,879
- Just one, just one.
- I'm going to go play.

316
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,378
All right, go play.

317
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,351
She seems so happy.

318
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,474
Aren't toddlers
supposed to be moody?

319
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,913
Oh, Isabelle's had her moments,
believe me.

320
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:41,945
Oh, I'm sure she has.

321
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:44,978
Ever since I got back,
I've been...

322
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:47,819
thinking about what it must
have been like for you,

323
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,457
raising her on your own.

324
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:52,673
You know, neither of
us asked to be parents,

325
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,608
not that it makes it any less
wonderful, but still...

326
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:57,567
It just kind of happened.

327
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:01,931
But you've always been
there for her,

328
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:04,355
even while I was gone.

329
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:09,274
You're a great father, Richard.

330
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,043
You can tell
just by looking at her.

331
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,901
<i>I'm definitely using my ability
on Richard Tyler.</i>

332
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:22,845
<i>He's seeing his dead wife,</i>

333
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:24,768
but I have no idea
if they're talking about

334
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:26,257
what he did to his daughter.

335
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,744
I just make him see her.

336
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,793
Everything they talk
about comes from him.

337
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:32,331
Allright, keep at it.

338
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,151
We don't have any other
options at this point.

339
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:38,131
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

340
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:39,810
Look, I know you're tired,

341
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:42,734
but this is very important.

342
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:46,116
I won't forget
what you did for me.

343
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:49,868
- Can I get a coffee or something?
- Absolutely.

344
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:51,164
Absolutely.

345
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,350
It's working.

346
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,778
We just need more time.

347
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,923
If you know where Isabelle is,
just tell me. I can help her myself.

348
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:13,840
Didn't really work out so well
the last time you tried it, did it?

349
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:15,296
It's too soon for that.

350
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:16,806
Richard's not ready to give her up yet.

351
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:19,453
This is just the first
part of a plan to get her back.

352
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:22,053
When we're ready for the next part,
I'll let you know.

353
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:24,137
Or you can tell me now.

354
00:22:29,753 --> 00:22:31,822
Did you know he was involved
with her grandmother?

355
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:34,723
Why do you think
we picked these two?

356
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:38,802
After we send them back
to their time,

357
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,266
they'll find each other.

358
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:43,103
They'll form a bond.

359
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:49,739
It's done.

360
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:52,519
She's pregnant.

361
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:11,125
Honey...

362
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:14,100
Honey, Meghan.

363
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,209
Honey, wake up.

364
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,702
I had the dream again.

365
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:20,854
Of course you did, Tom.

366
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:22,945
You're becoming your new self.

367
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:24,631
You're one of us now.

368
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,297
Welcome aboard.

369
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:51,885
Did you have another dream?

370
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,124
No, I slept like a baby, actually.

371
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,241
I feel great.

372
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:08,922
Forgot how much I hate it here.

373
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:12,234
There's so much noise
in this time period.

374
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,380
So many people.

375
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:16,271
Look at them.

376
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:18,121
They have no idea what's coming.

377
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:22,981
They just move from pointless
errand to pointless errand.

378
00:24:23,352 --> 00:24:24,582
It's disgusting.

379
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:27,455
I'd think you'd be
glad just to be alive.

380
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:30,245
You were given a chance
to continue your work.

381
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:32,866
The work that failed so badly?

382
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,223
The work that got
my previous host killed?

383
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,953
Don't blame your shortcomings
on Matthew Ross.

384
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:39,614
We are our hosts.

385
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:42,661
Your inability to harness
Isabelle Tyler was your failure.

386
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,994
I'll do better this time.

387
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:45,665
You need to get back to work.

388
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:48,316
Convince them to return
you to active duty.

389
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:50,123
I'll pull some strings if I have to,

390
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:52,213
but it's better if you
got it done on your own.

391
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,252
- And after I'm  there?
- That's the easy part.

392
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:56,241
Do what Tom Baldwin would do.

393
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:57,846
Find Isabelle Tyler.

394
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:01,394
I'll be in touch.

395
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:12,029
Richard, come play.

396
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:13,991
I can't.

397
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:18,173
Lily, I have to tell you something.

398
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:30,549
What is it, sweetheart?

399
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,618
I lied to you.

400
00:25:36,316 --> 00:25:37,574
That picture you saw.

401
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,150
The pretty girl.

402
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,470
That was Isabelle.

403
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:56,093
My god, Richard. I had no idea
things had gotten so bad.

404
00:25:58,351 --> 00:26:01,384
I don't expect you to forgive me,
but I need you to understand.

405
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:03,553
I did it for our daughter.

406
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,087
Why didn't you tell
me the truth right away?

407
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,148
I've been happy,

408
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:14,674
being with you the last few days.

409
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,532
You don't know how long it's been
since I've felt that way.

410
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:25,270
A good father will
do anything for his child,

411
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:27,937
and you're a good father.

412
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:33,401
But, Richard,
you took away her life.

413
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:38,042
The good and the bad.
You erased everything she was,

414
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:39,975
everything she could have been.

415
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,241
I knew I was wrong
after I did it to her, but...

416
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,420
Other people told me as much,
but I didn't listen.

417
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,234
I guess the only person
I could listen to was you.

418
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,231
Daddy...

419
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:10,817
I feel real.

420
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,061
We're talking.

421
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,202
- I've held Isabelle.
- No, you haven't.

422
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,766
My ability makes it seem
like you have.

423
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,719
I don't know if I'm  seeing you
because I want to,

424
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:25,850
or if someone conjured you up for me.

425
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:30,676
I don't know, Richard.
I don't know how I got here,

426
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,462
but maybe it doesn't matter.

427
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:57,158
I don't think I'm going
to be here much longer.

428
00:28:01,376 --> 00:28:02,789
But if I have to go,

429
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:06,434
will you just hold me?

430
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:14,883
I love you, Richard.

431
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:11,322
I'm not saying we don't have to worry,

432
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:12,884
but nothing happened last night,

433
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:14,675
and this morning, Tom said he felt fine.

434
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,188
He said he didn't
want me to come over,

435
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:17,416
but where is he?

436
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,317
Because Tom is always
here at the crack of dawn.

437
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:21,251
Hey, what's up with Tom?

438
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:23,540
He just dragged Marco
out of his office.

439
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:25,799
I think Baldwin's
gone nuts or something.

440
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:31,782
Your mind is no match
for the power of my mind.

441
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,505
You are now under my control.

442
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:38,815
My mind is no match
for the power of your mind.

443
00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:40,954
I am now under your control.

444
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:42,469
Total control.

445
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:44,253
Total control.

446
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:49,661
You should see their faces.

447
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:56,230
Sorry, Di, we were just trying
to ease the tension a little bit,

448
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,996
- that's all.
- You idiots!

449
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:00,417
Marco, you're fired.
You too, Garrity.

450
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:03,730
- Come on, that was classic!
- You can't fire this.

451
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,624
Go back to your office
and solve something.

452
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,550
- Hey, come on...
- Quick.

453
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,283
I'm sorry.

454
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:12,409
Good work.

455
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:14,704
No humor.
No humor in this room.

456
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:18,125
What?
Ah, you know what?

457
00:30:18,245 --> 00:30:19,481
Seriously, look,

458
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,053
I'd like to thank you both

459
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:22,917
for helping me get through
these past few days,

460
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:25,843
but I had a great night's sleep.
I feel...

461
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:28,786
better, and, look
I really hope this is all over.

462
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,308
If I have any more flashes,
I'll tell you right away,

463
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:35,304
but in the meantime,
I'd really like to get back to work.

464
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,474
What about Rebecca Parrish?

465
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:40,693
I think we need to keep an eye on her.

466
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,936
Her visit to my place was...
definitely weird.

467
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,528
but maybe you were right.
Maybe the whole thing

468
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,481
was her bizarre version
of a pep talk.

469
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:50,462
Look, whatever it is,

470
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,829
I don't have to trust her
to do my job.

471
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:55,924
And I really want to do my job.

472
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:00,035
All right,

473
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:02,397
but I'll be watching you, okay?

474
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:05,024
Any more attempts at mind control
Baldwin, and you're out.

475
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:10,830
That wasn't funny.

476
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:13,058
I have a very simple message

477
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:15,354
for anyone who's thinking
about taking the shot.

478
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:17,637
Wait.

479
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:21,008
In a few months, the research
that I'm funding will be complete

480
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:23,167
and 50-50 will be a thing of the past.

481
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:25,084
We will have a very simple test

482
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:27,312
that can tell you whether
or not you'll survive the shot,

483
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:29,296
and no one ever has to risk dying again.

484
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:32,190
What about Jordan Collier?
Is he in favor of this?

485
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,025
You'd have to ask him that, Paul,

486
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:37,369
but we're talking about preventing
thousands of needless deaths here.

487
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:40,328
I don't see how anyone
could think that's a bad thing.

488
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,681
You did this to your own child.

489
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:47,946
I'm disappointed in you, Richard.

490
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:50,580
You told me you wanted
to use that water I gave you

491
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,256
to help an old army buddy.

492
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:53,908
I know it was wrong.

493
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,146
But you never would
have gave me what I needed

494
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:01,046
- if you knew what I had in mind.
- Oh, you're right about that.

495
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:02,845
These abilities we have,

496
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:04,846
they are a gift from god,

497
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,991
and we need to treat them
with respect.

498
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:09,929
I know that,

499
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,392
and that's why I'm here.

500
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:13,804
I'm hoping you can set things right.

501
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:19,071
Cora, please.

502
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,196
I need your help.

503
00:32:36,694 --> 00:32:38,187
I'll see what I can do.

504
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,560
Byron, you gotta wake up.

505
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:42,284
Byron...
Isabelle needs you.

506
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:43,522
- Come on...
- Let him sleep.

507
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:45,487
He did what he needed to do.

508
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,723
Does that mean Isabelle's okay?

509
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:50,253
Not exactly,

510
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:51,791
but we're getting close.

511
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:54,688
I need you to call your father.

512
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,576
Call my father? Why?

513
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:59,839
You're going to have
to tell him where Isabelle is.

514
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:02,548
You want me to betray
her to the government?

515
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:06,586
If you know where she is, tell me.

516
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:08,820
- I'll go there myself.
- This is how it has to be.

517
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:12,814
I promise you, Kyle,

518
00:33:13,483 --> 00:33:15,379
if you do exactly what I say,

519
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,424
Isabelle will not wind up in jail.

520
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,139
Think of everything we've done, Kyle.

521
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:22,264
All that we've accomplished together.

522
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,256
Are you really going
to start doubting me now?

523
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:38,703
Did it work?

524
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,425
Daddy...

525
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,497
Are you going out?

526
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,431
We had a tip on the Tyler case.
Someone called in from Promise City,

527
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,318
gave us the name
and address of a 4400

528
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:06,819
that Richard claimed
he'd been in contact with.

529
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,581
It was anonymous,
probably nothing.

530
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:10,551
You had the appointment
at Maia's school.

531
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:12,181
I figured I'd run it
down while you were out.

532
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:14,707
I'm back, so I'll go with you.
I'll just get my jacket.

533
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:17,932
Okay, great.

534
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:37,146
Did you see that?

535
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:38,876
The curtain just moved.

536
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:41,169
Well, so someone knows we're here.

537
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:44,744
That tip of yours said this lady's
just an associate of Tyler's, right?

538
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,394
Yeah, but we'd better play it safe.

539
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:47,956
Knock on the door.
I'm gonna head around back,

540
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:49,839
make sure no one
tries to flee the scene.

541
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,451
Richard, a car just pulled up outside.

542
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:54,732
Some people are coming.

543
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:58,098
Isabelle,
get down to the basement.

544
00:34:58,427 --> 00:35:01,027
If you hear any kind of struggle,
run out the back, understand?

545
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:04,359
Answer the door if they knock.
See if you can get rid of them.

546
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:18,175
Cora Tomkins?

547
00:35:18,362 --> 00:35:20,850
Hi. I'm Diana Skouris.
I'm from NTAC.

548
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:23,964
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Richard Tyler.

549
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:26,046
Richard Tyler?

550
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:29,448
I haven't seen him since quarantine.

551
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:35,186
Do you mind if I come in?

552
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,471
So Richard hasn't tried
to get in touch with you at all?

553
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:44,117
No phone calls? No emails?

554
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:46,811
No, but I keep
pretty much to myself.

555
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:47,954
Right.

556
00:35:48,994 --> 00:35:52,299
Oh, I'm  sorry. I didn't realize
I was interrupting something.

557
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:55,531
- You have company.
- No, no.

558
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:56,763
Pardon my mess.

559
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:59,034
I'm not too good about
cleaning up after myself.

560
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:01,611
Like I say,
I knew the man in quarantine,

561
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:04,860
but I don't really keep in touch
with many of the 4400s.

562
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:51,381
- You people just don't quit.
- Don't move.

563
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:05,958
Are you okay?

564
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:23,340
What have you done to them?

565
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:39,203
Honey...

566
00:37:40,985 --> 00:37:42,140
Are you okay?

567
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:46,459
Yeah, I think so.

568
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:47,806
I'm sorry. I went around back,

569
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:49,368
and Isabelle was already
halfway down the alley

570
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:51,288
when I got out there.
I was going to chase her,

571
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:53,353
but I came back when
I heard the gunshot.

572
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:55,790
Where is she now?

573
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:58,015
I don't know, Diana,
she got away.

574
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,703
Good job, guys.

575
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:22,018
Today, agent Baldwin
and agent Skouris

576
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:25,680
provided a textbook example
of what we need to win this fight.

577
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:27,577
Initiative, savvy,

578
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:29,398
and exceptional teamwork.

579
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:31,772
The apprehension of Richard Tyler

580
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,651
is a huge win for us,

581
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:35,975
a reminder to everyone

582
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:39,919
that the rule of law still prevails
in this country.

583
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,444
Make no mistake,

584
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:43,425
there's lots more to be done,

585
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:44,692
but today....

586
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:46,712
Today we won.

587
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,709
Nice speech.

588
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:01,228
Yeah, exactly what Parrish
would say if she were marked.

589
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:04,220
Then again, it's exactly what Parrish
would say if she wasn't marked.

590
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,716
I know, either way,
she won today.

591
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:10,086
Nice work, you guys.
I gotta go make nice.

592
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,566
Hey, you...

593
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,626
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

594
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,692
Sure?

595
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,436
We really got lucky today,

596
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:29,206
just finding Richard in that house.

597
00:39:30,486 --> 00:39:31,979
It's a good thing you got that tip.

598
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:35,291
Yeah, well, it has to work
out for us sometimes, doesn't it?

599
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:01,629
This is not how this
was supposed to end!

600
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:03,620
Richard is in prison!
It's all over the news!

601
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,286
Isabelle's on the run.
Government's looking for her.

602
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,990
You said that she'd be okay.
You lied to me!

603
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,278
I promised you she
wouldn't end up in jail.

604
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:13,454
- She's not in jail.
- Yeah, and she's not safe, either.

605
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:16,674
- This is not what I wanted...
- This isn't about what you want, Kyle!

606
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:18,722
It's about what has to happen!

607
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:22,333
I'm not your sidekick.

608
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:24,401
I'm not here to run errands for you.

609
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,223
I'm here to tell you
what the movement needs,

610
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:28,644
and right now,
it needs for you to be strong,

611
00:40:28,783 --> 00:40:30,614
because the next thing you have to do,

612
00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:33,495
trust me,
it's not gonna be easy for you.

613
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,169
- What are you talking about?
- Your cousin Shawn?

614
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:38,085
The work he's doing
with that scientist

615
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:40,220
is threatening the entire movement.

616
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:41,426
Collier knows about it,

617
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:43,388
but he's too afraid
to get his hands dirty.

618
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,896
He shouldn't have
to get his hands dirty.

619
00:40:46,253 --> 00:40:48,103
That's what he has people like you for.

620
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:50,015
People like me?

621
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:52,899
What do you want me to do?

622
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:56,554
Shawn Farrell has to be stopped.

623
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:20,761
Don't worry. You're safe.

624
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:25,746
- Where am I?
- You're at my house.

625
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,629
I gave you a tranquilizer,
then I brought you here.

626
00:41:29,915 --> 00:41:32,188
- Where's my father?
- We put him on the inhibitor.

627
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,772
He's in prison.

628
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:35,582
He's gonna be there
for a very long time.

629
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:36,956
He didn't do anything wrong.

630
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:38,786
He was just trying to help me.

631
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,986
Isabelle, it's okay. It's okay.

632
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,233
There's a way to get him out.

633
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:44,886
I know people
who could make it happen.

634
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:46,142
It would be easy.

635
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:49,729
There's just one thing.

636
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,465
You...

637
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:56,113
have to take your abilities back.

638
00:41:59,746 --> 00:42:01,474
Then, you can bring
Jordan Collier to me.
