1
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:43,685
The world will have to
deal with us.

2
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,464
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

3
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:48,564
I'm not tired.

4
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,428
Are you worried about
what you might dream?

5
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,711
<i>- Who's cassie?
- I'm Kyle's ability.

6
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,323
<i>They did something to me
last night.

7
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,723
<i>When we need him,
he'll be there for us.

8
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,300
They put something into me.

9
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,669
- Where's kyle?
- Kyle and I agree. You're not ready.

10
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:02,864
You don't understand what we're trying
to accomplish here.

11
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:05,964
- Then tell me, what is this place?
- It's a model for a better world.

12
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:08,821
They're looking to make a better
life for themselves, and they did.

13
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:11,403
<i>Promicin isn't just here
to improve the world.

14
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,513
It's here to bring
heaven to earth.

15
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,361
You're supposed to make it happen,
and I'm supposed to help you.

16
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:19,037
You are going to
lead us all to God.

17
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:21,615
- So, what do we do now?
- We're going to Seattle.

18
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:32,517
Everyone's waiting.

19
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:34,417
These are
good people.

20
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:35,954
Loyal.

21
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:39,417
They believe in this new world
I've promised them.

22
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,686
It's not just a promise.
It's going to happen...

23
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:43,796
starting today.

24
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,217
Once we take this step,

25
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:50,950
there is no going back.

26
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:52,920
I need you to tell me, Kyle,

27
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:56,866
that no matter the cost,
no matter the sacrifice,

28
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,601
this will all be worth it.

29
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:01,617
You know
it's worth it, Jordan.

30
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:05,317
This is the right time.
This is the right place.

31
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:08,414
If you didn't believe that,
we wouldn't be in Seattle.

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,207
Let's go change the world.

33
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:22,708
<i>We believe in you, Jordan.

34
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:25,030
<i>He's here!

35
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:36,717
Three years ago,

36
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:39,517
4400 missing people,

37
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:41,587
each with
an extraordinary ability,

38
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:43,966
reappeared in a ball of light,

39
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,417
and the world wondered why.

40
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:46,917
Six months ago,

41
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:49,766
the promicin shot
made those abilities

42
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:52,617
accessible to anyone
with the courage to take it.

43
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:54,626
And again...

44
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,525
the world wondered why.

45
00:02:58,517 --> 00:02:59,526
Today...

46
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:00,817
we tell them why.

47
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:05,253
Today,
we answer all the questions.

48
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,409
And after today...

49
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:10,113
the world
will never be the same.

50
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,417
I'm so sorry.

51
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,600
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

52
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,904
Those noodles were so
overcooked.

53
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,666
Diana,
stop apologizing.

54
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,266
That's the first meal
I've had in months

55
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,366
that didn't come out of a microwave
or a take-out carton.

56
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:47,371
All these years
we've been partners, and I...

57
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,966
haven't had you over for dinner...

58
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,934
You never felt
this sorry for me before.

59
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:52,708
What?

60
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:54,862
Look, when a woman
invites a man over for dinner,

61
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,617
it's for one of two reasons...

62
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,306
Attraction...

63
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,617
or pity,
and I'm putting my money on pity.

64
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:05,266
Between Alana and Kyle,

65
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:07,140
you have had
a tough run of it lately.

66
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,183
Me too.

67
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:12,382
I figured there's nothing like
overcooked pasta to...

68
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,106
start the healing process.

69
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:19,668
You know, no matter how hard
you rub that mole,

70
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,975
it's not going to go away.

71
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:23,466
You're right.

72
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,917
It's just a mole.

73
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:27,966
I mean, I'm still me.
I'm not one of the marked, or whatever.

74
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,140
No, I never said you were.

75
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:34,317
This job can mess
with your head, huh?

76
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:37,817
Speaking of work,

77
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:39,617
what do you think of Meghan?

78
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:41,517
She's different...

79
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:43,866
from what you'd expect
for a boss.

80
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:45,314
That's a little noncommittal.

81
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,253
Have you not noticed?
I think she's a little...

82
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,617
a little focused on you.

83
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:53,017
What?
Focused on me?

84
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:55,817
Mom, Jordan Collier...

85
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:57,401
He's about to
do something.

86
00:04:58,017 --> 00:04:59,017
Something big.

87
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:00,617
You saw him?

88
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:02,317
Did you have a vision?

89
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:03,917
Sweetie,
where is he?

90
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,617
He's here, in Seattle.

91
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:08,722
Kyle's with him.

92
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:12,464
He's right here.

98
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,228
Maia, I've imported your drawing
into a graphics file.

99
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:21,858
We can make any changes you want,

100
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,488
to get it closer to what you saw.

101
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,317
The reds,

102
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,042
they should be a little darker,

103
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,015
especially around the middle.

104
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:34,316
Maia, are you sure this represents
some part of Seattle?

105
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,868
The picture had...

106
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,178
some kind of lines
under the colors.

107
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:42,693
- Like that?
- There's a definite pattern here.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,808
Maybe it's an elevation study?
Red for peaks,

109
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:46,526
blue and green
for lower elevations.

110
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,266
It could be a population survey,

111
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,317
a study of homes
of median income.

112
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,266
ethnic,
religious groupings.

113
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,366
- That narrows it down.
- Actually, it does.

114
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:56,934
All those things require
comprehensive data analyses,

115
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,513
- and those don't come cheap.
- Which means a big corporate

116
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,920
or a government study.

117
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,966
Yeah, what?
D.O.D., N.S.A., census bureau.

118
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,884
Odds are, this image is sitting
in a government computer somewhere,

119
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,191
which means I can find it.

120
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:23,526
Kara...

121
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,017
You don't
have to leave.

122
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:29,017
I didn't want to
overstay my welcome.

123
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:33,802
Listen, I hope you're
okay with everything.

124
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:35,817
I didn't really
plan on...

125
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,117
More than dinner
and a movie?

126
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,817
It's just, these last few days
have been great,

127
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:46,066
but your mom is a client,
or she was a client.

128
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,105
You make it sound like
you were her lawyer.

129
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,254
My mother had
stage four leukemia.

130
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:52,277
You saved her life.

131
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:55,148
I just don't want you to think
that I make a habit

132
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,864
out of sleeping with
the people that I help.

133
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,068
I know that.

134
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:08,266
I'd love I could stay.
I just have this appointment

135
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,217
- first thing in the morning.
- All right.

136
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:13,817
I'll call you.

137
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:24,931
I guess that answers
my question.

138
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,254
I was gonna ask you
if you were sure you wanted

139
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:33,633
to be a part of this operation.

140
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:36,159
Believe me, I want Collier
caught as much as anyone.

141
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,217
It's not Collier
I was thinking about.

142
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:40,322
It's your son.

143
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:44,817
Look, the only thing we have
on Kyle is taking promicin.

144
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,480
I can still help him cut a deal,
get him on the inhibitor.

145
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:48,740
But the longer he's with collier,

146
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:50,682
the harder it's gonna be for me
to help him.

147
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,600
Are you sure he...
wants to be helped?

148
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:56,517
He's my son, I've got to believe
I can still reach him.

149
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:02,722
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,233
I know.

151
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:15,766
It's a toxicology study.

152
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:17,107
I got it from the E.P.A.

153
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:19,593
The red areas indicate
a high level of pollution,

154
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,755
pink a little less, then
all the way to green...

155
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,976
Marco, do you know
where Collier is?

156
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,466
The Duwamish river delta.
South seattle.

157
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,666
One of the most polluted places
in the country.

158
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:34,166
We're talking old refineries,
dead end streets, and rotting factories.

159
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,729
So, not a nice place.

160
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,592
Unless you wanna hide,
then it's perfect.

161
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:39,966
That place is a maze. It could take days
to do a complete search.

162
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:43,057
Then you better get started, because
according to what Maia's told us,

163
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,917
whatever Jordan Collier's planning,
this is ground zero.

164
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,733
Bobby, head that way.
We're going to cover this side.

165
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,320
I still don't understand why Collier
would risk coming back to Seattle.

166
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:04,066
It's like he's daring us
to catch him.

167
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,966
We wouldn't even know he was here
if it weren't for Maia.

168
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,887
It's not like he's showed
up at a Mariners game.

169
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:09,617
This place is pretty
low profile.

170
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:14,017
I don't think this qualifies
as low profile.

171
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,473
Somebody's feeling
pretty confident.

172
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,912
Tom, what are those lights?

173
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,389
It's almost like they're marking
some kind of perimeter.

174
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:47,983
Maybe they're warning lights,

175
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,517
an alarm system.

176
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,517
I'm calling for back-up.

177
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:56,517
This is Skouris.
<i>We need help down at Duwamish delta.

178
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:01,004
Tom, what?

179
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:05,348
Get back!

180
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,172
We won't be doing that again.

181
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:32,217
Senator Lenhoff is here.

182
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,817
Senator, I didn't know
you were in town.

183
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:37,066
Come to say hello to your
favorite future councilman?

184
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,217
Actually, I'm here
to ruin your morning.

185
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,353
"Sex for miracles"?

186
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,666
It's all over the net.

187
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:49,849
Every anti-4400 wingnut
is running with it.

188
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,041
This says that I forced Kara
to have sex with me,

189
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,367
- in exchange for healing her mother.
- You know this girl?

190
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:57,798
I didn't exchange sex for miracles,
or for anything else, for that matter.

191
00:11:57,923 --> 00:11:58,926
But you slept with her?

192
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,860
She asked me out to dinner.
We went out on a date.

193
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,898
We had a really good time.
We went on a couple more dates.

194
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,218
- I like this girl.
- Farrell, did you or did you not

195
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:07,717
have sex with this woman?

196
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,690
- Last night.
- And it hits the net this morning.

197
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:11,819
What does that tell you?

198
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,093
You think this is
some kind of set-up?

199
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,873
I'll have my people
start digging.

200
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:18,912
It should be easy enough
to discredit her. A girl like this,

201
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,869
- there's always something.
- Senator...

202
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:25,212
Let's hold off on the character
assassination until I talk to kara.

203
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:28,917
You want to play nice,
give it a try.

204
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:31,224
But if this girl's
who I think she is,

205
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,516
tomorrow we come out swinging.

206
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:40,112
These lights, or...
beacons or whatever,

207
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,199
they must've been built
by one of Jordan's followers.

208
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:44,099
They extend from here,
all the way to the river.

209
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:46,074
They wall off about
a square mile of buildings

210
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,874
right in the most toxic
part of the delta.

211
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:49,606
We called in Seattle P.D.
and the guard.

212
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:51,766
No one's getting in or out
without us knowing it.

213
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,866
So Collier's backed
himself into a corner.

214
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:56,617
All we have to do is figure out
a way to get past these lights.

215
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,713
I think you're going to
want to see this.

216
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:03,617
<i>For too long,

217
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,617
<i>those of us with special gifts,

218
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:08,217
<i>the 4400,
and those who've taken promicin,

219
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:12,066
<i>have had to conceal
and even neglect their abilities.

220
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,641
<i>Well, I stand before you today
to tell you the time for hiding...

221
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:17,107
<i>is over.

222
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:19,542
And that the time for miracles...

223
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:20,975
has begun.

224
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:23,317
And it starts right here.

225
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,274
<i>Today, we claim...

226
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:28,480
<i>this godforsaken piece of earth...
ours.

227
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,966
Did this guy just say
he's annexing part of Seattle?

228
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:33,217
- It sounded like that.
- <i>...to make it whole again.

229
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,717
<i>Using our abilities,

230
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,993
<i>we will heal its toxic soil.

231
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:41,317
We will cleanse
its polluted waters,

232
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,217
and we will turn this...
blighted place

233
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:46,917
into a garden.

234
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:49,917
<i>For those willing to join us,

235
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:51,650
<i>we welcome you.

236
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,279
<i>All you need is an ability,

237
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,164
<i>and the willingness to become
part of a miracle.

238
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:58,602
<i>But, the blessings we bring

239
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:02,917
<i>will not just be limited to this...
small place,

240
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:04,939
<i>because this is the beginning</i>

241
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,791
<i>of a much wider...

242
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,017
<i>and deeper healing.

243
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:11,877
Because the miracles
we work here,

244
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,424
we intend to work everywhere.

245
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,824
<i>Help us,

246
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:18,722
<i>work with us,
and together,

247
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:22,817
<i>we can transform this world
into a paradise.

248
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:25,352
Yeah, assuming
you take promicin and survive.

249
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,417
<i>For those of you
unwilling to join us,

250
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,170
all we ask
is that you leave us in peace.

251
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:33,117
If you insist on interfering,

252
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,110
if you threaten us,

253
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:38,217
or in any way attack us,

254
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:40,244
<i>there will be consequences,

255
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:41,659
<i>immediate...

256
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,328
<i>and severe.

257
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,617
<i>But I did not come
to intimidate.

258
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,917
<i>This is a message of hope,

259
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:51,077
<i>for a better tomorrow,

260
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:52,742
<i>for a new world,

261
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:55,895
<i>and it begins here,

262
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:58,398
<i>in this...</i>

263
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,017
city of hope.

264
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:04,541
It starts here,

265
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:06,350
<i>in Promise City.

266
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:13,801
I'd hate to have her job.

267
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,751
Jordan Collier grabs
a chunk of seattle

268
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,966
as his own personal fiefdom
under her watch.

269
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,958
Not going to earn her any
brownie points in D.C.

270
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:22,530
- No one could have seen that coming.
- Tom, we've got another.

271
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:25,666
It's an earthquake in the Allegheny
mountains, just outside of Pittsburgh.

272
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:27,417
5.2 on the Richter scale.

273
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:29,075
Miles from the nearest
fault line.

274
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:30,766
A tornado
outside Palm Springs,

275
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,417
a warehouse explosion
in Jersey,

276
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:34,866
a tsunami on lake Michigan.
Now this? Anyone hurt?

277
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,759
No, just like the others,
property damage, but no injuries.

278
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,297
Any closer to the city, though,
it would have been different.

279
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,946
Collier's made a statement on the net.
He's claiming responsibility

280
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:45,679
for all these mini-disasters.
He's calling them demonstrations.

281
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:48,330
Just letting us know what will happen
if we move against him.

282
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:51,066
I mean, God knows how many
people he has with abilities,

283
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,517
scattered around the country
just waiting for his signal.

284
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:56,317
<i>Hey, dad.

285
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,920
Hey, Kyle.

286
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:03,617
- You okay?
- <i>Yeah, I'm fine.

287
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,966
All right, good.
Now, here's what I want you to do.

288
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,066
You go to the perimeter,
you walk across,

289
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,469
and you surrender to
the first NTAC agent you see.

290
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:14,645
Dad, I'm where I need to be.

291
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,466
Things could get
really ugly down there.

292
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,097
<i>Make sure that doesn't happen.

293
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,837
Promise City has to succeed.
Everything depends on it.

294
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,966
Is that what Jordan Collier's
been telling you?

295
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,580
Actually,
that's what I'm telling him.

296
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,917
You're some kind of
advisor to him now?

297
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,066
Something like that.

298
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,219
Then advise him
to end this thing right now!

299
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,066
I can't do that, okay? I know
this is coming at you really fast,

300
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,866
but you got to hear me out.
<i>There's this book. It's a prophecy.

301
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,617
<i>This ability that I have
led me to it.

302
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,518
<i>This ability of yours,
you still haven't  told me what it is.

303
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,017
It's complicated.

304
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:48,017
It tells me what to do.

305
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,517
It...
What's important,

306
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:53,245
and this book is important, dad.
I mean...

307
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:56,073
It's almost 100 years old,
but it talks about the 4400,

308
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,597
promicin, everything, and...

309
00:16:57,704 --> 00:16:59,391
Dad, it explains
what needs to happen

310
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:01,866
<i>for paradise</i>
<i>to come to earth,</i>

311
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,866
<i>and Promise City's
where it all starts.

312
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,639
<i>once people see what we can do here,
they're gonna want to be a part of it.

313
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:09,317
<i>Once that happens, according to the book
once everyone's taken promicin...

314
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:12,528
I don't know
how else to say it.

315
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:16,117
God is going to show his face.

316
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:18,717
It'll be heaven on earth.

317
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,262
Are you still there?

318
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:27,917
Yeah, I'm here.

319
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,330
Wait...

320
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,417
Kyle, think about
what you're saying.

321
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:36,566
If everyone in the world
takes this shot,

322
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,066
half of them are going to die.

323
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,966
<i>You're talking paradise
at the cost of genocide.

324
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,266
Dad, the world is falling apart.

325
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,617
<i>Okay, Promise City
has to succeed.

326
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:47,257
<i>You can't let them
destroy it.

327
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,717
Listen, Kyle, just...

328
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:50,017
can we just...

329
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:52,917
can we talk in person?

330
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:54,722
I mean, come home.

331
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,417
I am home, dad.

332
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:01,713
I'll talk to you soon.

333
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,966
Shawn, I thought
you were smarter than this.

334
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,883
I mean, are you really
that surprised?

335
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,460
I saved
your mother's life...

336
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,216
And I will always
be grateful for that.

337
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,766
My mother was sick
for three years.

338
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,117
My parents went through
their entire life savings.

339
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:23,266
They gave me enough money
to get my parents out of debt

340
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:25,774
- and start a life for myself, too.
- They? Who's they?

341
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:26,884
Lawyers.

342
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:30,648
From back east, I think.

343
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:33,990
All I know is that they promised
to take care of me, and they delivered.

344
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:36,675
You sold me out for money.

345
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,010
People need you.
They need what you can do.

346
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,566
It doesn't really matter
if you get elected or not.

347
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,917
You saying that because I'm a 4400,
what you did is okay.

348
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:48,617
I had to look out for myself.

349
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,040
I'm not special like you.

350
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,317
I had to look out for myself,
so I did.

351
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,286
He sounded rational,

352
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,679
but the things that were
coming out of his mouth...

353
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:07,017
Heaven on earth,
the face of God?

354
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,766
I'd like to see this book he's talking
about. Just read the prophecy.

355
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:12,049
And then what?

356
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:14,366
You know, take the shot
and hope you survive,

357
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:15,966
and then join Collier
in paradise?

358
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:18,931
Come on, what happened to
Diana Skouris, professional skeptic?

359
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,717
Well, you know, Tom,

360
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:22,869
my daughter sees the future.

361
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:27,217
We just have to consider the possibility
that there could be something to this.

362
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:28,517
That's all.

363
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:33,317
What the hell?

364
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:36,666
So this is D.C.'s big plan?

365
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:39,066
Send in a hit squad
to take out Jordan Collier?

366
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,466
With all due respect, Ma'am,
we're not a hit squad.

367
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:43,723
But you're not exactly trained
to arrest people, are you?

368
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,466
Jordan collier is in open rebellion
against the government.

369
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,347
He seized U.S. territory,

370
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,766
declared himself
above the law.

371
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,366
What do you suggest we do,

372
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,787
wipe his nose
and read him a bedtime story?

373
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,366
Those are our options?

374
00:19:57,466 --> 00:19:59,732
A bedtime story
or a bullet to the head?

375
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:02,565
I was told to send in my guys,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

376
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,593
What makes you think
you could even get close to him?

377
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:06,427
We appreciate the concern, Ma'am...

378
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:18,650
but I think we can handle things.

379
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:20,376
The enhanced soldier program.

380
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:22,311
That's still in operation?

381
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:25,394
The department of defense
considers it a top priority.

382
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:40,623
Maia, what do you mean,
I have to save Jordan Collier?

383
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:43,810
<i>The soldiers. They're going
to kill him. I saw it.</i>

384
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,128
And when they do,

385
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:47,107
something terrible's going to happen.

386
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:48,384
Terrible?

387
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,292
Maia, what did you see?

388
00:20:50,664 --> 00:20:52,551
It was just... black.

389
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:54,254
What, you mean the vision ended?

390
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,377
<i>No,
I was still having the vision,</i>

391
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:58,861
but it was like
I wasn't there anymore.

392
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:00,254
No one was.

393
00:21:00,818 --> 00:21:03,457
<i>Please, mom,
you can't let Jordan Collier die.</i>

394
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:06,085
Maia, I'll do what I can.

395
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:07,501
<i>I promise.</i>

396
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,320
I know you will.

397
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:23,603
What are you doing out here?

398
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:25,704
Cassie said
I needed to wait here,

399
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:27,651
so I'm waiting.

400
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:31,274
I was thinking
maybe you could ask Cassie

401
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:34,034
what my role is in all this?

402
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:35,826
You're part of it.

403
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:37,635
I know that much.

404
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,398
She told you that?

405
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,722
She tells me what she wants
to tell me.

406
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,431
And you just do what she says?

407
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:46,832
Does that bother you?

408
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:50,700
I guess it's just
a matter of faith, you know.

409
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:53,245
That's what Promise City
is all about.

410
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:54,909
Faith.

411
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:57,092
Belief. Hope.

412
00:21:58,207 --> 00:21:59,728
<i>Hey, get back here!</i>

413
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:02,488
Kyle, I think
something's happening.

414
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:08,662
We got a report that someone
managed to get past police lines

415
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:11,605
and enter Promise City. One of the
dashboard cameras got some video.

416
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:22,758
Oh, my God!

417
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:26,601
Maia?
Why aren't you picking this up?

418
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,195
You get this message,
you call me back immediately!

419
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,763
Maybe she didn't take
her cell phone with her.

420
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,286
Maybe they took it away from her.

421
00:22:32,406 --> 00:22:34,313
Jordan's not going to
hurt her, Diana.

422
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,447
Maia went in there to warn him
about the soldiers.

423
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:38,046
She has an ability
he'd love to have access to.

424
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,416
If anything, he's probably
treating her like a queen.

425
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:43,182
Maia's vision ended in darkness.
That has never happened before.

426
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:45,857
We have got to go in there
and get Kyle and Maia to safety.

427
00:22:45,977 --> 00:22:47,561
Well, how do we get past
the beacons?

428
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,824
Aquino and his men
seem pretty damn confident

429
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:51,527
they can get through.
We go with them.

430
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:53,498
It's a military operation, Diana.

431
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:56,408
Lawton's not going to let
two NTAC agents just tag along.

432
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,223
Then we don't ask for permission.

433
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,867
I was born three years ago.

434
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,546
So that makes you, what,
nine years older than me?

435
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:08,029
Almost ten.

436
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:12,881
I litterally grew up overnight,
I didn't...

437
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:15,313
understand
what it meant to be an adult.

438
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:18,814
You did a lot of bad things.

439
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:21,936
I was told they were... necessary.

440
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:24,114
Important.

441
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,008
But that doesn't
make it right, does it?

442
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:31,113
No. It doesn't.

443
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:34,909
So what I'm trying to say
is that I'm sorry for scaring you,

444
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,400
and for hurting
people you care about.

445
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,592
Some things are so bad...

446
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:44,492
saying sorry just isn't enough.

447
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:49,210
I know.

448
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:52,769
Maia Skouris.

449
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:55,273
Welcome to Promise City.

450
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:59,292
I understand you have
something to talk to me about.

451
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,167
I need to ask you something.

452
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:04,765
Are you a good guy

453
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:06,492
or a bad guy?

454
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:08,915
My mom can't seem to
make up her mind.

455
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,201
I get that a lot.

456
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,011
I'll tell you what.

457
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:20,015
I have something
I want to show you.

458
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:22,411
Then you can make up
your own mind.

459
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,305
<i>Yesterday, I promised you miracles.</i>

460
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:32,530
<i>Today, I'll show you one.</i>

461
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:34,730
This is the Duwamish river delta.

462
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,500
It's one of the most
polluted waterways

463
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:38,124
in all of America.

464
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,221
It's loaded
with cancer-causing chemicals,

465
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:42,995
pcbs, toxic levels of mercury.

466
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:44,432
<i>It's a blight.</i>

467
00:24:44,638 --> 00:24:45,842
<i>Anastasia?</i>

468
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,349
<i>Anastasia took promicin</i>

469
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:52,021
<i>when her fiance was killed
in a car accident.</i>

470
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:54,399
<i>I'm sure you'll agree</i>

471
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:56,868
<i>she's developed
a remarkable ability.</i>

472
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,522
Now, that's what a river
should look like.

473
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,575
<i>And that's the way
river should taste.</i>

474
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:58,884
<i>Come on in.
the water's fine.</i>

475
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:10,785
So, Maia,

476
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,132
now do you think
I'm a good guy

477
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:15,564
or a bad guy?

478
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:21,853
Soldiers... with abilities.

479
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,116
They'll be here soon.

480
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:26,735
They're coming to kill you.

481
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,855
As much as I like to hear
I was right,

482
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:35,961
it's not going to make
a bit of difference.

483
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:37,844
Yesterday, you said
that we could deal with this.

484
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,407
The sex scandal, sure,

485
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:41,335
but Jordan Collier?

486
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,101
This whole Promise City thing?

487
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:44,526
That we can't get around.

488
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,772
My position
on Jordan is very clear.

489
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:49,746
I publicly condemned the man
for handing out promicin.

490
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:52,737
Your whole campaign was constructed
around one concept...

491
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:56,201
Yes, a middle path
for both 4400s and non-4400s,

492
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:58,385
one you sold to me,
one I still believe in.

493
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:00,376
There is no middle path now.

494
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:02,313
Collier just blew it all up.

495
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:03,551
Promise City.

496
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,782
Miracles.

497
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,177
We can't compete with that.

498
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:09,098
So that's it?

499
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,871
You're telling me to just drop out
of the race.

500
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,625
I'm telling you you can't win.

501
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,752
Henders, it's your show.

502
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:17,819
He's east of here.

503
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:19,451
Maybe ten blocks.

504
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,561
Those guys get
all the good tricks.

505
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:34,730
Just be glad Aquino can only
do that camouflage thing

506
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,463
when they're standing still.
We would've lost them

507
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,913
the minute they got over there.

508
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,466
Diana, slow down.
We don't want to get too close.

509
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:50,130
- I don't want to lose them
- What the hell are you two doing?

510
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:55,586
Captain, we're not here to interfere
with your mission, okay?

511
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:58,961
My daughter, she's inside Promise City.
I just want to get her out.

512
00:28:59,081 --> 00:29:01,392
You two get caught,
things get a lot messier for us.

513
00:29:01,512 --> 00:29:03,046
Surrender your weapons,
I'm going to cuff you,

514
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,716
And we'll pick you up
on the way out.

515
00:29:04,902 --> 00:29:06,620
You obviously don't have children.

516
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:11,737
I said surrender your weapon!

517
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:12,924
Diana, run!

518
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:35,970
Okay, that's not good.

519
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:38,787
Look, I know you're here.

520
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,695
You can't move when you hide.

521
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:50,703
So I won't hide.

522
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:29,013
Aren't you sneaky?

523
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:37,636
10:00 a.m. in the garden.

524
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,068
Good.
Yeah, that works, thanks.

525
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,859
Okay, now we work on
your withdrawal speech.

526
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:45,314
The important thing is,
you go out with your head held high.

527
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,516
Shawn, there's some
reporters downstairs.

528
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:50,169
Tell them we'll have the press
conference tomorrow morning.

529
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:56,008
I'll see them now.
I have some things that I want to say.

530
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:02,546
Mr. Farrell!

531
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,672
What's your relationship
with Kara Sarkestian?

532
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,431
You receive sexual favors
for healing her mother?

533
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:08,272
Are you in contact
with Jordan Collier?

534
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:10,036
Please, please.
First of all,

535
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:12,178
in spite of my ability to heal,

536
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:13,889
I am a normal person,

537
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:16,454
and that means
that I make mistakes.

538
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:18,842
Obviously,
I made one the other night.

539
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,595
I regret
that my misjudgment

540
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:24,022
as distracted from
the real issues of my campaign.

541
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:26,669
Right now as you all know
Jordan Collier is creating

542
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:29,932
his own separate society in a place
that he calls Promise City,

543
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:31,321
further widening the divide

544
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:33,851
between people with abilities
and people without.

545
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:36,058
He says that he's here
to heal the world,

546
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:40,218
but what he's doing threatens
to tear everything apart,

547
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,600
which is why
I have no choice

548
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:44,755
but to continue my campaign,

549
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:48,440
to continue to be a voice
for unity and cooperation,

550
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:51,188
and to provide a middle path

551
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,572
that we can all walk together.

552
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:58,826
- I will answer those questions.
- Mr. Farell...

553
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:00,958
Senator Lenhoff, are you
still backing Mr. Farrell?

554
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:02,123
You bet I am!

555
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:03,836
Shawn, can we get
another statement!

556
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,157
Hey, mommy.

557
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:14,082
Oh, Maia,

558
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,648
I was so worried about you.

559
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,119
I'm sorry.

560
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,098
I had to warn Jordan.

561
00:32:20,377 --> 00:32:21,382
Jordan?

562
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:23,617
It's Jordan now?

563
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,460
This place, mom.

564
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,264
They're doing
all kinds of great stuff.

565
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:31,561
You should see it.

566
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:33,795
Some other time.

567
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,657
We're leaving.

568
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,629
- Now.
- No.

569
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:39,938
No?

570
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:41,692
What do you mean, "no"?

571
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:43,379
We can't.

572
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:46,005
We have to stay here.

573
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:48,981
It's safer that way.

574
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:01,726
Bad day, huh, dad?

575
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:03,332
I've had better.

576
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:05,607
You going to cut me loose?

577
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:16,395
So now what?

578
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,780
We go see Jordan.

579
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,914
Gentlemen, you're trespassing.

580
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,864
Are you sure
you won't reconsider?

581
00:34:22,014 --> 00:34:24,042
You could join us,
keep your ability.

582
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:26,392
That's not going to happen.

583
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:29,073
No, I suppose not.

584
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:58,137
It pains me
to see gifts like yours wasted.

585
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,380
Make sure they're escorted
out of Promise City.

586
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:11,776
Collier, wait.

587
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:13,711
This isn't going to end.

588
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:15,280
You've painted a huge bullseye
on this place.

589
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,968
The government's going
to keep coming after you.

590
00:35:17,088 --> 00:35:19,925
Then I'll just have to show them
what a very bad idea that is.

591
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,124
Just... wait.

592
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:34,958
Maybe I wasn't clear.

593
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:37,026
You are free to go.

594
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,050
Maia, you can come back anytime.

595
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,908
You can even stay here a while
if that's all right with your mother.

596
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:45,345
Play sleepover in a war zone?
I don't think so.

597
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:47,574
Sending in those soldiers,
it was a bad idea,

598
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:49,642
but don't make things worse
by retaliating.

599
00:35:49,762 --> 00:35:51,054
People you work for
are the problem.

600
00:35:51,174 --> 00:35:52,321
They need to learn
to leave us alone.

601
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,682
Your son has a point.

602
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:55,119
You've promised
the world miracles.

603
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,399
You've even shown us some,

604
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:58,658
but no one's going to remember
that once you start killing people.

605
00:35:58,778 --> 00:36:01,283
When people start dying,
it's a war.

606
00:36:01,404 --> 00:36:03,096
No matter how powerful
you think you are,

607
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:05,129
when it's war, you lose.

608
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:06,816
Don't be so sure.

609
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:09,107
My mom is right.

610
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:13,493
If there's a war,

611
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,232
everyone loses.

612
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:23,081
You saw this?

613
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:24,949
Just now,

614
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:26,874
while you were talking.

615
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,026
Please,

616
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:33,800
you have to listen to my mother.

617
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:37,185
So, what do you think, Kyle?

618
00:36:38,058 --> 00:36:39,429
Did Maia get through to Collier?

619
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:41,699
Will he hold off any reprisals?

620
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:43,849
He's going to do
what he thinks is right,

621
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:46,708
but he won't hurt anybody
if he doesn't have to.

622
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:50,231
I guess you can make it
the rest of the way on your own.

623
00:36:50,557 --> 00:36:52,558
I'll turn off the beacon
so you can cross.

624
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:53,909
Kyle, come with me.

625
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:55,917
It could be your last chance.

626
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,467
You never give up, do you?

627
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:00,842
No, and I never will.

628
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:05,288
That book I told you about?
The prophecy?

629
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:07,930
Heaven on earth.
Yeah, I remember.

630
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:10,621
Well, in the book,
there's a list of 200 names.

631
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:14,110
People who can take promicin
and are guaranteed to survive.

632
00:37:14,763 --> 00:37:17,853
The last name on
that list is you, dad.

633
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,764
So, what are you trying
to say, Kyle?

634
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:24,671
I'm destined to take promicin
because it says so in some book?

635
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:28,749
I'm just saying
you're a very important person.

636
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,548
And not just to me.

637
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:42,088
I gotta go.

638
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:09,408
I don't know about you,

639
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:12,530
but I'm exhausted.

640
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:15,255
Yeah, I'm pretty tired, too.

641
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:20,918
This war,

642
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:23,517
the one that
you told Collier about,

643
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,086
what exactly did you see?

644
00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:29,829
Actually...

645
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:32,086
I didn't see anything.

646
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,557
Sweetheart,

647
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,516
it doesn't matter
how bad it is.

648
00:38:36,636 --> 00:38:38,398
You can tell me,
because I need to know.

649
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:40,342
No, mom, I mean...

650
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:42,417
I didn't see anything.

651
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:44,700
I didn't have a vision.

652
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:46,776
I lied.

653
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:50,438
Why?

654
00:38:51,848 --> 00:38:54,486
Well, I didn't want
Jordan to hurt anyone,

655
00:38:54,992 --> 00:38:57,865
and he wasn't listening to you.

656
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:01,000
And you knew he'd listen to you?

657
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:03,139
I hoped he would.

658
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:05,754
I hope he did, too.

659
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:09,951
You know, mom,

660
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:12,911
Jordan's not a bad person.

661
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,646
I think he's...

662
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:19,115
one of the good guys.

663
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:22,839
Well,
if he's one of the good guys,

664
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:25,032
what does that make me?

665
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:33,907
This is Skouris.

666
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:36,536
Be right there.

667
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,908
How long have they been there?

668
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:54,142
They started gathering
about 20 minutes ago.

669
00:39:54,968 --> 00:39:56,401
All right, here comes Collier...

670
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,263
and Kyle's with him.

671
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:03,925
And Isabelle Tyler.

672
00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:10,049
I thought you said no one could get
close to those beacons.

673
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:12,708
Someone must be shielding them
from the effects.

674
00:40:28,974 --> 00:40:30,551
They're moving the perimeter.

675
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:33,251
That's Collier's reprisal.

676
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:35,641
He's expanding Promise City.

677
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:38,453
So, what's he saying?
The more we move against him,

678
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:40,178
the more land he's going to take.

679
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:43,356
Today south Seattle,
tomorrow what, the world?

680
00:41:57,488 --> 00:41:59,441
That's twice
as bigger as it was before.
