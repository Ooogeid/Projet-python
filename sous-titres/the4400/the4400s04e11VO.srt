00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,133
<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...

2
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,257
The world
will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:46,960
<I>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,633
I'm putting together profiles
of the people...

5
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:51,317
who've taken the shot.

6
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,019
Pretty soon, Kevin thinks
he'll be able to predict

7
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,924
who will survive the shot
and who won't.

8
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:58,741
Are you really asking me
to tell people not to take promicin?

9
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,024
Only for a few months.

10
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,624
I am not making
any announcement.

11
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:04,588
Who are you?

12
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:06,638
I'm Lindsey.

13
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:08,386
<i>This is Maia Rutledge.

14
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:11,334
<i>She was the first one to disappear
as far as we can tell.

15
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:12,751
<i>They're dead, aren't they?

16
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:14,631
<i>There's a faction of elites

17
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:18,664
<i>who want the future
to stay exactly as it is.

18
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,317
<i>I call them "The Marked."

19
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:24,375
<i>What about Imroth?
The CEO of Ubient software's

20
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:27,085
<i>supposed to be some kind of
double agent from the future?

21
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:29,835
<i>Tell the others
I went to see the NTAC agents.

22
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:32,301
<i>Baldwin thinks
it's some kind of ploy.

23
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:34,071
<i>When we need him,

24
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:36,455
<i>he'll be there for us.

25
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,871
You're becoming
your new self.

26
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:39,885
Do what Tom Baldwin would do.

27
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:41,319
Find Isabelle Tyler.

28
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,084
You...

29
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:45,268
have to take
your abilities back.

30
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:48,954
Then you're going to bring
Jordan Collier to me.

31
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:07,449
Tom, what's going on?

32
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,759
I felt restless.
I kept tossing and turning,

33
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,711
I didn't want to wake you.

34
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,144
So you were just...

35
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:20,504
- sitting here?
- No. I was watching you sleep.

36
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:22,170
It's kind of relaxing.

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,270
Well, I'm awake now.

38
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,809
So... why don't you
come back to bed?

39
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,646
There.
Isn't this more relaxing?

40
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,615
Andaluca's?

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,682
Isn't that
a little bit fancy?

42
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,754
So?
I'm not a little kid anymore.

43
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:07,221
I just miss the days
when the only place you'd eat was...

44
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,780
Charlie's pizza palace.

45
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:11,004
Mom, that was, like...

46
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:12,259
a long time ago.

47
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,162
Oh, yeah,
at least a year.

48
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,660
Besides, it'd be fun
eating spanish food with Ben again.

49
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,011
I hope you're not
getting your hopes up for nothing.

50
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,543
I know that Ben said
that he might make it, but...

51
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:26,893
London is a long way off.

52
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,226
I promise
I won't be disappointed.

53
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,096
On my birthday,
it's just been...

54
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:32,917
I don't know,
just you and me,

55
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,901
and with Ben,
it would feel more like family.

56
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:40,445
Excuse me!

57
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:43,145
Are you okay?

58
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:45,120
- Yeah.
- What's that?

59
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:06,019
Is this real money?

60
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:08,519
Certainly looks like it.

61
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:12,502
"These little green
scraps of paper

62
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,707
you're fighting over
are worthless."

63
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,373
"Welcome to
the new world."

64
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:21,372
"The new world". That's right out of
Jordan Collier's playbook.

65
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:24,128
It sounds like it,
but can we be really sure

66
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:27,546
that these ATM malfunctions
are being caused by some 4400 ability?

67
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:29,977
Because it could be the work
of some sophisticated

68
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:31,636
computer hacker who's just...

69
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,419
looking to create some havoc.

70
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,905
Actually, I have to go with
a p-positive here, Diana.

71
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,774
So far, 58 ATMs from four separate
banking institutions have been affected.

72
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:43,835
That means four separate computer
mainframes have been compromised.

73
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,455
Thousands of dollars
are being randomly dispensed.

74
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:49,285
Every time they shut down an ATM,
another one goes haywire.

75
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:51,587
I'd like to meet the computer hacker
that can pull that off,

76
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:52,944
you know, without an ability.

77
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:55,529
Pretty aggressive move, though,
I mean, even for Collier.

78
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:58,701
If you want to create a new world,
first, you have to destroy the old one,

79
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:01,752
and disrupting the economy's
a pretty good way to start.

80
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:04,847
I wouldn't mind driving.

81
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,834
- Does that work for you?
- Be my guest.

82
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:08,853
I'm gonna need an hour or two
before we go see Collier.

83
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:11,411
- Is there something wrong?
- Hopefully not.

84
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,419
I've got an appointment
for a cat-scan.

85
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,622
It's just a precaution.

86
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:19,551
Ever since the mole came back,
I've been a little on edge.

87
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:22,817
- You don't feel any different, do you?
- You mean, am I one of the marked?

88
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,408
Some kind of zombie
controlled by a future human?

89
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:27,980
Not... not yet, anyway.

90
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,224
I'll call you
when I'm done with the hospital.

91
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:36,069
Are you sure you won't
reconsider, Mr. Chatha?

92
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,985
Taking the shot
would be...

93
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,006
hugely beneficial,
not only to you,

94
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:43,370
but to the millions of your readers
who would follow your example.

95
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,640
Yes, but you have to
understand that...

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,736
there is no guarantee that
this alleged compatibility test

97
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:53,903
of Shawn Farrell's
will ever be perfected.

98
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:59,104
Yes, well,
if you change your mind,

99
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:00,887
the door's always open.

100
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,418
We have your cousin
to thank for that.

101
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:07,056
Maneck Chatha's name is on the list
in the white light book.

102
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:08,681
We already know
he can survive the shot.

103
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,740
It's his followers
he's worried about.

104
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:13,435
Why risk their lives
when Shawn's announced

105
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:16,069
it's only a matter of time
before the test is available?

106
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,389
Too bad you lost Chatha.

107
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,109
It wouldn't have happened
if you'd done what I told you to.

108
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:28,238
Yeah, I know.

109
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:31,204
Stop Shawn, right?
What does that mean exactly?

110
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,722
I was hoping
you'd figure that out for yourself.

111
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:37,640
Shawn's not developing
this test by himself.

112
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:40,938
What you need to do
is get rid of Kevin  Burkhoff.

113
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:44,683
Get rid of him?

114
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,222
What am I supposed to do exactly,
kill the guy?

115
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:52,842
I expect you to do whatever it takes
to fulfill the prophecy

116
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,534
and help Jordan Collier
bring heaven to earth.

117
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,398
Good morning, Isabelle.

118
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:15,871
I hope you're feeling at home.

119
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,763
You know, I have to say...

120
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:23,204
of all of our real estate holdings,
this place is my favorite.

121
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:30,918
I thought you'd like to know,
tomorrow, your father's being moved

122
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,600
from Seattle
to an NTAC holding facility in Virginia.

123
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:36,015
Which means you need to agree
to take your abilities back

124
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:38,634
before Richard steps on that plane,
because if you don't,

125
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:39,816
he's not getting off it.

126
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,057
You already caused
your mother's death.

127
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:46,857
Do you want to be responsible
for your father's, too?

128
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:50,121
Even if I agreed to take the shot,
what's the point?

129
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:53,289
The government doctors already told me
that promicin will kill me.

130
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,135
We can change that, Isabelle.

131
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:58,227
I guarantee you'll live
to fulfill your original mission...

132
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:01,841
To destroy the 4400, and anyone else
with trace of promicin in their system.

133
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,684
And you will start
by bringing us Jordan Collier.

134
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,769
You know, Kyle used to
talk about you all the time.

135
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,121
He said
you were a decent man,

136
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:14,579
but then you're not Tom Baldwin,
are you?

137
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:20,090
Tom Baldwin was a confused
and unhappy man.

138
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:23,090
I've given him the clarity of purpose
he desperately needed,

139
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,232
and I want to give that
to you, Isabelle.

140
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:27,644
After all, I created you...

141
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,582
Placed you in your mother's womb
to make sure you were sent back

142
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:31,781
in that ball of light,

143
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:34,355
so you could protect the world
from the 4400.

144
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:41,942
Promicin is evil.
People who use it are evil.

145
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,481
Their goal isn't to change the world,
it is to end it.

146
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,435
You can stop them.
You have to stop them.

147
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:49,697
It's what you're meant to do.

148
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,063
How can you say no
to your destiny?

154
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,959
Manual labor
in Promise City?

155
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:58,461
Isn't that
a bit old school?

156
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:02,675
Nothing wrong with old school,
when it comes to a little...

157
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:04,066
sweat and muscle.

158
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:06,316
Having an ability can
lead to complacency,

159
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,533
and complacency...

160
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,454
is the measure
of a dying society.

161
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:12,314
Welcome to the new world.

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,140
You're here about the attacks
on the banking system.

163
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,769
- You know about that?
- I try to stay current,

164
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,487
but I can assure you
that despite the attacker's...

165
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,795
utopian signature,
nobody here had anything to do with it.

166
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:26,595
Can you really be sure of that?
You must have, like, 500 people

167
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:27,695
living here by now.

168
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:30,674
Nobody here would do something like that
without Jordan's consent.

169
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:31,799
Which I didn't give.

170
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:33,281
Well, just proove it to us.

171
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:35,386
Let us talk to your people,
and if...

172
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,556
nobody did it, maybe they can
help us find out

173
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:40,195
- who the hell is responsible.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

174
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,392
You mean you won't.

175
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,216
I mean... Whoever's doing this
has my best wishes.

176
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:47,633
The system you live in
is obsolete.

177
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:50,898
Any society that worships
at the altar of wealth is doomed,

178
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:53,393
so why not flood
the streets with money...

179
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:57,552
<i>All those little pieces of paper</i>
<I>are as worthless as confetti.</I>

180
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:02,558
Christ, Tom, no!

181
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:06,818
Dad, don't.
Please don't...

182
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:08,238
Please don't, dad.

183
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:11,005
Because the future
I believe in,

184
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:13,540
is one that exists
without the need for money.

185
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,444
It's a world where miracles
are common currency.

186
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,584
Now, excuse me,
I have some work to do.

187
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:25,042
<i>It's not just ATMs anymore.

188
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,806
We're looking at computer system
failures all over the country.

189
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:28,944
Make that the world.

190
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,272
Federal agencies,
financial institutions,

191
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:32,386
private businesses...

192
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:35,277
Even your friendly neighborhood laptops
are all crashing,

193
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,950
victims of the same corrosive virus
that infected the ATMs.

194
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,911
And these attacks
are anything but random.

195
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:43,095
Every malfunctioning computer,
including the original ATMs

196
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:44,307
has one thing in common.

197
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:47,145
They all run Ubient's
<i>Enzyme</i> operating system.

198
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,875
Ubient?
That's Drew Imroth's company.

199
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,707
So, I guess the question
we have to ask is this...

200
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:55,569
Are these attacks against...

201
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:59,213
Drew Imroth,
the multi-billionaire corporate giant?

202
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:00,472
Or Drew Imroth...

203
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,284
the alleged member of the global
conspiracy known as The Marked?

204
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:04,747
The operative word
is "alleged."

205
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:07,258
We don't even have any hard evidence
that The Marked exist.

206
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:08,835
Tom and I are pretty certain.

207
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:11,632
Yeah, that's right.

208
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,851
But even so, Ubient is one of
the biggest corporations in the world.

209
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,710
If it goes under,
we're all in trouble.

210
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:22,534
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

211
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:23,901
No...

212
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:26,570
Everybody, this is Abigail Hunnicutt.
She's new.

213
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,937
We were lucky
to grab her.

214
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:32,148
Abigail's been teaching a course
in combinatorics and probability

215
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:33,548
at M.I.T. since she was 22.

216
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:35,975
I also worked my way
through graduate school

217
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:37,911
in the men's department
at Sak's. So...

218
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:39,759
Who knows?
Maybe I can...

219
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,510
teach these guys
how to dress like grown-ups.

220
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,902
I thought
everyone should see this.

221
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,660
It's some kind of manifesto.

222
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,917
Every computer
infected with the virus

223
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:54,227
is printing it out.

224
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:57,196
It's calling for the destruction
of all Ubient software.

225
00:12:57,573 --> 00:13:00,398
Which is why, marked or not,
we need to speak with Drew Imroth.

226
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,196
Hello?

227
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,603
Hey, Maia.
It's me Lindsey.

228
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,804
- Happy birthday.
- <I>Hi. I can't believe you remembered.

229
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:12,038
You know, it's not
for another two days.

230
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:15,424
<i>Whatever.</i>
I have got the coolest gift for you.

231
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,980
- You want to come over?
- <i>It's not that kind of present.

232
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,487
You have to come to Promise City
and see it for yourself.

233
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,962
My mom really wants me
to stay away from there.

234
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:26,392
<i>She doesn't have to know.
You are so going to thank me for this.

235
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:29,413
I guess I can come by
tomorrow after school.

236
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:33,852
Great. Meet me at the southwest corner
of Beacon and 64th street at 3:30.

237
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,522
I've got some friends here

238
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:38,026
who will help us sneak past
the government blockade.

239
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:39,759
Okay, bye.

240
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,260
Yes, Mr. Secretary,

241
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,119
I understand how sensitive
your department records are.

242
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:52,614
I promise that once we get
the problem resolved,

243
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:56,290
Ubient will do everything possible
to retrieve your lost data.

244
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,173
Believe me, sir,
I feel your pain.

245
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:01,475
I'm a stockholder, too.

246
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:06,883
I warned you

247
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,399
that something like this
was going to happen.

248
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,598
Jordan Collier and his followers
are bent on global revolution,

249
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,668
and this assault on my company
is the opening salvo.

250
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:21,780
We just came from Promise City.
Collier's denying any involvement.

251
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:23,462
I don't believe that,

252
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:25,769
and I certainly hope
you two don't either!

253
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:28,286
Whether it's Collier's people
or some rogue p-positive,

254
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:30,236
it doesn't really matter,
we'll find him.

255
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,229
When will that be?

256
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:35,223
Will I still have
a company left by then?

257
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:36,657
We're doing our best.

258
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,446
All of this could
have been avoided

259
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,113
if you people had done your jobs
in the first place.

260
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:45,448
But, no, you were too busy
chasing after imaginary conspiracies.

261
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:47,624
How about it, agent Baldwin?

262
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:49,958
Would you like to check
my mole again?

263
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:53,561
That won't be necessary.

264
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:57,688
Glad to see you finally have
your priorities straight.

265
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,357
I just hope it's not too late
to save my company.

266
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:03,764
With all your success over the years,
you must've made your share of enemies.

267
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,418
Thousands of them.
In fact, I keep a list...

268
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:11,828
of everyone who's ever sent me
a threatening letter or email.

269
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,670
Organized by level
of vehemence.

270
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:16,018
It's a hobby.

271
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:18,753
Is Steve Jobs
on page one?

272
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:21,900
You might want to give him
a promicin test.

273
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:35,071
Dr. Burkhoff,
you ready for a break?

274
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,240
Not now.

275
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:40,856
I lost quite a bit of data
when this computer crashed.

276
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:44,444
Right, that's that Ubient virus.
The net's down in the entire building.

277
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,289
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

278
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,077
I have to reconstruct
a 74-page document from memory,

279
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:51,335
and I'm on, like, what...

280
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,100
Page 12?

281
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,939
I appreciate
your dedication,

282
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:58,101
but I kinda promised Tess I'd get you
out of the lab once in a while.

283
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:00,218
- You spoke to Tess?
- Yeah, just now.

284
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:02,645
Sounds like she's having
a great time with her niece.

285
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,984
Grand-niece, actually.
Tess was born in 1937.

286
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,526
Right, sorry.
I forgot.

287
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,118
You need a break.

288
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,628
I got a surprise for you.
Come on, it's a massage.

289
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,441
- She's waiting upstairs.
- No, thank you.

290
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,325
I don't like strangers
touching me.

291
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:21,179
The human hand can be so...
clammy.

292
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,310
Okay, but I already paid
for the hour.

293
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,344
Well, be my guest.

294
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:26,714
Enjoy yourself.

295
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,277
I'll just be down here,

296
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:30,796
working to save
thousands of lives

297
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,568
and change the world
for the better.

298
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:37,254
Thank you.

299
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:41,975
You know...

300
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:45,082
Imroth was not joking
when he said he had a lot of enemies.

301
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:47,596
This is going to take all night
to get through this.

302
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:50,395
- I think I'm gonna take my half home.
- That's a good idea.

303
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,823
You really surprised me today
at Imroth's office.

304
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:56,506
The way you reacted
when he got in your face.

305
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,766
The guy was having a rough day.
I was trying to be diplomatic.

306
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,100
I mean, considering
what we suspect him of.

307
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,714
Because he brought up the Marked,
and you didn't even...

308
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:05,814
well, pursue it.

309
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:07,526
Neither did you.

310
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,959
It's not like he was
going to admit to anything.

311
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,042
I promise, the next time
he gives us some attitude,

312
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,592
you'll see
some fireworks, okay?

313
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,503
Good night.

314
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,759
Did you...

315
00:17:21,177 --> 00:17:22,743
get the results
of the cat-scan?

316
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:25,144
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

317
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:26,825
Thanks for asking.

318
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,060
- Good night.
- Good night.

319
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,022
- Hello?
- Hello.

320
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,128
Hi, Kevin.

321
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,510
I'm back.

322
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:13,268
Out here.

323
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,890
See me?

324
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:17,579
Come find me.

325
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:20,455
I thought you weren't
coming back for a few days.

326
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:22,272
Kevin, I'm over here.

327
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:27,456
Where are you?

328
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:30,757
You found me.

329
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,080
I brought your breakfast.

330
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,634
Come on.
Orders are you're supposed to eat.

331
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:12,332
Let her go!

332
00:19:12,837 --> 00:19:14,629
We're not supposed
to hurt her.

333
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,083
Morning, Diana.

334
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:31,272
Read any good
death threats lately?

335
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:33,334
Too many.

336
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,063
So, what do we got,
like, 8 000 suspects?

337
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:39,238
Good luck
tracking them all down.

338
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:43,744
So how was your night?

339
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:45,761
It was kind of strange.

340
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,176
I was on my way home

341
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,324
when I got a phone call
from Drew Imroth.

342
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,569
Yeah, I know,
it threw me, too.

343
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:56,240
Anyway, he told me
he had to see me right away,

344
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,369
alone at Madison park.
It all felt a little...

345
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,430
cloak and dagger,
but what was I gonna do?

346
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,917
- I guess you had to go.
- Exactly.

347
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,935
Turns out, he wants me
to pass the case off to another agent.

348
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:09,372
He's worried that I'm still obsessed
about proving he's one of the Marked.

349
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:12,605
What did you tell him?

350
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:14,773
The truth. That he had
nothing to worry about.

351
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,975
That I'd do my job
to the best of my abilities.

352
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:19,512
Then I asked him to name
every member of the marked,

353
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,176
which led to some of the fireworks
you were hoping for.

354
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:26,853
I better take this.
I'll see you in there.

355
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:31,218
Baldwin...

356
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:35,333
When?

357
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,780
Is Isabelle all right?

358
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,359
Fine. I'll have
to make an excuse here.

359
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:44,626
I'll be right over.

360
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,507
What happened?
Where's kevin?

361
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:55,854
I don't know. The cleaning
staff came in this morning.

362
00:20:55,994 --> 00:20:58,883
This is how they found the place.
All his work is missing, too.

363
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,111
This was Jordan.

364
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:09,224
It had to be.
He knows about the compatibility test.

365
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:13,862
It's so strange.

366
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:17,889
All those people willing to risk
their lives to get an ability.

367
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,613
Thinking it'll make them
feel less alone,

368
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,493
more powerful.

369
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,831
I never felt more alone
and less powerful

370
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:31,929
than when I had
limitless abilities.

371
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,378
It overwhelmed my entire life.

372
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,361
Became my identity,
cut me off from everyone...

373
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:41,136
My parents...

374
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,455
Shawn...

375
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:49,865
It's only when I lost everything
that I found myself,

376
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,890
and now you want me
to go back there,

377
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:57,365
- become that person again.
- That person is who you are.

378
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:01,432
It won't be that bad, Isabelle.

379
00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:04,552
These past few months,
you got a little vacation,

380
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:06,396
you spent a little time
out in the world,

381
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,555
but now it's time
to go back to work.

382
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,710
It was nice to be normal...

383
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:18,457
At least for a little while.

384
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,558
Okay,
so this is a modification

385
00:22:39,698 --> 00:22:41,363
of a document authorization program

386
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:43,340
Abigail designed
while she was at M.I.T.

387
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:45,427
We used it to cross-reference
the language

388
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,085
in the anti-Ubient manifesto

389
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,995
with the hate mail
directed at Drew Imroth.

390
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,804
We were looking for
idiosyncratic phrases

391
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:52,955
and word choices
with a high degree of similarity

392
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:54,295
in both documents.

393
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,874
Now, you can see
whoever wrote the manifesto

394
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,967
likes to use semi-colons
by the handful.

395
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:02,016
He's also fond of "who" or "which"
instead of "that",

396
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:04,889
and he refers to Imroth
as "Mr. Puppetmaster",

397
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,804
a phrase he repeats
a total of 6 times.

398
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,568
And... what do we find
in the hate mail department?

399
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,443
This document.
Semi-colons.

400
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,540
"Who" and "which" used again
instead of "that",

401
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,520
and finally, our old friend,
"Mr. Puppetmaster".

402
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,796
So the two authors
are one and the same.

403
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:22,484
Do you have a name for us?

404
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:25,242
This e-mail is signed "Swindled".
Imroth put his people on it.

405
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:27,547
They traced it
to a Warren Trask.

406
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,333
Turns out,
back in the early '80s,

407
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:31,202
Trask designed
a primitive version

408
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:32,757
of the <i>Enzyme</i> operating system.

409
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,237
When Imroth came out with
a very similar program,

410
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:37,623
- Trask sued.
- Let me guess. He lost.

411
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,223
No, no, it never
went to court.

412
00:23:39,343 --> 00:23:41,305
Imroth offered Trask
an out-of-court settlement.

413
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:43,270
Trask wound up with $100,000.

414
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,165
Meanwhile,
<i>Enzyme</i> has made Imroth billions.

415
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,663
- So the guy's pissed.
- Wouldn't you be?

416
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:51,479
You can ask him yourself.
He lives right here in seattle.

417
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:55,043
Well, nice work, Marco.

418
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:57,625
Actually, it was all Abigail.

419
00:23:58,198 --> 00:23:59,710
She buy you that suit, too?

420
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:06,759
Stop looking so freaked out.

421
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:08,051
We're almost there.

422
00:24:08,191 --> 00:24:09,776
I told you I can't stay long.

423
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,405
- If my mom finds out...
- She won't.

424
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:18,674
I promised you
a birthday surprise, right?

425
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:21,248
Well, here it is.

426
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,051
Mom?
Dad?

427
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:37,567
Maia, is it really you?

428
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,571
Vic, can you believe
how big she's gotten?

429
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:42,233
She's still
my little girl.

430
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:46,359
I only wish I could give you
a great, big birthday hug.

431
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:49,199
Me too.

432
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,442
But you can't.

433
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:54,978
You're just somebody's
4400 ability.

434
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:58,180
Whatever we are,
we're your parents,

435
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:00,274
and we love you so much.

436
00:25:11,412 --> 00:25:12,444
Excuse me.

437
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,144
I'm agent Baldwin,
this is agent Skouris. We're with NTAC.

438
00:25:15,506 --> 00:25:17,252
We're here to see
Warren Trask.

439
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:19,484
I'm his daughter, Eileen.

440
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:21,920
- What's this all about?
- We'd like to ask your father

441
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,793
some questions
about Drew Imroth.

442
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,953
Well, you can ask him
anything you want.

443
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:28,207
Just don't expect any answers.

444
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,753
My dad had a stroke
three months ago.

445
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,154
He hasn't moved a muscle
nor said a word since.

446
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:48,908
My father was a brilliant man,

447
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:51,340
but he was naive and trusting,

448
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,588
and Drew Imroth
took advantage of that

449
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:56,023
to cheat my father
out of his life's work.

450
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:58,846
His career, his marriage,

451
00:25:58,986 --> 00:26:00,809
his... health.

452
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:03,027
My father lost it all.

453
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,219
So when did he take
the promicin shot?

454
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,974
About six months ago.

455
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:09,367
As far as I know,
it didn't do anything,

456
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:12,438
no ability, nothing, and then
he had the aneurysm.

457
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:14,426
Do you really still believe

458
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:16,375
he's behind
what's happening to Ubient?

459
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:18,170
All these machines
he's hooked up to,

460
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,526
they're run by computer,
so he's connected to networks

461
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,399
for emergency response
monitoring.

462
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,462
If his mind is still functioning and
he's got an ability, then, yeah...

463
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:27,350
he could be
the ghost in the machine.

464
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:29,134
Well, that would be...

465
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:31,819
wonderful.

466
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,689
Daddy,

467
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:36,681
if that's true,

468
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:39,120
I am so happy for you.

469
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:42,982
Don't stop until you ruin Imroth
like he ruined you.

470
00:26:43,157 --> 00:26:44,659
That's enough of that.

471
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:47,470
- You're hurting me.
- Tom, let her go.

472
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,089
She's an accessory
to a half-dozen felonies.

473
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:53,503
If there is anything you are holding
back, you'd better tell us now.

474
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,306
I don't know anything,

475
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:59,350
but if my father
is bringing down Drew Imroth,

476
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,603
I'd consider that justice.

477
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:18,670
Am I mistaken, or am I looking
at a xerces blue butterfly?

478
00:27:19,401 --> 00:27:20,809
I believe
that's what it's called.

479
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:25,119
The xerces blue
has been extinct since 1941.

480
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,195
Not here.
Not anymore.

481
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:30,012
We have a resident
who can modify DNA

482
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:31,893
to recreate
extinct species.

483
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,310
Only insects so far, but he hopes
to work his way up to mammals.

484
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:38,654
I don't know about you, but I'd love
to see a woolly mammoth in the flesh.

485
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:48,350
I'm impressed...

486
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,610
And I'm not easily impressed.

487
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:58,701
A man of your intelect
could do just about anything

488
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,560
here in promise city.

489
00:28:02,818 --> 00:28:05,133
Which might be
a more persuasive argument

490
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:08,278
if I weren't a kidnap victim
being held against my will.

491
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:11,137
It was my idea to bring you here.
Jordan knew nothing about it.

492
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:14,153
Is that supposed to make
everything all right?

493
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,645
Kyle's method
might have been extreme,

494
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,273
but I can't fault his motive,
you belong here...

495
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:22,710
in Promise City,
with us, Kevin.

496
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:25,974
You are the father
of the promicin movement.

497
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:30,210
Without your discoveries,
Promise City wouldn't even exist.

498
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,990
I made
a scientific breakthrough...

499
00:28:36,318 --> 00:28:39,472
But I didn't start
a religious cult.

500
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:42,165
Kevin, like it or not,

501
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:44,343
you're revered by everyone here.

502
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:47,795
However, I cannot allow
your research to continue.

503
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,687
A promicin compatibility test

504
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:52,004
would be death to this movement.

505
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,043
All I'm trying to do
is save lives, Jordan.

506
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:57,319
So are we.

507
00:28:57,957 --> 00:29:00,067
We're just thinking
a little more long-term.

508
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,268
So...
Until you share our vision,

509
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:06,767
I'm afraid I'll have to insist
you remain our guest.

510
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:12,890
Tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.? I was kind
of hoping for something sooner.

511
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:15,814
No, no, we can't prove conclusively
that Trask's our man,

512
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,795
but we know he took
the promicin shot.

513
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,297
Okay, if that's
the best you can do.

514
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:21,592
Okay, thanks.

515
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:25,619
We can't get a court order to move
Trask to NTAC medical till morning.

516
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:29,070
But Ubient is hemmoraging
millions of dollars an hour.

517
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:31,019
The stock market is down
over 500 points,

518
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:33,337
I don't know about you, but my
pension plan is pretty much history.

519
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:34,849
We've done all we can
to isolate him.

520
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:37,082
We've cut off the phone services
and internet to his home.

521
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:39,458
We don't even know if he needs
a phone line to access the net.

522
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:40,977
We need to get Trask
on the inhibitor,

523
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:42,811
- and we need to do it now.
- It's not an option.

524
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:44,006
His doctors have ruled it out.

525
00:29:44,146 --> 00:29:46,196
Given the state of his health,
it's way too risky.

526
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:47,761
Well, maybe
it's worth the risk.

527
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,646
Just keeping Trask
under wraps at NTAC

528
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:52,153
is no guarantee that the attacks
against Ubient will stop.

529
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,065
What are you suggesting, Tom,
we kill him?

530
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:55,177
Of course not!

531
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:03,918
It's just... Look,
it's just frustrating, for all of us.

532
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:07,353
Anyhow, I guess there's nothing
we can do till morning.

533
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:18,906
Hey, birthday girl, I'm home!

534
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:22,220
Why aren't you dressed yet?
The dinner reservation's for 7:00.

535
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,587
I'll be ready in time.

536
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:26,000
Then we come home
and open the presents, all right?

537
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,600
That'll be good.

538
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:30,500
What's wrong?
Did something happen today?

539
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:35,180
I told you not to get
your hopes up about Ben.

540
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:38,175
I told you, I'm past all that.

541
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,559
That's good,
because I don't know about you,

542
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,218
but I'm ready
for some birthday cake.

543
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:44,689
So lets get going, okay?

544
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,266
- Yeah?
- <i>It's me.</i>

545
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,403
Tell me you've got good news.

546
00:31:13,684 --> 00:31:17,582
Because at this rate, Ubient software
will cease to exist in three days,

547
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,966
which means we lose
all our financial backing,

548
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,988
<i>not to mention
our spyware program.</i>

549
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:23,509
I get it.
Don't worry.

550
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:25,595
I'm taking care of it.

551
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:26,984
<i>I hope so.</i>

552
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,120
Oh, my god, daddy?

553
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:05,996
Daddy?

554
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:13,520
Come on!

555
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:16,250
Come on.

556
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:41,363
Half a dozen residents
claimed they heard the crash.

557
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,931
- But nobody saw anything?
- Apparently not.

558
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,176
Morning.

559
00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:47,712
Court order
come through yet?

560
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,496
Uh, yes, it did.

561
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,242
Not that it matters anymore.

562
00:32:51,557 --> 00:32:54,055
- Why not? What's going on?
- Last night, someone stole a car

563
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:55,654
and plowed it
into a telephone pole

564
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,384
a few blocks
from Warren Trask's house.

565
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:58,989
Blacked out
the entire neighborhood.

566
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:00,634
Life support system shut down.

567
00:33:00,774 --> 00:33:02,080
It ran on battery power for a while,

568
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,234
but we had his daughter's
cell phone jammed.

569
00:33:04,438 --> 00:33:05,832
By the time she got
to a phone that worked...

570
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:07,174
Trask's dead?

571
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,416
Try not to sound
so broken up about it.

572
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,820
I'm just surprised, that's all.

573
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:15,098
What about the attacks
on Ubient?

574
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:17,710
As of this morning,
Ubient software is running virus-free.

575
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,779
Seems Imroth's company
is going to survive,

576
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,233
and so's the economy.
Stock market's already up 200 points.

577
00:33:25,246 --> 00:33:27,781
Weird way for things to work out,
but I guess we'll take it.

578
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:30,354
Yeah, we all got lucky,
except for Warren Trask.

579
00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:32,509
What happened to your head?

580
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:36,259
Oh, I banged it
on the medicine cabinet

581
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,860
in the middle of the night.
Next time I'll turn on the light.

582
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,130
Good idea.

583
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:44,516
You have five minutes, Shawn.
Tell me what you want.

584
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:47,337
I want you to release Kevin Burkhoff.
Don't tell me he's not here.

585
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:49,243
Dr. Burkhoff is here.
He's my guest,

586
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:51,290
and he'll remain that way
for the time being.

587
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,736
Tell me, Jordan,
since when did kidnapping

588
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,519
become part of this
new religion of yours?

589
00:33:56,714 --> 00:33:59,623
That seems like a pretty twisted way
to bring the world closer to god.

590
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:01,442
You want to get back
in my good graces?

591
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,639
It's simple.

592
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,610
Hold another press conference,
announce you've had a change of heart,

593
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:08,327
and that you now support
the taking of promicin.

594
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:10,646
You know I can't do that.

595
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:12,646
Then Kevin Burkhoff
remains my guest,

596
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:14,457
and you...

597
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,086
You're no longer welcome
in Promise City.

598
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,638
Goodbye, shawn.

599
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:00,963
How is my girl feeling?

600
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:03,216
Like I'm going to die.

601
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:04,969
Ah, it's just
your body ridding itself

602
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:06,809
of the anti-promicin
allergens.

603
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:09,717
It's all part of the process.

604
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,653
Look this way.

605
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:14,274
There you go.

606
00:35:19,263 --> 00:35:21,845
Now...
It's time for the next step.

607
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,046
Don't.

608
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,305
It's okay, Isabelle.

609
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,278
In a few seconds, you are
going to feel a lot better.

610
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,595
You see?
That wasn't so bad.

611
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:50,435
Oh, and...

612
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,491
Isabelle, I know
what you're thinking.

613
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:55,866
Once your abilities return,
you're gonna use them against me.

614
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:59,938
It worked once before
when you murdered Matthew Ross,

615
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,089
but I wouldn't try it again.

616
00:36:02,436 --> 00:36:04,155
This time, we're not
taking any chances.

617
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,896
We placed a deterrent inside you
while you were in prison.

618
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:09,728
Call it a... kill switch.

619
00:36:10,723 --> 00:36:12,197
If you move against me,

620
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:16,057
or disobey me in any way,
it will be activated, and you will die.

621
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,654
Now, you just...

622
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:26,880
rest for another hour or so,

623
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:28,927
and when you get up,

624
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:31,609
you'll be the most
powerful person on the planet...

625
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,058
Again.

626
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,820
So, what do we have?

627
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:52,989
The lab ran
the test you asked for.

628
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:56,018
The glass sample they pulled
was pretty degraded.

629
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:59,060
It's going to take a couple of days
to get conclusive results,

630
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,418
but we do have
the preliminary results.

631
00:37:03,992 --> 00:37:05,556
I'm sorry, Diana,

632
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:09,335
but there's about an 80% chance
the blood belongs to Tom Baldwin.

633
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:17,255
These last few weeks, I could tell
there was something wrong.

634
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:20,530
It's like he was the same guy,
but different, you know?

635
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,926
And I kept telling myself,
"it's okay, it's still Tom."

636
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,051
Well, I didn't want to
believe it either.

637
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:28,132
He's been my partner
and my friend for years.

638
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:30,466
Talk about
sleeping with the enemy.

639
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:38,171
I don't know if he told you,
but... Tom and I...

640
00:37:38,866 --> 00:37:40,218
No, he didn't,

641
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:43,722
but the possibility
had crossed my mind.

642
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:45,555
Okay, so we're past that.

643
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:47,888
The question is,
what do we do now, Diana?

644
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:52,460
Well, we have to find a way
to get the real Tom Baldwin back,

645
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,217
and we can't let him suspect
that we know anything.

646
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,160
We just to have to
force ourselves

647
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,034
to act like
nothing's changed.

648
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:02,370
That's not going to
be a problem in the office,

649
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,966
but outside, I mean...

650
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:07,006
It's not going to be easy.
The physical intimacy thing, I'm...

651
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:08,841
I'm not sure I can handle it.

652
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,737
So you two got it all
figured out?

653
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,701
Whatever it is
you're talking about.

654
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:17,274
Tom, what are you doing
in the office so late?

655
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:21,452
Just catching up
on some loose ends.

656
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,156
- What about you guys?
- Just... just the same.

657
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:27,605
You know, I was thinking about
catching a bite. Who's with me?

658
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:31,039
I can't.
I'm supposed to be at my dad's.

659
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:34,831
Oh, I got to get home.

660
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:39,176
Well, I'm just going to
finish up here.

661
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:41,500
- You two have a good night.
- Yeah, you too.

662
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:42,862
Good night.

663
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:06,121
I have to say,
you did wonderful work.

664
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:08,356
With Trask out of the way,

665
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,460
the company
has finally rebounded.

666
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,993
The next two fiscal quarters
will be shaky at best,

667
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:17,145
but thanks to you,
Ubient lives.

668
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:20,036
You're not celebrating.
what's wrong?

669
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:21,611
One of the last things
Trask did

670
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:23,916
was spread your personal data
all over the internet.

671
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:27,637
Names, phone records,
financial statements.

672
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,947
They're all out there
for all eyes to see...

673
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:32,685
To study.

674
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:35,550
It could lead to
some very dangerous questions.

675
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,773
So, we do damage control.

676
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:40,127
Delete all we can
and deny the rest.

677
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,820
That'll only feed
the conspiracy theorists.

678
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,768
So it's been decided, Drew.

679
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:49,922
We're going to have to take
a more radical approach.

680
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:53,019
What do you have in mind?

681
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,595
Hi, mom!
Hi, dad!

682
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,385
Hello, sweetheart.
did you have a fun birthday?

683
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:05,918
Pretty fun.

684
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:08,528
I just... wish you
could have been there.

685
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:11,332
- So do we.
- I'll bet you got some nice gifts.

686
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:12,824
I got a new iPod.

687
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,878
It's like a record player,

688
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:17,683
only it plays
thousands of songs.

689
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:19,962
- Any Sinatra?
- Tons of Sinatra.

690
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,934
Next time I come,
I'll bring it with me.

691
00:40:22,074 --> 00:40:23,737
Are you sure
you can get away?

692
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:25,720
You know, we wouldn't
want to interfere

693
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,246
with any homework
or anything.

694
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:29,067
You're not interfering.

695
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:32,509
I like coming here
and seeing you.

696
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,028
I wish I could
come every day.

697
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,261
So do we.

698
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,880
But you're here now.

699
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,750
Jordan's never
going to let Kevin go.

700
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:46,461
So that's it? The compatibility test
isn't going to happen?

701
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,816
It has to happen.

702
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:51,170
I have to make it happen.

703
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:55,968
Get on the phone,
get ahold of Tess.

704
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:58,696
We're taking Kevin
out of Promise City.

705
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
It's all settled.

706
00:41:42,871 --> 00:41:44,824
He understands
what he has to do.

707
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:47,599
He may have been
a little disappointed at first.

708
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,069
After all, he had a good run,

709
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:51,595
<i>but in the end, he took it well.</i>

710
00:41:51,735 --> 00:41:53,285
<i>He knows it's time to move on.</i>

711
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:55,907
<i>I'm sure he considers it
an honor...</i>

712
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:59,544
Especially after he heard about
the new host we have lined up for him.

713
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:03,751
<i>He made an excellent
Drew Imroth,</i>

714
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:07,779
but he'll make an even better
Jordan Collier.

715
