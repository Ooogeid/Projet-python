<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,932
The world will have to
deal with us.

3
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:46,449
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

4
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:48,732
- Who's Cassie?
- I'm Kyle's ability.

5
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,749
<i>You ever go visit
your cousin, Shawn?

6
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,866
<i>Maybe someone should try injecting him
with a big old dose of promicin.

7
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,199
It's all about to happen.

8
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:56,582
What's going to happen?

9
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,507
Thumb through the book,
if you'd like.

10
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,615
A lot of it is written
in a code or something.

11
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,257
- Maia, this is my friend, Ben.
- I've heard a lot about you.

12
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:10,686
You saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?

13
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,737
These shots are free.

14
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:14,378
Give them to anyone
who wants them,

15
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,645
but be careful
to explain the risks.

16
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,208
There are no guarantees.

17
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,045
There never are.

18
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,051
Is this seat taken?

19
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,034
It is now.

20
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,693
I'm April,
by the way.

21
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:00,776
Peter. Barton.

22
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:02,737
So, what's good tonight?

23
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:05,281
I recommend
the lemon drop martini.

24
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,337
Bartender,
can I get two more?

25
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:12,242
Is that okay?

26
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,403
I don't want you to think
I'm hitting on you or anything.

27
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,986
So, what do you do, Peter?

28
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,037
I'm V.P. of client relations
for ANEXXO.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,761
We're in the fortune 500.

30
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:23,637
Energy. Communications.
Some defense work...

31
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,637
I get it. You're one of the guys
that runs the world.

32
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,837
Me? No, but...
I work for those guys.

33
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:32,153
So, what brings you to Seattle?

34
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:35,604
The company's in the midst
of a major project, and...

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,020
they hit a little snag, so...
I'm here to do some triage.

36
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,770
You're going to save the day?

37
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:42,436
Hopefully.

38
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,937
And how are you going
to do that?

39
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:51,762
I'm gonna bribe someone
to look the other way.

40
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,836
I can't believe
I just told you that.

41
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:59,154
Look, do me a favor...

42
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:02,729
- forget what I just said.
- It's already forgotten.

43
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,583
So, how much money
are we talking about?

44
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,588
$300,000. I'm picking it up
tomorrow afternoon.

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,660
Oh, my God.

46
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,579
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this stuff.

47
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:18,079
Did they put something
in this drink?

48
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:21,937
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm just a girl you met in a bar.

49
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:24,337
Don't ask me
any more questions, okay?

50
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:26,337
What room are you in, Peter?

51
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:27,445
315.

52
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:34,736
What I just told you,

53
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:36,311
don't repeat it.

54
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:38,744
It would be bad for you,
for me, for...

55
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,144
everyone.

56
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:49,625
Let me guess...

57
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,791
- The truth hurts.
- It usually does.

58
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,433
So what do we got?
Cheating husband? Tax fraud...

59
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,274
Try corporate intrigue.
Try bribery.

60
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:01,058
Try $300,000
arriving tomorrow.

61
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,746
- Room 315.
- 300 grand?

62
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,658
Baby, you're good.

63
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,158
Wow. Okay.

64
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,916
All right, so we'll hit him up
for 20% to keep quiet.

65
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,970
That's... 60,000 bucks.

66
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,620
Love me?

67
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:19,869
I do.

68
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:22,583
And it's not like
I can lie to you.

69
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:24,387
No, you can't.

70
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,541
No one can.

71
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:42,550
Glad I remembered
this place.

72
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,608
I had a lot of fun summers
up here when I was a kid.

73
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:48,900
It's pretty much
a ghost town till june, which is...

74
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:52,900
a good thing, because
the whole world's looking for you.

75
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:07,554
Maybe I should just
turn myself in.

76
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,287
Spend the rest of your life in prison?
I don't think so.

77
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,625
It was no coincidence
I was there when that van crashed.

78
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,591
I was sent
to help you get away.

79
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:20,024
This is all happening
for a reason.

80
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:21,882
And what would that be?

81
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:25,020
Truthfully, I'm not sure yet.
Maybe the answers are in this book.

82
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,723
I just hope they're not in this code,
or whatever this is.

83
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,098
Do you believe that
Jordan Collier is a Messiah?

84
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:32,153
And that promicin's
gonna save the world?

85
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:33,253
Yeah, I do.

86
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,733
Even if that's true,
what does it have to do with me?

87
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,504
My abilities are gone.

88
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:44,504
My body can't tolerate promicin.

89
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:48,541
I'm the enemy. I hurt shawn.

90
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,975
I tried to kill Jordan Collier.

91
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,525
I did kill Jordan.

92
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,233
Believe me.

93
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,800
I know what it feels like...

94
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,258
to be in prison and think
you're never getting out.

95
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:04,375
To feel you've done things
that no one will ever forgive you for.

96
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:06,929
But no one's so far gone
that they can't be forgiven,

97
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:10,400
don't have a role to play
In this new world of Jordan Collier's.

98
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:14,015
I'm meant to be
a part of that world.

99
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:17,266
To help bring it about,
and so are you.

100
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:29,975
Colin?

101
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,275
You're a hard woman
to find, April.

102
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,691
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

103
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,758
Well, you found me, Di.

104
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,000
Now what are you gonna do
with me?

105

110
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,092
It wasn't terribly smart using
mom's maiden name on your credit card.

111
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:56,834
If I'd known you were gonna come
looking for me,

112
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,495
then I would have been
more creative.

113
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:01,190
I can only imagine how pissed off
you must've been

114
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,781
when you'd heard
I'd taken the shot.

115
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,991
I wasn't terribly happy about it,
you're right.

116
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:07,524
But you are my sister,
and I was very worried about you.

117
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:10,624
Besides, I knew you never would have
taken the shot...

118
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:14,608
if it hadn't been for what happened
between Ben and me.

119
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:17,091
Feeling a little guilty, are we?

120
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,891
Well, don't.

121
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:21,083
You and Ben
may be why I did it...

122
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,766
But taking the shot
was the right thing for me to do.

123
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:26,520
I've got money, clothes,

124
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,587
a great guy, Colin,
who loves me,

125
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,520
and a pretty great ability.

126
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,072
How many times a week
are you and Ben having sex?

127
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:37,464
Three.

128
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,308
Wait, that's not...

129
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,591
- That is none of your business.
- I know.

130
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,474
And you told me anyway.

131
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:45,891
That's my ability.

132
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,191
I ask a question,
you tell the truth...

133
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,499
every time.

134
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:52,644
That's a pretty interesting ability.
It doesn't work on you, does it?

135
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,291
You mean make me
tell the truth?

136
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,432
Thankfully, no.

137
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,933
What am I gonna do
with you, April?

138
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:02,395
What am I gonna do
with you?

139
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:05,845
Go back to Spain, Di.

140
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,191
Any guilt you feel
about you and Ben...

141
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:10,324
Consider yourself
absolved.

142
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:12,074
Enjoy your life...

143
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,574
and let me enjoy mine.

144
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,582
That's wonderful, dad.

145
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:22,632
I'm so glad you're walking better.
I can't wait to see it.

146
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:25,008
I have to go.

147
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,008
I love you, too.

148
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,483
Garrity said
you wanted to see me.

149
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:38,441
Have you seen the doctor's final report
on your nephew's recovery?

150
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:39,649
Yes, I have.

151
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,225
Well, now so has D.C.

152
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:44,825
Those high levels of promicin
that were found in his system...

153
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,858
People are wondering
where they came from.

154
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,458
Yeah. Beats me.

155
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:51,891
Come on, Tom.

156
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,966
Someone
walked into the hospital

157
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:56,500
and gave your nephew
a massive dose of promicin.

158
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,579
Your sister and your son
were the only ones with him at the time.

159
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,285
Now I'm willing to dismiss Susan
as a suspect,

160
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,333
but I think you need
to have a talk with Kyle.

161
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,637
Excuse me?
Mr. Farrell.

162
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,491
Senator Lenhoff's
here to see you.

163
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,024
Senator Lenhoff?
Are you sure?

164
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:17,433
She's sure. I'm sure. And I can see
you're beginning to believe it yourself.

165
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:18,908
Roland Lenhoff.

166
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:20,708
The devil made flesh.

167
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:21,866
We need to talk.

168
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,387
In private.

169
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:29,324
Senator, if you're here
to try to force me

170
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,720
- to shut down the center again...
- Relax, Farrell.

171
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:33,858
I don't want
to shut this place, hell!

172
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,233
I want you to heal
as many people as possible,

173
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,278
which is surprising, I know.
After all...

174
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:39,753
I'm the guy that passed the bill

175
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:43,334
forcing all you 4400s
to register your abilities.

176
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:44,899
And you were
just warming up.

177
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,808
I seem to remember one speech
where you said

178
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:49,649
that if it were up to you,
we'd all be living behind barbed wire.

179
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,971
I knew you were
going to bring that up.

180
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:54,054
Have a seat.

181
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,156
Come on, sit down.

182
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:01,373
I'll admit...

183
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:04,207
I have been waging
a kind of war against you.

184
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:06,423
Trouble is,
I just chaired a committee,

185
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:09,274
which is about to issue
a 1600-page report,

186
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:11,290
which states,
in no uncertain terms,

187
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,632
that I'm losing that war
and you are winning it.

188
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:15,237
Promicin
isn't going away.

189
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,491
Jordan Collier
made damn sure of that.

190
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:19,341
If you're here
to sign terms of surrender,

191
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:22,307
- I could have some drawn up.
- Who's talking about surrender?

192
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,341
I fought in 'nam.

193
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,058
I have the medals to prove it.

194
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:28,424
And last year,

195
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:32,244
I took my wife
on vacation to Saigon.

196
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:36,058
I figure if I can make my peace
with Charlie,

197
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,109
I can make my peace with you.

198
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:43,924
They're holding
a special election

199
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:46,850
to fill a vacant seat
on the Seattle city council.

200
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:48,950
I want you to run for it.

201
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:52,016
City council?

202
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:55,058
Senator, I'm not a politician.

203
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:56,470
The hell you're not.

204
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:59,641
You stepped into the spotlight
when you reopened this center.

205
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,808
I want you to leverage
some of the good work

206
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:04,141
that you've been doing here
into something more.

207
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,801
You're the alternative we need

208
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,729
to Collier and his
promicin-pushing radicals.

209
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:14,208
You can walk the middle path
that will unite both 4400s

210
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:15,741
and non-4400s.

211
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,958
And this middle path?
You're planning on walking it with me?

212
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,575
Right down the center.

213
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,833
Probably lose any chance
of re-election.

214
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:29,561
My anti-4400 colleagues
will see to that.

215
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:32,028
But it's what
the country needs.

216
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:34,261
What the world needs.

217
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,869
So, what do you say,
Farrell?

218
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,769
You ready
to dance with the devil?

219
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:46,650
You should've seen
that hotel suite.

220
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,550
It must run
at $600 or $700 a night.

221
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,550
The dress, the shoes.

222
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,158
Moving around from city to city.
This ability of hers,

223
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:57,450
however she's using it,
she's going to get herself into trouble.

224
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,850
What are you
smiling about?

225
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,833
Diana, come on,
April's alive.

226
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:06,091
The shot didn't kill her.
She's not even living on the street.

227
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:08,920
She's even involved with a guy.
This is... a win.

228
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:10,750
It just doesn't
feel like a win.

229
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:12,242
She's going to screw up.

230
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:14,446
NTAC are going to get a hold of her,
and then what?

231
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,650
Listen to me.
Come here for a second.

232
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,300
You traveled 6,000 miles
to find your sister, right?

233
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,083
You offered her help.
She refused.

234
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:25,777
It's over.

235
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,283
And now we can move back
to Spain.

236
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,150
I guess we can.

237
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,050
- You guess?
- No, I mean... we will.

238
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,117
It will take a little time.

239
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:38,474
I mean, the whole work thing.

240
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,301
Come on, Diana,
it's not that complicated.

241
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:42,917
All you got to do is go in there,
turn in your gun and badge,

242
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:44,434
and we're on a plane
by tomorrow.

243
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,250
I can't just do that.

244
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:49,217
Not to Tom, to Meghan.

245
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,867
You just give me a week or so
and then we're out of here.

246
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,351
- We'll tell Maia tonight?
- Yeah. As soon as we get home.

247
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:10,042
You're sure you don't want me
to go with you to pick up the money?

248
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,896
Nah, you'd just freak
the guy out.

249
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,646
Barton knows you put some kind
of whammy on him, right?

250
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:22,550
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

251
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,967
Still thinking
about your sister?

252
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:28,008
I just can't believe she came
all that way to look for me.

253
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:30,075
I didn't think she cared enough.

254
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,012
April, she's a judgmental bitch,

255
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:34,062
and I say good riddance.

256
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,491
Besides, you don't need her anymore.
You got me.

257
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,242
So what do you say we meet in the bar
a little after 7:00,

258
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,450
- for a celebratory cocktail?
- Okay.

259
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,217
Where are we off to next?

260
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:50,650
I figured we'd go crash
with my brother in south beach.

261
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,350
He just moved there
from Phoenix.

262
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Jeff says there's
money to be made in Miami.

263
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,092
People there are holding onto
all kinds of dirty little secrets.

264
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,301
Dirty little secrets.

265
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:14,742
Got a minute, buddy?

266
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:16,650
Not really.
I'm meeting some friends.

267
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,158
It's about Shawn.

268
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,225
What about him?

269
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:28,679
The way he woke up from his coma
with all that promicin in him.

270
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:32,431
People are starting to wonder
if you had something to do with it.

271
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:34,414
By people, do you mean NTAC?

272
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,850
What exactly
are you accusing me of, dad?

273
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,250
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I'm asking you.

274
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,175
The day at the hospital,

275
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,521
did you give your cousin
a shot of promicin?

276
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,283
No, I didn't.

277
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:47,456
Kyle, listen to me.

278
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:49,456
- If you're involved in something.
- In what ?

279
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:51,812
I don't know. Last few nights,
you haven't come home...

280
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:54,392
- Dad, I'm 23 years old.
- I know that.

281
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,302
Kyle, if you're holding
anything back,

282
00:15:58,535 --> 00:15:59,552
Please...

283
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:02,118
tell me now.

284
00:16:05,985 --> 00:16:07,384
I got nothing to say.

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,633
Except I'm glad
Shawn's up and about.

286
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,383
For all I know, whatever isabelle
zapped him with, it wore off.

287
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:13,899
Or not.

288
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,716
I guess we'll never know
the truth, will we?

289
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,417
We all got to get used to that.

290
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,450
Can I go now?

291
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,568
<i>This is Colin.
Leave a message.

292
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:27,706
Colin?

293
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,756
Babe?

294
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:42,665
It's colin!
He's been shot!

295
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,350
There was so much blood.

296
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,974
Maia, will you go to bed now,
please, sweetie?

297
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:53,081
Help me, Di.
Please, help me.

298
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,275
April, did you honestly believe
that this guy, Barton,

299
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,292
was just gonna hand
you over $60,000?

300
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:04,499
Seemed like such an easy mark
and it's always worked before.

301
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:07,541
So that's how you've
been using your ability?

302
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,750
- To blackmail people.
- Oh, God.

303
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:12,317
Don't start lecturing me
on right and wrong.

304
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,866
- No, it's a little late for that.
- Yeah. It is.

305
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:17,383
- So save your breath.
- All right, ladies, just calm down.

306
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:18,683
Let's just stay calm, okay?

307
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,850
Focus on what's
important right now.

308
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:27,316
Barton?

309
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,016
He did it, right?
He killed colin?

310
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,933
Well, I would say
he's our number one suspect.

311
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:38,175
But this $300,000
that ANEXXO's paying out

312
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:39,412
in bribe money...

313
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,550
Barton didn't happen to mention
where it was going?

314
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,801
Does it matter?

315
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:49,059
Colin, the way he looked
lying there on the floor...

316
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,725
The hotel suite.

317
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:57,050
It was in Colin's name, right?

318
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:58,550
Yeah.

319
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,950
Or one of his names.
He used a couple.

320
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,525
And when they find the body,
there's nothing there

321
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,567
to connect you to it,
is there?

322
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,092
I don't think so.

323
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,479
Ben, will you stay here?

324
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:14,697
I'm gonna drive April
to a motel,

325
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:17,750
or somewhere away from here
and away from Maia.

326
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,483
I'm sorry, you'll have to stay there
until we figure this out.

327
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,061
Are you going to turn me in?

328
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:31,628
We just have to make this up
as we go along.

329
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,208
So I can count on you, right?

330
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:41,175
If my dad asks you,
and he probably will...

331
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:44,054
I'm not going to tell your dad
that you gave me a promicin shot.

332
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,370
It's hard, you know?
I mean, I love the guy so much,

333
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,778
but the things I'm doing,

334
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,873
- he just wouldn't understand.
- I get it, Kyle.

335
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,106
I really do.

336
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,583
It's just I've got...

337
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:59,400
all of this other stuff
I'm dealing with.

338
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,792
If you mean Isabelle Tyler,
don't think you have to worry about her.

339
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:06,733
- She's probably long gone from Seattle.
- That's good to know.

340
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,515
I'll fire the extra security
I had on.

341
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,750
Anyway, I wasn't
talking about her.

342
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:13,250
This is going
to sound weird.

343
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,767
Roland Lenhoff...

344
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:16,967
wants me to run for a seat
on the city council.

345
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,525
The guy behind
the Dinstman-Lenhoff bill?

346
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:22,950
He sees it as a "If you can't beat 'em,
work with 'em" kind of thing.

347
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,283
And he knows he can't beat us.

348
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:27,217
That's great, Shawn.

349
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,300
- You said yes, right?
- I'm thinking about it.

350
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,117
You have to do this.

351
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:34,242
You get elected,
that puts a 4400 into the mainstream.

352
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,808
They'll have to start
taking us seriously.

353
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:38,385
Who knows? You could become mayor,
maybe even governor.

354
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:40,200
Just one step at a time.

355
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,550
I don't even know if I can get
elected to city council.

356
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,342
You heal people with your hands.

357
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,208
Show me an opponent
who can beat that.

358
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:50,317
- Do you wanna be my campaign manager?
- No.

359
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,483
But you got my vote.

360
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,750
That's one.

361
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,539
Not a problem.

362
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:00,389
I'll have the test results
back tomorrow.

363
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,953
- What name do I log the samples under?
- No name.

364
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:07,102
- What if they're promicin positive?
- No name, Marco.

365
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:09,842
I want any paperwork
handed to me and me alone.

366
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:10,971
Are we clear?

367
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,517
Actually, Tom,
I still have some questions.

368
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:16,017
Do me this favor, please.

369
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,133
But I won't ask them.

370
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:20,750
Thank you.

371
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:23,883
Hey, Marco.
They told me you were down here, Tom.

372
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,575
- Have you got a minute?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

373
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,628
I know my sister's made
a lot of bad choices in her life,

374
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:34,259
but I also know that April
would never have taken that shot

375
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,451
if it weren't for me.

376
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:37,882
I understand you want
to protect your sister, Diana,

377
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:39,991
but if she knows
the identity of a murderer...

378
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,826
I can't be responsible
for sending April to prison, Tom.

379
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:43,978
She's promicin positive.

380
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,927
It's a life sentence.
You know the deal.

381
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:48,455
Besides, I mean,
there's a chance

382
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,975
that the police could get
to Barton on their own.

383
00:21:54,962 --> 00:21:56,272
But what if they don't?

384
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:57,915
What then?

385
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,208
Then I'll tell the authorities
everything I know.

386
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:06,274
After I've bought April
a one-way ticket to Marrakech.

387
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:18,821
April Skouris, right?

388
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:21,552
I'm a friend of Colin's brother, Jeff.

389
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:23,402
- Jeff?
- No, I'm Larry,

390
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:25,663
but Jeff heard what happened
and he...

391
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,597
He sent me here
to get you outta Seattle.

392
00:22:27,697 --> 00:22:29,896
Really? Well, where
are we going to go?

393
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:31,953
My car's right out back.
We're gonna go to Phoenix.

394
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:34,385
- What about my clothes?
- You can get some new ones, ok?

395
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:36,298
If we hurry,
we can catch the next flight.

396
00:22:36,495 --> 00:22:37,753
Wait, Phoenix?

397
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,409
Jeff moved to Florida.

398
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,694
- It really doesn't matter.
- Oh, my god, help!

399
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:43,553
He's trying to kill me!

400
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,628
Help! Help!

401
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,369
Di, I really need to know
what's going on

402
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,912
because none of this
makes any sense.

403
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:55,607
Why kill Colin?
Why come after me?

404
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,471
We never got our hands
on any of that money.

405
00:22:57,571 --> 00:22:59,762
Well, that bribe money
that ANEXXO is paying out,

406
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:01,823
they clearly don't want anyone
knowing about it.

407
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,437
I guess it's time we have a talk
with this Peter Barton guy.

408
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:09,735
I'm coming with you.

409
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,285
You want the truth?

410
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:13,883
I can get it for you.

411
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:15,932
You sure about that?
I mean...

412
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,668
People beat lie detectors
all the time.

413
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,911
Tom, do you like my sister?

414
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,660
Diana? Yeah, sure.
She's my partner, my friend.

415
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:25,905
Ever had a sexual fantasy about her?

416
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,039
Once or twice.
We were working late.

417
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:31,995
Diana mentioned we were the only
two people working in the building...

418
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:42,022
You can come.

419
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:53,492
Peter Barton,
I'm agent Baldwin.

420
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:55,368
This is agent Skouris.
We're with NTAC.

421
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,869
Oh, God, not her.

422
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,567
You murdered Colin, didn't you?

423
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:01,644
Murdered? No.

424
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,273
I wasn't even in the room
when your boyfriend showed up.

425
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:06,686
The money.

426
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:08,455
It wasn't me
you were trying to blackmail.

427
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:10,341
It was the corporation.
I had to warn them.

428
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:12,728
The bribe money.
Who'd you pass it off to?

429
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,549
I tell you that, I lose my job.

430
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:16,305
What was his name, Peter?

431
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:19,323
Alex Lupone.
He's the director of advanced

432
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:21,211
combat systems for the pentagon.

433
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,731
Ask him why ANEXXO
was paying Lupone.

434
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:28,830
Don't. Just...

435
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:31,135
Don't.

436
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:35,118
ANEXXO won a contract
to develop

437
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:37,868
a new interceptor ballistic
body armor for the military.

438
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:39,971
It was supposed to be impenetrable.

439
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,008
So this body armor,
it was defective?

440
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:44,722
There were some design flaws
which left parts of the side

441
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:46,553
and shoulders unprotected.

442
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:49,877
I was supposed to pay off Lupone
to look the other way.

443
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:52,574
You interfered,

444
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,384
and it was taken
out of my hands.

445
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:56,462
Who did you tell
about Colin and April?

446
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:03,442
Donald Mitchell. He sits
on our board of directors.

447
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,128
He called me personally
to handle the payoff.

448
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,616
Flew me out here
on ANEXXO's dime.

449
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,412
Where can we find Mitchell?

450
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:12,705
He's staying at
the Dorchester hotel.

451
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:16,919
I didn't know anyone
was gonna die.

452
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:19,654
<i>I don't like
standing up here</i>

453
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:21,500
<i>and calling Roland Lenhoff
a liar,</i>

454
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:25,099
<i>but the truth is,
he's been one for 40 years.</i>

455
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:26,984
<i>He did not single-handedly</i>

456
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:29,086
<i>hold off a platoon
of viet cong troops</i>

457
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,219
<i>while his men
lay wounded around him.</i>

458
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:33,541
<i>I know that for a fact
because I was one of those men.</i>

459
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:35,133
Turn that damned thing off.

460
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:37,618
<i>...performed
by staff sergeant Stephen...</i>

461
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:40,230
Guess some of my colleagues

462
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,900
heard that you and I
were meeting.

463
00:25:42,002 --> 00:25:43,534
Didn't waste any time
letting me know

464
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:45,279
they weren't
real happy about it.

465
00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:46,509
Senator,

466
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:48,340
I have to ask,

467
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,045
did you falsify your war record?

468
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:51,367
No, I did not.

469
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:53,639
That fellow who gave
that little speech...

470
00:25:53,837 --> 00:25:55,470
I saved his life that day.

471
00:25:57,745 --> 00:26:00,769
They must've paid him a lot of money
to get him to lie like that.

472
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,174
Well, I guess
if what he says isn't true,

473
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,536
then it doesn't really matter.

474
00:26:06,636 --> 00:26:08,896
Doesn't have to be true.
It's on the television.

475
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,788
I can tough this out.

476
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,610
The question is, can you?

477
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:17,738
'Cause they're gonna be giving you
the same kind of treatment.

478
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,339
If not worse.

479
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:22,997
People have been
telling lies about me

480
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:25,447
ever since we came back
in that ball of light, so...

481
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,600
Does that mean
you'll run for city council?

482
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,591
It means I'm gonna run
and I'm gonna win.

483
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,494
That's what I wanted to hear.

484
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,775
I knew I picked myself
the right man.

485
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:37,825
So what happens now?

486
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,433
The first thing
you got to do

487
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,095
is let people know
where you stand.

488
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:43,835
That means telling the world
you're against Jordan Collier

489
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:45,813
and everything
that he's been doing.

490
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:47,999
You want to win this election?

491
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:50,055
Then Jordan Collier is the enemy.

492
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,949
Your enemy.

493
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:02,484
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.

494
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:05,658
How's it coming?

495
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:08,570
I'm trying to decipher
these coded pages,

496
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,451
but I'm not a cryptographer.

497
00:27:14,454 --> 00:27:15,571
Can I have a look?

498
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,293
I may have lost my abilities,

499
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,634
but I did read
the encyclopedia from A to Z.

500
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:29,351
And you remember all of it?

501
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,681
Yeah, pretty much.

502
00:27:33,447 --> 00:27:34,752
How are you with puzzles?

503
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:37,155
Well, I guess we'll see.

504
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,193
But you did say you brought me
here for a reason, right?

505
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:42,362
That I'm part of all this.

506
00:27:44,483 --> 00:27:46,258
So maybe this is my chance
to prove it.

507
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:53,300
I don't care
what Peter Barton claims.

508
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:55,623
ANEXXO doesn't bribe
government officials.

509
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:57,506
That's not the way
we conduct business.

510
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:59,735
Mr. Mitchell,
did you authorize the payment

511
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:01,945
of $300,000 to Alex Lupone?

512
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,158
I did not.

513
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,484
We never paid
Alex Lupone a penny.

514
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:08,891
Now, if you'll excuse me,

515
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:11,161
I have an $80 kobe beef filet

516
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:12,522
growing cold on the plate.

517
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:15,261
- Then what was the money for?
- It was a down payment.

518
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,681
A down payment for what?

519
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:21,502
To have Alex Lupone murdered.

520
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:25,029
I didn't mean that.

521
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:27,341
I don't know why
I'd say such a thing.

522
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:28,871
Why have Lupone killed?

523
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:33,108
I'm not answering
any more questions.

524
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:36,005
Was it because you were selling
the military defective body armor?

525
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:40,933
Lupone would have exposed us.
we had no choice.

526
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,264
- I'm calling my lawyer.
- No.

527
00:28:48,364 --> 00:28:50,230
Not till you cancel
the hit on Lupone.

528
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,426
I don't know
what you're talking about.

529
00:28:54,764 --> 00:28:56,150
How do we reach Lupone?

530
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,356
- What is his phone number?
- There isn't one.

531
00:28:59,397 --> 00:29:01,547
He's on vacation
in the Brazilian jungle.

532
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,824
The men we hired
are already down there.

533
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:08,467
I have no way
of contacting them.

534
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,894
Is this really necessary?

535
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:14,362
Absolutely, it is.

536
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,698
So what do we do now?

537
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,680
Well, we'll get in touch
with the Brazilian authorities

538
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,210
and hope that they get in touch
with Lupone first.

539
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,388
But in the meantime,

540
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:26,940
I'm going to need you
to come into NTAC

541
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,338
and make sure that Mitchell

542
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,402
repeats his confession
for the record.

543
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:31,784
I can't do that.

544
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,825
I walk into NTAC,
I don't come out.

545
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:35,914
No, I'll speak to Meghan.
We'll explain the circumstances.

546
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:37,919
What if that doesn't work?
Can't take that chance.

547
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,791
April, without some coaxing
from your ability,

548
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:42,378
Mitchell is going to deny
everything he just told us.

549
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:45,371
He's going to get away with murder.
He's gonna get away with Colin's murder.

550
00:29:45,471 --> 00:29:47,528
- Do you want that?
- Look, I can't do that.

551
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,660
- I'm sorry.
- April, you've been running away

552
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,142
your entire life.

553
00:29:51,283 --> 00:29:54,489
From your family, from school,
from responsibility.

554
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:57,247
And I don't know, maybe I'm...
Maybe I'm to blame for that.

555
00:29:57,347 --> 00:30:00,013
Maybe I pushed you away.
Maybe I wasn't there for you.

556
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,659
I don't know.
But this time...

557
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:04,818
This time, you can't run away.

558
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:08,795
Watch me.

559
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:18,330
<i>All right. Time to get
to the tough questions.</i>

560
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:22,383
Do you think the average citizen
is ready to vote for a 4400?

561
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:24,365
Well, I'm hoping so,

562
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:28,189
being there's a lot more non-4400s
out there than people with abilities.

563
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,946
But more people
are taking the shot all the time.

564
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:33,238
How do you feel about that?

565
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:35,553
Do you agree with
Jordan Collier's decision

566
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:38,298
to hand out promicin
to anybody who wants it?

567
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:43,164
No. I don't.

568
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,411
Half of those people
are going to die.

569
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:47,791
Thousands already have.

570
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,078
Are you calling Jordan Collier
a mass murderer?

571
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:53,454
I think that Jordan...

572
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:57,847
should've waited until the odds
of survival were better than 50/50.

573
00:30:58,101 --> 00:31:00,298
A lot better than 50/50.

574
00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:01,824
If he wanted to change the world,

575
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:03,569
there are safer ways
of doing so.

576
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:05,907
Like running for city council?

577
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:08,082
Well, that's a start anyway.

578
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:15,029
<i>April, it's me.</i>

579
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:17,714
- Go away.
- <i>Not until we've talked.</i>

580
00:31:17,814 --> 00:31:18,999
<i>Now just let me in.</i>

581
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:21,526
<i>Come on, open up.</i>

582
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,149
So where do you go now?

583
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:40,965
I really hadn't thought
that far ahead.

584
00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:42,984
I never do, do I?

585
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,561
Maybe this time you should.

586
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:49,016
You want to hear
something funny?

587
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,946
I thought when
I got this ability,

588
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:54,040
it would change my life.

589
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:56,622
And it did.

590
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,444
Changed my circumstances anyway.

591
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:00,852
I got better clothes.

592
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,284
I eat in better restaurants.

593
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:06,356
Fly first-class
for the first time in my life.

594
00:32:08,904 --> 00:32:10,369
But it didn't change me.

595
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,420
No ability is going to do that.

596
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:18,171
You have to change yourself.

597
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,128
And you can.

598
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,090
How?

599
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,560
By marching into NTAC?

600
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:26,825
That would be brave.

601
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:29,059
Except I'm not brave, am I?

602
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:33,531
Another one of my many faults.

603
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,143
It's not too late.

604
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,546
You can still be the person
that you want to be.

605
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,043
Look, I...

606
00:32:49,353 --> 00:32:51,898
I can't say that I approve
of what you've been up to.

607
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,506
But you did say that
you loved this guy, Colin.

608
00:32:58,318 --> 00:32:59,454
And if you did,

609
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,037
if that's true,

610
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,532
then you have to
speak up for him.

611
00:33:08,538 --> 00:33:10,125
And only you can do that.

612
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:16,251
The man is guilty of multiple felonies
and he's threatening to sue us?

613
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:19,350
Mitchell's claiming harassment,
intimidation, oh, and false arrest.

614
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:22,263
And ANEXXO's lawyers have the muscle
to make a case like this stick.

615
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:23,436
Come on, Meghan.

616
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:25,456
He's responsible for
one murder we know of,

617
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:26,900
he plotted two others,

618
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:29,080
and his corporation is trying
to defraud the U.S. government,

619
00:33:29,197 --> 00:33:30,699
and we're just
gonna let him walk?

620
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,467
You tell me this guy deserves to be
locked up and I'll believe you,

621
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:34,958
but I need more than your word.

622
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:37,640
I need that woman, the one
that got his initial confession.

623
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:40,706
Look, I know
she's promicin positive,

624
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,344
but you need to convince
her to come forward.

625
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:43,595
I don't think that's gonna happen.

626
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:46,332
Then there's no way we're going
to get an indictment against Mitchell.

627
00:33:46,432 --> 00:33:47,567
Not without proof.

628
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,992
I have the proof
you need right here.

629
00:33:56,928 --> 00:33:58,008
Hey, Kyle.

630
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,230
- Everything all right?
- No, it's not.

631
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:05,538
I'm driving in my car,

632
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,801
turn on the radio,

633
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:11,414
and I hear you tell the world that
Jordan Collier's a mass murderer.

634
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:12,540
That is not what I said.

635
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,933
I said that he was wrong
to hand out promicin.

636
00:34:15,464 --> 00:34:16,600
And that's what I believe.

637
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:18,004
Everything that you are,

638
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:20,540
this building you're standing in,
you owe it all to Jordan.

639
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,201
You're willing to betray
him for some votes?

640
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:24,808
Hey, I built this place
just as much as Jordan.

641
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,474
He used my healing abilities
to raise money for it.

642
00:34:27,662 --> 00:34:29,371
He used me for a lot of things.

643
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:30,575
Not anymore.

644
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:32,903
I'm my own man now.
I make my own choices.

645
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,648
Well, you're off to a great start.

646
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:36,968
You're not only
betraying Jordan,

647
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:38,482
you're betraying yourself.

648
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:41,458
You're a traitor, Shawn.

649
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,101
Don't you see that?

650
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:47,344
Don't you see that?

651
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:49,802
Traitor.

652
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:03,940
How long has it been?

653
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:06,797
Since the last time you asked,
about 10 minutes.

654
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,551
Since your sister's been in there
with Mitchell, about two hours.

655
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,519
Mitchell's been with ANEXXO
for what, 14 years?

656
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:14,453
Imagine the secrets
he's saved up.

657
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:16,930
We could be here all night.

658
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,667
We got a signed confession.

659
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,658
Whether it holds up in court
remains to be seen,

660
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,402
but we've got enough
against him

661
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,505
that at least a couple
of these charges should stick.

662
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:33,856
- And April?
- I'm sorry, Diana.

663
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:35,967
We have to take her
into custody.

664
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:39,043
It's okay, Di.

665
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:41,381
Everything's okay.

666
00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:49,324
I didn't say
I'd go for it either but...

667
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:50,706
You must've been pretty convincing.

668
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:52,030
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

669
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,202
But I have been up all night

670
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:55,197
and what we're doing
to April just isn't fair.

671
00:35:55,297 --> 00:35:56,640
She didn't have to come forward.

672
00:35:56,743 --> 00:35:58,358
Mitchell could be
a free man right now,

673
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:00,484
instead of having his picture
plastered all over the papers.

674
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:03,009
But no, she did the right thing,
and we're locking her up?

675
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:06,164
We need to offer her some kind
of amnesty, not punish her.

676
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,999
Skouris, we're not punishing her.

677
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,501
We're hiring her.

678
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:13,535
According to Meghan,

679
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:16,467
NTAC...
The attorney general's office...

680
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:17,837
The FBI...

681
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,494
They're already fighting over
who gets me when.

682
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:23,447
And all I have to do
is ask people questions.

683
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,114
It's not always going to be
at a bar over drinks.

684
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:27,306
Some of the people you meet

685
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,922
and the questions
you have to ask...

686
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:30,894
Some of the answers
you're going to hear...

687
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:33,020
It can get pretty ugly.

688
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,337
Meghan was pretty upfront
about that.

689
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,970
Still, it's gotta be
better than prison.

690
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:40,100
I must say,
the perks are pretty good.

691
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,312
I get an apartment,

692
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,382
a nice salary,
health insurance,

693
00:36:43,482 --> 00:36:45,085
even a clothing allowance.

694
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:47,495
And let's not forget
Eric and Ralph.

695
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:49,320
Or is it Ralph and Eric?

696
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,056
I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

697
00:36:51,156 --> 00:36:52,742
Their job is to make sure

698
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:54,374
I show up
wherever I need to be.

699
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:58,693
Knowing me, it won't be
as easy as it sounds.

700
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,662
You think I'm gonna
screw this up, don't you?

701
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,629
April, maybe the question
you should be asking me is

702
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,005
if I want you to succeed,

703
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,168
and the answer
is a definite yes.

704
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:18,828
Well, I'll try not to let
either one of us down.

705
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,872
And I promise
to call or email

706
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,594
and let you know
how I'm doing.

707
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:26,742
So...

708
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,141
When are you leaving?

709
00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:31,259
You know, for Spain,
or wherever you guys decide?

710
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:34,396
I'm not leaving.

711
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,729
I'm staying right
here in Seattle.

712
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,816
Did I just say that?

713
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:43,689
Does Ben know?

714
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:49,363
No. I hadn't realized it
until just now.

715
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:53,213
You're gonna
have to tell him.

716
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,974
I'm really happy
for both of you.

717
00:37:58,074 --> 00:37:59,503
I really am. But...

718
00:38:00,513 --> 00:38:03,029
we're not leaving this table
until we've made a decision.

719
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:06,151
Are we living in France or Spain?

720
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:11,682
Neither.

721
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:15,622
Diana?

722
00:38:16,618 --> 00:38:18,486
Don't hate me, Ben. Please.

723
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,152
Oh, God...

724
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,338
I quit work.
I went to Spain.

725
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,231
I tried. I really tried.

726
00:38:28,564 --> 00:38:29,747
But I belong here.

727
00:38:30,818 --> 00:38:34,273
With Tom, and with NTAC,
the search for Collier.

728
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:38,382
I'm a part of that.

729
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:40,673
My daughter's a part of that.

730
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:43,659
And now my sister is, too.

731
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:50,721
So what happens to us?

732
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,069
We go back to our own lives?

733
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:55,489
Back to our work?

734
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,295
What, see each other
a few days a month?

735
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,057
For now.

736
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:06,668
We could have
so much more, Diana.

737
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:11,838
Maia said
that we'd get married.

738
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:14,073
And Maia's never wrong.

739
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:16,945
Well, I hope not.

740
00:39:21,715 --> 00:39:22,841
Me too.

741
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,900
The lab report
you asked for.

742
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:42,592
The one and only copy.

743
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:46,237
Samples came back
positive for promicin.

744
00:39:46,528 --> 00:39:48,734
Someone's definitely
walking around with an ability.

745
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:00,155
Thanks, Marco.

746
00:40:08,732 --> 00:40:10,882
"When the chosen
have taken the elixir

747
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:13,530
"and proved their faith
in the Messiah,

748
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:16,309
"then all will follow
in their wake.

749
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:20,195
"Only then will the father
reveal his true face,

750
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:24,008
"and paradise and the world
will be as one."

751
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,307
I think that's a pretty
accurate translation.

752
00:40:28,432 --> 00:40:29,992
The elixir,
that's gotta be promicin.

753
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:32,423
And we know Collier's
supposed to be the Messiah.

754
00:40:33,437 --> 00:40:34,545
And the father?

755
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:37,010
I don't know. God, I guess?

756
00:40:37,545 --> 00:40:39,667
- But who are the chosen?
- Flip the page.

757
00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:43,975
It's a list of names.

758
00:40:44,424 --> 00:40:45,749
Yeah. 200 in all.

759
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:48,005
And most of them
you'll recognize.

760
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:50,981
Politicians, scientists,
athletes...

761
00:40:51,094 --> 00:40:52,990
These people,
they're all alive today.

762
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:56,709
But this book was written
85 years ago.

763
00:40:56,943 --> 00:40:58,004
I know.

764
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,130
All right, so...

765
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,242
all these people
have to take the shot?

766
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:03,823
And...

767
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,990
That's supposed to influence
more and more people

768
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,375
to do the same, right?

769
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:09,761
Until what?
Everyone has an ability?

770
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,690
Those who survive, anyway.

771
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:15,035
And that's when god's
supposed to show up?

772
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:24,726
I think you'd better look
at the last name.

773
00:41:34,478 --> 00:41:35,595
My dad?

774
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,528
He has to take the shot?

775
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,043
If you believe in the prophecy.

776
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:47,627
In some kind of
paradise on earth

777
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:49,086
led by Jordan Collier...

778
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,453
Then, yeah...

779
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:57,893
Your dad has to take promicin.

780
