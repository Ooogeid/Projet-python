1
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,323
The world
will have to deal with us.

2
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:46,600
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

3
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,072
<i>You're
the alternative we need

4
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:50,822
<i>to Collier and his
promicin-pushing radicals.

5
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,003
Does that mean you'll run
for city council?

6
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,790
It means I'm gonna run
and I'm gonna win.

7
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:57,552
I intend on attacking you
right up until the day of the election.

8
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:01,111
There are a lot of people out there
that are afraid of what you represent.

9
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:04,778
<i>I have my eye on something greater
than just city council.

10
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,450
<i>- You hate all the 4400.
- So what if I do?

11
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,180
<i>I have reason to believe
that you're capable of terrible things,

12
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,310
and that you have an evil
living inside of you.

13
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,613
I'm supposed to eliminate
the 4400.

14
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:19,310
All this talk of a catastrophe
the 4400 are supposed to prevent?

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,545
- It's lies.
- So you keep telling me.

16
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:25,939
<i>Everything in that book
is going to come true.

17
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,944
Collier will lead
the human race to salvation.

18
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,200
You will help him.

19
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:35,681
<I>I found the guy for the job.

20
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,298
<i>His name's Robert Shaftoe.

21
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,402
<i>Ex-Marine.

22
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:46,593
<i>Dead-eye sniper.

23
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:48,944
<i>He did some work
for our...

24
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,516
<i>organization,
out of Kansas City.

25
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:54,882
<i>If you want someone killed,

26
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,190
<i>until they're completely dead,

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,313
<i>then Shaftoe's your man.

28
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,247
<i>Sounds good.

29
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:04,733
<i>Bring him in.

30
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,650
<i>Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,571
<i>Because once I bring Shaftoe
through that door,

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,168
<i>there's no going back.

33
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:12,603
<i>The target...

34
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:13,969
<i>is a dead man.

35
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:16,937
- <i>Completely.</i>
- Oh, my God.

36
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,710
Come on, the acting, the dialogue,
this is horrendous.

37
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,830
- Marco, why are we watching this?
- Just, shh...

38
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,397
The best part's coming up.

39
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:37,585
<i>The assignment is dangerous.

40
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:40,010
<i>In fact, it might be
the most dangerous assignment

41
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,610
<i>you've ever been assigned.

42
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,175
<i>But if you succeed,

43
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,370
<i>the danger will be worth it.

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,187
<i>And the rewards?

45
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:50,685
<i>They will be worth...
the danger.

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,242
<i>Danger is my business.

47
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,012
<i>Consider the target dead.

48
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,675
<i>Completely...

49
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:05,446
<i>dead.

50
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:07,898
That's our guy.
That's Curtis Peck.

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,813
He's an original recipe 4400.

52
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:12,070
Correction...

53
00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:15,330
- He's our favorite original recipe.
- Before he disappeared,

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,700
Curtis wrote, directed,
and starred in horror movies.

55
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:19,650
Real low-Budget stuff.

56
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,570
You know,
the sets were mostly in his house.

57
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,710
The actors?

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,597
Pretty much
just his friends and family.

59
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:26,470
Really?
I never would have guessed.

60
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,900
After he came back,

61
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,310
Curtis kept on making movies,

62
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,482
but he shifted genres.

63
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:33,017
Each one of his movies
is about an unsolved mystery.

64
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:36,270
He did one about
Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance.

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,100
He filmed a costume drama
in his backyard

66
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,050
about the lost colonies at Roanoke.

67
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,240
You just saw his take
on JFK's assassination.

68
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,680
That's great, Marco.
I'm glad this guy has a hobby.

69
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,380
It's not just a hobby.

70
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,040
Some people think that
making these films

71
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,852
- is Curtis's 4400 ability.
- Come on, guys,

72
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:53,990
you're not telling us
that that movie...

73
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,418
tells us what really happened
to president Kennedy?

74
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:57,867
There's no way
to know for sure,

75
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,770
but, I mean,
there really is an ex-Marine

76
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,140
named Robert Shaftoe,

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,673
and he really was in Dallas
on november 22nd, 1963.

78
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:06,690
You can't prove Curtis is right,

79
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,459
but you also can't deny

80
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,586
that his theories are compelling.

81
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,460
Some people want to think
everything is a conspiracy,

82
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,460
and I'm sure that this guy
is really appealing to them,

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,152
but, Marco,
we've got  a lot of stuff on our plate,

84
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:18,304
and we just don't have time
to look into something

85
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,262
that might be a 4400 ability.

86
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,560
Don't think I could sit through
another one of those movies.

87
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,657
We didn't ask you down here
to tell you about his ability.

88
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,207
Curtis disappeared.

89
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,530
Nobody can find him.

90
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:32,220
About 10 days ago,
he stopped posting on his myspace page.

91
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,528
We noticed, so we tried
to get in touch with him.

92
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:38,182
He's not picking up the phone,
he's not answering emails.

93
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,470
I know, I know,
no big deal, right?

94
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:44,408
I wasn't really worried
until he missed his last NTAC check-in.

95
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,370
Curtis Peck has dropped off the map.

96
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,133
Somebody should look into it.

97
00:04:58,935 --> 00:05:00,468
- What is this place?
- I don't know,

98
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:02,468
Cassie just said
we should come here.

99
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,367
I think it's an old bomb shelter.

100
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,690
We should be safe here. It doesn't look
like anyone's been here in years.

101
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,990
I don't understand
why we came to Seattle.

102
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,340
We just led a hundred people
into a city

103
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,212
where everyone's looking for us.

104
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,340
Nobody has a place to stay.
Nobody knows what to do next.

105
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,647
Are you telling me
this is the answer?

106
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,342
- This place is a mess.
- We'll repair it.

107
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,610
Thank you for finding this for us.

108
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,523
You have a truly
extraordinary ability.

109
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,997
Get everyone settled in.

110
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,197
This place is perfect.

111
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,613
We begin here.

112
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,584
How much you wanna bet
we're about to wake up a man

113
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,112
with a crushing  hangover?

114
00:05:58,922 --> 00:05:59,922
Curtis!

115
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:01,522
Curtis Peck!

116
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:12,920
You think someone
broke into the place?

117
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,155
Maybe, or else this guy's
as bad at housekeeping

118
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:16,697
as he is at making movies.

119
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:22,278
It doesn't look like anything's missing.
All his video equipment is sitting here.

120
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,495
Are you looking for Curtis?

121
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,750
Yes, we are.
We're from NTAC.

122
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:29,695
- Do you know him?
- Of course.

123
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:30,978
I'm Neal Handler.

124
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,990
I live around back.
I'm Curtis' neighbor.

125
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,152
And... his collaborator.

126
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,830
I'm proud to say
I've been in more of his movies

127
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,160
than anyone else.

128
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:44,065
- Yeah, we've... seen your work.
- Thank you.

129
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:49,140
I haven't seen Curtis in a few days.
Is he all right?

130
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:51,750
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

131
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,150
Do you know
if Curtis had any enemies,

132
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,410
or anyone who might want
to break into his house?

133
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,750
Enemies?

134
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,150
Take your pick.

135
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,670
The CIA, the mafia...

136
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,180
the freemasons.

137
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,410
Curtis exposed
a lot of people.

138
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,820
So you...

139
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,762
you believe his movies are real?

140
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,703
Of course.

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,630
That's why
they brought him back

142
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,667
in a ball of light.

143
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,735
To tell the truth
to a reluctant world!

144
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,287
I'll tell you what, though,

145
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,038
if someone did toss this place,

146
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,443
I can guarantee you they didn't find
what they were looking for.

147
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:32,332
Curtis has...

148
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:34,182
a secret hiding place.

149
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,470
He keeps his journal in there.

150
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,010
All his script notes.

151
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,490
Could you show it to us?

152
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,370
We just want to help out your friend,
That's all.

153
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,340
We really like his movies, too.

154
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,420
I mean,
we just saw the one on JFK,

155
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,400
and it was... good.
You were really good.

156
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
It's here.

157
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,470
Here.

158
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,067
Curtis uses those
for inspiration.

159
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,028
<i>If you're watching this,
then that means I'm in trouble.

160
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,940
<i>Deep trouble.

161
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:16,260
<i>Don't believe anything you hear
about a car accident or a suicide.

162
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,683
<i>If I'm gone,
it's because they came after me.

163
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,170
<i>I have an idea for a new movie.

164
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,030
<i>It's big.
It's so big,

165
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,401
<i>it's going to change everything
if I get to make it,

166
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,173
<i>and that's
what they're scared of.

167
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:36,892
<i>That's them.
They're here now.

168
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,222
<i>You need to know,
Jordan Collier...

169
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,706
<i>the 4400... they're not the ones
you should be scared of.

170
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,064
<i>There's something else out there,
something worse,...

171
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:46,830
<I>it's much worse,
and they're coming for me now.

178

<i>Completely dead.

179
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,487
According to Curtis, Jimmy Hoffa
was buried in the Florida everglades.

180
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:00,636
If you really believe that,
you should read this.

181
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:02,350
I ran a background check
on Curtis.

182
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,697
He owes money
to credit card companies, the IRS.

183
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:06,910
He's three years behind
on his alimony payments.

184
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,040
I talked to his ex-wife.

185
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,535
She moved to Wisconsin
just to get away from Curtis.

186
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:12,810
She hasn't heard from him
in nine months.

187
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,470
Look, if anybody's coming
after this guy, it should be...

188
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:19,000
creditors, or movie critics.

189
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,466
But he has almost 6 figures
of outstanding debt.

190
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,296
Isn't it possible
he just skipped town?

191
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:25,340
I don't know.

192
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,947
He looked genuinely scared
at the end of that video we found,

193
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,457
and I don't think Curtis is
a good enough actor to fake that.

194
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:31,985
Besides...

195
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,520
if making movies is really
his 4400 ability...

196
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,322
aren't you even just
a little bit curious ?

197
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,068
Don't you want to know what's out there
that's bigger than Jordan Collier?

198
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:43,466
Until we have evidence
that tells me this guy's legit,

199
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:45,217
all I want to do
is make sure he's okay.

200
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,371
Look at the credits.
Ever since Curtis got back,

201
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:50,640
his movies have been produced
by a guy called Stuart Henley.

202
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:51,860
I checked him out.

203
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,010
He's a retired lawyer.
He lives nearby.

204
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,090
Maybe he'd know something
about Curtis' latest movie idea.

205
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,192
It's worth a shot.

206
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,207
At the very least, I'd like to look
into the eyes of the man who put up...

207
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:04,063
good money to pay for
"I dismembered Jimmy Hoffa."

208
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,080
<i>No, I don't think that
my announcement

209
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,638
<I>that I intend to run for mayor

210
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,246

I'll be spending less time

211

Shawn Farrell's candidacy.

212
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,100
<I>If anything,
I think that the mayor's office

213
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,158
<I>would allow me a stronger platform

214
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,840
Mr. Farrell?

215
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,142
- This just came by messenger.
- Thank you.

216
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,322
We're going to be working together
every day. You can call me Shawn.

217
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,465
<i>Hey, Shawn...
it's Kyle.

218
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,135
Where are you?
I've been worried about you.

219
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:59,408
I'm fine, man.
I'm better than fine, actually.

220
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:02,082
I'm as good as I've been
in a long time.

221
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,167
Did you get the package?

222
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:07,417
You sent this?

223
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:08,652
<i>We did.

224
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,496
Look, it's really important, man.

225
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,768
You need to read the whole thing
before your meeting.

226
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,018
What meeting, Kyle?

227
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,213
<i>Jordan's nearby.
He wants to see you.

228
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,248
You're with Jordan?

229
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,202
What does he want
to see me about?

230
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,235
It's important, okay?

231
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,155
Call me on this number
after you finish the book.

232
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:29,044
We'll send someone
to come get you.

233
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
Mr. Henley?

234
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:44,601
I can hear a radio
playing inside,

235
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,852
and I swear I heard
someone moving around.

236
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,290
Mr. Henley!

237
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,180
He's back here.

238
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:53,963
Stuart Henley, wait!

239
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:58,649
Just wait!

240
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,427
I promise
I won't tell anybody!

241
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,820
- Don't kill me!
- Just relax.

242
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,050
- Nobody's going to kill you.
- We're from NTAC.

243
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,193
We're just trying to locate
Curtis Peck.

244
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,980
You won't find him.
They got to him.

245
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,783
Who are they?
Why'd you run from us?

246
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:12,108
What are you so scared of?

247
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,958
The people from Curtis' movie...
"The Marked."

248
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,042
That's the name of his movie?

249
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,457
Can you tell us about it?

250
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:22,050
About a month ago,
he came to me,

251
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,870
said he had an idea
for a new movie,

252
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,130
called "The Marked."

253
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:27,740
He said it was
his biggest film yet.

254
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:29,359
I was fascinated,

255
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,675
so I asked him to make me
a short trailer.

256
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,741
I like to see what the movie's about
before I write a check.

257
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,892
He gave me the trailer
about two weeks ago.

258
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:41,642
Do you still have a copy?

259
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,110
And you're more than welcome
to it, because...

260
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,797
if what Curtis is saying is true,

261
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,497

I had never watched it.

Very, very important.

322
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,140
It better be important,
Mr. Imroth.

323
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,700
It's easter.

324
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,380

I have big news.

328
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:07,982
Jordan collier is back,

330
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:16,764

00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,708
I am so buying that movie.

335
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:30,475
So either that's
the ramblings of a madman,

336
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:33,600
or Curtis Peck has just exposed
the biggest conspiracy of all time.

337
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,000
According to that movie,

338
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,315
Matthew Ross was one of these guys,
The Marked,

339
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:38,915
and Isabelle Tyler killed him.

340
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:41,032
And we always wondered
if that were true.

341
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:42,132
What about Imroth?

342
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,866
I mean, the CEO
of Ubient Software

343
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,412
is supposed to be some kind
of double agent from the future?

344

Everyone always says that company

Now we know it's true.

The only thing we know for sure
is that Curtis Peck is a horrible,

347
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,039
horrible film-maker.

348
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,114
Though, I do have to admit,

349
00:17:57,214 --> 00:17:59,456
there are a bunch of questions
I'd like to ask him.

350
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,958
But since he's in the wind, I guess
we'll have to settle for his producer.

351
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,793
Get Stuart Henley in here.

352
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:11,825
Mr. Henley,
it's Diana Skouris from NTAC.

353
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,825
We need to talk.
Can you open up?

354
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,288
It smells like exhaust.

355
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:26,535
Stand back.

356
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:43,324
No big surprises
in the coroner's preliminary reports,

357
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,800
Stuart Henley died
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

358
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,960
There's no suicide note,
but there's no sign of foul play either.

359
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:51,557
So...

360
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:53,637
do you really think
he committed suicide?

361
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,695
Henley was an odd guy.

362
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:58,848
I mean, He'd have to be to pay
for Curtis' movies,

363
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:00,190
so I guess it's possible.

364
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,010
But I don't know,
the timing seems off.

365
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,297
Why would he commit suicide

366
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:06,388
right after NTAC
got in touch with him?

367
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,665
So, what then?

368
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,882
Executed by the marked?

369
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,660
I'm not ready to go there yet.

370
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:14,390
Yeah, me neither.
But I...

371
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,188
I got a lot of questions.

372
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,578
You know Drew Imroth
is in that movie.

373
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:21,915
Ubient's based in Seattle. Maybe we can
get in and see him tomorrow morning.

374
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,682
And ask him what exactly?

375
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:25,504
Oh, I got it,
"Excuse me.

376
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:28,341
"When you're not running the biggest
computer company in the world,

377
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,538
"are you by any chance involved in
an enormous...

378
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,038
"intercontinental conspiracy?"

379
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:33,529
Maybe.

380
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,842
Or maybe we could just ask him
whether

381
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,398
Curtis Peck ever tried
to get in touch with him.

382
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,480
Sounds good.
I'll see tomorrow.

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,175
- What, you're not going home?
- No, not for a while.

384
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:48,220
Meghan asked me to put all this
in an email.

385
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,141
I told her I'd get it off
to her tonight.

386
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:53,043
- Want a hand?
- No, I got it. Go ahead.

387
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,060
Spend a little time with your daughter
while she's still awake.

388
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,742
- Thanks.
- Good night.

389
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:04,760
We appreciate you taking
the time to meet with us, Mr. Imroth.

390
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,190
It's really not a problem.

391
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,160
I'm a huge supporter of NTAC.

392
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,052
You guys have tough jobs.

393
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:11,597
Please,have a seat.

394
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,967
I only wish I could be
more helpful.

395
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,780
I've never heard of this guy.

396
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,024
You said his name was
Curtis Peck ?

397
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:19,522
Yeah, that's right. He's a...

398
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:21,432
He's a 4400 who...

399
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,872
who makes movies,

400
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,732
and you,

401
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:27,107
well, you're a character
in his latest film.

402
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:28,314
Really?

403
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:29,537
Who plays me?

404
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:31,563
I always hoped
it would be Jeff Goldblum.

405
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,478
It's more of a low-budget
kind of thing.

406
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:37,379
What's it about?

407
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:40,286
Well, it's interesting.
It's creative.

408
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:43,865
It's a global conspiracy
in which agents from the future

409
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:45,557
have taken over
the bodies of...

410
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,858
prominent people
from all around the world.

411
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:52,980
I have to say,

412
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm the subject of
a lot of conspiracy theories,

413
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,476
but that's the most innovative
one I've heard yet.

414
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:03,271
So, are you here to ask me
if it's true?

415
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:06,353
Because you have to figure
I wouldn't tell you even if it was.

416
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:09,376
No, actually, we came to see you
because Curtis Peck has gone missing.

417
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,986
There's a chance one of his
investors may have been murdered.

418
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,470
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

419
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,946
Should I be worried for
my own safety?

420
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:17,831
No, we don't think so,

421
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:20,495
but if Curtis should try
and get in touch with you,

422
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:22,584
or if anyone should ask you

423
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:24,564
about a movie called
"The Marked",

424
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,517
could you get in touch
with us?

425
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:28,090
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

426
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,083
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

427
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:32,122
Actually...

428
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:37,263
This may seem like
a really strange request.

429
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:40,700
Do you think we could take a look
behind your left earlobe?

430
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:43,444
Let me guess,

431
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,801
this has something to do
with that movie.

432
00:21:47,763 --> 00:21:48,778
Have at it.

433
00:21:57,278 --> 00:21:58,968
Has that mole
always been there?

434
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,607
Ever since I was born.

435
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:05,980
My dermatologist tells me
I have to keep an eye on it.

436
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,178
So give it to me straight.

437
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,622
Does this mean I'm one of the...

438
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,745
What was the name
of that movie?

439
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:15,106
"The Marked?"

440
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:20,152
Kyle, what's with all
the spy game stuff here?

441
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:23,501
Am I really this far outside
of the Collier circle of trust?

442
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:24,988
It's just a precaution.

443
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:29,310
I need you to promise me that
you're not going to freak out, okay?

444
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:31,639
I would just like
to take this thing off, please.

445
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:37,846
Hi, Shawn.

446
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:43,899
- What the hell is she doing here?
- She's with us. It's okay.

447
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:46,706
She just wanted to talk to you
before you saw Jordan.

448
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:48,851
I'm glad you're awake...

449
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:51,810
and I'm sorry.

450
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:53,810
For everything.

451
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:57,811
I know I was wrong,

452
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,789
and I know
what we had wasn't love.

453
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:02,403
Yeah, you're right, it wasn't.

454
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,283
I don't expect you
to forgive me...

455
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,567
Ever...

456
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:13,123
But I just needed you
to hear it.

457
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,154
Well,
there's no one so far gone

458
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:23,339
they can't find their way
back to the movement.

459
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:26,632
Even if I told the world that you
were wrong to hand out promicin?

460
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:31,255
I wasn't surprised
they had you speak against me.

461
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,414
Politics is compromise.

462
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,430
That's why
I never pursued it myself.

463
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:43,198
I understand that you are
wanting to build a bridge

464
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,184
between positives
and the rest of the world,

465
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:47,011
but, Shawn, I'm telling you,

466
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:49,109
events are moving past that.

467
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,622
We have big plans here,

468
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:54,835
and when we're finished,
the 4400 won't need the mainstream.

469
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,550
The mainstream will come to us.

470
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:58,297
Is that what your book told you?

471
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,779
I've read it.

472
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,047
Frankly, it scares me.

473
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:03,618
Are you saying that you're gonna
bring God to the world?

474
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:05,582
If the word "God" frightens you,

475
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:07,132
substitute "paradise".

476
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:09,366
We're gonna make it happen, Shawn.
You should be here with us.

477
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:11,070
Yes, but who's
in charge of paradise?

478
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,758
How many martyrs
will it take to create it?

479
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:15,771
Jordan, you've done
great things for the 4400.

480
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,264
You have done great things
for me, but...

481
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:18,897
you are on the wrong path here.

482
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:20,823
And you have always been rebellious.

483
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:24,348
But I think you're afraid
of change, Shawn,

484
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,031
or it is just me?

485
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:29,305
I'm against anyone
who wants to accumulate power

486
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:31,624
that won't tell me exactly
what they wanna do with it.

487
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:33,257
Not just you, anyone.

488
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:36,995
There's a man by the name
of Gabriel Hewitt.

489
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,470
He's running for mayor.

490
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:40,030
He's dangerous.

491
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:42,058
Maia Skouris
saw him in a vision.

492
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:43,722
He's in charge
of prison camps,

493
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:45,503
and they're
rounding up 4400s.

494
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:49,715
Even if I wanted to
drop out of the race,

495
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:51,397
even if I wanted to join you,

496
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:52,965
I can't,

497
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:54,536
because I have to stop him.

498
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,262
Well, it sounds like you have
your hands full already.

499
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:06,007
Good luck
in your political career.

500
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:15,080
I'm sorry.

501
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,833
I don't know, but that birthmark
behind Imroth's ear?

502
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,317
It was definitely
shaped like an "x".

503
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:23,826
Exactly like the ones
in Curtis' movies.

504
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:25,466
It was weird, yes,

505
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,631
but it could be
a coincidence.

506
00:25:27,837 --> 00:25:29,455
We're looking for
a paranoid 4400.

507
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:31,886
That doesn't mean we have to
become paranoid ourselves.

508
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:34,064
This man is here to see you.

509
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,413
My name's Walt Saperstein.

510
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:37,307
I'm a psychiatrist
at Feeney Memorial.

511
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,736
I have instructions
to bring you to the hospital.

512
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:43,299
You're being placed under
a 72-hour psychiatric hold.

513
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:44,812
What? Why?

514
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:46,273
You sent an email last night.

515
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,352
It alleged some of the most
powerful people in the world

516
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:50,131
are united
in some kind of conspiracy.

517
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:51,388
No, it didn't allege anything.

518
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:53,167
It's a summary of our work
on a case.

519
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:55,714
Well, nevertheless,
someone in Washington read it.

520
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:57,989
They've reviewed your files,
agent Baldwin. They're worried

521
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,827
- you've had a psychotic break.
- Shut up.

522
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,340
You sent my email on to D.C.?

523
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,370
I do that every time
we open a case. I'm sorry.

524
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:05,810
I never would've done it
if I knew this was gonna happen.

525
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:07,642
Get your hands off me!

526
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:09,145
It's only going to
get worse for you

527
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:11,243
if you put up a fight.
It's only temporary.

528
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:14,486
You need to go with them. We'll do
everything we can to end this quickly.

529
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,151
Fine.

530
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:31,880
Well, I don't understand.

531
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:34,868
What do you mean that no one
can get in to see him?

532
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,067
Well, how long is Tom
going to be in isolation?

533
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:43,777
Okay, forget it.
I'll call back in the morning.

534
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,654
Don't move.

535
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:05,732
What are you doing down here?

536
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,956
Don't shoot me.

537
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:08,777
I'm the one
you're looking for.

538
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:11,120
Curtis?

539
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:13,089
You're alive.

540
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:14,751
I am.

541
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,608
If you can keep me that way,

542
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,833
I'll tell you
all about The Marked.

543
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:23,952
So how did you find me?

544
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:27,742
I've been in hiding ever since
I made that movie trailer.

545
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:29,996
I knew they'd be coming for me.

546
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:32,859
My buddy, Neal,
sent me an email

547
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,440
after you and your partner
came by my house.

548
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:37,651
He thought I could trust you.

549
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,710
What can you tell me
about these people?

550
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,161
Well, not everything.

551
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,420
I haven't finished
writing the script.

552
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:47,784
That's how
my ability works.

553
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,615
Ideas just jump into
my head while I'm writing,

554
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:53,344
but I don't know the whole story
until I write the end.

555
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:54,673
Let's see,

556
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:56,962
they don't have abilities.

557
00:27:57,062 --> 00:27:58,885
The procedure
doesn't work that way.

558
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:03,978
I do know that all 10 of them
had a meeting in 2005.

559
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,025
That was the only time
they were all together.

560
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:07,548
It was in Tunis.

561
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:09,379
That's a city in North Africa.

562
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,305
No other names
other than Drew Imroth?

563
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,158
Not yet.

564
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,779
That's why I came to you.

565
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:19,240
I need a safe place
where I can write.

566
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:28,221
You're a fan of my movies.

567
00:28:28,388 --> 00:28:29,394
Cool.

568
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:31,028
Yeah, I've seen them all.

569
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:33,892
Uh, it's a pleasure
to have you here.

570
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,077
Yeah, you can work right there
if you want.

571
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,238
Thank you so much, Marco.
I really appreciate this.

572
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:43,325
We were careful on the way
over here. We weren't followed.

573
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:45,286
It's okay.
I'll keep him working.

574
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:48,929
It's been a while since you've seen
the inside of my place, huh?

575
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,588
We should make
a pot of coffee.

576
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:56,105
Do you mind staying up with me?
I like to have somebody I can...

577
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,661
bounce ideas off.

578
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:00,796
Coffee.

579
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:08,574
Hey, Joanna, I'm going to need you
to juggle around

580
00:29:08,674 --> 00:29:10,723
a couple of my healing
appointments for today.

581
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,065
What is it?

582
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:15,408
Gabriel Hewitt
had a stroke last night.

583
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,655
- What?
- It's bad.

584
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,217
I guess he has brain damage.

585
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:20,988
They're saying he's going to
have to resign his seat

586
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:22,100
on the city council,

587
00:29:22,436 --> 00:29:24,408
and withdraw
from the race for mayor.

588
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:13,092
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.

589
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:14,830
Tom is fine.

590
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,547
If I keep the pressure on,
there's a chance

591
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:18,799
they may end his psych hold
a day early.

592
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:21,683
- What are you working on?
- You want me to tell you,

593
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:23,599
or should I just
put it an email?

594
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:26,773
That's not fair.

595
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:28,822
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Tom.

596
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:30,202
If I could've stopped it,
I would've.

597
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:33,359
Tom's psych hold had nothing
to do with his state of mind.

598
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:36,567
We were getting close to something,
and they sent us a warning.

599
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:39,626
Who? The people from
Curtis' movie, The Marked?

600
00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:41,629
Well, I can't prove that,

601
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:45,543
but I do know that Drew Imroth
was in Tunisia of June, 2005.

602
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,601
If The Marked ever gathered,
that's when it happened.

603
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:50,329
At the same time,
Wesley Burke was also there.

604
00:30:51,273 --> 00:30:53,151
The political advisor
to the president?

605
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:54,858
What was he doing in Africa
while the White House

606
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,632
was gearing up
for mid-term elections?

607
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:58,162
I don't know,
but he had company.

608
00:30:58,308 --> 00:30:59,759
That's cardinal Emmanuel Calabria.

609
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,524
Rumor is, he finished third
in the last papal election.

610
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,200
This is all interesting,
but Drew Imroth heads up

611
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,819
the world's largest
charitable foundation.

612
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,671
He travels to Africa
all the time,

613
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:10,533
and these other guys,
well...

614
00:31:10,824 --> 00:31:12,204
Who knows why they were there.

615
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:14,598
Well, I'm going to find out,

616
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:16,316
And I'm also gonna learn

617
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,408
who else was there
to play that week.

618
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:22,393
Let me know if I can help.

619
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:57,002
The Marked have no way of
getting in contact with the future.

620
00:31:57,144 --> 00:31:58,841
It's a one-way ticket.
They're cut off here.

621
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:00,375
Okay, Curtis,
that's very interesting,

622
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:01,627
but there are
no new names here.

623
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:03,977
We need some facts
and things that we can verify.

624
00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:06,356
They'll come.
I'm on a roll.

625
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:08,363
Tom, are you okay?

626
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:09,911
<i>They did something to me, Diana.</i>

627
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,685
They changed me.

628
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:13,629
Whoa, just take it easy.
Where are you?

629
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:15,950
The hospital.

630
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:17,368
<i>They just let me out.</i>

631
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:18,701
<i>Can you come and get me?</i>

632
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,634
Are you sure
it wasn't there before?

633
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:21,864
I'm positive.

634
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:23,546
They did something to me
last night, Diana.

635
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:24,828
Those people who came into my room,

636
00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:26,377
They were dressed
for an operation.

637
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:27,926
They put something into me.

638
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:31,586
What? Like another person?
Another consciousness?

639
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,858
Hey, Tom, I don't think
it works that way.

640
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,503
Curtis is working on
his script right now,

641
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:38,280
and according to him, The Marked
are cut off from the future.

642
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,844
They can't just
make more of them.

643
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:41,979
Yeah, but one of them's dead.
Matthew Ross.

644
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,784
What if they took whatever was
inside of him and put it into me?

645
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,332
No, you can't be sure of that.

646
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:53,267
Tom, just...

647
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,305
please just tell me
that you're still you.

648
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,552
I think so.

649
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:01,815
I mean, for now, anyway.

650
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:04,976
It's crap.

651
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:07,032
I can't get this scene right.

652
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:09,163
they're at the meeting
in Tunisia.

653
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:11,927
They're face to face
for the first time.

654
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,826
Imroth is introducing them
to each other.

655
00:33:16,817 --> 00:33:18,826
I know what the scene is.
I just can't...

656
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:20,712
- nail it.
- Look...

657
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:23,629
I have to think creatively
for my job, too.

658
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:25,434
I mean, I share an office

659
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:27,975
with two of the most
annoying guys on the planet.

660
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:30,783
Believe me,
I get stuck all the time.

661
00:33:32,105 --> 00:33:33,232
Know what I do?

662
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:35,739
I shut my eyes,

663
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,107
and I think of song lyrics.

664
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,262
Sounds dumb, right?

665
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:43,027
But I swear,
it almost always works.

666
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:51,437
What are you thinking of?

667
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:54,000
"The trooper", <i>Iron Maiden.

668
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:59,160
Hey, whatever gets you going.

669
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:00,643
Be right back.

670
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:34,863
Did you do this?

671
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:36,749
Did you do this?
Did you order

672
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,547
one of your followers
to give Hewitt a stroke?

673
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:39,724
Have we grown that far apart?

674
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,456
You actually believe
I'm capable of that?

675
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,040
Jordan, I don't know what
you're capable of anymore.

676
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,378
All I know I that two days ago
I came in here ad I told you

677
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:48,360
that Hewitt as dangerous.
Now he has brain damage

678
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,003
and he probably
won't have a career.

679
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:53,002
Then it looks like
fate intervened on our behalf.

680
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:55,182
You're not answering my question.

681
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:57,378
Because I find it offensive!

682
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:59,478
You're the one who's always
saying that we're at war.

683
00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:01,579
Why wouldn't Hewitt just
be another casualty to you?

684
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,889
Just like all those people
that died taking your shot?

685
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:05,409
Those people made a choice.

686
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:07,337
They knew the risks.
I knew the risks.

687
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:13,937
I did not order anyone
to attack Gabriel Hewitt.

688
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:18,154
I don't believe you.

689
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,105
I can't begin to tell you
how disappointing that is.

690
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,300
Well, it's true.

691
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:26,270
That's why
I can't follow you anymore.

692
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:35,941
Did you see the license plate
on the car that took him away?

693
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,169
I'm sorry.
What do we do now?

694
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,406
We need to tell Meghan,
bring the whole building into this,

695
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,579
hope we find Curtis
before the worst happens.

696
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:47,759
They just told me
you were released.

697
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,942
Are you okay?

698
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:50,686
Yeah, yeah.
Pretty much.

699
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:53,542
We were coming to see you. We need
to talk to you about Curtis Peck.

700
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:56,130
He came to me for protection
a couple of nights ago.

701
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,597
We tried to keep him safe,
but we lost him.

702
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:00,356
We think The Marked took him.

703
00:36:02,485 --> 00:36:04,111
Guys, Curtis Peck is
in the building.

704
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:05,313
He came in about an hour ago.

705
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,701
He went straight down
to NTAC medical for his checkup.

706
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,740
Sorry I had to rush out.

707
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,923
I know this is going to
sound weird,

708
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:14,338
but I got a call from this...

709
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:16,591
from this big movie producer
who's in town.

710
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,379
He's a big fan of my work.

711
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:21,434
He offered me a deal to direct
a big Hollywood movie.

712
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:24,444
Don Incubus, demon P.I.

713
00:36:24,702 --> 00:36:26,458
It's a comic book adaptation.

714
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,082
It's perfect for me.

715
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,355
I'm in business, guys.

716
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,901
This is what I always wanted!

717
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:34,544
But, Curtis,
what about the conspiracy?

718
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:36,608
- What about The Marked?
- You were almost done.

719
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,601
You were just about to
tell us all the names.

720
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,395
The names?

721
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,149
Well, there are no names.

722
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:44,077
Not really.

723
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:46,221
I made the whole thing up.

724
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:50,197
I'm putting that project on the shelf.
I couldn't finish it.

725
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,920
What, they got to you.
they bought you off, huh?

726
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,505
You really believed that stuff,
didn't you?

727
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,154
Look, I'm flattered,

728
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:04,653
but you need to calm down.

729
00:37:05,195 --> 00:37:07,261
There's no such thing
as The Marked.

730
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:13,870
Just like Robert Shaftoe
didn't shoot JFK.

731
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:16,144
They're just movies.

732
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:22,165
So... I'm sorry I missed my checkups.

733
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:23,787
It won't happen again.

734
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:26,886
Can I leave now?

735
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:28,532
I gotta pack.

736
00:37:29,189 --> 00:37:30,447
I'm going to Hollywood.

737
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:43,967
There's nothing unusual there.

738
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:45,888
I spent all afternoon
in NTAC medical,

739
00:37:45,988 --> 00:37:48,116
and as far as they could tell,
there's nothing different with me.

740
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,346
Well, that's good, Tom.
It's all a mind game.

741
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:51,965
They just want us to back off.

742
00:37:52,218 --> 00:37:53,282
Well, it's not going to work.

743
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:54,756
We're gonna find out
the truth about these people

744
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,454
with or without Curtis Peck.

745
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:59,826
Excuse me, agent Baldwin?
agent Skouris?

746
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:01,485
Sorry for the surprise.

747
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:03,666
I asked my driver to make a detour.

748
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,651
I can't get that crazy movie
idea out of my head.

749
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:09,905
What was it called,
The Marked?

750
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:11,847
You know damn well
what it was called.

751
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:13,349
I guess I do.

752
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:16,259
I keep thinking
what it would be like

753
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:19,248
to actually be
one of those guys.

754
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,151
Imagine if you were
stuck in the past,

755
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:24,785
just cut off from your friends
and your family.

756
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:27,206
That'd be quite a sacrifice,
wouldn't it?

757
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,507
They sound kind of like
heroes to me.

758
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:32,152
Well,
heroes don't have people killed,

759
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:35,215
They don't consume the personalities
of innocent men and women.

760
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,032
I don't know exactly
what The Marked are up to.

761
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:38,388
I haven't seen the movie.

762
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:39,947
You never will now.

763
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:41,313
No one will.

764
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:43,844
Maybe it's better that way.

765
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:47,215
Seems to me their work would be
best done in secret.

766
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:48,856
If they are out there,

767
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:50,486
I would think

768
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,820
people like you
would consider them,

769
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,395
I don't know, allies?

770
00:38:55,863 --> 00:38:58,933
After all, they'd have
the same goal as you, right?

771
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:01,782
To stop Jordan Collier's
global revolution,

772
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:04,288
and all the chaos
and unrest that it could bring.

773
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:06,641
I'd just think of them
as back-up.

774
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:08,718
Valuable back-up.

775
00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:09,844
If...

776
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:12,217
- they exist.
- That's right.

777
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:14,700
If they exist.

778
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:19,092
Anyway, it was good
to see you two again.

779
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,142
I have to pick up my wife.

780
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:23,178
We're being honored
at the world

781
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:25,112
health organization tonight.

782
00:39:27,009 --> 00:39:29,150
Those look like x-rays.
is everything okay with you?

783
00:39:31,514 --> 00:39:32,632
It didn't work.

784
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:35,830
Whatever you tried to do to me,
it didn't take.

785
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:37,675
I'm still me.

786
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:39,985
Of course you're you.

787
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:42,885
We're all ourselves, aren't we?

788
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:46,256
I mean, who else would we be?

789
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:15,699
He made you doubt me,
didn't he?

790
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,097
Your cousin,
he made you doubt me.

791
00:40:22,395 --> 00:40:23,857
It's just weird timing,

792
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,995
Hewitt's stroke.

793
00:40:27,877 --> 00:40:30,878
If you have something you want to
ask me, Kyle, I'll answer honestly.

794
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,004
Was this you?

795
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:37,851
Did you have this done?

796
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:40,146
I did not.

797
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:44,102
I believe you.

798
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:47,514
I'm sorry Shawn didn't.

799
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:48,791
I'm sorry, too.

800
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:51,966
Shawn was like a son to me,

801
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,072
and I've lost him.

802
00:40:55,898 --> 00:40:57,175
But I've found you.

803
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:30,884
Thank you.

804
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,155
Don't thank me, just change.

805
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,338
I think we can rest easy.

806
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:44,954
It's all going to be fine.

807
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,025
Tell the others that I went to see
the NTAC agents.

808
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:53,565
Baldwin thinks
it's some kind of ploy,

809
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:55,111
a mind game...

810
00:41:59,157 --> 00:42:00,590
When we need him,

811
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,741
he will be there for us.
