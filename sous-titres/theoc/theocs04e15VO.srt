1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,501
I'm pregnant.
What?

2
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,900
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.:

3
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:04,167
Sandy, we're having a baby.
<i>I just want you</i>

4
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:05,900
to find something
that you really care about.

5
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,800
I could be a critic.
You mean spending your
whole life watching movies

6
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:09,933
and telling people
how terrible they are?

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,067
You want to go rent
<i>An Inconvenient Truth?</i>

8
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:12,134
So what'd you tell Frank?

9
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,100
I told him right now
I need to be spending
<i>some time with my daughter.</i>

10
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,833
RYAN:
<i>Well, let's put it</i>
<i>all on the table.</i>

11
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,100
I love you and I don't want
to lose you.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,234
Mom!
It's okay, it's just...

13
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:26,668
It's an earthquake!
Get in there!

14
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:28,601
Mom!

15
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:29,668
SANDY:
Kirsten?

16
00:00:58,034 --> 00:00:59,933
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Ryan.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,534
Oh, my God.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right.

18
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,301
Uh, okay, I'm going
to count to three

19
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,167
and you're going to get
out of here, okay?

20
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,800
No, no, no, you're going
to hurt yourself.

21
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:08,900
Don't have a choice.

22
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:12,200
All right, one, two, three.
Okay, okay.

23
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:13,334
Go. Go, go, go, go.

24
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:17,867
Ryan?

25
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:21,301
Ryan? Are you okay?

26
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,067
(coughing)
Yeah. Yeah.

27
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:26,567
You?

28
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:28,134
Yeah.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,701
I'm fine, thanks to you.

30
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:34,833
Hey, Ryan?
Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,567
I'm sorry I was all,
"Oh, my God, Oh, my God."

32
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,134
'Cause usually I'm very
good in a crisis.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,601
But I just started
thinking about
if anything happened to you

34
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,234
and I don't know
what I would do.

35
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,833
It's okay, we're both okay.

36
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,401
It's just that grace under fire
is a very important quality

37
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:47,768
and I don't want you to think
that I'm lacking in it,

38
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,867
because we might encounter
all sorts of crisis

39
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,100
when we're away
together, like, at college.

40
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,267
Oh, my God, is that blood?

41
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:53,534
I faint at the
sight of blood.

42
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:55,434
Oh, no, no,
no, it's just glitter.

43
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:56,701
Taylor.
I'm okay.

44
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:00,534
All that stuff we put on
the table just now,

45
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:03,267
let's, uh, let's talk
about it later, okay?

46
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,701
Right, yeah.
That's probably a good idea,

47
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:07,367
when, you know,
the power's back on
and we're not sitting in rubble.

48
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:10,234
Um, I'm going to call
Kirsten and Sandy.

49
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,833
Where's my jacket?

50
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,234
Oh, gross.

51
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,534
Sorry.

52
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:18,900
You know, I've
actually stockpiled

53
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:23,867
some rudimentary supplies in case of,
you know, the Apocalypse or whatever.

54
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,401
I got all sorts of
stuff in there.

55
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,768
Got extra tennis shoes

56
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:30,534
(voice echoing):
and flashlights
and canned goods and...

57
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,967
(voice fading):
A space heater...

58
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,434
I'm not...

59
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:41,501
Hey... getting good
reception here.
I'm going to step
out in the hall.

60
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,234
(echoing):
Okay...

61
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:57,267
REPORTER:
Yes, Orange County, as you
probably figured out,

62
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,467
that was an earthquake.

63
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:00,967
So far, no reports
of fatalities,

64
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:03,267
but power is out,
cell lines are jammed

65
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,334
and the roads are for
emergency vehicles only.

66
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:07,800
As more information comes in
we'll relay it to you.

67
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:11,867
So if you're safe,
stay calm and stay put.

68
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,434
So we got our marching orders
and our staying put orders.

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,167
So no one's to leave the plaza
unless they have to.

70
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:20,100
WOMAN:
What are we going
to do with everyone?

71
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,601
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.

72
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,000
(whispering):
And what about looters?

73
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,367
We just have to get organized.

74
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:30,501
Also, keep the radio on
and gather up anything
you think might be useful--

75
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,867
flashlights, blankets, water,
batteries, you'll be fine.

76
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:40,467
I can't get through
to either of the boys.

77
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,267
Well, keep trying.
How about you?

78
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:43,567
We should get you
to the hospital.

79
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:45,301
I'm fine, it's just
a bump on the head.

80
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,367
Mine. Not his or hers.

81
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,601
Hello.

82
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:53,467
Ryan, where are you?

83
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,401
They're at the Cooper
house with Taylor.

84
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,534
Tell him to stay there.

85
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,200
Okay. Just stay there, okay.

86
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:00,668
All right.
(cell phone ringing)

87
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,401
Seth?

88
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,034
Hey, Dad.

89
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,567
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

90
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,867
I wish I could say the same
for Ryan's car though.

91
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,034
How's Mom?

92
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,367
Mm-hmm.
And Ryan?

93
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,067
Ryan and Taylor are
at your house.

94
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:15,900
Yeah, sounds good,
we'll do that.

95
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,833
All right, take care.

96
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,867
Found a flashlight.
I can see that.

97
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,334
Which is good,
'cause we can use it.

98
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,534
We're going to have to get
back to my house on foot.

99
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:26,267
My dad thinks we should
get off the streets.
Why? Did he hear something?

100
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,567
About aftershocks
or looters or...

101
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,434
Zombies? I know, that was
my first thought, too.

102
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,900
But no, it's just
a precaution.

103
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:38,701
Need yr help.
Pls come to Coopers. Dont tell Summer.

104
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,434
It's Ryan.
Is everyone okay?

105
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:43,200
Yeah, we just have to make
a little change of plans.

110
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,634
But I think we should
all be together.

111
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:44,501
This is a bad idea.

112
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:45,601
We're almost there.

113
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,667
No, we're not.

114
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,501
It's just a few
more minutes.

115
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,400
Well, I know where my
house is okay?

116
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:53,167
Look, I command you
to stop this bike.

117
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:56,367
I'm sorry, okay but I'm starting
to get a little creeped out.

118
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:58,434
Not that I don't want to play
Pictionary by candlelight

119
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:00,000
and raid Taylor's
Apocalypse kit,

120
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,200
but I think we should
just go to your house.

121
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:06,167
Okay, but I'm still awaiting
on news of Pancakes.

122
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,901
Pancakes?

123
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,400
You said Ryan said
everyone was fine.

124
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,367
I know, but I don't know
that he included rodents
in his head count,

125
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:16,734
so I texted him
to be sure.
And?

126
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:18,667
And I'm still waiting
on the reply.

127
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,400
Maybe I should pedal.
You look a little tired.

128
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,367
(bike bell rings)

129
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:26,567
Fine.

130
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:29,634
Go!

131
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,534
Frank, hi, it's Julie.

132
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,400
I hope you're okay.

133
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,267
Caitlin and I are fine,
I mean, we're trapped

134
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:54,501
at the ice cream store
on the pier, but we're fine.

135
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,367
I guess help is
probably on the way.

136
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:59,234
Okay, well...

137
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,634
take care, bye.

138
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,868
Look, I understand why you keep
on calling Summer

139
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:06,200
and the Cohens,
but why Frank?

140
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,767
I mean, weren't you guys
supposed to take it
down a notch?

141
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,267
Caitlin, just because we're
pulling things back a little bit

142
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,234
doesn't mean that we've stopped
caring about each other.

143
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm sure wherever Frank is,
he's worried about us,
just like I am about him.

144
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:19,534
And I am about myself, because
we're stuck here with him.

145
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:21,968
The back door is stuck, too.

146
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,701
Looks like there's
no way out.

147
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:24,934
We're trapped.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,534
Figures.

149
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:28,267
We can't just sit here
waiting to be rescued.

150
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:30,901
Totally.
No, we should start eating
all the melting ice cream.

151
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,534
I want a gold medal ribbon
on a...

152
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,801
Sugar cone, I know.

153
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,801
Creepy, but convenient.

154
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,901
Okay, ice-cream guy,
start scooping.

155
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:41,467
It's Gary, my name.

156
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,667
Okay.

157
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:47,501
I'm thinking the roof,
or where the roof
used to be.

158
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,734
Ice-cream guy, got a ladder?

159
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,234
You can't climb up there.

160
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,634
I'm not going to,
you are.

161
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,300
And this is my personal
safety device.

162
00:07:58,367 --> 00:07:59,634
It's a flashlight, it's a radio,

163
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,567
it's a cell phone charger,

164
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:03,767
it's a siren and
it's a compass.

165
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,634
Hmm. North is that way.

166
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:06,801
Handy.

167
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:09,267
Also got canned goods,
batteries, water,

168
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:12,234
ooh, a gas mask and-- that's
right-- North Korean currency,

169
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,434
because you just
never know.

170
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:17,234
Hey, why are you
wearing a jacket? Are you cold?

171
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,634
Let me get my
space blanket.

172
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,334
It preserves up
to 80% body heat.

173
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,067
REPORTER:
A bit of bad news just in.

174
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,567
Our first fatality.

175
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:24,901
Not a lot of information,

176
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:26,801
a pedestrian hit
by a downed power li...

177
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,000
No reason to think
its anyone we know.

178
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,334
Yeah, of course not.

179
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,834
Still, aren't families supposed to reach out
to each other in times of uncertainty?

180
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,000
I know the phones
are messed up,

181
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,701
but you were able to get
through to Sandy and he was able to get
through to Seth.

182
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,868
Uh, right, you're worried
about your mom.

183
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,167
Yeah.

184
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:01,200
She gave birth to me.

185
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:04,100
If I'm worried
she may be hurt,
then shouldn't
she be worried about me?

186
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,601
I think we need to go over
there and check on her.

187
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,634
To her house?

188
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes, Ryan.

189
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,601
I know my mom is a total bitch,
but she's still my mom,

190
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,667
and she doesn't drink
a lot of milk so her bones are probably
very brittle

191
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,467
and she's always been kind
of scared of the dark...

192
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:17,767
Taylor, Taylor,
we can't go over there.

193
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,067
Seth and Summer are
coming over here.

194
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:20,701
What? Since when?

195
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,334
Since Seth texted me.

196
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,901
He said that they were.

197
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:27,067
I thought Sandy said
it was safest for us
to stay where we are.

198
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,801
No, no, no, Sandy said

199
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,000
that it's safer for all of us
to be together.

200
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:35,734
SANDY:
<i>All right, folks,</i>
<i>we got to remain calm</i>

201
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,100
and we got to remain here.

202
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:40,367
Anyone in need
of medical attention,
please identify yourself
to this gentleman,

203
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:43,601
and everyone who is willing to
help anyone who might need it,

204
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,734
please come over and introduce
yourself to me.

205
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:48,000
The good news is, we got
everything we need here.

206
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,067
We got shelter, we got food,
we got water.

207
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:53,167
We got fine literature,
chips and salsa,

208
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:57,267
so if we all stay together, we
can get through this no problem.

209
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,834
All right?

210
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,367
This is like Berkeley 1989.

211
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,400
Oh, you say that so warmly.

212
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,434
Not that I'm fond
of natural disasters,

213
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:13,501
but there is nothing sexier
than your husband calming
an angry mob.

214
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,634
Now, are you okay?

215
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,334
Yeah, I know I've been
complaining
about Newport a lot lately,

216
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,100
but it just breaks my heart
to see it like this.

217
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,968
I'm going to pass
these out.
All right.

218
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:26,667
Hello?

219
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,234
Oh, hey, Sandy, I'm glad
I finally got a hold of you.

220
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,734
Are you with Ryan?

221
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:34,367
Oh, no, Frank, but he's at
the Cooper house with Taylor.

222
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,634
He's fine, we're all fine.

223
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,734
That's great news.
And Julie and Caitlin,
they're at the house too, right?

224
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:39,901
That I don't know.

225
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:42,234
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

226
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,267
I'm sorry, I don't,
but I'm sure they're
going to try to get
in touch with you,

227
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,734
and if I hear anything at all,
I'll call you.

228
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:50,133
I... yeah, yeah, thanks, Sandy.

229
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,133
Great.

230
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,367
Okay, Gary,
how's it look up there?

231
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:59,567
Can you climb down
and get some help?

232
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:01,267
Um... not really.

233
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,968
Why not?

234
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,267
What's going on?

235
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,434
We're on an island, all alone.

236
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,734
Look, we appreciate the imagery
and all that,

237
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,100
but this is no time
for existential metaphors.

238
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,834
No. Really.

239
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,767
The pier's been washed out.

240
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,667
Summer, you're okay!

241
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:24,300
I am so glad to see you.

242
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,234
Hey, where's Ryan?

243
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,634
He's...

244
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:28,100
Hey.

245
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:32,167
SUMMER:
Hey, Atwood.
I got to look for Pancakes.

246
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,767
Oh, my God! Pancakes!
I'm gonna go with you.

247
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,167
Great. While you guys do that,
Ryan and I will, uh...

248
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:39,100
Go.
SETH:
Yeah, we're gonna go.

249
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,367
Where are you gonna go?
Yeah, we just got here.

250
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,901
Well, we need supplies.
I have supplies.

251
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,901
No, I know, but, uh, who knows
how long those will last.

252
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:49,133
Yeah, and there'll
probably be a run,
especially when
the zombies come out.

253
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,067
Seth.
Ryan.

254
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,534
Look, guys, we'll be fine.

255
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:54,167
Just stay here, lock the doors
and don't open them.

256
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:56,501
SETH:
Summer,

257
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,300
Pancakes needs you right now.

258
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,400
Be careful.

259
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,133
'Kay, come back soon.

260
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,667
Okay.

261
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,234
What's up?

262
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,467
TAYLOR:
Don't you think the boys
were acting weird?

263
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,868
SUMMER:The shifty looks, finishing each
other's sentences

264
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,701
like they're composing
a lie on the spot?
Yes.

265
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,200
Totally normal for them.

266
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,033
I don't know, I feel like
they're hiding something.

267
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,234
SUMMER:
If it's not the location
of Pancakes,
I'm not interested.

268
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,501
Oh, no.

269
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,167
He was in his cage.

270
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:29,801
He's gone!

271
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,701
Oh, no.

272
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,868
(whispers):
Pancakes?

273
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:33,868
(whispers):
Pancakes?

274
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,601
Pancakes?

275
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,434
Okay, I didn't want
to worry Taylor.

276
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:41,000
She's pretty upset, and she's
got this thing about blood.

277
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,234
Blood?
Yeah. Don't freak, okay?

278
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,868
I-I-I need you
to not freak.

279
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:47,234
Okay. Why would I freak out?

280
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,434
It's not that bad, is it?

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,901
Dude, it's bad.

282
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:30,267
--Seth, the hospital is,
like, a mile away.

283
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:34,501
I know, which is
why I'm taking
the secret back roads way
that's only a half mile.

284
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:38,767
That was sarcasm.
I'm pretty sure my
shortcut got us lost.

285
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:42,467
Well, the ocean's on one side,
the land's on the other--
I'm sure you'll
figure it out.

286
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,400
That was sarcasm, too. Sorry.

287
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,300
No, hey, so you're
a little on edge.

288
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:51,367
A giant glass spear in the back
will do that to a guy.
It's not a spear.

289
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:54,367
What is it, more of
a spike or a skewer?

290
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,133
Dude, you're doing
a terrible job

291
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,367
of trying to keep
my mind off the pain.

292
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:00,400
You're supposed to talk about
something else, not the thing

293
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,267
causing the pain.
True, but the
real question is,

294
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,734
what are you doing to keep
<i>my</i> mind off of your pain?

295
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,400
'Cause right now
you're not looking too good

296
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:07,501
and I'm starting to feel...

297
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:12,467
What was that?

298
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,000
Uh, seems like we hit something.

299
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,234
Oh, God, not a body.

300
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,267
All right, well,
pull over or something.

301
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:24,434
All right, go out and check,
I guess.
With the zombies?

302
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,033
You watch way
too many movies.

303
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,400
KAITLIN/JULIE:
* <i>I used her</i> *

304
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,801
* She used me,
but nobody cared *

305
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,868
* We were getting our share *

306
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,467
* Working on the night moves *

307
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:57,234
* Uh, uh, uh *

308
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,868
* Trying to lose those *

309
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:01,501

313
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,334
(laughs)
* Mm, mm. *

314
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,567
GARY:
You guys are amazing.

315
00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:13,667
Uh, no. We're not.
No.

316
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:14,667
It's just
something we do.

317
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:17,834
I used to sing that
to Kaitlin when she
was little and scared.

318
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:20,067
Isn't that, uh,
kind of inappropriate?

319
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,734
I mean, given the sexual
content of the lyrics.

320
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:25,033
Well, it was the only song
she knew all the words to.

321
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,701
That and
"Pour Some Sugar on Me."

322
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,334
(chuckles):
Ah. Well, this is really fun.

323
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,734
Staying up late, eating sweets,
singing songs.

324
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,334
It's like summer camp.

325
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,067
Coed summer camp with
really hot camp counselors.

326
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:40,601
No offense, Gary, but this
is barely entertaining <i>me.</i>

327
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, Gary,
young guy in Newport, cool job--

328
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,901
you must have a lot of fun.

329
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:46,300
Not really.

330
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,634
No friends?
No girls?

331
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:52,567
Well... there is one girl.

332
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:55,267
Oh, well, you only need one,
as long as it's a good one.

333
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,934
She's an amazing one.

334
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,300
Well, are you guys serious?

335
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,634
Pretty serious.

336
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:03,300
You know, thinking about
taking it to the next level.

337
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,934
Oh, the next level.

338
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,801
That's very serious.
Yeah, you haven't
asked her out yet, have you?

339
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,868
Not yet, no.

340
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,067
Well, what's the holdup?

341
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,300
I mean, if she's
as hot as she sounds.

342
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:16,934
It's not her. It's me.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,934
She's a great girl.

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,501
And I'm...

345
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,501
the ice cream guy.

346
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,567
Oh, what the hell--
we have nothing better to do.

347
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,567
Yep, today is your lucky day.

348
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:32,000
Awesome!

349
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,968
I mean, wait, what do you mean?

350
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:37,100
Well, first, we have to get rid
of that dorky bow tie.

351
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,267
Yeah, and an apron
is friend to no man.

352
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,701
Surely we can do something
with this hair.

353
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,801
I think
I have some
nail scissors in my purse, hmm?

354
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:47,901
I can't get anyone on the phone.

355
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:50,667
Eh, that's okay, I'll, uh,
I'll walk you through it.

356
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:52,300
Just open up the back door.

357
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,234
It's easy, don't worry about it.

358
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,067
Ryan, you're asking me
to use tools and exert
myself physically.

359
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:01,167
I think we both know
where this is going.
Yeah, okay, well,

360
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:03,067
uh, start by putting
the jack under the frame

361
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,234
by the, uh, by the
door there. Yeah.

362
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,634
The jack is this thing
with the handle, right?

363
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:08,601
Yeah.

364
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:12,434
Actually, wait. First, um...

365
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:14,801
loosen the bolts
with that wrench.

366
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,534
All right.

367
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:26,467
(grunts):
There we go.

368
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:28,334
(exhales):
Okay.

369
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,334
All right, you may find this
hard to believe, Ryan,

370
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,200
but when I was younger,
I used to be a bit of a worrier.

371
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:40,367
You don't say.
To distract myself
from worrying,

372
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,701
I would sometimes make lists.

373
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,400
Didn't matter
what the lists were.

374
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:47,467
They could be anything--
every cereal
I've ever eaten, or...

375
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,100
uh, the names of every planet
mentioned in <i>Star Wars.</i>

376
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,834
Whatever.

377
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,167
Anyways...

378
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,234
You want to make a list, Seth?

379
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,734
Huh? Oh, yeah, whatever.
I mean, sure, if you want to.

380
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:01,167
We could start with everyone
you've ever punched
in the face
since moving to Newport.

381
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,567
First would be...

382
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:06,067
(grunts):
Luke at Holly's beach house.

383
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,167
Yeah, and number two
would be Luke.
Right.

384
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:14,567
At the diner.
Yeah, and again
at the mall.

385
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:16,067
What about Holly's dad
at Cotillion?

386
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,834
That was more of a tackle.
Which takes us back to Luke.

387
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,534
Yeah, in T.J.

388
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:30,434
Summer, do you really think
Pancakes is in the attic?

389
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:36,167
Like he pulled down the ladder,
hopped up and-and then
put it away?

390
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:38,868
Well, we have checked
everywhere else.

391
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,400
Light.

392
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,567
TAYLOR:
Be careful.

393
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,801
Oh... gross.

394
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,100
(gasping breaths):
It's okay.

395
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,434
What is that?

396
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,100
SUMMER:
That's Uncle Alistair.

397
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,767
That's your uncle?
Yeah. No.

398
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,701
It's, uh, my dad's skeleton
from med school.

399
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,901
He called him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.

400
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,467
God, well, I don't want to meet
any of your other relatives,

401
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:08,801
so let's just find
Pancakes and go.
Okay.

402
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:10,267
Pancakes.
Pancakes.

403
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,968
Pancakes.
Pancakes.

404
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,367
Don't be afraid.
It's just me.

405
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:17,968
Summer, you're such
a good mother.
Thanks.

406
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:22,701
When I think of the lengths
that you're going to
to save your adopted rabbit son,
and my own mother

407
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:26,634
can't even pick up the phone
and send me
a text message saying,
"Hi. Are you alive?"

408
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,167
That's okay--
you have us now.

409
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:31,534
Seth and I rode on a bicycle
just so we could
be here together,

410
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,801
and Julie and Kaitlin
left a message
and the Cohens asked about you.

411
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:37,367
Yeah, I know-- you're right.
You know,
if there's one thing

412
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:39,934
I've learned over the years,
it's you make your own family.

413
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,033
It seems to me that
you've scraped together
quite an awesome one.
(laughs)

414
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,200
Wait.
What?

415
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,634
You hear that?
Where?

416
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:49,367
In the vent.
It's Pancakes.

417
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:52,100
Pancakes? Pancakes? Here.
Pancakes? Pancakes?

418
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,367
Um, stay there, Pancakes.

419
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:56,033
Let's pry this open.
Okay.

420
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,434
Pancakes?
There he is!

421
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,400
(both make kissing sounds)
Come on! Good boy!

422
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:05,534
Hey.

423
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,133
(loud bang)
Come on.

424
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,334
TAYLOR:
It's an aftershock--
it'll stop in a second.

425
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,667
Pancakes!

426
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:15,234
(crying):
Oh, my God.

427
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,567
SANDY:
Kirsten?

428
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:45,701
Kirsten?

429
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,934
Kirsten?

430
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,234
Over here, Mr. Cohen.

431
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,200
Kirsten.

432
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:54,567
Sandy.

433
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,634
Something is not right.

434
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,901
--Nothing works.

435
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,567
It's like an
information blackout.

436
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:46,834
Well, the aftershock probably

437
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:48,901
took out a power line
or something.

438
00:21:48,968 --> 00:21:52,767
So listen, I'm going
to go on foot and
get help, I think.
No, no, no.

439
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,767
Well, we can't stay here.
I don't even know where here is.

440
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,968
Well, I'm going with you.

441
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,567
No, it's cool.

442
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:01,133
Listen, I'm going to come
back as soon as I can. Promise.

443
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,801
What about the zombies?

444
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,501
That's a really
good point. Okay.

445
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,501
All right, buddy. We have to
keep you alert and on your feet.

446
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,000
Now, when last
we checked the list...

447
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:19,467
Need some help?

448
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:20,701
Yeah.

449
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:22,367
...we were on Trey.
Mm-hmm.

450
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:25,100
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
but I believe we went from Trey

451
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,901
to a lengthy
Volchok period.

452
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:32,133
Hey, thanks for this.

453
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,868
Yeah. Now, unless
you hit that Chili guy--

454
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:36,667
or Johnny-- I know a lot of
people were rooting for that.

455
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:39,334
Well, I did punch Johnny's dad.

456
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,067
Or a bounty hunter
who worked for him.

457
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:42,534
Johnny's dad
was a bounty hunter?

458
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:44,534
Oh, yeah. I never
told you that?

459
00:22:57,734 --> 00:23:00,200
Excuse me, Doctor.

460
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:01,634
My wife needs to see
someone right away.

461
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,334
What happened?
I fell down some stairs.

462
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,367
You break anything?

463
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:05,701
I don't think so, but...

464
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,434
She needs help.

465
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,567
Everyone here
needs help, sir.

466
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:12,534
You can fill
out this form
and wait your turn.
She's pregnant.

467
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,067
Any bleeding?

468
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:16,267
No, but something isn't...
isn't right.

469
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,200
I'm sorry. Try to make
yourself comfortable.

470
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,434
Hang on a second.
Sandy...

471
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,701
Hang on one
second, all right?

472
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,167
I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Doctor.

473
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:29,167
My wife would never complain.

474
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:31,534
She would never put her needs
in front of anybody else's.

475
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:33,334
But I am not that proud.
I am not that selfless.

476
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,234
I am begging you,please, please,
to give her and our baby priority.

477
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,667
I'd like to help, really, but...

478
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:39,000
MAN:
You can have
my spot.

479
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:41,334
(over PV):
Richard White.

480
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,567
That's me. Go.

481
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,834
Thank you.

482
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,367
Honey.

483
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:52,567
Oh, great. We're out of candles,
and now the ice cream is melted.

484
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:53,968
Honey, please. Stop worrying.

485
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,901
Stop worrying? We're about
to be washed out to sea.

486
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,701
I'm sorry. You're right.

487
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,334
I'm... I'm right?

488
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,300
I thought I was exaggerating.

489
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,467
I'm going up there.

490
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:06,000
To do what?

491
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:08,133
To go swim out to shore?
I don't know.

492
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,334
Assess the situation...
figure it out.

493
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,567
I'm your mother. It's my job.

494
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,000
Wait.

495
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:18,067
You can't do that.
Why not?

496
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,367
Because... I'm having
an asthma attack...

497
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:23,100
from the stress!

498
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,267
Oh, my... Oh, my God.
Do you have an inhaler?

499
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:28,267
Or like an Epi pen?
I could stab you.

500
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,167
Maybe... we could just...
sing "Night Moves"?

501
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:32,767
(coughing):
I think it might calm me.

502
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,367
Really?
Please.

503
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:36,367
Uh.. uh... uh...

504
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:40,133
* Little too tall,
could have used a few pounds *

505
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,400
* She was a black-haired beauty
with big dark eyes *

506
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,701
That's good.
That's good. That's good.

507
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,234
* Working on the
night moves *

508
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,334
Okay, I think he needs,
like, CPR or something.

509
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,534
I learned this when
I was in Junior Lifeguard.

510
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:53,634
* Trying to lose
them awkward teenage blues *

511
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,667
* Working on the night moves. *

512
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:57,267
Oh! Gross!

513
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,267
What the heck
was the tongue for?

514
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:00,100
He tried to kiss me!

515
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,300
I'm sorry.

516
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,834
Young man, what is going on?

517
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:09,734
Oh, my.

518
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,601
The girl you like?

519
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,267
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

520
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:16,033
SUMMER:
<i>Pancakes!</i>

521
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,334
I think I hear something
this way.

522
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,067
Summer, how come we keep looking for Pancakes
when there's a giant elephant in the room?

523
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:24,434
We walk around the elephant.

524
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,267
It may be big,
but we are crafty.

525
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:27,968
The boys should have been back
over an hour ago.

526
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,200
Aren't you worried?
No, I'm not worried.

527
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:30,501
I'm freaking terrified, okay?

528
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:33,634
That's why I'm focusing
on just finding Pancakes
and not about the fact that
my boyfriend could be laying

529
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,033
on the side of the road
ravaged by zombies.

530
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,400
Okay, well, let's
go look for them.

531
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,767
In what?
They took the only car.

532
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,367
Have you
thought of that?

533
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:40,767
Well, let's listen to the radio
and see if there's any news.

534
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:43,701
The radio stopped working
with the aftershock.

535
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,300
(glass breaking)
What was that?

536
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:46,701
Pancakes?

537
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,834
Maybe it was Ryan and Seth.

538
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:50,567
Why would they need
to break a window?

539
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,133
I don't know.
What do we do?

540
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:54,968
Quick, hide!

541
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,033
(clanging)
Shh! No, no, no.

542
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,567
Summer, wait. I've got a better
idea. Summer, come here.

543
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:01,234
(screaming)
Shh!

544
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,734
You received a makeover
under false pretenses.

545
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,234
You lied about
having asthma.

546
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,534
Do you even <i>like</i> Bob Seger?

547
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:09,334
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.

548
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,701
I mean, I do know,
but I'm embarrassed.

549
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:15,834
Kaitlin, you come
in here all the time,

550
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:19,033
and you look right through me
like I don't even exist.

551
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,100
I'm sorry.
Don't be.

552
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,033
I mean,
why would a girl like you

553
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,267
pay any attention
to a guy like me?

554
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:31,467
I know the only
reason you'd ever
get to know me is if
you had no choice.

555
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:35,367
Tonight, that happened,
and it felt like fate.

556
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,067
I didn't want it to end.

557
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,234
I guess, I mean,
that's understandable.

558
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:48,367
But what do you mean,
you didn't want it to end?

559
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:50,601
What the...?

560
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,300
Mom...
It's okay.

561
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:57,868
Frank!

562
00:26:57,934 --> 00:26:58,868
Just got your message.

563
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,901
I was so worried.
Oh, me, too!

564
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:05,000
Go for it.
There was a flipping earthquake.

565
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:12,400
But wait. How did you get here?
What about the pier?

566
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,667
What about it?
The pier is fine.

567
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:22,434
There's a heartbeat.

568
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,367
Thank God.

569
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,100
The baby is under stress
and, after a fall, there can be a rupture.

570
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:30,968
Separation.

571
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,501
Can you treat that?

572
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:37,801
We still have
some more tests to run.

573
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,133
Okay, I've always wondered this.

574
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,367
In your opinion, who is a better
food industry server?

575
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:53,200
(echoing):
Chloe, the magical waitress
from Albuquerque,

576
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:55,567
or Donny, the angry
busboy who shot Luke?

577
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:58,300
I'll go with Chloe
on that one.

578
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,234
Good. That's what I figured.
That's what I figured.

579
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,601
(echoing):
Okay. Okay. Desert island.

580
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,701
Sadie, the tough as nails
yet soulful jewelry maker
or Lindsay,
my grandfather's

581
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,067
illegitimate, bookish
love child?

582
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,334
I can't, Seth.

583
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,767
Sure... sure you can.
It's very easy.

584
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:11,901
Go on. Just go.

585
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm not going
to go alone.

586
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,200
We need help, man.
I need help.

587
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:19,667
Just sit me down, okay?

588
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,868
All right.

589
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,901
Okay, but I'm going
to come right back.

590
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:46,100
I know.

591
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:05,901
SUMMER:
Do you hear that?

592
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:08,200
No.

593
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,601
Exactly.

594
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:12,267
It's quiet now.
Maybe they moved on.

595
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,467
Or... maybe they're
just faking us out.

596
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:19,200
There we go. Locked and loaded.
Just how mama likes it.

597
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:21,133
Taylor, a gun? Where did you
get that? Are you crazy?

598
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,667
It's Jimmy Cooper's
flare gun.

599
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:24,834
I found it in
the hall closet
when I was looking
for rain gear.

600
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:25,968
Yeah, but it's not raining.

601
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,234
Well, this was last November.

602
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,467
What?

603
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,167
Jimmy doesn't need it anymore,

604
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,133
and it's cold, and it's shiny,
and it feels so good in my...

605
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,467
Here. You try it.

606
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:35,968
Eww! I'm not
touching your pistol.

607
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,434
That is stupid
and dangerous.

608
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,033
Oh, my God.

609
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:44,400
Go 187 on that zombie ass.

610
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,501
It's in the kitchen.

611
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:47,534
Follow me.

612
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:05,100
Stop or I'll shoot!
(screaming)

613
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,067
Oh, my God!

614
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,400
I've been hit!
Mom?

615
00:30:13,968 --> 00:30:16,701
Taylor-- you shot me!

616
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,267
--I came here because
I was worried about you.

617
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,801
I know, Mom, and it really means
a lot to me that you did.

618
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:41,133
Save it--
that's the last
maternal instinct
I'll ever have,

619
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,434
since you shot me.

620
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:43,934
It was just a toe nick.

621
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,033
You're totally fine.

622
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,133
Until sandal season!

623
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,868
Taylor, I'm going
to have to see
a plastic surgeon
right away.

624
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,934
I already told you, there's no
way to get you to the hospital.

625
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,367
You're just going
to have to tough it out!

626
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,200
SUMMER:
Pancakes is hurt!

627
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:58,100
What? Oh, no!
A rabbit?

628
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,100
I found him in the garage,
and he was limping.

629
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,467
Let me see.
Careful.

630
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:03,667
Baby, come here.

631
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:07,067
Let me see.

632
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:09,067
You know, he seems
like he's okay.

633
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,534
Maybe it's just a sprain.

634
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:12,200
No, I can't take a chance, okay?
I have to go get him help.

635
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:13,868
Summer, you can't.
It's too dangerous.

636
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:15,501
I cannot wait here
any longer, okay?

637
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:17,434
I have a missing boyfriend
and a sick rabbit.

638
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,200
I cannot listen to any more
of your mother's whining.

639
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,300
Okay, I'll go with you.

640
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:26,934
We'll brave the zombies
together.

641
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,300
Mom, we're going to need to
take Pancakes to the hospital.

642
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,000
Wait. This carrion gets help,
but not me?

643
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,701
We don't have a car,
you can't walk.

644
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,467
There is no way
to get you there.

645
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:37,133
Taylor, I risked my life
and hoofed it all the way

646
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,567
from Emerald Bay,
and you're just going
to leave me here to rot?

647
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:43,467
I have an idea,
but I don't think
you're going
to like it.

648
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:54,200
This is not okay with me.

649
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:56,067
Well, I told you
you wouldn't like it.

650
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:59,868
Mom, it's not that far
to the hospital,
and it's kind of this
or nothing.

651
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,667
Fine, but I'm not holding
the rabbit...

652
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,501
unless you promise I can make
a vest out of him.

653
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:07,534
I'll carry
Pancakes.

654
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,601
Okay.

655
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:20,434
Caitlin, if you'll
just listen...

656
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:22,434
I heard you, you're sorry.
I get it.

657
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:25,567
Truthfully, I'm not sorry.

658
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,968
Tonight was the best
night of my life.

659
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,601
Gary...

660
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:32,934
Given the chance, I'd do
everything exactly the same.

661
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,734
Caitlin, honey,
you coming?

662
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:37,400
Oh, yeah, just give me
one second.

663
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,234
Okay, we'll wait for you
in the car.

664
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:43,667
Look, I should go.

665
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:47,334
But I am into ice cream,
and you're obviously hooked up
as far as that goes.

666
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,033
And the makeover
was pretty successful.

667
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:53,300
And the asthma attack had me
completely fooled.

668
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:56,033
Sweet.

669
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,767
So I guess once you guys get
this place back up and running,

670
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:00,801
I'll come stop by.

671
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:02,767
Gold Medal Ribbon on the house.

672
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:13,801
Best... earthquake... ever.

673
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:20,667
Dr. Harris, are those
my wife's tests?

674
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:24,133
Oh, no, Mr. Cohen,
it's going to be awhile
before we get the results.

675
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,167
Oh, of course, it's just
a little bit too soon for that.

676
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,400
I know you have your hands full.

677
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,367
Yes, we have a pretty
full house right now.

678
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:32,167
Well, as soon
as you know anything,
you know, good or bad...

679
00:33:32,234 --> 00:33:33,734
if you could please let me know.

680
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:34,901
I will, of course.

681
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:38,000
Let me know first,
just so I can prepare my wife.

682
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,000
Of course. Thank you.

683
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:43,100
I mean, it's kind of crazy
in that we have two other boys

684
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,934
that are just going off
to college,

685
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,567
so we were expecting
to have an empty nest, you know,

686
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:50,367
when then,
all of a sudden,

687
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:53,968
this unplanned,
miraculous event
and, well, uh, the fact
of the matter is,

688
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,868
I can't imagine anything worse
than an empty nest,

689
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,434
so, uh...

690
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,400
Anything you can do for that,
uh, for that little baby,

691
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,567
please, do it.

692
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:06,467
I'll get out of your hair
right now, okay?

693
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:07,534
I'll come find you.

694
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:08,834
I'll be right there, all right?

695
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,567
Okay. Thank you.
Yes, of course.

696
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:19,801
You feel that?

697
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:25,534
Darryl?

698
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,133
Hey, Seth.

699
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,367
How's the earthquake
treating you?

700
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,434
Uh, not too well.

701
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,067
I need to ask for your help.

702
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:33,634
Sure, but how can I help you?

703
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:38,367
Well, I'm guessing you don't
have a, uh, like, a car
or a walkie-talkie?

704
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:41,501
This shopping cart's
my only worldly
possession.

705
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:44,300
Okay, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you for it.

706
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,200
Sorry, no way.

707
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:47,567
I'll give you my pants.

708
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:49,234
No, no, they look better on you.

709
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,234
Listen.

710
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:55,300
It has a flat tire
and possibly
a broken axle, but it's

711
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:58,100
a $70,000 car
and it's all yours
in exchange
for the cart.
Sweet.

712
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,667
Stay here, I'll come back
to draw you a map.

713
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,167
MAN:
<i>Because--</i>

714
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,367
it's a rabbit.

715
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:13,033
It's a he, and I'm aware
of his species.

716
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,767
but that doesn't mean
that he doesn't feel pain
and that he isn't hurt.

717
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:19,667
Please, if you have
a shred of humanity,
or animality in your body,

718
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:23,734
you won't deprive this poor,
little, adorable bunny
of quality medical care.

719
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:29,501
Well, I did do a year
of veterinarian school.

720
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,901
Really?

721
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,767
Maybe if there's an
X-ray machine free, I'll...

722
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:36,968
Thank you. Thank you.

723
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:43,400
JULIE:
I still can't believe
that guy kept us there
for no reason.

724
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,767
I don't know. I think his
reasons are pretty good.

725
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,701
When a guy gets around a girl
he's crazy about,

726
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,367
sometimes reason goes
out the window.

727
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:53,834
He forgets
to take things slow.

728
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:57,334
Well, sometimes,
when a girl
gets around a guy
she's not too crazy about,

729
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,167
she does some
pretty stupid
things, too.

730
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:04,467
I'm sorry for posting your mug
shot up in the ladies' room
at Taylor's birthday.

731
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:07,801
Well, it showed a lot
of creativity.

732
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:10,968
JULIE:
Speaking of creativity,
Caitlin-- clown porn?

733
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:13,067
I'm not even going to ask
where that came from.

734
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,567
I found it
in Dr. Robert's study.

735
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:19,701
You guys will believe
absolutely anything.

736
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:23,000
Hey, Frank, have you ever
considered cutting your hair?

737
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:24,501
Is that Seth?

738
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:34,567
Oh, my God, pull over.

739
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:38,534
Mom, I'm really
sorry I shot you.

740
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,400
I know we don't
always get along,

741
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:43,434
but... I really
love you.

742
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:55,767
I love you, too.

743
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,801
I...

744
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:10,100
don't think I've ever
heard you say that before.

745
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,934
Taylor, that's why
I went to Julie's.

746
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,734
After the earthquake happened,
all I could think about was you.

747
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,534
Oh, my God, Mom,
me, too.

748
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:26,767
I was shot because I was such
a total failure as a mother.

749
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:31,000
It never even
occurred to you
that I would come
looking for you.

750
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:32,901
But you did.

751
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:34,801
So...

752
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,434
So.

753
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:40,934
Mom...

754
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,501
Hi.

755
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:05,133
Hi.

756
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,467
I guess this is the point where
I'm supposed to tell you

757
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:13,434
that you gave us all
quite a scare,
except I was never scared.

758
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,033
Oh, yeah, I know that.

759
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,667
Me, on the other hand...

760
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:18,267
The doctors say
you're going to be fine.

761
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:21,801
Although you're going to have to
wrap your head around the fact
that we're really brothers now.

762
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,100
We're blood brothers.

763
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,634
You donated blood?

764
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:31,267
Ah, I had an extra few pints
flowing through my veins.

765
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:32,567
It was no big deal.

766
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:35,367
Hmm.
You're not a big fan of needles.

767
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:37,234
Nor of fainting, it turns out.

768
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,834
But the bank was a little low

769
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:40,601
and us O-negative guys
got to stick together.

770
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,200
Hmm.

771
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:45,701
That's weird, 'cause all of a
sudden I have this strange urge

772
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:49,000
to listen to Death Cab
and read comic books.

773
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,634
Really?

774
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:53,534
No, I'm kidding.
Oh, that's too bad,
'cause if we could have

775
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:55,033
turned this into
a body-swap comedy,

776
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,934
we could have
squeezed another
year or two
out of this.


777
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So listen, I don't know if I've
said this at all today, but...

778
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:01,868
You did.

779
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:09,701
But after all the times you've
saved me, I was up, so...

780
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,634
All right.

781
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:13,434
Where's everyone else?

782
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:15,567
How are, how are the girls?
Kirsten, Sandy?

783
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:17,234
Uh, the girls are fine.

784
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,200
Veronica Townsend and Pancakes,
however, have matching casts.

785
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,934
And Frank is here
with Julie
and Caitlin.

786
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,834
He gave me a ride,
brought you here.

787
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:30,567
Um, but my mom and dad are doing
some tests with the doctor,
'cause she fell.

788
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,033
Is it bad?

789
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,934
Hey, boys.
Mom.

790
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,567
Hey.
I'm so sorry.

791
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:40,767
Everything's fine.

792
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,234
The baby's okay.

793
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,434
<i>She's</i> okay.

794
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,000
She?

795
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,868
It's a girl.

796
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:34,067
Sweet.

797
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:35,100
Cool.

798
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:58,934
Well, looks like the old
girl held up pretty good.

799
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,400
I can't wait
to have a hot shower
with the hot water
we don't have.

800
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:05,100
I'll settle for sleeping
in my own bed.

801
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,200
Or sleeping
anywhere.

802
00:42:06,267 --> 00:42:07,701
Come on, I'll fire up the grill,

803
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:09,801
we'll get the camp stove going--
it'll be fun.
