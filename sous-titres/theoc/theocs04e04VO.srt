1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,366
Previously on the O.C.

2
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,133
ll get used to it.'

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,267
You got married?
I'm just too afraid to tell
my mom now.

4
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:06,567
You're the one who walked away,
Neil.

5
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:07,767
You had the affair, remember?

6
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,367
Nothing happened with Gloria.

7
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:10,968
When I get back,
I want you out of this house.
It's my house.

8
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:12,867
Where's my dad?
Gone.

9
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,034
All I would do was hang
out with my best friend

10
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,701
and go tanning with
her and go shopping...

11
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,801
Let's be honest for a sec.

12
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:18,968
That's what this is all about.

13
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:20,233
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

14
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,300
It's just... I miss my friend.

15
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:29,267
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

16
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:30,968
MAN:
I'm glad you came.

17
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:34,601
What brings you in?

18
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:40,068
Well, I've changed a lot
since I got to college.

19
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:44,334
New friends, new interests,
new clothes.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,968
Well, that's
perfectly normal.

21
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,400
I know.

22
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:52,001
But... I think throwing myself
into all these new things

23
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,701
is just a way of avoiding

24
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:57,133
dealing with
what happened to my friend...

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,167
who, um... who died.

26
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:07,167
Well, grief often comes
in five stages.

27
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,867
Yeah, but I haven't
really been grieving.

28
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,534
Why is this happening?

29
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:20,001
Life is so unfair!

30
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,567
I'd do anything
to change things.

31
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,467
Please, just name it,
and I'll do it.

32
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:40,300
(sobbing):
Nothing matters anyway.

33
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:54,901
(loud sobs)

34
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:57,233
But this is so not fair!

35
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,434
I'm sorry, I have rage issues.

36
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:11,068
I think she would want me
to move on.

37
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,467
So that's what I'm going
to try to do.

38
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,367
I'm proud
of you, Summer.

39
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:22,434
You've made astounding
progress, and all in one week.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,100
It's kind of a relief in a way.

41
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,400
Now I can go back to being me.

42
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,500
What do you mean
by that?

43
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:31,767
Well, this whole save the planet
thing, it was a crutch, right?

44
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:34,968
And nothing against handicapped
people, but crutches? Ew.

45
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:37,767
A lot of people do change
when they go to college.

46
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,367
Well, not me.

47
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:41,267
I love shopping, tanning
and celebrity gossip,

48
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,934
always have, always will.

49
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,634
But I think I have to.

50
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,901
If I ever want things to be good
with my boyfriend again.

51
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:54,500
Summer, just promise
you'll take it slow.

52
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,634
Totally.

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,534
RYAN:
Hey, man.

54
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,667
Hey, dude,

55
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,334
I know, three hour time
difference,

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,601
but, Ryan, she's going
to dump me.

57
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,634
It's okay, I'm awake.

58
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:08,634
Oh, good.

59
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:09,701
Ryan, she's going to dump me.

60
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,233
No one believes that, all right?

61
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,267
Summer loves you.

62
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:13,667
The old Summer loved me.

63
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,167
But new Summer is upon us,

64
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:17,001
and Providence is the place
that spawned her.

65
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,701
Summer is just dealing with what
we're all dealing with, okay?

66
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,968
She'll come around.

67
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,334
What if she doesn't?
This is my last shot.

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,500
Otherwise, the girl with the
violent temper and good hygiene

69
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,167
is nothing
but a childhood memory.

70
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:45,867
Careful, lady, my girlfriend's
going to be here any second.

71
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,567
Shut up, Cohen.

72
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:49,400
Hey, you just punched me.

73
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,834
My baby's back.

74
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,968

You look good out there.

82
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:08,833
(chuckling):
Thanks.

83
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,467
I got to get you
on a surfboard.

84
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:11,501
Not a chance.

85
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:12,900
How about some breakfast?

86
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,833
I could use some intel
on Seth and Summer.

87
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,867
You know what, I
can't, but, uh, I think
they're doing all right.

88
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,134
You know? Doing the
long distance thing.

89
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,234
How about you?

90
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:21,434
How are you doing?

91
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,134
Good, good.
Better, once I get

92
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:25,067
my first day of work
under my belt.

93
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:27,234
Well, Pavo Guapo is lucky
to have you working there.

94
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,534
Me, too.

95
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,934
Now I got an excuse to come
by for your shrimp tacos.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,668
Yeah, Kirsten warned me
about that.

97
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,134
You're limited
to two a week.

98
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,201
Oh! I knew I should have
divorced that dame.

99
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:39,733
Well, it's not forever.

100
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,733
You're still accepted to
Berkeley for next year.

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,167
I'm just glad you're getting
back to your old self.

102
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,234
You know?
Back home again.

103
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:49,934
New job.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,767
I'm just trying to stay busy
and earn some extra money.

105
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,668
And hook me up with
some shrimp tacos.

106
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,201
Yeah, right.
I'll work on that.

107
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,501
I'm going to walk back.
I'm kind of sweaty.

108
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:01,367
Yeah, I wasn't offering
you a ride.

109
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,334
Hey, Ryan?

110
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:04,867
Hang in there.

111
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,134
Wow, that was a lot better

112
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,934
than what I was imagining
on the plane.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,634
You were imagining it
on the plane?

114
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,334
Not like that.
When you called me here,

115
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:21,800
I was sure you were going
to break up with me.

116
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,733
Well, I know I'm not the one

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,501
that usually apologizes
in this relationship,

118
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:29,334
but I'm sorry
about everything.

119
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:30,934
I turned into a liberal zealot

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,967
just to distract myself
from my own grief.

121
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:34,501
I'm not even into
all this stuff.

122
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:35,800
So the old you is back?

123
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:38,733
In all of my artificially
tanned glory.

124
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,833
Thank God.

125
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,800
'Cause I was not sure
that the new you

126
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,067
and old me were
really working.

127
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:44,634
Yeah, the new me
kind of smelled weird.

128
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,833
Well, what would you have done
if I didn't go back to being me?

129
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,568
I had a plan

130
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,467
to coax the old Summer out.

131
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,067
<i>The Valley,</i> Season Three?

132
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,434
Awesome!

133
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,767
KIRSTEN:
<i>I checked on Ryan.</i>
<i>Did he leave already?</i>

134
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,201
Yeah.

135
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,534
He seemed to be doing okay.

136
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,601
I was hoping to hang with him
while Seth is away.

137
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:08,733
Poker, maybe shoot
a little pool,

138
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,534
but his new job is going
to make that tough.

139
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,334
Well, I could rack
a few balls with you.

140
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:14,733
You are so smart and sexy

141
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,833
and gorgeous.

142
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,501
But sometimes a man just needs

143
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:18,534
to hang with the guys.

144
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:19,700
Well, that I'm not.

145
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:22,234
(timer rings)

146
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:32,867
You know, Jimmy left, Caleb
died, then Jimmy left again.

147
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:34,000
Even Neil's gone.

148
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,267
Look, I wasn't a
pennant winner,

149
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,167
but at least I had
a bullpen, you know?

150
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:38,434
It's baseball talk.
I got it.

151
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,067
Why don't you give Jason Spitz
a call?

152
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:41,601
You're always saying
how funny he is.

153
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:43,301
Why don't you ask him
to do something?

154
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:44,833
Yeah, yeah...
I don't know.

155
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,134
I mean, it's a little weird
for a guy to ask another guy

156
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,201
to do something
right out of the blue like that.

157
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:53,134
Since when is Sandy Cohen
afraid of acting weird?

158
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:54,767
Well, Spitz is pretty funny.

159
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,234
He's allegedly
a scratch golfer.

160
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,401
He likes the Dodgers.

161
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:58,534
I could live with that.

162
00:07:58,601 --> 00:07:59,601
It sounds perfect for you.

163
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:01,034
Yeah, but what am I going to do?

164
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,733
I'm going to give him
a call or what?

165
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,767
Ask him out?

166
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,267
Come on.

167
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:09,167
Why don't you use some
of that Sandy Cohen charm?

168
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,767
I'm sure he won't be
able to resist.

169
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,700
It's been a long time since
I been out there, honey.

170
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,201
What if Spitzy doesn't like me?

171
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:16,900
Are you calling him Spitzy now?

172
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,601
No, not yet.

173
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,134
Do you think he'll
go for it?

174
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:22,434
JULIE:
<i>Well, that's very</i>
<i>generous of you.</i>

175
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,100
Thank you, Neil.

176
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,000
Bye.

177
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,534
So how's Seattle?

178
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,000
Is that short, sassy lady

179
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,700
still bossing Dr. Roberts
around the hospital?

180
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,767
Neil is fine.

181
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,034
He's going to let us stay
in the house as long as we want.

182
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,201
Well, nice work, Mom.

183
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,634
I wish I could take
all the credit,

184
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,000
but it was actually Neil's idea.

185
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,201
He's really very sweet.

186
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:44,900
Oh, you miss him.
Well, don't worry.

187
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,767
We'll find you another old dude
to pay for all your stuff

188
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,867
and cheat on you.

189
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:50,000
Is that what I'm teaching you?

190
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,267
Mm, pretty much.

191
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:52,401
Well, no more.

192
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,501
Now that we have our housing
situation handled,

193
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,334
I am officially giving up men.

194
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,733
Good one.

195
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,100
That'll last a week, max.

196
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll take that wager,
young lady.

197
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,100
And I'll make one with you.

198
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,367
I will not so much as bat
an eyelash at a man,

199
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:06,668
and you will stay
out of trouble.

200
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,134
You cannot live without a man.

201
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,501
not even for a week.

202
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:13,833
TAYLOR:
Morning, roomies.

203
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,201
Anyone want a protein scramble?

204
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:17,934
Nice to see you're making
yourself at home, Taylor.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,668
Well, thanks for making me
feel at home, Jules.

206
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,900
Summer's room is
just adorable.

207
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,334
And I don't know how I ever
lived without a home gym.

208
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:26,067
Oh, this came for you today.

209
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:27,234
Who's Henry Michael?

210
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,867
Uh...

211
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,634
(French pronunciation:
Oh, Henri Michel?

212
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
That's just, um,

213
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:32,967
my French husband.

214
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:35,668
I'm sure it's nothing.
Excuse me.

215
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:41,367
You see? Man drama--
who needs it?

216
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:46,267
Hey, Ernesto's
looking pretty hot.

217
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:48,000
Nice six-pack.

218
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,067
Where?

219
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:51,167
Gotcha.

220
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,833
Taylor, hey.

221
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,434
Hi, Ryan.

222
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:15,100
Are you working at
El Pavo Guapo?

223
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,634
You know, that means
a handsome turkey?

224
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,067
That's why I took the job.

225
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:21,668
Hey, do you know when
Seth's going to be back?

226
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,034
I really need
to talk to him.

227
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,334
Sorry, gone for the weekend.

228
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,601
(sighs)

229
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,367
You know, that shirt really
brings out your eyes.

230
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:39,467
It's black.

231
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:40,867
What are you doing here, Taylor?

232
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,767
Just in the mood for Mexican.
Mm-hmm.

233
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,800
Maybe the Macho Nacho Burrito
wrap with extra guac.

234
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:47,833
And...

235
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,034
Oh, um, a favor.

236
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,367
(laughing):
No, no, no, sorry.

237
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,534
With Seth gone, you're the
only one I can turn to.

238
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:56,800
Well, I'm honored.

239
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,301
Okay, so, I'm trying
to get divorced,

240
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,467
and I just found out
that Henri Michel...

241
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,534
Oh, that's my French husband.

242
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,934
Um, he's coming to Newport

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,401
and I know he's going
to try and talk me out of it,

244
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,568
and I could really
use you there.

245
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,934
No.

246
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,467
I'm afraid to be alone with him.

247
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,601
I'm afraid
of his sensual powers.

248
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:17,100
Ryan, the man is

249
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,367
a sexual Jedi.

250
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:21,100
Whatever he asks you to do,
you just do it.

251
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,401
It doesn't matter
how depraved...

252
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:24,367
Okay, some people
are trying to eat here,

253
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,601
including me someday, so...

254
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:26,934
Ryan, please.

255
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,668
If I go alone, I'll be back
in France next week.

256
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,067
You don't know
how hard it was to leave.

257
00:11:31,134 --> 00:11:33,034
Seth and Summer are gone,
my mom kicked me out,

258
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,267
and... I have no one else.

259
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,568
Look, just do me this one favor,
and I'll leave you alone.

260
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:41,467
Promise?

261
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:46,833
Knock, knock.
Hey, Summer, can you

262
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,833
fact-check this flier
on solar panels?

263
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,601
It's for the
rally tomorrow.

264
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,601
Che, I'd like
to talk.

265
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:55,100
Sure, man.
What's up?

266
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:59,833
I haven't been completely honest
with you about who I really am.

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,334
This is my shoe collection.

268
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:08,434
There's leather, suede,

269
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,034
and the occasional
calfskin boot.

270
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,167
Whoa, my friend.

271
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,334
These are my magazines.

272
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:21,000
I know which stars
pump gas just like us,

273
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,034
and who's on pump watch.

274
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,267
And this is Marissa.

275
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:34,100
She was my best friend,
um, but she died

276
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,634
in a car accident
on graduation night.

277
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,634
Summer, I'm sorry.
That's-That's really heavy.

278
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,867
Yeah, well, it's so heavy
that I couldn't deal, so...

279
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:49,833
I put all my energy
towards being an activist,

280
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,134
but that's not who I am.

281
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,867
These shoes
and these magazines-- that's me,

282
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,700
but I hope
we can still be friends.

283
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:00,334
All I can do is be me,

284
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,501
whoever that is.

285
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:03,733
It's, uh... it's Dylan.

286
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,167
The guy's a genius.

287
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:08,167
Look, Summer,
if you've found

288
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:11,201
your place in this world, I am
nothing but happy for you.

289
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:13,900
Hey.

290
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,201
I put some cream
in your coffee.

291
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:16,634
I figured you'd be
back on dairy.

292
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,634
Hey, uh, Che, this is
my boyfriend, Seth.

293
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,201
Seth, this is Che.

294
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,201
Summer, you have a twin flame.

295
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,534
I wish I knew you were
coming into town.

296
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:25,601
I would have made
you a bracelet.

297
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:26,800
SETH:
Oh, hey.

298
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:29,867
Uh, where I come from,
we just say hey.

299
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,334
Well, to borrow
your native tongue, hey.

300
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:34,568
Listen, forget what I
said about the rally.

301
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,301
We got plenty of warriors
for the fight.

302
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:40,534
You two, just... be.

303
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:43,201
Thanks, Che.

304
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,367
What's that?

305
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,134
It's garbage.

306
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:51,733
Hi, Jason. How you doing?

307
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,434
I just had a meeting
with Kaminsky.

308
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,267
Oh, the slowest talker
in the world.

309
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,000
It took forever.
Forever.

310
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,000
(laughing)

311
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,301
Good to see you, man.

312
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,167
Hey, uh...

313
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:02,867
you got any plans this weekend?

314
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,668
Sandy, I've been working
the past six Saturdays.

315
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,201
No, no, I didn't mean that.

316
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,367
I'm just saying that we could,
you know,

317
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:11,867
you and I, uh, we could do
something.

318
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,800
Do something?

319
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,334
Poker, pool,

320
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:19,100
you know, a little
small ball.

321
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:22,067
If you're free.
If not, no worries.

322
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,833
Can I get back to you on that?

323
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,668
Oh, sure, yeah.

324
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,800
Whatever.

325
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,034
WOMAN:
But I had to spend the night
with Derek.

326
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,668
He tore his ACL.

327
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,700
MAN:
Hey, it's not my fault
he'll never kickbox again.

328
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,900
WOMAN:
If I remember correctly,
he did kick your ass.

329
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,000
God, this is so disgusting.

330
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,334
MAN:
That was a sucker punch.

331
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:46,434
I don't know, I think you're
being too hard on April.

332
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:49,034
Derek's knee was...
it was really messed up.

333
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,067
No, I just... I don't
like this show anymore.

334
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,733
All they do is create fake
problems for fake people

335
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,833
just to distract viewers from
the real problems in the world.

336
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,934
Well, I don't think the network
would go for a sexy teen soap

337
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,267
set in the Damascus, but we
can turn it off if you want.

338
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,601
I just thought you liked it.

339
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:04,700
I'm just distracted.

340
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:05,867
I haven't been keeping up

341
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,367
on how much blow
Lindsay Lohan's doing.

342
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:09,167
And did you hear
about JT and Cameron?

343
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:10,234
No, what?

344
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:12,067
I don't know.
That is the point.

345
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,034
I'm going to go get
one of my magazines.

346
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,833
That sounds like
the old Summer.

347
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,568
I'm going to stay here
and, uh, keep watching.

348
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,733
You know, I have this thing
where if I start something,

349
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,867
I have to finish.

350
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:24,568
Is that li a disease
or a condition?

351
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:26,534
Don't really know, Cohen.

352
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,534
I'm reading about who got lipo.

353
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,901
--You know, you might
want to relax.

354
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:57,034
Distract me.

355
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,801
Tell me about this,
um, cage fighting.

356
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,100
It's something that I've
been meaning to get into.

357
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,167
Yeah? Yeah?
Ask me another favor,

358
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:06,001
I'll be happy to show you.
Oh, Ryan Atwood with
a side of sauce.

359
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:07,233
I like it.

360
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,001
You're going to have to do
better, though,

361
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,767
'cause right now all I ca
think of is him, my husband,

362
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,601
and his arms, his smell...

363
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,767
making love in the
barn in Burgundy.

364
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:18,500
Sounds like the perfect guy.
Why would you want to divorce?

365
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:22,001
Well, despite being
agnostic in most things,

366
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,601
I do believe in true love.

367
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,034
And this was not it.

368
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:31,267
Well, back to you and your life.

369
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:32,901
What is your favorite fruit?

370
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,834
Peaches.

371
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:38,601
Oh, he used to say my breasts

372
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,200
were like two, soft...
Is that him?

373
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,834
No, that's...

374
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,867
his lawyer.

375
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,400
Madam.

376
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,500
(speaking French)

377
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:53,233
(speaking French2)

378
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:54,234
(speaking French3)

379
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,534
Is everything okay?

380
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,434
No, not exactly.

381
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,767
(speaking French)

382
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,768
(speaking French2)

383
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:04,769
(speaking French3)

384
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,770
(speaking French4)

385
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:15,771
(speaking French5)

386
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:17,772
(speaking French6)

387
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:19,773
(speaking French7)

388
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:26,774
(speaking French7)

389
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:35,133
What did he say?
What's wrong?

390
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,133
(speaking French)

391
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:39,134
(speaking French2)

392
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:40,135
(speaking French3)

393
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,236
(speaking French4)

394
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,237
(speaking French5)

395
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,601
What's going on?

396
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,968
Oh, I just told him
you were a soccer fan.

397
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,434
Oh.

398
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,534
Yeah, I like soccer.

399
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,500
Sorry today was such a bust.

400
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:12,801
What are you talking about?

401
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:16,001
We totally cleaned out the mall.

402
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:18,667
Well, you threw your smoothie
at a lady on the street.

403
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:20,734
Hey, that fur did
not look faux.

404
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,634
Yeah, I just feel like your mind
is someplace else.

405
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:26,034
My mind is on this adorable
sweater right here.

406
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,601
m going to try it on'
with that bag we bought,

407
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,467
because how cute would
they look together?

408
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:32,100
Now, if you don't mind,
a little privacy.

409
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:35,034
Well, I enjoy watching you
take off your clothes,

410
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,167
I'm sure I'll enjoy watching
you put them on.

411
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,001
Hey, this is
a very intense process.

412
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:41,233
All right, actually
this is perfect.

413
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,968
I wanted to head over
to Thayer Street

414
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,601
and do a walking tour
of ethnic foods.

415
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,834
I can't be moving here if
the shwarma is not up to par.

416
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:48,867
Well, bring me a kabob.

417
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,233
CHE:
Hey, Summer.

418
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,968
Che, hey, I wanted to know
how the rally went.

419
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:07,034
We marched, we chanted,
and along the way,

420
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,233
we may have even opened up
a few eyes.

421
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,334
We'll see.

422
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,500
Oh, that sounds great.

423
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,734
Yeah, Summer,
what are you doing?

424
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,133
Trying on a sweater.

425
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,801
Hey, Seth and I are going
to watch a movie here later

426
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,267
if you want to come by.
No, I can't.

427
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:19,400
We're prepping for tomorrow
night's debate.

428
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,534
Debate?

429
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,133
They agreed to grant us
an audience

430
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,667
with the dean,
present our proposal.

431
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:27,200
Only thing not powered by the
fuel of the sun is our passion.

432
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,701
Uh, well, tell everyone I said
hi, and good luck.

433
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,001
Yeah, thanks.

434
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,434
So do you like it?

435
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,034
Huh? Like what?

436
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,400
The new sweater.

437
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,367
No.

438
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:41,267
KIRSTEN:
<i>So you're really giving</i>
<i>up on men?</i>

439
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:44,801
Men are to me, what
Chardonnay is to you.

440
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,500
One sip and I'm upside down
on a chandelier.

441
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,233
Not that you've
ever done that.

442
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,467
What's your point, Julie?

443
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,801
I'm just trying to set
a good example for Kaitlin,

444
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:56,434
develop my own interests,
maybe my career,

445
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,267
that is, if you'd still
have me as a partner.

446
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,467
As I told you,

447
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,667
New Matchis there for you
whenever you want.

448
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,534
Thanks, Keeks. I was hoping
you'd say that.

449
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:11,068
Okay, so, I have so many
new ideas about expanding.

450
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:13,300
I went online.
I checked out some office...

451
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,068
Oh, there's Taryn.
Wow, she looks amazing.

452
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,901
Did she have
some work done?

453
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,634
She's had something.

454
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:24,367
Kirsten, great to see you.

455
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:26,734
Julie, I'm so sorry

456
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:27,767
about Neil.

457
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,434
I hope you plan to sue.

458
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,200
You know, just because
you aren't legal

459
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,068
doesn't mean you're not
entitled to some sort of...
(phone ringing)

460
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,601
Oh, it's Sandy.

461
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,834
Excuse me.

462
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,001
Hi, honey.

463
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:37,867
Hey, guess what?

464
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,133
I'm not good at guessing.

465
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm going out.

466
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:41,834
I'm jealous, with who?

467
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,834
Spitz! Spitzy to me.

468
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,167
He called?

469
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:46,233
He called.

470
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,167
How about that?
How about that?

471
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:51,400
Maybe a little golf, maybe a
drink after, watch the game.

472
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,434
Golfing, game watching,
suddenly not so jealous.

473
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,834
Thanks, but I don't think

474
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:58,367
I'll be needing
a dating service anymore.
Really?

475
00:20:58,434 --> 00:20:59,934
I didn't know you
were seeing anyone.

476
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:01,100
Oh, not someone...

477
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,233
someones.

478
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,267
Young ones.

479
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:07,334
Men our age are
so complicated.

480
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,801
Young guys just like
to have fun.

481
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,667
And they are so
grateful for a woman

482
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,334
who knows what she's doing.

483
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,167
Oh, so grateful, and limber.

484
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:20,467
Hey, a group of us are
going out tomorrow night.

485
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:21,667
You should come.

486
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:24,334
Uh, I'm trying to be
a role model.

487
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,467
Oh, mm-hmm.

488
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:31,867
I'll call you.

489
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:34,734
Did Taryn run off already?

490
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,601
Mm-hmm.
What's she doing?

491
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:37,701
JULIE:
Him.

492
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,133
Hey, Kaitlin!

493
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,534
We got a guy who can
hook us up with fake I.D.'s.

494
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:46,567
It's awesome.
Yeah.

495
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:48,167
I think I'll pass.

496
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,300
You've wanted a fake I.D.
since you were six.

497
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:52,734
Yeah, come on.

498
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:53,968
Yeah, and the guy's leaving town
next week.

499
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,767
Well, where is he going?
He's going to prison.

500
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,367
Yeah, for fraud.
Because he's awesome.

501
00:21:57,434 --> 00:21:59,701
Look, you guys, I made
a bet with my mom

502
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:00,968
that I'd stay
out of trouble.

503
00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:03,968
And this definitely
sounds like trouble.

504
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:05,034
Dude, not if we don't
get caught.

505
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,667
Dude, seriously.
Yeah, dude, seriously.

506
00:22:10,968 --> 00:22:14,233
Well, with a foolproof plan
like that, how can I say no?

507
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
<i>Garcon?</i>

508
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,567
Ah! Taylor.

509
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,233
It's been a few hours
since your last Macho Nacho.

510
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,734
You must be starving.

511
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:28,334
I was thinking of the mol\.

512
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,267
And, um, one more
tiny little favor.

513
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:33,867
Does it involve me standing
around while you speak French?

514
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:34,834
'Cause I've already done that.

515
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:35,901
No, no, no.

516
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:38,367
I actually just need
your signature.

517
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,334
You see, before I can get
divorced,

518
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,267
I have to have someone
attest to my character.

519
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:43,434
That's in French.

520
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,001
It's just the usual
boilerplate.

521
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,801
You know, never
been to prison--

522
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,034
well, me, not you.

523
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:48,834
(giggling)

524
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,068
Never been married before,

525
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,500
no contact with livestock,
blah, blah, blah.

526
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,968
So I think I have a pen.
Uh, you know, actually,

527
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:55,367
can I sign that after work?
Just leave it here.

528
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:58,267
Sure. Yes, okay.

529
00:22:58,334 --> 00:22:59,901
Thank you very much.

530
00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:02,400
So you don't speak
French at all?

531
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:03,801
No, why?

532
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:07,434
Well, it must have been really
boring for you today.

533
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,801
Sorry.

534
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,467
Hey, Seth, man, what's up?

535
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,400
Hey, I got some extra
baba ghanoush.

536
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,300
Oh, baba ghanoush.
No thanks, man.

537
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:26,100
I'm all right.
Where's Summer?

538
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,667
I gave her a little time-out.

539
00:23:27,734 --> 00:23:29,334
It's not easy
having house guests.

540
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,934
What?! I thought you guys
were having this great day,

541
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:34,500
purchasing luxury goods,
and eating things with faces.

542
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,001
Honestly, it could have gone
a little better.

543
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:38,500
I mean, you know, I support her,
whatever she's into,

544
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,133
but I really
need this to work 'cause...

545
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,267
SUMMER:
The people have spoken!

546
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:44,300
We are of one voice,
one mind

547
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,001
and one heart!

548
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:48,567
Yeah!
(applause)

549
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:51,367
I will not sleep,
I will not eat,

550
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,767
I will not rest until
this hypocrisy ends.

551
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:57,001
Solar panels on all of our
dormitories, or we revolt!

552
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:57,968
Who's with Summer?

553
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:00,034
Yeah!
STUDENTS:
Yeah!

554
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,334
(applause, cheering)

555
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,801
Yeah!

556
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,934
Hey, man, how's your French?

557
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,233
Old Summer's been replaced by
the real Summer,

558
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,101
and she looks suspiciously like
the new Summer.

559
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,667
So she's still in her
"Go Green" phase?

560
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:22,934
I don't think it's a phase, man.

561
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,801
I think this is her life
now, and it's obvious

562
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:26,967
I don't fit in it.

563
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,901
Uh, sorry, gotta go.

564
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,667
Hey, wait, I've got to talk to
you about Taylor... what...?

565
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:34,634
Didn't mean to eavesdrop.

566
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:35,801
It's okay.

567
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:37,867
Well, I knew
you were lying last night

568
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,434
when you said nothing was wrong.

569
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,534
Nothing is wrong; you're doing
what people do at college--

570
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,834
discovering who you really are.

571
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:46,534
Believe me,
I am as surprised as you are.

572
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,168
But I'm still going to shave
my legs and wash my hair,

573
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:50,901
and be the best
girlfriend that I can.

574
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,034
Well, you know, who can ask
for more than that?

575
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:55,001
Think of all the new subjects
we'll have to talk about.

576
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:58,168
I did explain the concept of
recycling to you in tenth grade.

577
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,567
See, there's lots of places

578
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:01,701
where we could use
your help, Cohen.

579
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,300
(knocking at door)
(playing simple melody)

580
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,233
Please come in. Enter.

581
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:08,467
Hey... Oh!

582
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:09,434
You're really nude.

583
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,534
Why don't I...
let me come back.

584
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,901
No! Wait right there.

585
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:15,034
I have a gift for you.

586
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:17,701
My song.

587
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:24,500
* Polar bears are dying *

588
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:25,934
* ...two, three, four *

589
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,200
* Good-bye. *

590
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:32,168
Wow.

591
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,500
Wow.

592
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:35,734
That's really, uh...

593
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,300
Anyways, listen,
I kind of need your help.

594
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:42,001
Yeah, bro, one second.

595
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:43,534
Uh, I'm actually really
honored you would ask me.

596
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Oh, hey, that's cool,
we can shake.

597
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,068
We can shake. We can shake.

598
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:48,233
And we're touching.

599
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,134
(cell phone ringing)

600
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,034
SANDY:
Oh!

601
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:52,967
Fore!

602
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:54,134
Yeah, hi.
Sorry!

603
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,367
Rob, what are you doing?

604
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:56,233
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

605
00:25:57,867 --> 00:25:58,901
Bye.

606
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,901
I'm sorry about that.

607
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,333
My, my kid's got a rash.

608
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,267
I got to go to the
pharmacy after this.

609
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,267
Oh, sorry.

610
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,567
Take another one.
It was my fault.

611
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:07,567
No, no, no!
You're up.

612
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,267
I'll play it from
the parking lot.

613
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,567
I think I hit your car.
It'd be an improvement.

614
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,168
Sandy...

615
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,034
uh... (anxious laugh)

616
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:21,801
You know,
my kid doesn't have a rash.

617
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,467
My wife's just calling,

618
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:26,101
making sure
I'm having a good time,

619
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,534
you know, because I don't have
that many guy friends anymore.

620
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,934
Who does?
Who's got the time?

621
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:33,634
I know, it's work, family,
then more work, you know?

622
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:35,134
When did it get so hard?

623
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,400
Well, when we were kids,
all you had to do was ask,

624
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:38,600
hey, want to play
some ball?

625
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,300
And we didn't have
any cell phones.

626
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:42,267
I turned mine off.
I'm really sorry about that.

627
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:48,300
(cell phone ringing)

628
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,001
Oh!

629
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,434
I'm so sorry, man!
I'm so sorry.

630
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,101
It's the office.
I'm turning it off.

631
00:26:55,168 --> 00:26:57,400
JASON:
I think I hit <i>your</i> car anyway.

632
00:26:57,467 --> 00:27:00,834
I love this space
and I love the windows.

633
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:02,734
Plus it's by the beach,
so there'd be lots

634
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:05,767
of foot traffic and eye candy,
not that I'm looking.

635
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,534
So I'll make an appointment
for us for Monday?

636
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,367
Are you doing
anything tonight?

637
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:13,934
No, Kaitlin's with the twins,
working on a science project,

638
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:15,734
so I have the night
all to myself.

639
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,734
Well, Sandy's out with a friend.

640
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:19,134
Do you want to do something?

641
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,834
I don't know--
takeout and a movie?

642
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:23,068
Two women spending Saturday
night at home together.

643
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:24,400
I love it.

644
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,434
How very <i>Whatever Happened To</i>
<i>Baby Jane.</i>

645
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,567
(cell phone ringing)

646
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:34,967
Go ahead, you can take it.

647
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:36,567
No, that's okay.

648
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:39,801
Just a sec.

649
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:45,634
Hello?

650
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,600
It's Taryn.
You joining us tonight?

651
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,867
Uh, actually,
I'm here with Kirsten

652
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,267
and we were thinking about
maybe...

653
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,001
Order in and watch a movie?

654
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:58,867
Oh, honey, even with the wonders
of elective surgery,

655
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:01,168
you will only be this hot
for so long.

656
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:03,233
Have fun while you can.

657
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:05,767
Julie, you still there?

658
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,333
I'll call you back.

659
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,934
Oh, I was just going
to get some takeout menus.

660
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:17,567
Do you know what
you'd like to eat?

661
00:28:17,634 --> 00:28:19,233
Kirsten, I feel like I'm coming
down with something.

662
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,734
I'm not feeling so hot.

663
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:23,367
Do you mind if I take a rain
check on our girl's night in?

664
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:25,834
Julie, did you just put on
lipstick?

665
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:29,834
What? No, uh...
I'm just a little flushed.

666
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:31,333
I'll call you.

667
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:38,400
KAITLIN:
Okay, I think that's the guy.

668
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,267
Kaitlin,
what if he's packing heat?

669
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,801
Okay, you guys just stay here.

670
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,967
Money.

671
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,534
Got what we talked about?

672
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,834
In here.

673
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:54,534
Great, so it's covered in lice
and grease.

674
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,367
Put your money in the hat
and try and be cool about it.

675
00:28:57,434 --> 00:28:58,901
You think it's my first buy?

676
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:01,901
It's been a pleasure.

677
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:06,001
I'm available,
by the way.

678
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:08,034
That's heinous.

679
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:17,068
I don't know
about this, Taryn.

680
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:18,300
It might be too soon.

681
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,467
Julie, I know how you feel.

682
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:23,134
But there's one
man who can always

683
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,634
get me out on
the dance floor.

684
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:26,467
His name is Jose.

685
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:28,467
Jose Cuervo.

686
00:29:53,701 --> 00:29:56,934
Have you met my friend
Julie Cooper-- urban cougar.

687
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:02,233
TAYLOR:
Ryan! There you are.
You know,

688
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,967
I think there might be
something wrong with your phone.

689
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:04,967
I called you
three times today.

690
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,034
Six, actually.

691
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:10,233
Oh, well, um,
did you get a chance

692
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,567
to look at that silly
little document?

693
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:13,600
Yeah! I did.

694
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,500
And I had a question for you.

695
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:16,967
Um, what does that mean?

696
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:19,534
Oh, that's just lawyer speak.

697
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,367
You know, just party
of the first part,

698
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:22,701
party of the second part.

699
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:24,500
So it doesn't say
we had sex, like, 30 times?

700
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:26,834
Took me like five hours
to translate that.

701
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:28,534
Sorry.
Yeah.

702
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,400
It's just that without
the consent of my husband,

703
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:33,534
the only way I can get a divorce
is if one of us was unfaithful.

704
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,534
I just didn't think you'd
sign if you knew the truth.

705
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,300
Yeah, well, I've got a lot of
half-eaten enchiladas to clear.

706
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:42,034
Ryan, I have to meet that lawyer
at the yacht club tonight,

707
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:43,400
and if I don't have this signed,

708
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,068
I'm going to have
no choice but to go with him

709
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,367
to France and try to work it out
with Henri Michel, face-to-face.

710
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:48,634
Which means you won't
be able to keep coming here,

711
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:49,767
which is a real shame.

712
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,767
Well, did you at least
read this part

713
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,434
where I said what
a great lover you are?

714
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,467
Look, Taylor... this job,

715
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:58,400
this is about all
I can handle right now.

716
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:01,101
You know?

717
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:08,634
I shouldn't have
dragged you in to this.

718
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,068
Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to say.

719
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,434
It's just that I...

720
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:15,867
...don't have anyone else.

721
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:18,600
It's kind of why I married a
Frenchman in the first place.

722
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,168
I mean, my mom hates me.

723
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:21,801
I don't really
know my dad,

724
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:24,168
and last year was the first year
I ever had friends.

725
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,634
All of a sudden, I'm by myself
in a foreign country,

726
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:28,967
and I meet this guy
who says he loves me.

727
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:31,801
He wants to take care of me
and... and...

728
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:33,467
One too many bottles
of Chateau Margot

729
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:37,567
and a view from
the Eiffel Tower, and why not?

730
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:38,901
That's how Tom wooed Katie.

731
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:40,567
Why not me?

732
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:50,767
Well, look, I'm sorry you're
going through all this.

733
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,701
I'm just not the guy to help.

734
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,867
Sorry.

735
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:08,434
Here they come.

736
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,267
There you are.
CHE:
Sorry we're late.

737
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,434
Earlier today, a caterpillar
entered my room.

738
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,767
I'm happy to say
a butterfly emged.

739
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:17,333
SETH:
Did you know that the
amount of solar energy

740
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
that touches the Earth's
surface in 40 minutes

741
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,934
is greater than all the energy

742
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,101
required by the entire
human population in a year?

743
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:26,767
Yes, I did know that.

744
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:28,701
It's a thing of beauty,
isn't it?

745
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:30,068
CHE:
Come on, friends.

746
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,200
Oh, the board only allows
students in the town meeting.

747
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:39,367
Do you go here?
Uh, no...

748
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:41,034
But I made this.

749
00:32:41,101 --> 00:32:43,300
Can you just make an exception?
It's for the good of the Earth.

750
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:44,901
No, I'm afraid not.

751
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:46,667
Well, it's cool, you go ahead.

752
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:48,534
But it's your last night here.
You can't spend it alone.

753
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,267
Summer, everybody in there is
counting on you, okay?

754
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,567
I can amuse myself
for a few hours.

755
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:55,600
You're the best boyfriend ever.

756
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,001
Go change the world.

757
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,734
mp tacos.
Oh, yeah?

758
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:10,400
Looks like you're
going to get a chance
to meet one of my kids.

759
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:11,101
Hey, Ryan.

760
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,400
Hey.

761
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:13,634
I'd like you to meet
Jason Spitz from work.

762
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,034
What's up?
How you doing?

763
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:16,500
We're about to go in
and watch the game,

764
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:17,701
get a bite to eat.
Can you join us?

765
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,168
Uh, you know, actually,
I'm kind of beat.

766
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:21,567
But you guys go ahead.
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you.

767
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,600
I'll be inside.
Yeah.

768
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,400
Hey, hey.

769
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,068
Is everything okay?
'Cause I'm guessing
not really.

770
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,834
I didn't get fired,
I didn't punch any of
my drunken customers,

771
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:29,168
I'd say I'm great.

772
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:31,600
One day at a time, one foot
in front of the other.

773
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,034
Eventually, it'll get easier.

774
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:34,934
Yeah, why, because I'll start
to forget about her?

775
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,667
No, no. You're never going
to forget about her.

776
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:40,134
But... life goes on.

777
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
Not the same life.

778
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:42,901
No.

779
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,001
But you're going to have
to make this life work.

780
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:46,101
Yeah, but I do, you know?

781
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:47,967
I got a job.
I go there, I go home.

782
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,634
I talk to as few people
as possible.

783
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:51,400
If it were only that easy.

784
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,634
Unfortunately for you,
getting mixed up in
other people's lives,

785
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,300
helping them out of jams,

786
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,101
it seems to
be what you do,

787
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,434
like it or not.

788
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,467
I'd hate to see you
turn your back on that.

789
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:03,367
It'd be like rning
your back on yourself.

790
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:04,867
Come on, join us, would you?

791
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,567
Get a little food, watch
the second half of the game.

792
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:09,434
Actually, there's something
I've got to do.

793
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,034
Uh, you guys have fun.

794
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:13,434
All right.
All right.

795
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,267
MAN:
Cover's 20 bucks,
just pay inside.

796
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,701
Let me do the
talking, okay?
All right.

797
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,034
You got an I.D.?

798
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:26,434
It's cool.

799
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,068
Cover's 20 bucks,
just pay inside.

800
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,801
Cool.

801
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,200
Sorry, boys,

802
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,134
not tonight.

803
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,101
What? Why?

804
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:34,300
I'm sorry, is there a problem

805
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:35,300
with their I.D.'s?

806
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,300
Because they're with me.

807
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,567
There's a problem
with them.

808
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:39,367
See, I have the right to refuse
entry to anybody.

809
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:40,367
And tonight that includes

810
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:41,500
dorks and virgins.

811
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:43,434
So just beat it, guys.
Fine.
Whatever, man.

812
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,333
That blows.
Come on,
Kaitlin, let's go.

813
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,734
Yeah, you can't go in
there without us.

814
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:49,300
Who's going to protect you?

815
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,034
See you guys later.

816
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:56,233
Need you to move aside, guys.

817
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:09,867
SANDY & JAN:
Go! Go, go, go!

818
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:10,701
Run!

819
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:12,600
groaning)

820
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:15,667
Man.

821
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:16,767
This is great.

822
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:18,934
Watching the game,
having a beer.

823
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:20,434
For five minutes,
the sky isn't falling.

824
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,901
A chance to be stupid again.

825
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,901
Here's to being stupid
for five minutes.

826
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:24,934
(phone ringing)

827
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:27,400
Hey, honey.

828
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:28,701
How's it going?

829
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,134
Great. Spitz just told
me a story

830
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,034
about how his kid's walked in
on him and his wife

831
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,200
when they were playing
Strip Scrabble.

832
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:34,534
Strip Scrabble?

833
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,034
I'm glad things are going well.

834
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,267
Yeah.
So how are you doing?

835
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,400
You having fun with Julie?

836
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:41,068
Well, Julie had
a mysterious illness.

837
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:42,600
So I'm home alone.

838
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,267
I just finished watching a movie
and I thought I'd check in.

839
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,901
I love you.
I love you.

840
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:49,034
Bye.

841
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:59,300
(speaking French)

842
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,901
I don't love him.

843
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:04,300
I never did.

844
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:06,101
I was just scared.

845
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,534
(speaking French)

846
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,901
Sorry I'm late.

847
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:26,333
You have that paper
for me to sign?

848
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,068
It won't be necessary.

849
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:34,300
I may be a lawyer,

850
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:35,600
but I'm also a Frenchman.

851
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,168
I know love when
I see it.

852
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,834
I will inform Henri Michel.

853
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,867
Ryan, I...

854
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,267
Don't worry about it.

855
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,400
Yeah.

856
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:59,500
CHE:
We stand before you,
an organized student body.

857
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,834
We have a question.

858
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:03,867
Where does this burden fall?

859
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:08,834
Hey, sleepyhead.

860
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:13,001
Hey.
Hey.

861
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:14,200
Did we win?

862
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:15,801
Not yet, but Che suggested
a filibuster,

863
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,333
so it could go on all night.

864
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,834
I think we got 'em.

865
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:20,168
That's great.
Yeah.

866
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:22,534
When I showed them my cost
benefit analysis chart,

867
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,834
jaws actually dropped.

868
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,400
Of course they did.

869
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:27,068
There's all these
old people in there

870
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:28,500
that are actually
listening to me. Me!

871
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,767
It felt better than
when I got 70% off

872
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,467
that Marc Jacobs dress
with the broken zipper.

873
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:34,001
I wish I could have been there.

874
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:36,101
Instead you slept in the hallway

875
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:37,500
on your last night in
Providence.

876
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:38,934
I'm totally fine.

877
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:41,500
Listen, go back in there and
knock it out of the park.

878
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:42,701
Was that a sports reference?

879
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:44,834
Maybe.

880
00:38:44,901 --> 00:38:46,333
See, I know people can change.

881
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:07,767
(knocking)

882
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:08,934
Yeah?

883
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:12,434
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you asleep?

884
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,634
No.

885
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,467
Oh, well, then my timing is

886
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:17,333
impeccable, as always.

887
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:20,467
So I wanted to
thank you.

888
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:23,200
So I made you peach torte.

889
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,701
Yeah, after I got married,
Henri Michel

890
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,634
made me take a cooking class.

891
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,134
Um, I failed everything
except tortes.

892
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Tortes I rocked.

893
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:33,434
Uh, well, that's great,
but, um...

894
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,400
You're not a dessert guy.

895
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:35,634
Okay.

896
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:37,400
Well, um, I could make
you lunch, or... dinner.

897
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:39,168
I have to pay you back somehow.

898
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:40,467
I love dessert.

899
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:42,300
Okay.

900
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:47,068
Fork.

901
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,467
Thanks.

902
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,001
Yeah? All right.

903
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,801
Wow.

904
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:56,534
Who would have thought,
six months ago,

905
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,300
you and I, sitting here,
sharing a torte.

906
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,233
Not me.

907
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,267
You know, at graduation,

908
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,867
in my commencement address,

909
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,467
I said there's no one older than
a high school senior,

910
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,534
no one younger than
a college freshman.

911
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,068
It was one of the few parts
that wasn't in Latin.

912
00:40:11,134 --> 00:40:14,333
And uh, it's true.

913
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,634
Because I feel like everything
I thought I knew,

914
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:20,367
everything that I expected,

915
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:22,701
is just kind of gone
out the window.

916
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:27,867
Yeah, life is definitely
unpredictable.

917
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:29,634
Yeah.

918
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:34,434
But I guess I'm realizing that
that could be a good thing.

919
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,034
You know?

920
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,233
Because it's exciting not
knowing what's going to happen.

921
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,068
Taylor, this is a great torte.

922
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,734
Really good.

923
00:40:51,134 --> 00:40:53,934
Can I have the next flight
to John Wayne Airport, please?

924
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:56,267
8:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

925
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:16,667
Come on.

926
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:05,168
(chuckles)

927
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:19,867
SETH:
Hey, Summer.
I know flying home early

928
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:21,734
is your move, but I stole it.

929
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:24,967
I just wanted to give you room
to keep doing

930
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:26,901
what you're doing, because
I think it's pretty amazing.

931
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:29,267
So if you don't hear from me
for a while, it's not because

932
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,267
<i>I don't love you,</i>
<i>it's because I do.</i>

933
