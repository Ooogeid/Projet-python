1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:01,433
Previously on The O.C:

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,767
I'm officially giving up men.

3
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:05,433
You cannot live
without a man,
not even for a week.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
I will not so much as bat an eyelash at a man,
and you will stay out of trouble.

5
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,534
Solar panels on all our
dormitories or we revolt!

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,801
SETH: I just want to give
you room to keep doing

7
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:15,400
what you're doing, 'cause
I think it's pretty amazing.

8
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:17,801
So if you don't hear from me
for a while,

9
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,234
it's not because I don't love
you; it's because I do.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,367
The only way I can get a divorce
is if one of us was unfaithful,

11
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,534
and I didn't think you'd sign
if you knew the truth.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,201
Getting mixed up in other people's lives
and helping them out of jams,

13
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:28,801
seems to be what you do.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,333
Bollywood, huh?

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,667
I didn't know you're
such a world cinema buff,

16
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,234
especially at 2:30
in the morning.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,101
What are you doing up?

18
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:48,834
I had a dream Summer
was marrying Ralph Nader

19
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,600
and I was playing
the marimba at the wedding.

20
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,034
Good gig. Why don't
you call her?

21
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:53,567
I'm giving her space,
remember?

22
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:57,001
I promised myself I'd wait
at least a week before calling.

23
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,268
What are they
dancing about?

24
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,234
This guy just saw his
girlfriend's ankle.
Hmm.

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,834
You think it's about time
to talk to someone?

26
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:03,168
Nobody ever died
of insomnia.

27
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:04,500
Fine. You know what?

28
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm sort of in the mood
for a chaste Hindu love story
with lots of needless dancing.

29
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,001
Seth, go to bed.

30
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,467
No can do.

31
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:11,934
If you're awake,
I'm awake.

32
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,067
Come on.

33
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:01,934
Love is...

34
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,300
Nice.

35
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,400
Thank you.

36
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:07,467
You know, you'd be a lot sharper 
if you didn't sleep on the couch.

37
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:10,934
You know, maybe you should invest in
some less-comfortable furniture.

38
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,667
Why don't you chew
on that for a while?

39
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:13,767
Morning, all.

40
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,268
Hey, how'd it go?

41
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,700
Oh.
I'll get it.

42
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,433
Five feet, glassy,

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,467
and I got that skinflint Sweeton
to pledge $30,000 to the PD's
Youth Outreach Program.

44
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:28,367
Oh, they are so lucky that you
are organizing that event.

45
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,034
You are amazing.

46
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:31,300
Mm...

47
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:33,034
Uh-huh.

48
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,433
What do you need?

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,667
I just need a slogan
for New Match.

50
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:41,667
So far, your son has
come up with
"Love is Nice,"
and "Love Schmov."

51
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:49,333
"Love is a smoke made with the fumes of sighs;
being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes."

52
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,467
Taylor, that's beautiful.

53
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:51,600
Shakespeare.

54
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,534
Old Bill's always good
or a line.

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,801
Julie left this in my car.

56
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,300
So, um, I was in
the neighborhood,

57
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,600
I thought I'd drop it by
in case you needed it.

58
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,700
Oh, thank you.
I'm going to go
give Ryan some coffee.

59
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,067
Um, I can do that.

60
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,300
Thank you.

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,867
Hello?

62
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,834
(quietly):
Easy, girl.

63
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,500
Taylor, what are you
doing here?

64
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,700
Um, I'm just, uh, bringing
Kirsten some papers.

65
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,168
This is for you.

66
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,934
Oh, thanks, but actually,
I'm kind of not drinking coffee right now.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,867
Oh.

68
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:39,367
Well, Ryan, I just wanted
to thank you again
for helping me
with my husband,

69
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:41,767
and I am...
You don't have
to pay me back.

70
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,134
Are you kidding?

71
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:47,767
If it wasn't for you, I would be in France right now,
trapped in a loveless marriage.

72
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:52,667
You saved my life,
and I am at your command.

73
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,034
Anything you want...
anything.

74
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:03,534
You could hand me
that shirt.

75
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,367
You joker.

76
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,734
Here.

77
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,967
Um, I'm serious.

78
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:12,134
You're not getting out
of this so easily.

79
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:17,901
You know, in some cultures,they say that if you save
someone's life,you're bound to them forever.

80
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,101
Oh.

81
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:24,333
Bye.

82
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,001
Here she comes.

83
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:34,734
You know, it's odd, but I never
appreciated how funny Ryan is.

84
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,801
Life-- such a journey.

85
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,867
Well, have a nice day.

86
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,300
She said Ryan
was funny.

87
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:51,867
(piano and acoustic guitar
strumming gentle melody)

#--Oh, my God.

93
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,801
Wake up! Wake up!
(moans):
Oh, what are you doing?

94
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:37,134
It's almost 8:00.
You have to get out of here
before my daughter wakes up.

95
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,000
Schnell!

96
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, my God.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,367
Are you my new daddy?

98
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,134
Oh, uh, good morning.

99
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,100
I'm, I'm your mom's
personal trainer.

100
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,967
We were just
doing an early
morning workout.

101
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:55,967
Oh, really?

102
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,467
How much do you charge for that?

103
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:58,768
Well...

104
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,200
Save it, okay?

105
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,634
If my mom wants to club five
nights a week, sleep till noon,

106
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:06,167
and hook up with some
25-year-old Bavarian beefcake,

107
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:09,134
it just means she's got
less time for me.

108
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,267
The door is that way, Hans.

109
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:11,501
Okay.

110
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:22,000
Kaitlin...

111
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:26,667
You are having breakfast alone?

112
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:29,267
Yeah, why?
Who else would be here?

113
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:30,868
No one.

114
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,467
Uh, although my new personal
trainer was going to come over.

115
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:36,200
You know, we single women
have to stay in shape.

116
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:38,801
Well, I'm sure he'll give you
a very good workout.

117
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,334
Oh, no.

118
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,467
Seth!

119
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:52,734
Good, you're here.

120
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,167
Actually, I was just,
I was...

121
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:55,567
You might want to sit down.

122
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:58,434
I have huge news
and a favor to ask you.

123
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,401
You like Ryan and you
want my help convincing
him to date you?

124
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:02,834
Wow.

125
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,933
You said he was funny;
that's kind of a giveaway.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,134
I know, it's crazy.

127
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,768
I mean, I've always thought
"Cute guy,

128
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,900
"might be good for a night
of rough-and-tumble fun,

129
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:11,768
but it's not like we have
anything in common."

130
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,501
So ignore it.
It's probably just gas.

131
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,434
But then when he helped me with
my husband and he kissed me,

132
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,401
it was like Dorothy
landing in Oz.

133
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:20,267
Everything just popped
into Technicolor.

134
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,367
Ah.

135
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:24,267
You think I don't know
what that means?

136
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:26,567
I said, "Ah."

137
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:30,434
Meaning, "Ah, that Taylor,
she is so pathetic."

138
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:33,601
Someone's the least bit nice to her
and she becomes totally
obsessed with them.

139
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:37,801
First me, and then her French husband when he lent her
a subway ticket, now Ryan.

140
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,933
Well, you know,
isn't it kind of true?

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,134
So what?

142
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,367
Yes, I have a psychological predilection to become
romantically attached to men who are nice to me

143
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:50,601
due to the fact that I was raised by a she-wolf of a mother
who practiced emotional terrorism.

144
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,300
Does that mean that if by some miracle,
love does come into my life,I should deny it?

145
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,768
What kind of person
would that make me?

146
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:56,834
What kind of life...

147
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,501
Taylor, what do you
want me to do?

148
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,134
Find out if he's ready
to start dating.

149
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,267
Okay.

150
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,000
Hello?

151
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,434
SETH:
Hey, you're doing a great job.

152
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:13,501
RYAN:
Thanks.

153
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,933
Did you finish the movie
last night?

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,167
Uh-huh.
Uh, which one?

155
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,334
Are you ready to date again?

156
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:18,167
What?

157
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,534
Simple question.

158
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:21,300
I have no idea. Why?

159
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,801
Okay, cool.

160
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:25,933
He's not sure.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,768
Listen, you don't want to get involved
with him right now, okay?

162
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,701
He slept like four hours
in the last week.

163
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,467
He's a mess.

164
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:35,367
Really?
Interesting.

165
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,501
Excuse me?

166
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:50,967
Can you not do that now?

167
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,768
Excuse me.

168
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:53,967
Hey, we're supposed
to clean, buddy.

169
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,334
Yeah, and I am in the middle
of something.

170
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,601
What's this one's name?

171
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:57,567
Don't touch that.

172
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,200
They're part
of an experiment.

173
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,067
You're a janitor?
Uh-huh.

174
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,900
Uh, you know, we can just go.

175
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:05,933
Betty, we'll come
back later.

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,033
Yes, Lou, we should go.

177
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:20,734
So you're going to hold the ball gently, okay, like, um,
like you're holding ice cream.

178
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:21,933
I stopped eating
ice cream.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,367
So what do you eat?
Nonfat, non-dairy yogurt.

180
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:26,234
Fine, hold the ball
like nonfat yogurt.

181
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,667
Okay.

182
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,667
But if I serve this one in,
you have to go out with me.

183
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,768
Kaitlin, how many times
I got to say this?

184
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,100
You're 15.

185
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,267
So a kiss is still out
of the question?

186
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:38,200
Just serve the ball.

187
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,601
There it is,
it's over the net.

188
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,667
Well, I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to squeeze me in
for a training session tonight.

189
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,933
Mm-hmm.

190
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:59,067
Easy girl.

191
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:00,234
Hold on a second.

192
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,367
Eye on the ball.
Come on.

193
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:06,000
Kaitlin,
you didn't tell me
you had a new instructor.

194
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:08,300
Hi, I'm Julie Cooper,
Kaitlin's mother.

195
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,534
How you doing?
Spencer.

196
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,601
Uh, your daughter,
she's got a lot of potential.

197
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,434
Mm-hmm.

198
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:17,234
So you play?

199
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,868
Oh, no,
I used to, but...

200
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:24,067
I was actually thinking
about getting back into it.

201
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:25,601
Wow.

202
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,967
Hey. You're early.

203
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:30,300
Well, I wanted to see
the new place up and running...

204
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:31,634
and give you this.
Oh...

205
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:33,334
So Julie already
took off, huh?

206
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,567
She had to pick up
Kaitlin at tennis.

207
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:39,667
Oh, it's a Wonder Woman
paperweight.

208
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:42,401
Seth gave me
his employee discount.

209
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:45,868
Well, it may end up
being a souvenir.

210
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,501
What are you talking about?

211
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,067
Remember that woman that I told you about in Laguna

212
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:51,933
that has a high-end
dating service?

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,100
Yeah, she's going to retire,
sell you her client list.

214
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,734
Well, she got another offer,
four times ours,and right now

215
00:10:56,801 --> 00:11:00,701
we don't have enough money to counter,
which means that all of this could be short-lived.

216
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:02,234
What about taking on a backer?

217
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,067
I could you put in touch with
the donors I've been talking to.

218
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,134
I'm playing golf tomorrow
with Gordon Bullet.

219
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,234
The oil tycoon?
Yeah.

220
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,501
Didn't he go to jail
for tax evasion?

221
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,200
Yeah, but he's out now.

222
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,801
I had dinner with him
last month.

223
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,134
He's really not a bad guy
for being a total pig.

224
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,933
I don't know.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,834
We just wanted to do
this ourselves.

226
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,134
And besides, having
a silent partner,
they always have an opinion.

227
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,801
Well, it's my impression
he's got a lot of fish to fry.

228
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:29,667
So I doubt he'd be involved
in your day-to-day,
but I could ask him.

229
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,267
Okay.

230
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,768
Thanks.

231
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,267
(whispers):
Clear.

232
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,567
Did you find out
what they were
doing with them?

233
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,434
Does it matter?

234
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:57,868
If it wasn't evil,they wouldn't have
to keep them locked in cages like animals.

235
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:58,900
What's the plan again?

236
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:04,134
The plan is to set them loose
and then lead them
to the forest.

237
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,401
The forest, across the river.

238
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,200
Lead them, how?
I brought my flute.

239
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:09,967
Your flute?
Like the Pied Piper?

240
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,801
Uh, no, scientific study shows

241
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:17,734
that music actually triggers a reaction
inside the pleasure center of the rabbit's brain.

242
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:18,868
Check this out.

243
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,967
(quietly):
* Ah... *

244
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,267
Feel his heartbeat.
It's calmer.

245
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,567
It's just to keep them calm.

246
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:28,367
But trust me, as soon as they feel the free air
on their faces,they're going to be leading us.

247
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:29,768
Hi.

248
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,768
You're a fat bunny.

249
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,000
You're name is Pancakes.
Did you know that?

250
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:37,200
Huh? Pancakes.

251
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,067
Hey, come here.

252
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,900
Okay, when I open this door
we've got about 60 seconds till the storm troopers arrive.

253
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,000
You ready to do this?

254
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,067
Yeah.

255
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,334
Welcome to liberty, my friends.

256
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,434
Come on, Pancakes.

257
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,367
Taylor?

258
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,734
Ryan,
you can't sleep, can you?

259
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:20,834
You poor thing.

260
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,067
It's 3:00 in the morning.

261
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:24,801
Seth told me everything.

262
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:29,000
But lucky for you, junior year,
I won the state science fair
for my study in sleep disorders.

263
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,067
I can help you.

264
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:33,334
Oh, well, that's really nice,
but actually, you know,I'm fine.

265
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:35,200
It's the middle of the night,
and you're wide awake.

266
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:36,567
So are you.

267
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,467
Well, I never sleep
more than four hours a night.

268
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:42,534
It's unproductive.
Ryan, don't you see, this is
how I'll pay you back.

269
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:43,734
Yeah. You know what?

270
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:44,967
Actually, I'm kind of tired.

271
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,467
Stop lying.

272
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,734
I want you to meet me tomorrow
morning at 8:00, at the diner.

273
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:50,167
And I won't take no
for an answer.

274
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:52,868
Fine.

275
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,401
Ryan?

276
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,467
Yeah?

277
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,300
Good night.

278
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,768
Good night, Taylor.

279
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:33,867
--Okay, just relax.

280
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,234
Be normal.

281
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:37,668
You can do this.

282
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:42,900
Good morning, Ryan.

283
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,134
Hi.

284
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,034
Oh, you poor thing.
You look exhausted.

285
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,701
Yeah, well, look, Taylor,
I don't know what Seth told
you, but I'm fine, really.

286
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:51,034
I've got work, so...
Did you sleep
at all last night?

287
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,000
No, but, uh...
And how about
the night before?

288
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:58,301
Ryan, insomnia can
go on for months.

289
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,501
What's the harm in letting me
try and help you?

290
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,167
Fire away.

291
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:07,668
Okay. So, um, first off...

292
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,967
How much of this is
related to Marissa?

293
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,467
I'm really sorry to ask,

294
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:15,567
but if that's what's going on,
I think we need to know.

295
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, I need to know.

296
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,833
It's not about her.

297
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,167
It started after Thanksgiving.

298
00:15:20,234 --> 00:15:22,601
Hmm.

299
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,734
Right after Volchok
turned himself in?

300
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,200
Yeah, I guess, why?

301
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,267
Ryan, I'm just
spit-balling here...

302
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,634
Yeah, yeah.

303
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:33,167
But, um, this is the guy you
wanted revenge on, right?

304
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:35,634
So you probably went to
bed every night thinking,

305
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,301
"I'll get him tomorrow."

306
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:39,967
But now that
purpose is gone,

307
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:44,867
so what's the point in going to bed
if there's no point in waking up?

308
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,167
I hadn't thought about that.

309
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:47,367
Oh, my God.

310
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:50,134
I am such an awesome
sleep therapist.

311
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,867
And this is
only our first session.

312
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:54,867
Yeah, listen, I better go.

313
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,134
Yes.

314
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,933
But, uh, thanks.
This was, uh...

315
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:03,768
Good.

316
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,501
Well, my pleasure.

317
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,334
(whispers):
Bye.

318
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,867
You ready?

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,434
Nice shot, Julie.

320
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,933
Thank you, Spencer.

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,900
You know, this is supposed
to be my tennis lesson.

322
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,634
Don't you think it's fun
to do mother-daughter stuff?

323
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,734
Please.

324
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:50,067
Come on, keep your eye
on the ball, Kaitlin.
Let's go.

325
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:57,301
Bring it back, up,
and very nice.

326
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,534
Back, up and...

327
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,768
Very nice.
Mm-hmm.

328
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:09,134
Do you mind?

329
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,367
It's the third time.

330
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:11,267
Sorry.

331
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:18,501
Ow. Ooh.

332
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,167
Are you all right?

333
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,401
This will help
with the serve.
Right.

334
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,234
I think I really strained it.

335
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,634
I'm strong.

336
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,501
SPENCER:
You are strong.
I'm pretty impressed.

337
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,100
JULIE:
Ooh, perfect.

338
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,634
Where's my racket?

339
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:44,167
Oh, that's weird.

340
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,467
You know,
I'm ready when you are.

341
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:50,501
Well, I get that she did a fine job
in that whole Middle East thing,

342
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,301
but I'm sorry,
Madeline Albright-- not hot.

343
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:54,501
Well, Gordon...

344
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,501
I told you
to call me Bullet.

345
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,301
Well, Bullet,
call me crazy,

346
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:00,867
but maybe Madeline Albright
doesn't need to be hot.

347
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, well, that's an interesting
point of view, Sandy.

348
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:05,900
Hey, your donation to the PD's
Outreach Program
was really generous, thank you.

349
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,634
Oh, well, you caught me
at the right time.

350
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:09,234
I was in bed with
those Arab fellas.

351
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,967
That's a metaphor.

352
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:14,434
Them boys cooked
the books on me,
so I sold out.

353
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:16,334
Left them high and dry.

354
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,000
They never should have messed
with old Bullet.

355
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:18,601
Bang.

356
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:19,867
All righty.

357
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,401
Look at that.

358
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,634
Shii-ite Muslim.

359
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:30,800
You see, the point is,
I'm cash-rich right now,

360
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:33,334
and I don't know
what to do with
all the stuff.

361
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,434
Really?

362
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,434
Cigar?

363
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,167
No, thanks.
They're Cuban.

364
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,734
Commie bastards do
one thing right.

365
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,301
You know, my wife just
started a business,

366
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,367
and she and her partner
are thinking about
taking on investors.

367
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:46,434
In fact, you could talk to them about it tomorrow at the benefit--
you know, get the details.

368
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, I don't think I'm
going tomorrow, Sandy.

369
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,167
You see, my date went
back to her husband.

370
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:52,467
I'm going to do you a favor.

371
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:56,167
You should talk to my wife,because that's the business she's in,
and her partner is newly single.

372
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,900
She hot?

373
00:18:60,000 --> 00:19:02,867
And I was into recycling
way before it was cool.

374
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,900
Al Gore got half that stuff
from a paper I wrote in sixth grade.

375
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:10,000
I just don't, you know, make a stink,
because he's doing good work.

376
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,800
Well, when are you allowed
to call Summer again?

377
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,301
10:03 tomorrow.
Am I driving you crazy?
No, no.

378
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:17,800
Hi, Seth. Ryan,
I need your keys.
I have to get
your room ready.

379
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:18,967
What?

380
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,734
Oh, I'm Ryan's
sleep therapist.

381
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Right.

382
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:25,367
Uh, that's your tacos.

383
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,567
Because you can't.
Why not?

384
00:19:32,634 --> 00:19:35,933
I did not tell you about
Ryan's sleep problems,
so you could use it for
some weirdo seduction.

385
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
I'm not...
Are you a sleep therapist?
Are you certified?

386
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,267
Sleep ther... Do you
have a little certificate

387
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:42,768
from the American Institute
of... uh, the sleep place?

388
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,668
And what if I can help him?
He wins, I win.
They call it win-win
for a reason.

389
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:46,900
It doesn't matter.
You can't.

390
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,100
Just say what you're really
thinking, Seth.

391
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,100
RYAN:
Hey...

392
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,800
Everything okay?

393
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:51,800
Yeah.
Great.

394
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,567
Could you go get me some
pico de gallo?

395
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:56,067
Yeah. Sure.

396
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,800
It's true--
you don't think I'm good enough.
That's crazy.

397
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,601
--"Oh, Taylor, she's so funny,
what a kook,but her and Ryan, please."

398
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,601
You need help,
do you know that?

399
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:06,800
"I mean,
she's no Marissa."

400
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,501
Exactly.

401
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,301
Here you go.

402
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,833
Thanks, I've got to get
back to the shop.

403
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,334
TAYLOR: Yeah,
I better go, too.

404
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:18,634
Hey, Amber.
Did Seth..."?

405
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,768
Your boyfriend didn't call.

406
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,668
I thought he was
giving you space.

407
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:25,367
Uh... he is. It doesn't mean
that I can't call him.

408
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,634
Oldest trick in the book.

409
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:29,668
I'm giving you space
so you can call first
and look like the needy one.

410
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,434
Seth isn't doing that.

411
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,567
Of course not. Oh, but
the dean's office called.

412
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:34,933
They want to see you tomorrow.

413
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,167
What?
Did they say what for?

414
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:38,800
No.

415
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:42,434
Hey, did you hear that someone
set free the bunnies
in one of the science labs?

416
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:45,267
Huh, really?

417
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:47,267
Well, maybe someone
thought it was inhumane.

418
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,668
Maybe someone didn't know
they were only being studied

419
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:53,634
for their socialization patterns
and lived a pretty cushy life.

420
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:56,734
By the way,
there's a rabbit
under your bed.

421
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:00,334
Che.

422
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:01,501
I got the call, too.

423
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,634
That scientist picked us
out of a face book.

424
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:06,234
Apparently the chiseled
features of freedom,
not that hard to recognize.

425
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:08,367
What are you going to do?
Breathe, caterpillar.

426
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,467
It's all going to be okay.

427
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,933
I went through the same exact thing

428
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
when they tried to frame me for
flooding the trustee dinner.

429
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,134
But you did flood
the trustees' dinner.

430
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,167
Yeah, but they didn't know that.
Flax and Oats?

431
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,467
I don't think I can lie.

432
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:20,867
Of course you can't.

433
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:25,668
No more than the wind
could lie,or a tree.

434
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,867
Oh...
I have to go write a song.

435
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:34,334
I just came by to tell you that I am
with you until the end.

436
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,267
But, Che,
what if they kick us out?

437
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:41,567
Then in the words
of the great Chief Aupumut--

438
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:46,334
I will sing my death song and
die like a warrior going home.

439
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,768
(Native American chanting)

440
00:21:58,601 --> 00:21:59,867
Pancakes.

441
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:05,867
I thought
we were going
to the beach.

442
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:09,301
In a minute. I just want him
to see me in my bikini first.

443
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,967
You mean you want him
to molest you.

444
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:14,134
All right, shut up.
I have real feelings
for this guy...

445
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,800
Oh, my God.

446
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:20,301
Wow, looks like
your mom has some
feelings, too--

447
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:21,467
for that guy's butt.

448
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:25,800
Dude, why are you talking about that guy's butt? 
Shut up.

449
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:27,634
You're so gay
sometimes.

450
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,467
Oh, my God.

451
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,900
Welcome home, Ryan.

452
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,301
Taylor.

453
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,534
Taylor, Taylor.

454
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:58,501
This, um...
Are you wearing pajamas?

455
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:02,567
Oh, yes.
Many people sleep better
with a warm body beside them.

456
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:04,501
Don't worry.
It's completely non-sexual.

457
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:05,734
Yeah.

458
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,167
I've got to ask, though.

459
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:10,601
Is this...

460
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:13,200
I mean, you don't,
you don't like me, do you?

461
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,567
Um...

462
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:17,900
Yeah, I like you.
We're friends.

463
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:19,301
No, I mean,
the, um...

464
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,167
Oh.

465
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:24,668
Oh...

466
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:25,668
My goodness, no.

467
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:28,501
No, no, no, no, no.

468
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:31,167
I just, you know, I want
to pay you back and, um...

469
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:33,367
I happen to be really interested
in sleep disorders.

470
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:38,967
Okay.

471
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,200
Great. Shall we start
with a massage?

472
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:52,600
#--Oh!

473
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:53,301
Whoa!

474
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:55,134
What the...?

475
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,700
Hey, what are you doing here?

476
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,634
Me? What are you doing here?

477
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,967
Uh, bringing Ryan coffee,
and I live here.

478
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:03,134
Did you stay the night?

479
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,500
No.

480
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,767
Well, yeah, kind of.

481
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,600
Can I just have
one of these?

482
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,067
You didn't put any
sweetener in, did you?

483
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:13,467
'Cause I read that aspartame
can cause brain tumors

484
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:14,867
quicker than you can say
Jack Robinson. Hey.

485
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:16,001
Taylor.

486
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:18,134
I was just helping Ryan
with his sleep.

487
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,500
Have you seen him?
He was gone when I woke up.

488
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,967
Hey! I went for a jog. Uh...

489
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,834
Oh.

490
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:27,167
Yeah.

491
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,368
It's, uh, this isn't
what it looks like.

492
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:30,967
Totally.

493
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:31,834
Yeah, you know...

494
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:33,067
Well, kind of.

495
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:35,700
We did sleep in the same bed.

496
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,400
No, actually, uh, you slept
in the bed.

497
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:38,967
I was reading in
the chair all night.

498
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,600
This is too weird
for this early in the morning.

499
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:41,867
I'm just going to... here.

500
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,667
Well, that was good.

501
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:53,767
So you really didn't
sleep at all?

502
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,334
Is it because I snored?

503
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,834
My mom always wanted me
to get an operation
for a deviated septum.

504
00:24:58,901 --> 00:24:59,901
You didn't snore.

505
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:03,500
We should talk about what happened
so I can adjust the plan for tonight.

506
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,634
Taylor, look, I appreciate
everything you've done.

507
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,867
I really do.

508
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:08,667
And I think you're probably
right about Volchok.

509
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:13,967
But I also think it's something
I need to go through on my own.

510
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,034
So let's call it even, okay?

511
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:18,368
Okay.

512
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,433
All right.

513
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,368
I'm going to go jump
in the pool.

514
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,534
--So what, Sandy just served me up
like a piece of meat?

515
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:41,033
How rich is he?

516
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,033
5:00 will be fine.

517
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:46,134
Hi, honey.

518
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,768
You going on a date?

519
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:51,067
Yes, I'm going to Sandy's delinquent benefit
with a man called"The Bullet."

520
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,501
Apparently,
he owns Texas.

521
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,567
Oh, well, that sounds like fun.

522
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:59,300
Um, do you think Mr. Cohen
would mind if I crashed?

523
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:02,300
Yeah, I think
that'd be okay.

524
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,933
I'll have to leave you
some cab money.

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,501
Well, what if I invited
a friend who drives?

526
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,134
That works, too.

527
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,567
It's nice to see you
interested in charity.

528
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,501
That's me.

529
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:22,801
Ms. Roberts, the reason
we called you in today...

530
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:23,834
I helped free the bunnies.

531
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,567
I didn't know that they were only
being studied
for how they interacted.

532
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:29,100
I know it doesn't excuse it.

533
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,434
Well, the board
appreciates
your candor.

534
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:34,267
Can you tell us
who else was involved?

535
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:36,067
No, I'm sorry.

536
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:37,967
I see.

537
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:41,100
There have been other acts of
political activism this semester

538
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,434
that cross the line of legality:

539
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,134
An incident at the Board
of Trustees Dinner...

540
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,567
I wasn't involved in that.

541
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:49,067
Do you know who was?

542
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:57,134
Ms. Roberts, the severity of your punishment
will be influenced by how
cooperative you are today.

543
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,768
Dean-- other deans,
I really, really love Brown.

544
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:07,300
I have changed so much here.

545
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:10,200
But I'm afraid if I tell you
who did those other things,

546
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:14,701
then I'd be betraying
the new me,
and I can't do that.

547
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:19,200
One final question.

548
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,367
There is still
one rabbit missing.

549
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:22,834
I don't know anything
about that.

550
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,033
Taylor, did you take
my lip gloss

551
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,534
with the bee pheromones in it?

552
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:30,868
It's on the dresser.

553
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,434
Are you okay?

554
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:33,768
Yeah, peachy.

555
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:36,900
(sighs )... Talk.

556
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:40,768
Okay, what do you do
when you like a boy

557
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:43,167
and he barely knows
you're alive

558
00:27:43,234 --> 00:27:45,701
and you already pretended
to be his sleep therapist

559
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:48,033
and... I'm out of options?

560
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,933
Okay.

561
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,734
Well, this may sound
a little weird,

562
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:57,768
but try dressing up fabulous
and going to a place where you
know you'll run into him.

563
00:27:57,834 --> 00:28:00,334
That's it?

564
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:01,567
That's it.

565
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:03,200
That really works?

566
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,567
Almost every time.

567
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:11,134
And I mean,touching his arm when you guys are talking
is always good and dancing and body contact.

568
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,467
And laugh at his jokes.

569
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,367
I mean, even if they're
not that funny.

570
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:16,601
Ooh, I-I do that already.

571
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,167
Okay, what else?

572
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:22,100
You could walk in front of him,
I mean, if he's a butt guy.

573
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,234
I don't know
if he's a butt guy.

574
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,367
Well, it can't hurt.

575
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:26,734
I mean, girl,
you've got a great butt.

576
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:28,933
You are such a sweetie.

577
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,300
Tell me more.

578
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,634
SANDY:
I just want to thank you again

579
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:35,100
on behalf of the entire
Public Defender's Office.

580
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,334
So please, drink, dance
and have a great time.

581
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:38,534
Thank you.

582
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,967
Hello.

583
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:48,234
This is wonderful.

584
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,467
Thank you.

585
00:28:49,534 --> 00:28:51,801
So how's Julie and
The Bullet doing?

586
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,434
See for yourself.

587
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:56,834
So there was this big,
white-tailed Texas deer
coming across there,

588
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,200
so I wheel around like
Dick Cheney and go... bang!

589
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:01,768
Oh!
(laughing)

590
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,601
I got him. Bang!

591
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:31,467
Hello, Ryan.

592
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:32,267
Taylor, hi.

593
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:33,300
You look, um...

594
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:34,801
I look nice?

595
00:29:34,868 --> 00:29:36,868
Nice, yeah, that's the word
I was looking for.

596
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:37,967
Well, so do you.

597
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,834
Would you like
to dance?

598
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,567
Actually, I'm not much
of a dancer.

599
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:43,501
It's probably shocking.

600
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,467
Maybe the exercise
will tire you out.

601
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,134
Not that this is therapy.

602
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,567
No, we're not doing
that anymore.

603
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:51,167
It's just,
you know, fun.

604
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:54,801
Yeah, okay.

605
00:29:54,868 --> 00:29:55,834
Okay.

606
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,734
Whew.

607
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:09,267
Okay, just a second.

608
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,900
He wants to talk numbers Monday.

609
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:14,701
Who?
The Bullet.

610
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:15,801
He's getting drinks.

611
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:17,768
But he's in, Kiki.
He loves New Match.

612
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:18,667
That's great.

613
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,534
I know.

614
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,067
Mom.

615
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:22,601
Kaitlin.

616
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,933
Look at who I brought with me.

617
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,900
What are you doing here?

618
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:30,167
You said your mom
told you to bring me.

619
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:33,334
Uh, Julie, what's going on?

620
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:34,434
Is that your date?

621
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:39,567
You and I will talk later.

622
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:40,667
Bullet, this is...

623
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:41,601
What the hell are you doing
here, boy?

624
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:43,501
You know each other?

625
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:45,434
You're on a date with my dad?

626
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:46,367
What?

627
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:47,167
What?

628
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:48,067
Oh, God.

629
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:55,868
You ditching
my party already?

630
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:58,567
I was thinking
about calling Summer.

631
00:30:58,634 --> 00:31:01,067
I'm not supposed to call her
until 10:03,

632
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:05,601
but technically,
it is 10:03 on the East Coast,
so that's not cheating, is it?

633
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:06,967
Sorry, Seth.

634
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,300
I'd say, yeah,
that'd be cheating.

635
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,634
Hey, did I see Taylor leaving
the pool house this morning?

636
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:16,367
Yeah, she's pretending
to be Ryan's sleep therapist
so he falls in love
with her.

637
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:17,868
That's new.

638
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,868
That'd explain the way
they're dancing in there.

639
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,067
I hope it works out.

640
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:24,933
You're supporting
this seduction plot?

641
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,234
Well, you don't have
to be a shrink
to see that Ryan's still
working through things.

642
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,000
You know, I think
he could use the
human connection.

643
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:34,667
Yeah, but those two...
I don't know.

644
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:36,933
Well, they're not the most
obvious couple,

645
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,267
but then neither were you
and Summer once upon a time.

646
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:43,834
And Taylor thinks
Ryan is funny.

647
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We-we did not hate you.

648
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:05,167
Oh, you totally hated me.

649
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:08,267
Come on, you were
probably the president
of the "We Hate Taylor Club."

650
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:09,501
I was the secretary.

651
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:10,933
I took the notes.

652
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,267
Ryan, you made
a real joke.

653
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:13,768
Yeah, well,
a pretty bad one.

654
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:15,067
But I made a real joke.

655
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,000
Thank you,
but don't tell anyone.

656
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:22,033
(music stops)
Oh.

657
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,000
You want a drink?

658
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,000
That'd be nice.

659
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:30,334
Okay.

660
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,234
Hey.
Hey.

661
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,300
I saw you dancing
with Taylor.

662
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, is that look
supposed to mean
something or...?

663
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:40,334
Crazier things have happened.

664
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,200
Nothing I can recall
this instant, but...

665
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:43,900
Okay, I don't think so.
Ask yourself why.

666
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:45,167
She's smart, she's funny.

667
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:46,634
Dude, just forget
about it, okay?

668
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,834
I'm not going
to date Taylor.

669
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:53,100
Um, I was just...

670
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:58,634
Excuse me.

671
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:11,400
--Taylor, Taylor, Taylor...
Hold on, let me explain.

672
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:13,701
Oh, I think you were
pretty clear, Ryan.

673
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:17,034
And, yes, I lied when you asked
me if I liked you.

674
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
But...

675
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,901
What was I even thinking?

676
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,068
I mean, you and me...

677
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,334
I must be totally crazy.

678
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,667
You're not crazy, okay?

679
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:29,601
Ryan, I pretended to be
a sleep therapist to seduce you.

680
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,100
That was crazy.

681
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:34,701
Don't worry, because I'm sure
next week I'll be totally
obsessed with some guy who
gives me change for parking.

682
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:37,267
Look, what I said has absolutely
nothing to do with you, okay?

683
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:39,734
It's just...
What?

684
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,233
That for the longest time all
you could feel was your desire

685
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,901
to kill Volchok,now that's gone,so you feel empty.

686
00:33:44,968 --> 00:33:47,133
You can't feel anything,
least of all anything for me.

687
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,133
How do you keep doing that?

688
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Doing what?

689
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:53,300
That-- you keep telling me
what I'm thinking
before I feel it.

690
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,734
Because I think about you.

691
00:33:55,801 --> 00:34:00,233
You know, I want you to be happy, and I think that

692
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,434
if you gave it a chance,
you might feel something, too.

693
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,601
Taylor...

694
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,467
Are you going to tell me that
you really like me as a friend?

695
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:11,901
Maybe.

696
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,801
How does she do that?

697
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:21,434
Do you have any idea what
you just did in there?

698
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,034
Screwed up things with
your new boyfriend?

699
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,634
Thought you were all,
"I'm off men.

700
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:26,400
I'm going to start focusing
on the new business."

701
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:27,534
That was about
business, Kaitlin.

702
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:30,667
That man was going
to give us money,
money that we need.

703
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,267
Then why'd you have to
hook up with Spencer?

704
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:34,834
I mean, couldn't you see
that I liked him?

705
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:37,467
He's ten years older than you,
and no, I couldn't see that.

706
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,734
Well, I was
flirting with him.

707
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:40,601
You flirt with everybody.
So do you.

708
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:41,901
You're 15 years old.

709
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:43,634
And you're my mother.

710
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:45,601
I don't have to see guys
sneaking down the stairs

711
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,801
while I'm trying
to eat breakfast.

712
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:50,867
It makes me
want to barf.
That...

713
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:53,500
That is completely fair.

714
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:56,434
Oh, my God, honey.
What is wrong with me?

715
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,934
I am so sorry.

716
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:00,701
It's okay.

717
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,667
Just try to pick one guy.

718
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,133
One that I don't like.

719
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,334
How did you know that
Spencer was Bullet's son?

720
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,334
I didn't.

721
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,767
It was just coincidence?

722
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:14,801
That's weird.

723
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:23,367
Summer, hey.
What are you doing?

724
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:24,667
Waiting for you.

725
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:28,400
Have you been talking
to the board this whole time?

726
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:32,801
Summer, have I accomplished
anything this semester?

727
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,267
Are you kidding?

728
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,667
Che, there would be no political
activism at Brown without you.

729
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:39,400
Oh, my God, are you
getting kicked out?

730
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,667
No, no, but I think
you might be.

731
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:42,901
What?

732
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:45,500
Yeah, they needed a scapegoat.

733
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:48,133
You said yourself,
I'm too important
to the movement, so...

734
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,534
What did you tell them, Che?

735
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:52,734
Uh, just that you flooded
the trustee's dinner,

736
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:56,534
and disabled the maintenance
vehicles in October...

737
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:58,968
And, well, there's
a whole list of stuff.

738
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,334
I was only going to say
a couple, but then, you know,

739
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,701
I thought, if Summer's
going down anyways...

740
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:04,667
may as well have her
go down in style.

741
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:07,334
Well, Che, you did all of those
things and I protected you.

742
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,601
I know.

743
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,233
And the movement will
never forget it.

744
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,901
Shut up about the movement,
okay?

745
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:13,068
This is not Cuba.

746
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:15,100
We are in college.
We have dining cards.

747
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,567
I'm going to get kicked out.
Caterpillar.

748
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,167
No, okay, don't call me that.
Okay, just stay away from me.

749
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,233
Well, fine.

750
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,867
Fine.
You'll have your money tomorrow.

751
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,334
Senators.

752
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,934
Well, if it's not
the little pot stirrer.

753
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,467
Have you seen my idiot son?

754
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:35,567
He's probably somewhere banging
his head against the wall.

755
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:38,068
Dude, no one cares
that he's your son.

756
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:39,701
You should invest in
my mother's business.

757
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,634
Or what?
You going to tell everyone

758
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:45,233
what a meanie old Bullet is
and I'm going to have
to sit alone at lunch?

759
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
Oh, boo-hoo, boo-hoo.

760
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:47,801
My mother is awesome.

761
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,767
She ran the Newport Group.

762
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,934
And when she broke up with her
fiancee, she got his house.

763
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,867
She'll make you
a lot of money.

764
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,634
Already got a lot
of money, squirt.

765
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:58,133
Just thought it might
be some fun.

766
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,701
Well, if that's all
you're in for,

767
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:04,968
then knowing my mother,
will be the best investment
you've ever made.

768
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:09,233
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

769
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:15,434
Tired?

770
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,534
Exhausted.

771
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,567
Hey, how'd it go
with the Bullet?

772
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:22,167
Well, as it turns out, Julie was
dating his 25-year-old son.

773
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:24,233
Ooh.
That's a weird coincidence.

774
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,233
That about sums it up.

775
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,267
Sandy, mind if I borrow
your wife for a second?

776
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:31,133
Come on, blondie,
I won't bite.

777
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:39,001
Hey, you ready to go home?

778
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:40,100
Yeah. Where's Spencer?

779
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:44,100
I figured you guys
would have made up
and he'd be showing you
his half volley.

780
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,767
I told him it's over and that
if he ever came near you again,

781
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:49,167
I would crush him.

782
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,367
KIRSTEN:
Julie?
We're back on.

783
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,634
Bullet wants to come by
the office on Monday.

784
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:54,767
What?

785
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,467
Apparently Kaitlin can
be quite persuasive.

786
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,434
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

787
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,267
Yeah, I got game.

788
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:03,267
Mm-hmm.

789
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:04,801
You want to get some ice cream?

790
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,734
I stopped eating.

791
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:07,968
What the hell.

792
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:10,167
The guy at the ice cream
store is so hot.

793
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:11,901
That's my girl.

794
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,534
Well, close enough.

795
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,068
TAYLOR:
Seth.

796
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,734
Taylor, what are you
doing in here?

797
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:29,968
When I had really bad insomnia
last year,a Chinese doctor gave me this herbal tea.

798
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:31,834
And I thought it might
help Ryan sleep.

799
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:35,200
I would have given it to him before,
but I was trying to seduce him.

800
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:37,601
So...
So why can't you just
give it to him?

801
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,534
Because I'm too embarrassed.

802
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:41,300
You were totally right.

803
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:45,634
Here I am, getting a divorce,
I'm living like a refugee at Julie's.

804
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,667
Ryan's nice to me
so I fall for him?

805
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:49,367
It's just totally pathetic.

806
00:38:49,434 --> 00:38:52,367
Just please give that to him.

807
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:54,934
Wow, I never thought
I'd see you quitting.

808
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:00,400
Well, it's completely hopeless,
Seth. You heard him.

809
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,901
Yeah, I know, just you're
rolling over like an old dog.

810
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,200
Not the Taylor I remember.

811
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:08,167
Are you seriously trying
to Jedi mind trick me?

812
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:09,434
Taylor Townsend, quitter.

813
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,634
I guess I'll just have
to get used to that.

814
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,034
Fine.

815
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:25,934
Hello.

816
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:27,968
Hey.

817
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,434
Hey. Summer, I was just about
to call you.

818
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,934
Oh, you were?
Yeah.

819
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,300
I wanted to call you, but I
didn't want to seem needy.

820
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,200
Are you kidding? I been wanting
to call you all week.

821
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,734
Seth, you still love me, right?

822
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:41,300
Of course I do.
What's going on?

823
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:46,200
Well...

824
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,034
I got a rabbit.

825
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,133
Okay.

826
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,167
What's its name?

827
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:55,068
Wait, no, let me guess.

828
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,133
Is it Cyclotron?
No.

829
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,367
Are you lying?

830
00:39:58,434 --> 00:40:01,767
Is it, uh, Gorgon
the Destroyer of Carrots?

831
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,467
(giggling):
No.

832
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,167
Is it Larry?

833
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:06,233
Larry?

834
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,667
You're not Larry.

835
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:16,567
Hi.

836
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:18,434
Hey.

837
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,100
Um, I brought you some tea.

838
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,133
I'm not trying to be
your therapist again.

839
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,667
I just thought it might
help you sleep.

840
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:26,133
Oh, thanks.

841
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,334
Oh, God, what am I doing.

842
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,767
Wait, hold on.
Look, I've got to say something.

843
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:36,767
Um...

844
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:41,068
I think you've got this idea
that you're this strange person
that has to trick people
into liking you.

845
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,100
That's not true.

846
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:43,167
You're, um...

847
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,367
You're amazing.

848
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:50,767
Oh, my God.
You just did it to me.

849
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:51,901
Did what?

850
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,467
You said exactly what
I was feeling.

851
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:57,068
Well, except
for the amazing part.

852
00:40:57,133 --> 00:41:00,400
Well, it's true.

853
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:02,734
Honestly, you know, I wish
I did feel something.

854
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:06,500
Kiss me.

855
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,001
Uh, what?

856
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,068
I think there's something there.

857
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,968
And I think that if you kiss me
you'll feel it, too.

858
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:14,367
I think we already did that.

859
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,001
Nope, uh-uh.

860
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:17,534
You kissed me,
I didn't kiss you.

861
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,968
Come on.

862
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:22,867
Just... If you don't
feel anything,
I will never mention it again.

863
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:25,068
That's the best
deal you'll ever get.

864
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,233
Ask Seth.
