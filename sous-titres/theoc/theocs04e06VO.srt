1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
What the hell you doing here,boy?

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,600
You're on a date with my dad?

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,800
You know each other?
Kiss me.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,700
-Uh, what?
-If you don't feel anything,

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,400
I will never mention it again.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,200
One kiss.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:46,410
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,300
What's cooking, Ryan?

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,900
SANDY:
Hey, Ryan?

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,300
Ryan?

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,800
I shmeared it for you.

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,400
Thanks.

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Is everything okay?

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Yeah.

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,600
I'm just gonna go see
if Seth's up.

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,900
I am up, and I'm out of here.

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,100
What? Where you going?

19
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,300
I didn't know you
were planning a trip.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,300
Neither did Summer, but

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,700
RISD sent my dorm info,

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,100
so I figured I'd
check out my new home

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,500
and give her some moral

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,600
support for finals.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,300
Are you gonna eat that?

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,700
Are you sure that's

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,400
such a good idea?

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
Why, did Ryan do
something to it?

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,300
No, not the bagel,

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,700
the trip-- I thought
you were gonna give Summer

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,600
some more space.

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
Well, a little space turned

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,200
into a lot of missing me.

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,300
That's my cab.

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,700
E-mail me a Christmukkah list.

36
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,500
I'm gonna be shopping
at the Providence Place Mall.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,600
They have carpeting,

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,400
which is weird.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,500
They have a Dave & Buster's,

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,100
but parking sucks.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,500
Listen, dude, I really

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,600
need to talk to you--
it's very important.

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,900
Okay, and I want to
hear all about it

44
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,600
when I land in Providence.
Just call me.

45
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,400
Call me.

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,800
So we've had a chance to

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
review your situation,

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
and the board has come

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,800
to a unanimous decision.

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,300
Effective immediately,

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,200
you are suspended

52
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,400
from this university

53
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,500
until next fall.

54
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Suspended?

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,500
Breaking into that lab

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
was very serious.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,700
If it wasn't for your

58
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,900
excellent record,

59
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,800
the board might have

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,900
involved the police.

61
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,300
I'm sorry, um, I'm just not sure

62
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,500
what I'm supposed to do now.

63
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,300
It's done.

64
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,200
You can go to the dorm

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,100
and start packing.

66
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,700
But I have finals, and friends.

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
I'm afraid you're no

68
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,900
longer a student here.

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,700
But my dad is living in Seattle

70
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,600
with the step-monste

71
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,700
And Taylor Townsend

72
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,300
is sleeping in my old bed.

73
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,900
And Seth was moving out here
so we could be together.

74
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,700
Ms. Roberts,
you need to go home.

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
This is my home.

76
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,300
California, here we come

77
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,600
Right back where
we started from

78
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
California...

79
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
California...

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
It's just you and me now.

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,300
Summer Bear.

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,700
So, I heard
the iron fist of justice

83
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,100
came crashing down on you

84
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,600
swiftly, without mercy.

85
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,700
Yep. Sounds like your plan

86
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,900
worked out perfectly.

87
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,300
Oh, come on, that's not fair.

88
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
Back at the reservation,

89
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,900
they taught us,

90
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,000
sometimes the weaker gazelle

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,900
must be devoured
for the good of the herd.

92
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,400
Oh, Che, just shut up, okay?

93
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,700
Before I tie you up
with hemp

94
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,500
rope, set you on fire,

95
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,700
and get high off the fumes

96
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,800
from your burning flesh.

97
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,600
Dark.

98
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,300
Mm.

99
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,500
I think the fact that

100
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
you would use hemp

101
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,500
proved that I have made a
difference

102
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,200
in your life.

103
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,300
Yeah, Che, you have.

104
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,500
You got me thrown out of school.

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
You know,
I really liked this place.

106
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,900
I liked
who I was becoming at it.

107
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,000
I mean, this was my life.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,700
And you sacrificed it for the

109
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,200
good of the... the-the cause.

110
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,100
You're a martyr.
You're a hero.

111
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,400
I just wanted to be a student.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now if you'll excuse me,

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,100
I have to find my roommate

114
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,800
and tell her that
she now has a single.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,300
Are you dirty, Ryan?

116
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,900
KIRSTEN:
Ryan?

117
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,700
Hello?

118
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,500
Hey.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,100
I-I couldn't help but notice
that you

120
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,200
wanted to talk to Seth.

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,300
Oh, did I?

122
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,600
Well, since he's
out of town

123
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,700
and he's gonna be
moving out next semester,

124
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,200
you're gonna need a new Seth.

125
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't tell Sandy, but...

126
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,600
I thought I would audition

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,100
for the job.

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,700
Oh, uh, yeah, well, that's,

129
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,400
uh, very thoughtful.

130
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,300
So... how does it work?

131
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,300
Do I ask you
what's on your mind?

132
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,900
Uh, usually you talk
about yourself,

133
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,500
and I solve my
problems on my own.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
I've noticed that you've been

135
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,100
spending time with Taylor.

136
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,000
Rea... Have I?

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,500
If we're gonna talk
about girls,

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
I am a far more knowledgeable

139
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,600
resource than my son.

140
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,300
Okay. But you can't
repeat this, all right?

141
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,500
Because if the real
Seth found out

142
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,600
I was telling the substitute

143
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Seth a real secret...

144
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
It's in the vault.

145
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,900
Okay.

146
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I kissed Taylor.

147
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Or she kissed me.

148
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,900
Anyway, there was
a kiss, and, uh...

149
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,700
And now you can't stop
thinking about her.

150
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,300
Pretty much.

151
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,400
That is so cute.

152
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
Okay, Seth never
does that.

153
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,300
Sorry.

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
But it is, and so is she.

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,900
Yeah, I know, it's
just... me and Taylor?

156
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,400
After everything
you've been through

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
over the last few months,

158
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,800
if something good happens,

159
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
shouldn't you embrace it?

160
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
Or at least be open

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to the possibility?

162
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,900
You're right.

163
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,900
You're right. Thanks.

164
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,700
Okay.

165
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,600
So do I get the job?

166
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,700
You're on the short list.

167
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,600
Spencer, what brings you

168
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,500
to Casa de Cooper?

169
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,300
Your racket.

170
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,600
You restrung it for me.

171
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,400
That's so sweet.

172
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,400
Yeah, I went with
the Pro-Flex Fiber Tour.

173
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,600
It should, uh... it should
cut down on the tension.

174
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,400
Good, because I've been having
a lot of stress lately.

175
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,000
I could use a little bit
of... relaxing.

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,300
String tension, Kaitlin.

177
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Well, now that you
and my mom are over,

178
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
maybe you can help me
with my stroke.

179
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,600
Yeah, right.

180
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Look, you got a great
backhand, but, uh,

181
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,500
no offense, I kind of have

182
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,700
a "no jail bait" policy.

183
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,800
Lame.

184
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,600
You know, maybe you
should try, uh,

185
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,900
try meeting guys
from your school.

186
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,800
-You mean boys?
-Exactly. Yeah, because

187
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
you're in high school.

188
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,900
You know, that place with desks

189
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,000
and chalkboards and kids.

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
Those are people
your own age.

191
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,200
I don't know, maybe...

192
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,300
maybe you should try
hanging out with them.

193
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,600
TAYLOR:Hi, Ryan.

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,800
I got to go, can't talk.

195
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,100
I'm-I'm not here
to see you.

196
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,600
I'm just covering for
Seth while he's gone.

197
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,400
That's nice.

198
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Sorry that I kissed you.

199
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,700
What?

200
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
No, its... it's cool.

201
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,900
It's obviously not okay.

202
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,600
You're totally uncomfortable
around me now.

203
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
No, no. Um...

204
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,100
It's... the kiss
is not a problem.

205
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,400
Really? Good, because

206
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,500
usually when I kiss a guy,

207
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,200
it ends in tears.

208
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,800
His, not mine,

209
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
because, like,
I'm a bit of a lip biter

210
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,400
and, you know, sometimes
I draw blood and...

211
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,700
Taylor?

212
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,500
Yeah?

213
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,900
What are you doing tonight?

214
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,200
Oh, I'm updating my blog.

215
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,100
It's kind of
Felicity by way

216
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,400
of Anais Nin, the erotic memoirs

217
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,300
of a soulful college girl.

218
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,500
Taylor, tonight,
are you busy?

219
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,100
Oh. Blog, shmog.

220
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,700
-Is-is that a yes?
-Yes, it is a yes, squared.

221
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,100
In all caps, with
a exclamation mark

222
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
and a smiley-fed emoticon.

223
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,600
A simple yes will do.

224
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Yes.

225
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,400
Great, all right, well,
I'll see you tonight.

226
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,700
Hey, do you just want to come
up to the comic book store?

227
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,000
There's a flat-screen TV,
SurroundSound,

228
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,700
a bevy of Blu-ray anime.

229
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
All right. See you then.

230
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,600
Hey, Eric.

231
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Kaitlin, hey.

232
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,700
What are you doing here?

233
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
It seems like people at

234
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,400
this school like to watch
hairless wonders in banana slings.

235
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm just trying to fit in.

236
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Oh, cool.

237
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Well, good to see you.

238
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
Ask her.

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,100
No, you ask her.

240
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,400
Do you bitches have a problem?

241
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
We saw you talking to Eric Ward.

242
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,900
Oh, my God, he is so hot.

243
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,100
Do you know him?

244
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
I know that his brother
shaves his chest.

245
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Seriously?

246
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
That is so...

247
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,300
Gayer than his dad, I know.

248
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,400
You're Kaitlin Cooper,
aren't you?

249
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes.

250
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,100
I'm Olivia.
This is Lea.

251
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,700
-Hi.
-Cool.

252
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,800
Do you guys think
anyone would notice

253
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,600
if I sparked a jay
up by the bleachers?

254
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
That is so totally illegal.

255
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,900
Is there a reason why you guys
aren't home right now?

256
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,700
Riley, hey! We-we...

257
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,100
Came to cheer on
your boyfriend.

258
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,000
Connor's doing awesome.

259
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,300
That's because he is awesome.

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,900
Now, get going.

261
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,300
Those party invites aren't
gonna address themselves.

262
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,200
Okay.

263
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,300
Okay, why do you guys
let her talk to you like that?

264
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
Well, she's having a
pimps and ho's party

265
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
for her sweet 16,

266
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,200
and it's gonna
be awesome.

267
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,500
But if we don't help out,

268
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,300
we don't go.

269
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,400
So don't go.

270
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Yeah.

271
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,500
That would be social suicide.

272
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,900
Everyone who's anyone
at this school is

273
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,900
going to that party.

274
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,300
No offense.

275
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,700
Come on, Lea.

276
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,500
'Kay, well, if you guys
change your minds,

277
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,900
I'll be by the bleachers.

278
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,600
Sure.

279
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,900
Gotcha.

280
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,600
Hey, man, how's the
East Coast treating you?

281
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,500
Too soon to tell.

282
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,900
I had a layover in Salt Lake

283
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,100
and then I got delayed in Poughkeepsie.

284
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,600
It's hard to get a direct flight
last minute.

285
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,300
Yeah, well,

286
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,200
at least you made it.

287
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
Summer surprised to see you?

288
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm headed over there right now.

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,900
I got an all-night study package.

290
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
I scored a brick
of Dunkin' Donuts coffee

291
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,800
and some reasonably priced meth

292
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,700
from this homeless guy.

293
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
Oh, I'm sure she'll appreciate

294
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,000
the pick-me-up, very thoughtful.

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,100
How are things with you?

296
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,400
I know you wanted to talk.

297
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,300
Things are weird.

298
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,900
And about to get a lot weirder.

299
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
That wasn't vague
or ominous at all.

300
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,100
I'll explain later.

301
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,200
Well, good luck.

302
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Back at you.

303
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
I know you're unhappy,

304
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,500
but you've been out with
seven different men.

305
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,800
You mean seven versions
of the same man.

306
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,300
Republican
real estate developer

307
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
hates his ex-wife,
loves golf.

308
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,300
This is Newport.

309
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,700
You live in a monkey cage,

310
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,800
you have to date chimps.

311
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Well, maybe you could throw

312
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,100
a gorilla into the mix.

313
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,700
I appreciate the analogy,

314
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,100
but, Pam, how do we fix this?

315
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,900
Find me a man
who will surprise me.

316
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,100
Someone different.

317
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,000
Her prayers have
been answered.

318
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,300
I tell you, the women are
well-preserved in this town.

319
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,200
If my slacks weren't
so damn tight...

320
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,300
Bullet, what are
you doing here?

321
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,800
I thought you were going
to be a silent partner.

322
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,200
Oh, I ain't here to work.

323
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,700
I came to see my girlfriend.

324
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
-What? No, I am not...
-Car's waiting outside.

325
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,600
Dinner's planned.

326
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
I'd invite Blondie,
but she don't look

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,100
much like an eater.

328
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,900
Oh, that's a shame.

329
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
I'm going to let you two

330
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
figure this out.

331
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,800
See you in the morning.

332
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,600
Kirs...

333
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,500
Okay, I'm not having
dinner with you.

334
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
A) You repulse me,

335
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,500
and B) I'm busy.

336
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,800
Well, A) that's cool;

337
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
2) busy doing what?

338
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,300
A client is unhappy
with our man base,

339
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,000
so I have to go on
a major recruiting mission.

340
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,300
Or you can just put them
in the Bullet's line of fire.

341
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay, while the client is looking
for something out of the norm,

342
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,100
"lunatic" probably isn't her type.

343
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,700
-Have dinner with me.
-No.

344
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,900
-A cocktail?
-No!

345
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Then let's just make out.

346
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,200
I can hurt you.

347
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,700
Wow.

348
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,100
Call me.

349
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,400
Isn't this just great?

350
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,000
I mean, did you ever think

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
that decapitation could be so beautiful?

352
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
How many times
have you seen this?

353
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Oh, I watch it every night.

354
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,900
It helps relax me.

355
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,500
Is everything okay?

356
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm sorry.

357
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,400
So that's a "no."

358
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I can't do this.

359
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,400
Okay, um...

360
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,100
I've done my fair share of

361
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,500
misreading signs in my life,

362
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,800
but you asked me to hang out.

363
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,300
You sat next to me,

364
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,400
you leaned in with
a slight tilt to your head.

365
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,300
I know, I know,

366
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,000
and I'm sorry.

367
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,500
Uh, you're a great girl.
It's just,

368
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,600
this is too weird.

369
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, that makes me
feel so much better.

370
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,300
Me!
Not you, me.

371
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,100
I'm... weird.

372
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Surprise!

373
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,900
Cohen?

374
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,400
Cohen.

375
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,700
Hey, where are you?

376
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,500
Where are you?

377
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,800
I'm in your room.

378
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,600
I'm in your room.

379
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,100
Summer, I was going
to surprise you.

380
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,300
Well, I'm surprised.

381
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Yeah, me, too.
Why aren't you in school?

382
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,700
Because I got kicked out.

383
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Summer, what'd you do?

384
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,300
I listened to stupid Che

385
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
and his stupid plan,

386
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,700
and he sold me down
the stupid river.

387
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,800
I knew anyone that sincere
was not to be trusted.

388
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,200
I miss it already.

389
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,500
I don't know what to do.

390
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,100
Yeah, well, I do.

391
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,300
What?

392
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,000
If he hurt you,

393
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,700
then I'm going to hurt him.

394
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,100
That's funny, Cohen.

395
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,200
See, I knew you could
cheer me up.

396
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,600
I'm serious.
You can at least act like

397
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,100
it's halfway feasible
that I could avenge your honor.

398
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,900
What, you're serious?

399
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
No, no, no.

400
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,300
I'm going to go
so Ryan Atwood on his ass.

401
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,900
Come on, Cohen,
I don't like this.

402
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Neither will Che.

403
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,800
No, wait, don't...

404
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
So Kirsten told me
she came in yesterday

405
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,100
and applied for the job
of substitute Seth.

406
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,800
She may have.

407
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, you know, uh,

408
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
if anyone's qualified,

409
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,700
I think we all know it's me,

410
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,500
and I'm thinking the only
reason you didn't ask me

411
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,400
is because no interview
was necessary.

412
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Yeah, well, it turns out I may

413
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,600
not have to fill the position--

414
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,400
I handled the whole
Taylor thing--

415
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,500
although it may be a little
awkward for a while.

416
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,600
Oh.

417
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,700
What happened?

418
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,400
Nothing happened.

419
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,700
Which was the problem for her.

420
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,600
Yeah, yeah.

421
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,300
But now I don't know.

422
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,500
I mean, at first I thought
I was just caught up in

423
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,800
the whole Volchok thing.

424
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,700
And then I thought the
problem might've been Taylor.

425
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,400
You know, because she can

426
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,100
be a little, uh, weird.

427
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,000
She's a touch eccentric.

428
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,100
But now I think
the problem is me.

429
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,900
Maybe it's too soon.

430
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,500
So keep it casual.

431
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
You know, just tell her you...

432
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
you need to be friends for now.

433
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,200
Yeah, that's a line
every girl loves to hear.

434
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,500
No, if it's the truth,

435
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
she'll understand.

436
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,300
Well, I don't have
any other choice.

437
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,600
All right,
I'll give it a shot.

438
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Great, okay, listen,

439
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,700
if there's anything else
I can do for you,

440
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll be in my room
reading comics

441
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,400
and listening to indie rock.
All right.

442
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,600
That was a good Seth.

443
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
Were you a good Ryan?

444
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,900
I was actually going
to borrow one

445
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,400
from the Julie Cooper playbook,

446
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
and wait till Che was asleep,

447
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,900
then smother him with a pillow.

448
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, my hero.

449
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,700
But the guy was at some

450
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,000
all-night candlelight vigil.

451
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
Still, he's got to sleep
sometime.

452
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,100
This place reeks of incense
and righteousness.

453
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,400
Oh, that's Che's musk.

454
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,300
Look, be careful.

455
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,500
He's not in his room.

456
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,800
Neither was your roommate
last night.

457
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,700
Yeah, that's because
she's a huge slut.

458
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Wait a minute, what's this?

459
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,700
What, I don't know.

460
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm on the phone, I can't see.

461
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Hello, Seth.

462
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,100
News of your vendetta
has reached my ears.

463
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,200
Is that Che?

464
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,900
What's happening?

465
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,500
I'm a pacifist.

466
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,500
Until cooler heads prevail...

467
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,700
I will be underground.

468
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,300
Peace.

469
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,100
He's going to run?

470
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,400
That coward!

471
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm going to watch it again
for background noise,

472
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,300
visual cues,

473
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,500
anything that might tip me off

474
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,400
to his whereabouts.

475
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,100
No, Cohen, Che has had

476
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
survival training, okay.

477
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
He's probably hiding in a cave

478
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,700
somewhere with Osama Bin Laden.

479
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Look, forget about him.

480
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,900
I need you, and I'm here.

481
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,300
All right, but for the record,

482
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,600
I did not back down.

483
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,300
And I love you for it.

484
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,200
Come home.

485
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,900
Okay.

486
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,300
Summer?

487
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,000
What are you doing here?

488
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,300
Oh, I slept out here.

489
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,900
Turns out I like nature.

490
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,700
And Taylor's in my bed.

491
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
No, I mean, what are you
doing here in Newport?

492
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,200
Oh.

493
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,300
Long story.

494
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,800
Oh.

495
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Well, then if you need anything

496
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,100
or just want to talk,

497
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm here for you.

498
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Thanks, Julie.

499
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,700
And you should go
reclaim your bedroom.

500
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,900
Taylor has boundary issues.

501
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,400
Mm.

502
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,700
Is that a bunny?

503
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,800
Okay, so if I don't
call your name,

504
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,200
that means you're not coming.

505
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
All the hot senior guys
already got their invites.

506
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,600
Jeanie.

507
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Kristen.

508
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,500
Sarah.

509
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,400
She's got to
invite us, right?

510
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,900
She'd better.

511
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,200
We stayed up all night
licking envelopes.

512
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Alexis.

513
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,300
Michelle.

514
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,800
Shana.

515
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
And lastly, me, duh.

516
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,700
Wait, what about us?

517
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Sorry,
but I didn't know

518
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,900
you'd ruin the envelopes

519
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,400
with your heinous saliva stains.

520
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
The whole school could get

521
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
gonorrhea of the throat.

522
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
But you promised!

523
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm afraid it'd be unsanitary.

524
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,600
KAITLIN:
You guys can all come to my party.

525
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,600
It's tonight, my house.

526
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,400
Well, I rented out Hide,

527
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,000
and did you know that

528
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,900
Chef Hu yells at people?

529
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,300
He's making sushi,
and Danity Kane

530
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
is playing a 25-minute set.

531
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,000
Well, sushi's high in mercury,

532
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,300
and Danity Kane sucks.

533
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,100
I've got five kegs,

534
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,000
a quarter ounce
and absolutely no parents.

535
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,900
Sweet!

536
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,200
Bring whoever you guys want.

537
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,700
And don't worry about
any lame costumes.

538
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,100
Thanks.

539
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100
Yeah, that was
really nice

540
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,900
inviting us
to your party.

541
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,500
It sounds like fun.

542
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,100
Oh, it will be.

543
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,500
You want to join New Match?

544
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,800
I don't understand.

545
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,700
The application fee
is rather steep,

546
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,100
and most of our female clients
are over 35.

547
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,200
Look, you need new recruits,
right?

548
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,500
So sign us up.

549
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,300
Here's a check to cover it.

550
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,200
And I believe this is for you.

551
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,300
Uh-huh, and I think
I know who it is.

552
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,000
Bang!

553
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,200
Am I good or am I good?

554
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,100
What do you think
you're doing?

555
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,300
Well, money may not buy
love or happiness,

556
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,400
but it'll buy a whole lot
of bachelors.

557
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,400
I think you owe me
a weekend as a thanks.

558
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,300
No, I can't.

559
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,400
I already have plans.

560
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,500
Cancel them.

561
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,700
I'm going away for the weekend

562
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,800
with Kirsten and Sandy.

563
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,900
To the Montage,

564
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,200
it's their anniversary.

565
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,900
You're celebrating
their anniversary?

566
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,600
They're having a recommitment

567
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,800
ceremony and, uh...

568
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,600
I am their witness.

569
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, that's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

570
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,100
See you there.

571
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,000
The Bullet?

572
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,500
Bang.

573
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,900
Taylor.

574
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,300
Ryan.
Boo!

575
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Didn't run away that time,

576
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,000
so you must not be
that scared of me.

577
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,700
All right, look,

578
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,800
I just wanted to come by and

579
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
apologize about last night, and...

580
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,400
And I didn't know
you had company.

581
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,300
Roger, Ryan.
Ryan, Roger.

582
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,200
-Roger.
-Ryan.

583
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
I've been helping Roger

584
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
track down this obscure

585
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,700
Kinji Fukasaku biography.

586
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,000
And it turns out he
watches Blood Bath IV

587
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
every night before
he goes to bed, too.

588
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,700
Well, that's...

589
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,800
Kismet? I know.

590
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,900
Maybe it's too soon
to talk about fate,

591
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,800
but...

592
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,100
Yeah, well, anyway,

593
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,900
I just wanted, you know,

594
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,800
to see if you need
a ride home or anything.

595
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,900
Oh, I got my bike, thanks.

596
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,500
Not you.

597
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,600
Well, that is very
friendly of you, Ryan,

598
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,400
since I'm assuming
that's what you want

599
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,600
us to be, just friends?

600
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,900
Well, if you're cool
with that.

601
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,500
Ryan Atwood,
"mon ami" sounds terrif.

602
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,500
But Roger and I
were just gonna

603
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,700
hang out
and, uh, order some takeout,

604
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,900
so if you don't mind.

605
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
All right, well, uh, you know,

606
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,600
I'll see you, then.

607
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,700
Bye, friend.

608
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,900
Bye, Ryan.
Nice to meet you, man.

609
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,800
Bye, Roger.

610
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,800
Let's come lat this.
I wanted to show you this.

611
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,500
I really think you guys
should work at this one.

612
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,300
This really why
you work here?

613
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,700
Yeah,
I talked to my dad today.

614
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
He was pretty
disappointed in me.

615
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,100
Well, I'm leaving the Antelope
Valley Airport now,

616
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,500
so there's just the $100 cab
ride home.

617
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,800
Just get here soon, okay?

618
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,000
Okay, I love you.

619
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
That was fast.

620
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,200
I've come to atone for my sins.

621
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,400
around the block with the kegs.

622
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
have to get my mr of h.

623
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,600
What, or convince her to let me
throw a huge party

624
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,800
with underage drinking?

625
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Yeah, I have to get her out
of the house.

626
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,700
Are you going somewhere?

627
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,900
yeah, I'm go to the Mgeh
Sandy and Kirsten,

628
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,400
just for the weekend.

629
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,900
Going to a hotel
with Sandy and Kirsten?

630
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,200
They're not spg r
relationship up, are they?

631
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Please, Sandy and Kirsten?

632
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,800
Yeah, they don't
exactly scream threesome.

633
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,400
Just hld y

634
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,300
So I guess I can assume
you'll be fine

635
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,500
without me this weekend?

636
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,200
Oh, I think I can survive.

637
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,300
Now, if you need anything,

638
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,100
Summer and Taylor
are in charge.

639
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,300
it, Summer's here?

640
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,700
Fine, Che, you're really
going to dehydrate,

641
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,300
ca oon the front lawn,
I'll get you some water.

642
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,900
Hi.

643
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,500
So you don't belie
that I'm thirstyh?

644
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,800
Now you think I'm a liar.

645
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,600
And a chicken and a snake

646
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,800
and a ra

647
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,900
Well, those are
all God's creatures.

648
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,000
Aneyalll.
I made a mistake.

649
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
It wasn't a mistake.
You deliberately used me.

650
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,900
Summer, I cannot go on with my

651
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,600
life with this issue unresolved.

652
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,700
So let's go out on the lawn

653
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,500
and have a truth circle.

654
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,300
will be your
opportunity to tell me

655
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
how you're really feeling.

656
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,100
I have.

657
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,600
I hate you. Now leave.

658
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,800
This can't be fixed by
some candlelight vigil oretn,y?

659
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
And I'm not some tree that you

660
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,400
can just chain yourself to.

661
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,100
We'll see about that.

662
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,700
What? What did you do?

663
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,200
This is fu
Give me the key.

664
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,700
I cannot unlock us
until we are done healing.

665
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,400
Hmm. Okay, then be prepared
to stay here

666
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,300
for the rest of your life,
'cause that's never going to happen.

667
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,700
SANDY:A weekend away
at the Montage.neououe self.

668
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,600
I don't know about that.

669
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,300
Oh, no, listen,

670
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,900
I'm going to be paying you
back later tonight.

671
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,100
Guess who packed Scrabble?

672
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,400
There's just one small
wrinkle totherwisrrd

673
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,800
romantic holidayth forgot to share.

674
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,600
Not to worry.

675
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,000
I TiVoed the Australian Open.

676
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,100
Tiger's going
to take it any

677
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,400
Just one more g.

678
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,800
Tell me at least he's got
a separate room.

679
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Sandy Cohen,

680
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
you're looking lovely tonight.

681
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
If my date didn't look so hot,

682
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,300
I might scope you out.

683
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
llI-I'm jealous.

684
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Now, who is the lucky date?

685
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,800
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

686
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,900
I owe you both big time.

687
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
I'll make this up
to you tight.

688
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,600
I am so damn honored
to be here with you

689
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
and Kirsten for your recommitment ceremony.

690
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,300
I am crying already.

691
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,600

692
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,400

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,300

packaging, so no groping...

696
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,000

735
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,500
Wh?

736
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,600
Kaitlin!

737
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,300
Roger?!

738
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,400
Yon't believe your eyes.

739
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,700
ese girls are wild.

740
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,600
Get out ere now!

741
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,500
Ride with me, Ryan.

742
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,000
So the good news is,
my frequent-flier miles

743
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,300
just reached platinum.

744
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,700
The bad news is, they don't

745
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,900
change the in-flight movie,

746
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,200
and Failure to Launch
does not hold up

747
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,700
on the third viewing.

748
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,900
What are you doing here?

749
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,000
Summer got kicked out of school

750
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,200
and I'm about to head over there.

751
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,600
Can I come with you?

752
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,400
I appreciate your interest
in Summer's future,

753
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,800
but I think this
is a conversation

754
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,200
that's just for the two of us.

755
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,100
Is Taylor going to be there?

756
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,000
I assume so.

757
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,600
I like her.

758
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,700
Say what now?
Why would you even think that?

759
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,000
Because I keep imagining her
on roller skates

760
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,100
and washing windows with a big

761
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,300
bucket of soapy water.

762
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,700
Dude, your fantasies

763
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,100
are so pedestrian.
A sudsy girl?

764
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,300
That's... so average.

765
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,900
Doesn't mean it's not hot.
I guess they call them classics for a reason.

766
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Do you want to drive
or sh-should I?

767
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,200
Again!

768
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,500
Okay, game night!

769
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,300
Who wants to play Pictionary,
huh?

770
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,800
Come on, guys, get high on life!

771
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,900
Hey! Hey!

772
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,100
Cut it out!
I tan on this chair.

773
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,700
Hey, if you are going
to consummate your union, be safe.

774
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
Out of my way, wasteoid.

775
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,600
Hey, stay alive.

776
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,500
Don't drink and drive.

777
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,400
Che, shut up!

778
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Where's Kaitlin?

779
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,900
Again!

780
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,000
You guys, your seven minutes is up.

781
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,500
And I'm next.

782
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
It's Connor.

783
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,400
Oh, Riley's gonna die.

784
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,800
I mean, it's bad enough you

785
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,100
didn't go to her party.

786
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
She doesn't have to know.

787
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,300
Come on, Kaitlin.

788
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,200
Oh...

789
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, my gosh.

790
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Oh, man.
Whoo!You're so hot.

791
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,400
Why don't I ever see you
around school?

792
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,700
'Cause I don't really like school.

793
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,600
Huh.

794
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,300
So are we going to
make out or what?

795
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,800
'Cause the clock
is kind of ticking.

796
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Or we could talk more.

797
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,300
I mean...

798
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,500
Yeah, you seem
really interesting.

799
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,600
I'm not.

800
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,700
Let's make out.

801
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Are you afraid
to cheat on Riley?

802
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,300
No. I don't even like her.

803
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,200
So what's the problem?

804
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,300
Are you... gay?

805
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,200
What?

806
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,500
No!

807
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,100
I don't, I don't,

808
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,900
I don't think so.

809
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
Sweetheart, you're so gay.

810
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,000
I know the Jews are good

811
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,500
with numbers and lending stuff.

812
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,100
Now, there's a generalization

813
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,800
that's not even
remotely offensive.

814
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Well, hold on there,
He-bro.

815
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,300
It's just,
if you all control the media,

816
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
why does everyone know?

817
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,200
Why not use the media to say

818
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,700
someone else controls it?

819
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,600
It would cause a lot less
resentment that way.

820
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
You know, we should talk
about something else.

821
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,100
Dinner was delicious.

822
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Like you ate!

823
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,700
Oh, I know what they say--

824
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
"Eat light on
Saturday night."

825
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,800
Less food in the stomach
for the booze.

826
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,600
Bullet, Kirsten
doesn't drink.

827
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,100
Time for bed.
I have a headache.

828
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,700
Uh-oh!

829
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,500
I guess she doesn't do that either.

830
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,900
Thank you, Gordon.

831
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
Your point of view regarding
the Middle East is something

832
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
I will treasure forever.

833
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,400
Well, all I said
was Iran-Iraq war.

834
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,200
Whoever loses, we win.

835
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,300
Honey, let's see
if we can cancel our room.

836
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Sounds like a plan.

837
00:30:59,300 --> 00:30:59,900
Good night, Julie.

838
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
-Good night.
-Good night.

839
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,400
What about their wedding vows?

840
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,500
That was a lie, Bullet.

841
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Told to avoid you, because you

842
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,900
are an ignorant buffoon.

843
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,000
Now, if you'll excuse me,

844
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,600
I'm going to try and salvage
my friendship with Sandy and Kirsten.

845
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
You want some more coffee?

846
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,900
-Let's split up.
-All right, good luck.

847
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,700
You, too.

848
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,800
Taylor?

849
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,200
Taylor?

850
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,700
Ryan?

851
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Roger, hey.

852
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Uh, keep doing
what you're doing.

853
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,300
I was looking for Taylor,
but clearly she's...

854
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,800
Who's Taylor?

855
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Uh...

856
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,500
Is this your boyfriend?

857
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,700
Uh, Taylor isn't in there

858
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,300
with you guys, is she?

859
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,900
No.

860
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,300
Okay. What are you doing, man?

861
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,100
Um, I mean, I think Taylor
really likes you,

862
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,700
and you're kind
of leading her on.

863
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,900
I barely even know her.

864
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,300
She told me if I pretended
to like her,

865
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,400
she'd give me
her Kitano action figure.

866
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,400
It's extremely rare.

867
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,900
Wait, she paid you
to pretend to like her?

868
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
That sounds like Taylor.

869
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,800
All right, well, uh... carry on.

870
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,600
Well, well, well.

871
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,300
Looks like you finally crawled
out of your cave.

872
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,000
Seth, perhaps with your
presence,

873
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,200
we could broker some peace.

874
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,600
What are you doing here,
Sandals?

875
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,400
Ruining Summer's life
at Brown wasn't enough?

876
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
Cohen, you're here!

877
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,100
Yeah.

878
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,300
Now I want to see what this

879
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,800
guy's got to say for himself.

880
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,700
Please, Seth.

881
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,600
Summer and I are on
a journey together.

882
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,300
Huh?

883
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,800
A journey towards the truth.

884
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,900
You're on a journey...

885
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,100
-to the pool.
-What?

886
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
What? No! Cohen!

887
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,500

888
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,100
So you dress like a ho
for no reason?

889
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,100
-I changed before I came here.
-Oh.

890
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Look, you win, okay?

891
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,800
I'll... I'll serve your command.

892
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,700
The school is yours.

893
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,000
Except that I don't want it.

894
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,700
Just be nicer to your friends.

895
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,700
Oh.

896
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Connor's totally gay.

897
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Hi, 911?

898
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,500
Yeah, I'd like to report
a totally lame partyer.

899
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,400
I'm a worthless coward,

900
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,600
and you're a
glorious m artyr.

901
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,400
Sorry,

902
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,300
I didn't realize
about the handcuffs.

903
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,600
Well, you know,
it's all Che's fault.

904
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
It's my fault.

905
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,100
Just know I hate myself more

906
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
than you could ever hate me.

907
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,500
I'm capable of a lot of hate.

908
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,200
It's true.

909
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,500
You're my best friend, Summer.

910
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,700
All those other kids,
they only  joined the cause

911
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
so it'd look good on their
grad school applications.

912
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,800
But you, but you really
believed in the good

913
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,700
we were doing.

914
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,200
We did a lot of good.

915
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,600
I let you down, I know.

916
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,500
I'm sorry.

917
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,600
I liberated those bunnies
because

918
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
I believed that
they should be set free.

919
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,200
I knew the consequences
if I got caught.

920
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,300
Look, I can't spend
my whole life blaming you,

921
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,800
so I accept your apology.

922
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
With an asterisk next to it.

923
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,600
And there's a footnote
at the bottom.

924
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,800
And it says

925
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,100
you don't deserve it.

926
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,200
Yeah. (sighs)

927
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,100
You're so much more
enlightened than

928
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,400
I could ever hope to be.

929
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,900
I think I need
to blow my nose.

930
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,200
No, you...
Could you unlock us first?

931
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,800
Okay.

932
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,500
I guess
now we are

933
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,000
free to take
our own paths.

934
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,400
Yours leads toward the airport.

935
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,600
Yeah, okay, yeah.

936
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,500
I should be going.

937
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,600
You ready, Dalton?

938
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,000
Your bags are packed,
Winchester.

939
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
-Winchester?
-Winchester?

940
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,800
Why do they think
they call me Che?

941
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
Your father's G-4

942
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,000
is waiting
on the tarmac.

943
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,700
I thought you grew up
on a reservation.

944
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,200
It was a reservation--

945
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,000
a beautiful reservation--

946
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,300
Before it became
a family

947
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,300
compound
that's all gated.

948
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,000
My dad owns
a pharmaceutical company

949
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,700
and some factories in Mexico.

950
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,700
Well, I guess every kid

951
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,000
finds a way
to rebel against their parents.

952
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,100
Good-bye, Caterpillar.

953
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,600
And defender of
Caterpillar's honor.

954
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
?????????????

955
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
So he was a liar,

956
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,800
a coward and a hypocrite.

957
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
At least he had depth.

958
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
I guess I am really
back home again.

959
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Which is great,
except now I have to leave.

960
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,400
Taylor?

961
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,000
Ryan.

962
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,700
What are you doing?

963
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,900
Someone wrote I love poop

964
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,300
on this poor boy's face.

965
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
You know, that kind of thing

966
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
can scar you for life.

967
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,500
No, what are you doing paying

968
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,700
your gay friend Roger to pretend

969
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,600
he's in love
with you?

970
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,300
Well, what if I did, hmm?

971
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,100
What if I did rent a homosexual
for the evening?

972
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,700
And pay him with rare
collectibles from Asian cinema?

973
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,300
What difference
does it make to you?

974
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,800
Well, it's a little strange.

975
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,200
Well, so am I.

976
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,000
Which is why you ran away

977
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,900
from me last night.

978
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,500
No, it wasn't 'cause
you're strange.

979
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,500
You don't find me strange?

980
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,300
No, I do, but that's
not why I took off.

981
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,900
Look, I'm not really ready

982
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,100
for a relationship right now

983
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,300
or a girlfriend.

984
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,800
Uh... girlfriend?

985
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,100
Cart, horse?

986
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,000
Aren't you getting a little
ahead of yourself there?

987
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,000
Well, I mean, just because

988
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,400
I want to use your body
as a jungle gym,

989
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,700
doesn't mean that
we have to get married.

990
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,300
-I see.
-I mean, my divorce papers

991
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,600
aren't even dry yet.

992
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,500
Look, you're a sweet, smart,

993
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,400
great guy, Ryan Atwood.

994
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,400
And hot.

995
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,800
Did I mention hot?

996
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So whatever happens,

997
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,500
happens.

998
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,100
-Taylor, that's...
-Normal?

999
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,800
Yeah.

1000
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah, I have my moments.

1001
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,200
You know, this is
my first high school bash.

1002
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,200
Have you ever played
Seven Minutes in Heaven?

1003
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Thanks to you, Sandy and Kirsten
are packed and on the road.

1004
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,900
I'm sorry, Julie.

1005
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,600
When God was handing
out brains,

1006
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,400
I guess I was sitting
on the toilet.

1007
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,900
I swear you make me
all nervous inside.

1008
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,700
So you only act like a bigot
and a sexist pig around me?

1009
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,800
No, I just feel worse
about it when you're around.

1010
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,600
You're such a classy
and elegant dame.

1011
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
Well, that is true.

1012
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Look, I was trying so hard

1013
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,500
to make you laugh,

1014
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,300
and I know what a hard time
you've been through,

1015
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,000
and I...

1016
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,300
it just came out all wrong.

1017
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,100
I appreciate that, Gordon.

1018
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,700
I guess you're heading
on home now, too, huh?

1019
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,800
Are you kidding?

1020
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,200
I put the room on
the company card.

1021
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,500
I've got a mud bath
in the morning.

1022
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,300
So, since I ruined dinner,

1023
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
how about breakfast?

1024
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Breakfast?

1025
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,800
Okay.

1026
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
So, uh, should I

1027
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,100
call you or nudge you?

1028
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,300
Bang.

1029
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,100
That was funny.

1030
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,500
You have a pretty smile.

1031
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,700
My job is to get you
to use it more.

1032
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,000
Then you're going
to need better material.

1033
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,800
Well, I am working on it.

1034
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,500
'Night, Julie.

1035
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
Can't we be left alone?

1036
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,000
It's probably Julie.

1037
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,800
She felt terrible.

1038
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,000
Well, I bet she did.

1039
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,700
She spent the night
with the Bullet.

1040
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,700
Hello, I was told you two

1041
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,900
are renewing your vows?

1042
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,700
I'm a justice of the

1043
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,100
peace, here to preside
over the ceremony.

1044
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,600
Oh, I'm sorry,

1045
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,900
that was an excuse.

1046
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,500
Yeah, we didn't call
for anyone.

1047
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,100
I was hired by a Gordon Bullet.

1048
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
-Hello.
-Julie.

1049
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,700
Hey, it's Spencer.

1050
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,000
I just wanted to, uh, call

1051
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,700
and say thanks.

1052
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,300
I had a great night.

1053
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
I would assume so,
it's pretty late.

1054
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,700
I'll, uh, give you your cut
when you get back into town.

1055
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,700
My cut?

1056
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,400
Spencer, you pay
to join the service.

1057
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,700
Your date doesn't pay you.

1058
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,700
That... that's illegal.
You're not a gigolo.

1059
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,400
Right.

1060
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,800
Open phone line.

1061
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,900
Got it, my bad.

1062
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,600
Anyway, you got yourself
one satisfied customer.

1063
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,000
See ya.

1064
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,600
Spencer, wait...

1065
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,800
Spencer?

1066
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,600
I wish.

1067
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,900
But it's probably for the best.

1068
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,400
I am tin roof rusted.

1069
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,800
Pam.

1070
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
So you had a good night?

1071
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,100
Worth every penny.

1072
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,500
And I'll be telling
all my friends.

1073
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,500
And what will you be
telling them exactly?

1074
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,400
Okay, seven minutes are up.

1075
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,800
You said you wanted
to take it slow.

1076
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,900
Yeah, well, I don't think
eight minutes would be rushing.

1077
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,600
-Nine seems like a good pace.
-Mm-hmm.

1078
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,700
And ten is a nice,
round number.

1079
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,600
Mm, mm-hmm.

1080
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,800
We could try the
long-distance thing again.

1081
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
I've got a lot
of frequent-flier miles,

1082
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,100
and we survived
one semester apart.

1083
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,300
Yeah, barely.

1084
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,900
Why don't you move to Providence
with me and get a job.

1085
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,300
Oh, right. You'll be in school

1086
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
and I'll be slinging
baba ganoush on Third Street,

1087
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,400
while all the kids are living
the life

1088
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,600
that I should be having.

1089
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,800
Well, you know, I've really
been enjoying home lately.

1090
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,700
Ryan's back and I've been
bonding with the Newpsies.

1091
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,900
Maybe, uh, I could put off

1092
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,000
RISD for a semester.

1093
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,800
We could both go back
together in the fall.

1094
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,700
You'd really put off
college for me?

1095
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,300
Rhode Island is a big place.

1096
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,600
Better we tackle it together.

1097
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,800
Cohen, Rhode Island's the
smallest state in the country.

1098
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,400
I was kidding.

1099
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,600
Right.

1100
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,300
There's just one more thing.

1101
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,100
This is Pancakes.

1102
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
Pancakes is very
important to me.

1103
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,300
Then you can hold it.
I'm not really an animal person.

1104
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,400
Cohen, Pancakes is
my daughter,

1105
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,200
or my son,
I'm not really sure.

1106
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,200
Oh...

1107
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Oh, he's your son.

1108
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,000
He kind of looks
like you, Cohen.

1109
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,200
Feel how soft he is.

1110
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah.

1111
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,400
He's beautiful.

1112
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,800
Take a look around, Pancakes.

1113
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,400
This is your new home.

1114
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,300
