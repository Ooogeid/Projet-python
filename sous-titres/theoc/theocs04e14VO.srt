1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,500
Previously on The O.C.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,300
Articulating your feelings
to your girlfriend

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,200
kind of a challenge.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:04,800
How do you feel?

5
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,100
I...

6
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,400
I see the great
love of your life.

7
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,300
It's George.

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,900
George?
George?

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm here to offer you a job.

10
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,400
He heard about my work
with the sea otters

11
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,400
and invited me to travel
across the country

12
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,100
and talk to college
kids about voting.

13
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,700
Why don't you give
Jason Spitz a call?

14
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,300
You're always saying
how funny he is.

15
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't have that many
guy friends anymore.

16
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,300
Who does? Who's got the time?

17
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,600
Where the heck's your mom?

18
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,700
I know I asked you
to be my stepdad.

19
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Do you mind being
my friend instead?

20
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,700
Tell me what it is
that you love about Julie.

21
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,600
We're just

22
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,300
from the same world.

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,100
I'm not buying you
lingerie for your birthday.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,900
That's just weird.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,900
Okay, that's fine.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
I told you, you don't
have to buy me anything.

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,200
You and Ryan are throwing
me a birthday party

28
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,100
and that's enough.

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Look, I know you've never
had a birthday party before,

30
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,900
let alone been to one,

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,800
but usually people get
presents for their birthday,

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,900
so will you please
tell me what you want?

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,200
Okay, honestly,

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,100
I want Ryan

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
to ask me to go to
Berkeley with him next year.

36
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,800
Okay, I was thinking more
along the lines of a cute top.

37
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
I know, I know, it's just,

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm a planner,

39
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,500
and I've already seeing
that day six months

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,900
in the future when we
all go our separate ways.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,900
And I just know

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,900
that if Ryan goes
to Berkeley and I go to...

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Harvard or Princeton
or Oxford, then it's over.

44
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,700
Don't you have to apply
to Berkeley first

45
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,900
in order to...

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
You already applied to Berkeley?

47
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,000
Does Ryan know this?

48
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,800
No.I applied before we
even started dating.

49
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,300
I just got back from
France and I figured,

50
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
well, I had to go somewhere,

51
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,700
so I reapplied to Princeton,
Oxford,Yale, Harvard

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,000
and the Sorbonne,

53
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,800
and I figured why not
throw Berkeley in?

54
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,800
Hmm.

55
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,200
Um, hi.

56
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,400
Can we get two coffees, please?

57
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,400
Uh, yeah.

58
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,800
Okay.

59
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,600
So you want to get
Ryan to tell you

60
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
that he wants you
to go to Berkeley,

61
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,400
without knowing that
you already got in to Berkeley?

62
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,000
Exactly.

63
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,700
And how're you going to do that?

64
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,000
Easy.I just need to get him
to tell me that he loves me.

65
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Mm-hmm, Ryan talking
about his feelings.

66
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,000
Now that would be an
earth-shattering event.

67
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Careful, they're hot.

68
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
Thank you.
Thanks.

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Did you see this about earthquake weather?

70
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,000
You know, it's exactly
this kind of voodoo science

71
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,000
that lets politicians
deny global warming.

72
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,400
Oh, my God, I know.

73
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
And how many times
have they predicted the big one,

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
and it never happens.

75
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,300
It almost makes you wish that it would.

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,600
Hey.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,100
Good morning.

78
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,100
What's the occasion?

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,400
Just you're being so sweet
throwing me a birthday party,

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,300
and I wanted to thank you, so...

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,900
Oh, my gosh, did I ever
tell you about...

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
How you've never
had a birthday party

83
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,500
and you've always spent every
birthday alone in your room

84
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,900
watching Sixteen Candles

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,800
and talking to a gypsy
on the psychic hot line?

86
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,900
Yeah, I know,
I'm a broken record.

87
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,300
Just, you know, it really
means a lot to me

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,500
that you're doing this for me.

89
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,800
Well, Taylor, I'll tell you,

90
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,600
planning your birthday
party is not easy.

91
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,200
I expect something in return.

92
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,700
Oh.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
I expect to have
my way with you.

94
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,500
Ryan!

95
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, all that time and energy.

96
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,600
Clowns, balloons, a magician...

97
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,600
Oh, oh, well,
if there's a magician.

98
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,000
It's kind of strange to think
about all of this ending isn't it?

99
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,400
Hmm?

100
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,200
You, going off to Berkeley,

101
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,100
me, whichever way
the wind blows.

102
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,100
Well, it's still six months away.

103
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,400
Right, yeah.

104
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,300
If only I had
a crystal ball, huh?

105
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,200
Maybe I should call Esmerelda
from the psychic hot line.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,700
Th is a really good croissant.

107
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,100
Don't you have the feeling that

108
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,500
we're on the cusp
of something and we just need

109
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,000
to leap into the void?

110
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,400
Did you get these at Joe's?

111
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,300
Ryan, don't you have that feeling?

112
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,600
What?

113
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,900
That life is telling us
to take a wild,

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
impulsive jump into the unknown?

115
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,700
Not really.

116
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,800
So, you're good?

117
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,400
You don't have a need
to just let something

118
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,100
explode out of you,
consequences be damned?

119
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,400
What are we talking about?

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,200
Well, I was...

121
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,600
I guess it's just my birthday
and I'm getting sentimental.

122
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,200
All right, well, don't worry.

123
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,400
It's going to be great.

124
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,500
Okay?

125
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,000
All right, I've got to go.

126
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Thanks for this.

127
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,100
Hey, tonight, you want
to do something? See a movie?

128
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Yeah, sure, okay.

129
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
All right, great.

130
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,400
Oh, my God.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
Oh, hi, honey.

132
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,100
Sorry, I didn't
hear you coming down.

133
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,400
Mom, do you mind?

134
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,300
Because I still
have to eat in here.

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,000
What can I get you?

136
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,600
You want some scrambled eggs or
I could whip up some pancakes.

137
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,100
You cook, too? That's amazing.

138
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,500
It's just a talent I have.

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Yeah, one of many.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,900
I'm seriously never
going to stop barfing.

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,300
Caitlin, don't be gross.

142
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
Me? Gross?

143
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,500
What's gross is Frank's dirty...

144
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,100
germy convict bag
is sitting on the counter.

145
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,000
I mean, what,

146
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,000
did the warden give that to you
as a going-away present?

147
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,200
Caitlin.
It's okay. It's okay.

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
It shouldn't be on the counter.

149
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,600
Though I actually
got it at REI.

150
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,400
Well, why bother with a bag?

151
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,700
You can just move in.

152
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,100
You spend enough
time here anyway.

153
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
Young lady, apologize.

154
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,100
I'm sorry, Frank.

155
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,400
Feel free to have as many
conjugal visits as you'd like.

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,500
You know, I... I
should get going.

157
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
I've got a job interview.

158
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,600
I'll walk you out.
Okay.

159
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,800
And we'll talk later.

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Mrs. Cohen?

161
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Holly.

162
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
I went to Harbor with Seth.

163
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Oh, hi.

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,500
Hi, are you here
for prenatal yoga?

165
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,300
Oh, yes, I am. And you?

166
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes. I just found out.

167
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,000
How far along are you?

168
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,800
Oh, not-not very.
I just found out, too.

169
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,500
Well, this class is great.
I told Missy, the instructor,

170
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,600
I have worked way
too hard for this body

171
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,800
to just let it turn
into some dumpy baby factory.

172
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,500
I mean, who says I can't
have a baby and a six pack?

173
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,100
I should probably
stretch before class.

174
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,300
Well, hold on just a second.

175
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,200
Hey, hos, come here.

176
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,500
This is Mrs. Cohen.

177
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,800
She just found out
she's pregnant.

178
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,600
Oh, my gosh!
Congratulations.

179
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,400
And you're not
even showing.

180
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,600
So...

181
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,600
should we let her in?

182
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,800
Oh, yeah.
Totally. She's ripped.

183
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,600
We formed a club.

184
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,600
Promised ourselves

185
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,300
we wouldn't turn out like Molly
the Mammoth over there.

186
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,100
Eww.

187
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,200
In nine months
I'm wearing my bikini.

188
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,700
I don't care what anyone says.

189
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,300
And I told Jerry
if I get too big,

190
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm inducing at eight months.

191
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,200
It's much easier
to lose the weight.

192
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,000
So do you want in?

193
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,800
We call ourselves the
Six-Pack Pack.

194
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,000
Isn't that like so cute?

195
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,500
Don't you just want to barf?

196
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,500
All the time.

197
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Summer, what's up?

198
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,800
Hey.

199
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,300
I am just picking up Seth.

200
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,100
Taking him to an art exhibition,

201
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,500
sponsored by GEORGE,

202
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,600
the Global Environmental Organization
regarding Greenhouse Emissions.

203
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,100
Seth's going to an art show.

204
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,500
Well, yeah, I mean,
he's going to art school,

205
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
and I like the environment,so
I thought it was the perfect date.

206
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,800
Sure.

207
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,100
So are you ready
for Taylor's party?

208
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
Oh, yeah, party's all set.

209
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,600
Even got her a present.

210
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,300
Really. Mind
telling me what it is?

211
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,900
Well, you know,
she likes translating

212
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,300
those French love poems?

213
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,800
I collected a few.

214
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,700
Had them bound for her.

215
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,100
Atwood, that is so romantic.

216
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,200
You know, nothing is as romantic

217
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,700
as the first time you tell
someone you love them,though, huh?

218
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,000
I, uh...

219
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,300
haven't told Taylor I love her.

220
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,100
You haven't?

221
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,300
Has she said something?

222
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,200
No. No, I-I just assumed.

223
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,000
You guys have been together

224
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,900
for a while
and you seem pretty happy.

225
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,300
I thought,"Why wouldn't you
have said I love you?"

226
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,300
I have an idea. Why don't you?

227
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,000
What?

228
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,700
For her birthday.

229
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,100
You should, because...

230
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,700
the book of poems is awesome, but
add that special little "I love you."

231
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,700
As as girl,I don't know, me personally,

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I got chills.

233
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,700
Does Taylor expect me to tell her
that I love her on her birthday?

234
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,700
What? No. I don't know.
I've got to go.

235
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,300
I can't stay, okay?

236
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,100
Well, thanks for meeting me.

237
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
I wanted to talk to you alone.

238
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,300
You're not going to do
anything pervy are you?

239
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Caitlin...

240
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,100
I care about your mom.

241
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
And considering my past,
I understand

242
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,200
why you're suspicious.

243
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,400
Look, I really don't care that
you went to prison, all right?

244
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,700
I mean, the Bullet went to prison
and he was awesome.

245
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,600
You're just boring.

246
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,300
I'm sorry, but it's
just the way it is.

247
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,500
Well, I have to say
I don't think that's fair.

248
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,300
You hardly know me.

249
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,500
Then say something funny.

250
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,500
What?

251
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,700
Make me laugh.

252
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,800
Fine.

253
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,300
I don't know what interests
a 15-year-old girl,

254
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
but your mother
doesn't think I'm boring.

255
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,400
Well, that's because
you're sleeping with her.

256
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,100
Can you not say
that kind of thing?

257
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,300
Well, what do
you want me to say?

258
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,700
I mean, is it true in prison

259
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,900
on your first day,
you got to make someone your bitch?

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Or what about the whole
dropping the soap thing?

261
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,200
I mean, really,why don't you guys
just install soap dispensers?

262
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,900
Hey, I make your mom happy.

263
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm just asking
for a chance here, Caitlin.

264
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Of course.

265
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
If it makes my mom happy.

266
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Oh, my God.

267
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,900
Oh... my God.

268
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,700
It's so beautiful. Just forget how the ocean ties us all together.

269
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,100
You know, he's so right.

270
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,700
If we aren't good custodians for our planet,

271
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,600
what right do we have to be here?

272
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Don't you think
that was amazing?

273
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,400
Mm-hmm.

274
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,000
I give it a three.

275
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,900
A three?

276
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,000
He put a radio transmitter
in a piece of trash,

277
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,000
threw it into the ocean,

278
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,400
followed it around for six years

279
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
just to show how pollution travels.

280
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,700
And you're giving it a three?

281
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,300
I'm gonna give it a three-and-a-half, then.

282
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,000
What about the part where
he followed it

283
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
through the oil fires in the Persian Gulf,

284
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,200
and he got third-degree
burns on his arms?

285
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,200
I know, but the camera work was terrible,

286
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,700
and what kind of film
stock was he using?

287
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,000
The oranges and reds
totally bled together.

288
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
He was just making a point
to show the health of our planet.

289
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,500
Yeah, but he's also
making a movie,and as a movie,

290
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,600
it sucks.

291
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Well, what about that one?

292
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,400
Where the turtle adopted the hippo
who was lost in the tsunami?

293
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,900
Mm-hmm.

294
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,900
That's pretty much the nature film
equivalent of a chick flick.

295
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Okay.

296
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,600
What about that? Where the family giraffes habitat was destroyed.

297
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,300
Yeah, shot like a perfume ad.

298
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,600
God, what is your problem,Seth?

299
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,300
I just want you to get excited
about something.

300
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,100
I am, about things
that are good.

301
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,200
But I could do one of these
doughnuts with both hands

302
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,100
tied behind my back.

303
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Really?Prove it.

304
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

305
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,300
Make a movie.

306
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,300
Are you serious?

307
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,800
Yeah.

308
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,100
I want see you do it better.

309
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I want to go watch the penguins again,

310
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,400
and don't you dare say anything.

311
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,600
Hey, I didn't know
you were coming by.

312
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,300
I was just at Spitzy's office.

313
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
You should have called.

314
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,900
Is everything all right?

315
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400
The people in Newport are awful.

316
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,800
Honey, you're
a little late to the party.

317
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,200
I've been saying that
for 20 years.

318
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,500
Has it gotten worse?

319
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,200
I mean, I know Julie and
some of the othersare bad, but...

320
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,100
What happened?

321
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,100
I was at this prenatal
yoga class and these young women,

322
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,800
they're monsters.

323
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,600
They wanted me to join the six-pack pack.

324
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,000
The what?

325
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,000
And then they talk about
inducing labor at eight months

326
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,300
so that they don't have
to gain weight.

327
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,300
Can we raise another child
around this?

328
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Oh, honey, Newport's always had
that element,

329
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,200
and still we managed
to have life.

330
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
And not everybody's like that.
You know what?

331
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,400
Spitz has been wanting us
to meet his wife.

332
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,200
How about we do
dinner tomorrow?

333
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,000
Restore your faith in humanity.

334
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,300
All right.

335
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
But more importantly,

336
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,900
do you think they'll let me
join the six-pack pack?

337
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,500
I've been doing my sit-ups.

338
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Come on, hit me with your best shot.

339
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,100
Go ahead, come on, wind up.

340
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm not a beast!

341
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,500
Oh, God, he really loves her.

342
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,600
And she is never going
to know how he feels,

343
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,000
because he can't tell her.

344
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,500
Isn't that tragic?

345
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,000
Yep.

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
I mean, how could you do that?

347
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,100
How could you just let the love
of your life slip away

348
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,400
because you were too afraid to
tell them how you really felt?

349
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,100
Well, maybe she's better off.

350
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,100
Uh-huh.

351
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,000
Did you get that from the scene

352
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,700
where she was about to be
burned at the stake?

353
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,500
No, she's a beautiful woman,
he's a hunchback

354
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,300
who lives in a bell tower.

355
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,300
The chances of it working out...

356
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,900
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.

357
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,700
If he at least told
her how he felt,

358
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
then maybe there would be
a way to work things out.

359
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,700
You know, they could
have a life together.

360
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,300
Or you know,
at least four more years.

361
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,600
Why did you save me?

362
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,500
But the archbishop...

363
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Ryan, I'm not talking
about the movie.

364
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,100
It's... There's just moments
in everyone's life,

365
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,800
and if you just let them
slip away, then...

366
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,900
then they're gone forever.

367
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
And that's the tragic
thing about life.

368
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,700
Don't you feel that way?

369
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,800
Taylor.

370
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,000
I...

371
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,400
...missed the last
part of the movie.

372
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,000
Would you mind
rewinding it a little?

373
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,200
Sure.

374
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,700
Thanks.

375
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,200
Lonely, huh?

376
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,200
Better get used to it, buddy.

377
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Good morning.

378
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,600
If you say so.

379
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,400
What's that?

380
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,400
This is the obituary for mine
and Ryan's relationship.

381
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,300
A rose, plucked
before its time.

382
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Uh-huh, English?

383
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,400
I wrote a letter to the Dean of Berkeley,

384
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,700
telling him that I must
respectfully decline the scholarship,

385
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,700
and he should offer it to the next candidate.

386
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
So you're saying no?

387
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,200
What happened with Ryan?

388
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
I tried, Summer, I really did.

389
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,200
The moment was upon us.

390
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,900
We were staring
into each other's eyes,and...

391
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,600
And he just didn't say it.

392
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,700
You know, sometimes I just want
to grab him and tie him

393
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,000
to a chair and shoot him full
of sodium pentathol

394
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
and see what spills out.

395
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Why don't you?

396
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,000
You don't think it's too crazy?

397
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Because I was thinking
if the two of us just tackled him

398
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,100
and then we could
tie him down...

399
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
I wasn't talking literally.

400
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,400
Oh.

401
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,500
Do you love him?

402
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, I really do.

403
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Do you think he loves you?

404
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,900
Well, sometimes he grabs my hand
and he squeezes it

405
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,700
for no reason.

406
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I mean, what else could that mean?

407
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,600
Okay. So we just need to loosen
his tongue a little.

408
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,100
But how are we going to...

409
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,500
Summer Roberts, you bad thing.

410
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,500
Okay, you know what,

411
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,600
a trip to the Robert's
wine cellar is in order.

412
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,900
What the hell is he doing?

413
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,600
Morning.

414
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,100
Morning.

415
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Hey, are y all right?

416
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,800
Yeah, it's just a cramp.

417
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,700
How far did you go?

418
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,600
Mm, nine, ten miles.

419
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,400
Oh. Wouldn't it be easier
if you just said,"Sandy,

420
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,700
there's something bothering me.
Can you give me some advice?"

421
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Yes, it would,but where's the fun in that?

422
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,400
Let me guess.

423
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
You're trying to decide
if you love Taylor

424
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,700
so you can tell her
on her birthday.

425
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Huh?

426
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
You've been dating for a while,

427
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
things are good,
birthday's tomorrow.

428
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,800
Bingo.

429
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,100
Yeah. You're good.

430
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,000
So? Do you love her?

431
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,000
Uh, honestly I'm scared.

432
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,500
Good, you should be.

433
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,100
That's reassuring.

434
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,400
Well, it might be the most
powerful thing

435
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,800
you can say to another person.

436
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,500
It changes everything.

437
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,600
Now for heaven's sake,
if you don't feel it,don't say it.

438
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,500
Yeah, it's just I think
she's expecting it.

439
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,600
And to not say it...

440
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,000
It's like saying
you don't love her.

441
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,000
Exactly.

442
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Well, do you care about her?

443
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,900
Of course.

444
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,200
Do you enjoy being with her?

445
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,700
More than with anyone.

446
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,700
Tell her that.

447
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,600
It won't be exactly what she wants
to hear,but it'll be honest.

448
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,700
All right.

449
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Can you tell me something?

450
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,600
Sure.

451
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you have any idea
why Seth is filming the pool?

452
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,700
Hey, check it out, man.

453
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Summer challenged me to make
this pretentious art film,

454
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,300
so I'm making one called
Six Hours In The Pool.

455
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,000
Sounds great.

456
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Yeah, I'll tell you
about it later.

457
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Uh, Taylor called.

458
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
She wants you
to go over there for dinner.

459
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, okay.

460
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah. Okay.

461
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,000
Ah, it's perfect.

462
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Look, Frank, I get
that men have urges,

463
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,600
and I imagine prison is
one of those places where

464
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,200
those urges get twisted, but...

465
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,700
Julie...

466
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,100
I've never even heard of clown porn.

467
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,000
I mean that photo where they're all
stuffed into the little car...

468
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
It's not mine.

469
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,200
Oh, really?

470
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,300
It was just in your bag,
along with... this?

471
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,400
I mean, which one of us
is supposed to wear this?

472
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
Julie, none of this is mine.

473
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,000
So someone just went
into your bag, planted a wig

474
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,600
and some really bad clown porn.

475
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,000
Who would...

476
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,600
Oh... Caitlin.

477
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,200
Julie, it's all right.

478
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,900
No, Frank, it's not.

479
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,400
My daughter is trying to
sabotage this relationship.

480
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,600
And where would she get
her hands on clown porn?

481
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
She's just hazing
me, you know?

482
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,900
It'll be good for me to show
her that I can take it.

483
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
Itll blow over.

484
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
It's not serious.

485
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,100
Did you see  50?

486
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,900
How much more of this is there?

487
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,600
Five hours and 58 minutes.

488
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,000
What are you doing?

489
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,500
I'm not going to sit here
and watch six hours of the pool.

490
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,700
I told you to become
engaged in something.

491
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,100
Instead, you just set up a tripod.

492
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,300
It's a satire.

493
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,600
It's a comment on the lack
of artistic rigor...

494
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,600
No, it's you being lazy.

495
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
How many naps did you take
while you made this?

496
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,700
I took two to res...

497
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,000
Do you feel like you're
overreacting a little bit?

498
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,200
I mean, what does
it really matter?

499
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,800
That's the problem, Seth.

500
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,700
You did this because you chose
the path of least resistance.

501
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,400
You know, you could have
made a movie about anything

502
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,700
in your life,
and instead you chose this.

503
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,000
So what am I supposed to do?
Follow Ryan around with a camera

504
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,000
until he punches someone?

505
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,600
Yes, anything that engages
you in the world.

506
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
What is the point?

507
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,900
Well, if nothing else,it's important to me.

508
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,400
Thanks.

509
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,800
Mr. Spitz.

510
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,300
How are you?

511
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,800
Kirsten, how's it going?

512
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,500
Hello, Jason.

513
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Listen, you guys, I want you
to meet my wife, com.

514
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,300
No way, really?

515
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900
Well, then what did she say?

516
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,700
Honey, honey.

517
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, my God.

518
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,600
What a complete ho-bag.

519
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,900
Honey.

520
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,400
I got to go.
Call me back.

521
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,700
Love you, bitch.

522
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
Hi.

523
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,700
I am so sorry.

524
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,000
Kirsten and Sandy Cohen,
this is Carrie, my wife.

525
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,300
So nice to meet you.

526
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,000
You, too.

527
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,000
That was my girlfriend.

528
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,600
She's having trouble dating this guy,

529
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,200
and the guy's wife is
all like, uh, "I'll kill you."

530
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,500
Wow, I imagine that could
be a little hard to handle.

531
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,500
Oh, whatever.Not my problem.

532
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,700
So, Carrie, you're from Newport?

533
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,700
Oh, yeah, born and bred.

534
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,700
Really. Interesting.

535
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,400
Oh, now, Sandy,let's get to it.
How can we convince Jason here

536
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,600
to get out of that soup kitchen
he calls an office

537
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,000
and get a real job?

538
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,900
Oh, thanks, that's good.

539
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
For luck.

540
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,300
Uh, actuylor, I'm not
that big a wine drinker.

541
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,500
I know, you can't have
coq au vin without the vin.

542
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,900
Well, that's true.

543
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,100
Okay.

544
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,500
You know, I feel kind of bad, you making
dinner the day before your birthday.

545
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,400
No, it's my pleasure.

546
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,000
Absolutely.

547
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh, sorry.

548
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:06,800
It's okay.

549
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm nervous 'cause I've never
cooked for you before.

550
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
Okay, cheers.

551
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,800
Oh, yeah.

552
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,000
Whoo, bottoms up.

553
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,900
Mmm.

554
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,200
Tasty.

555
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,900
So, uh...Oh, that's...

556
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So, Taylor, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

557
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,500
No, let's save all the serious
conversation for after dinner.

558
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,900
We don't want it to get cold.

559
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,800
Okay.

560
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,700
Hmm, I think I need another sip.

561
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,100
Wow, do you detect
a hint of blackberries?

562
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,700
Mm, no, I don't.

563
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,900
Try it.

564
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,600
It's fun, come on.

565
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,500
Uh...

566
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:47,600
Okay.

567
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,700
Mm.

568
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,700
Nope, no blackberries.

569
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,200
I think you need
to take a bigger sip.

570
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,100
You still go to your sorority rush?

571
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,000
Sandy, sisterhood doesn't
just end with graduation.

572
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,700
A Tri-Delt once,
a Tri-Delt forever.

573
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,100
Oh, but last year,I got so sick.

574
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,000
Totally embarrassing.

575
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,000
I can only imagine.

576
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
And I thought,"Carrie, what gives?"

577
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
Can't you hold
your liquor anymore?

578
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,700
Ugh! And then I realized
it was just morning sickness.

579
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Was that a relief.

580
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,300
You know, I'm afraid it's getting
a little late for us.

581
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh, no, no,no, no.

582
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
You are not running away.

583
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,900
This great bar
just opened up on Ocean.

584
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,800
When was the last time
you two did tequila poppers?

585
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,800
Maybe another time.

586
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh, tell me you're not bailing
because you're pregnant.

587
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,800
I mean, no offense,
but that is lame.

588
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,800
Carrie, no.
What?It's lame.

589
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,900
Actually, I'm an alcoholic.

590
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,200
Oh, God.

591
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,800
Me, too.

592
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Hey, after you have that thing,
we should totally go out.

593
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,200
You know, without
the two dish rags.

594
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,500
Oh, God!

595
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,300
Can you just take
that thing outside?

596
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,300
Oh, don't freak.
I'm not a psycho.It's our baby.

597
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
When we go out with the baby,

598
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,200
Carrie likes to have the nurse
sit nearby,a few tables away.

599
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,200
Oh, you know,Sandy,
I'm-I'm, uh, suddenly...

600
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,100
I'm, I'm not feeling well.

601
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
I'd better get you home.

602
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,200
Thank you both for
an unforgettable evening.

603
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,200
Jason, I'll talk to you Monday.

604
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,700
Yeah. Well,good night,and...

605
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,500
Hey, Kirsten,uh, remember,you can
call me for baby advice anytime.

606
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
Sure.

607
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,600
Losers.

608
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,100
I don't understand
how you're not drunk.

609
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,700
Oh, it's the Atwood genes.

610
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,300
We're built to withstand
massive quantities of alcohol.

611
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,000
Ooh.

612
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,100
Here we go.Here's the bed.

613
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,300
Okay, all right.

614
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Now we're just gonna...
Whoa. That's good.

615
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,400
But if I can't get you drunk,
you'll never tell me you love me.

616
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, Taylor.
I know, I know.

617
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,300
Bad Taylor.

618
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,100
I shouldn't have tried
to get you drunk.

619
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,400
Just like I shouldn't have
pretendedto be your sleep therapist,

620
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,700
or rented Roger the homosexual,
or stalked you wearing

621
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,400
a Groundhog costume, or...

622
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,700
What else did I do?

623
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,000
I-I think that's it.

624
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,500
I'm going to go to sleep now.

625
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,600
Oh.

626
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,000
Good-bye, Ryan.

627
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
It was nice.

628
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,900
Taylor.

629
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,700
Taylor?

630
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,800
Are you pretending to go to sleep,
thinking I'll tell you I love you

631
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
while you're unconscious?

632
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,700
Maybe.

633
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,000
Don't laugh at me.

634
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,100
I'm not.

635
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,700
It's hard dating someone
who doesn't tell you how they feel

636
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,400
and always having to
interpret hand squeezes and...

637
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,200
I love you.

638
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,200
What?

639
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,500
I love you.

640
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
You do?

641
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,300
Uh, yeah.

642
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,200
I can't believe
you just said it.

643
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,200
Neither can I.

644
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Oh, I love you, too.

645
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Oh, good.

646
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,500
Yay!Yay!

647
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Now we can go to Berkeley together.

648
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,900
What?

649
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

650
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,000
I got into Berkeley.

651
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,000
I applied, and I got this letter,
and put it on my desk and...

652
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,500
Ryan Atwood.His face
betrays no emotion,

653
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,100
but what passions lurk
behind those eyes?

654
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,700
Answering that is the purpose
of this film.

655
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
Come with me, my friends.

656
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,700
I thought the movie was about the pool.

657
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,100
Summer didn't really take
to six hours of the pool.

658
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,100
She wanted me to make a movie
in which I engage with people.

659
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,700
What is Ryan Atwood
wrapping so intently?

660
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,600
Taylor's birthday present.

661
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Ah, Taylor Townsend,
the fast-talking Eve Harrington

662
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
who melted Ryan Atwood's heart.

663
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,400
Tell us, Ryan,how does it feel
to have Dean Hess's sloppy seconds?

664
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,000
Or what did you get her?Either one.

665
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,500
Um...

666
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
well, uh, one of her hobbies is
translating French love poems,

667
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,300
so I had them bound for her.

668
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,000
Wow.That is really romantic.

669
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,200
Well, it's,it's not that romantic.

670
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,200
Are you kidding?

671
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,700
You may as well tell her
you love her.

672
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's, uh, it's actually
a little late for that.

673
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,200
What?

674
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,300
Yeah.

675
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,500
And then what happened?

676
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,300
Well, we finished dinner
and he still wasn't drunk,

677
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
so I suggested a drinking game.

678
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I called it "Drink."

679
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,200
Whenever I said "drink,"

680
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,000
we drank.

681
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,800
Simple but effective.

682
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,400
Yeah, a little too effective.

683
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,800
I ended up on the coffee table
singing "Part of Your World"

684
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,500
and telling him he was my Prince Eric.

685
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,300
Uh, did he say it?

686
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,400
Yes.

687
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,100
He did?!

688
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,500
Yeah!

689
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,400
Oh, my God,that's amazing.

690
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,900
Ow.Ryan told you he loved you.

691
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,200
I know.

692
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,100
I mean, I think he said it.

693
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah, this feeling just kind of
came over me and...

694
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,300
I couldn't stop myself.

695
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
So why the long face?

696
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,000
You regretting it?

697
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,800
Well...

698
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,500
it turns out she applied
to Berkeley without telling me,

699
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,200
and now...Your spur-of-the-moment
"I love you" issuddenly committing you

700
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,700
to four more years.

701
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
The plot thickens.

702
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,400
I'm not saying it'd be bad.

703
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,600
It just seems like all of
a sudden we're going mach five.

704
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,400
You'd like to turn down
the heat a little.

705
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,600
He definitely said it.

706
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,000
Absolutely.

707
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,400
I think.

708
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Well, don't you
think you'd remember?

709
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,900
I don't know; it hurts.

710
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,900
Summer,what am I going to do?

711
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,900
I can't just ask him,by the way,
"did you tell me you loved me last night?

712
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,900
Because I was too plastered
to remember."

713
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,400
Right.

714
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,100
Okay.

715
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,300
Today's your birthda right?

716
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,200
And I happen to know
that he got you a crazy,

717
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,400
romantic present.

718
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,700
So when you open it tonight,
why don't you just be like,

719
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
"Oh, my gosh,Ryan, I love you,"

720
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,100
and if he said it last
night, he'll say it again.

721
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You're a genius.

722
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Yes, I am; it's all up here.

723
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,400
It's just there might be
one other tiny little thing.

724
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,400
I'm not saying take it back,
but today's her birthday, right?

725
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
So she's going to be interpreting
every little thing.

726
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,700
So maybe you send her a message.

727
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,600
For instance,

728
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,300
that sends the message "You're the only girl in the world for me.

729
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,000
Let's move to a co-op in Berkeley."

730
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,000
Is that what you want to say?

731
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,500
We go off Ryan Atwood.
What will he do?

732
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,700
How will this situation
resolve itself?

733
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,200
You said something
about Berkeley?

734
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm not sure.

735
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,300
Maybe I was just talking
about him going to Berkeley.

736
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
That would make sense, right?

737
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,600
Morning, girls.

738
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,000
Happy birthday, Taylor.

739
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,000
Thanks, Julie.

740
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,100
Oh, I gave the mailman
that letter from the counter.

741
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,200
What letter?

742
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,300
The letter to Berkeley?

743
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,400
Yeah, I think so.

744
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,400
Oh, my God.

745
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,300
Oh, my God.

746
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,700
Uh-uh! Mister!
Mail carrier, sir.

747
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,800
Excuse me, please.

748
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
Um, could you wait?

749
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,200
Hi.I'm sorry.

750
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,300
Um, a woman in that house where
I live just gave you a letter

751
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,100
that she shouldn't have,and, uh,

752
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,600
I kind of need it back.

753
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,100
Ma'am, once the letter goes in the pouch,

754
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,900
it's the property of
the Federal government.

755
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,300
Okay, and I totally understand that,

756
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,100
but if you take that letter,I am going to lose

757
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,800
my place at Berkeley and the
chance to be with the man I love

758
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,000
and who I think loves me,

759
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,400
and, and 15 years

760
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,700
from now,when he is trapped
in a loveless marriage

761
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,200
and I have become
a cold, hard ice queen

762
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,100
for whom love is no more
than a distant memory,

763
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
it will come down to the fact
that on this morning,

764
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
which coincidentally happens
to be my birthday,

765
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,100
you obeyed the letter of the law at
the expense of simple, human charity.

766
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,800
Wow, that was amazing.

767
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,000
Can I have my letter now?

768
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
Yeah, sure.

769
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,300
Hey.

770
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,400
I didn't know you were a runner.

771
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,100
Yeah,it helps me
to work stuff out.

772
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
You should try it.

773
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
Maybe I will.Everything okay?

774
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah. No, I was just,uh, nearby.

775
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,300
I figured I'd stop in and say hello,

776
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,800
ask your advice on winning
over a 15-year-old Newport girl.

777
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Caitlin giving you trouble?

778
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,400
Well, things with Julie are great,
and I-I'm so grateful

779
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,100
to you and Taylor,but Caitlin, she just--

780
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,700
I don't know,she just seems to
want to shut me out.

781
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,100
And I know that you have some
experience with the Cooper women,

782
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,000
so...Well, a Porsche would
probably do the trick.

783
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,600
Yeah.

784
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,700
Yeah, yeah, that's not
really in my budget.

785
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Well,Caitlin's had a tough year.

786
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,600
You know.Once she sees that her
mom's happy,she'll come around.

787
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,800
Just be patient.

788
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,900
Ah... suddenly a Porsche
sounds like a bargain.

789
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,100
Right.

790
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,200
Uh, look,I, I got to get going,
help set up Taylor's party.

791
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
Oh, sure.Is that,
is that her present?

792
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,300
Oh, yeah, it's, uh--

793
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,000
she translated these French love poems

794
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,000
so I had them bound in
leatherfor her.

795
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,700
Oh, my son the romantic.

796
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,600
Yeah.

797
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
So I'll, uh, see you tonight.

798
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Yeah.

799
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,300
It's not that romantic.

800
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
Taylor, it's going to be fine.

801
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,500
Ryan's going to give you
a really romantic present,

802
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,500
tell you he loves you,and you guys are going

803
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,500
to wind up going to Berkeley
together.Don't worry.

804
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,700
Okay, yeah, I know.

805
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,200
Do you think I should act
surprised when I go to the party?

806
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,400
But it's not a surprise party.

807
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,200
Well, I know, but it might
make Ryan feel good.

808
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,200
Okay, it's a great idea.

809
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,000
Ah!

810
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,900
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday.Happy birthday.

811
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,900
Oh, my God, what a surprise.

812
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,800
Oh, I didn't know it was
a surprise party.

813
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,200
Just go with it, okay?It's Taylor.

814
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,700
Happy birthday.

815
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,400
This is a-amazing.

816
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, well, you deserve it.

817
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,500
You got a lot of
birthdays to catch up on.

818
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,000
Is everything okay?

819
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,800
Yeah, absolutely.
Let me get you a drink.

820
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,300
Okay.

821
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,600
Happy birthday.

822
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Thank you.

823
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,100
Happy birthday.

824
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,100
We can move.

825
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
I mean it.

826
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,300
Ryan and Seth will be gone
in six months.

827
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,600
We could put the house on the
market, throw a dart at the map.

828
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,700
Maybe it's time.

829
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,300
But this is our home.

830
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
So? We'll make some place
new our home.

831
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,500
You know?

832
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,200
We'll still have our memories.

833
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,300
But when Ryan and Seth
come home for the holidays,

834
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I want them to come
home to that house.

835
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,700
It was an idea.

836
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,100
Well, thanks, Sandy.

837
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,400
I just don't think I can.

838
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,100
Oh, my God.

839
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,900
It's a replica of the green
destiny sword from Crouching Tiger.

840
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,800
Oh, my God, thank you so much Seth.

841
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,800
Glad you like it.

842
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
It's so neat.
Open Ryan's present.

843
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay. Where is it?

844
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,700
Oh, no, no, no.

845
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,600
It's okay.

846
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,800
Ryan's embarrassed.

847
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,000
No, it's just,
it's um, personal.

848
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,200
Well, I hope so.

849
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,400
Oh, my God.

850
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,000
It's a...It's a dictionary?

851
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,300
That is practical.

852
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,300
Yeah, the guy said that it,

853
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,200
um, had more words than others.

854
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,400
Well, that's good, being
as it is a dictionary.

855
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,500
It's red-- that's a cool color.

856
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,700
I still love him,you know?

857
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,200
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be
telling you this.

858
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,800
No, I understand.
I worry about him a lot.

859
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,200
You know, I know making this
movie just seems so stupid,

860
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,700
but I just wanted him to get
excited about something, you know?

861
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,400
Anything.

862
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,800
Just give him a chance.

863
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,700
Seth will find his way.

864
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
I hope so.

865
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,100
He just seems a little lost.

866
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,400
Those are mine.

867
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,500
What do you think you're doing?

868
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,800
What? The guy likes clown porn.
I think everyone should know.

869
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,000
Do you have any idea how
humiliated Frank would be if he saw,

870
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,500
or if Ryan saw it?

871
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,400
It's his father,Caitlin.

872
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,700
Whatever.

873
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,200
Do not walk away from me.

874
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,600
I've tried to be understanding.

875
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,900
I'm sorry if Frank isn't as
hilarious as Bullit was.

876
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,500
It's not even about that.

877
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,700
Then what is it?

878
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,700
Is it the money?

879
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,300
Mom, look at us.

880
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,100
In the past year we've lost
Dad, we've lost Marissa,

881
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,300
we had Dr. Roberts and we lost him.

882
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,200
And then we got
the Bullit, lost him.

883
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,000
What makes you thinkthat this guy'
sgoing to stick around any longer?

884
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,300
Caitlin, am I crazy,

885
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,000
or did you say that it
was okay for me to date Frank?

886
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,400
Yes, to date him.

887
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,400
But it's been a week and he's
practically living in our house.

888
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Like he's family.

889
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,200
He is not family.

890
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
You and I are.

891
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,400
I mean, why can't we just act
like that for a little while?

892
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,900
Hey.

893
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
They're about to
bring out the cake.

894
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Everything okay?

895
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,100
Yes, everything's fine.Caitlin,
why don't you go back inside.

896
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,900
Taylor.

897
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,400
Taylor, I'm sorry.

898
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,100
I'm not crazy, right?

899
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,700
Last night, you did
tell me you loved me.

900
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,700
Yeah, I did.

901
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,600
Okay, then what?

902
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,800
Are you trying to
send me a message?

903
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,100
Do you wish you
hadn't said it?

904
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,500
No. Last night when I told you...

905
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,100
You mentioned going to Berkeley.

906
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
God, I knew it.

907
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,700
Ryan, yes, I applied to
Berkeley months ago.

908
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,800
Before you and
I ever started dating.

909
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,400
Oh.

910
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,200
And then, this, you and I
happened, and I thought,

911
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,600
I don't know, maybe.

912
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,500
And I guess I should have told
you, but I really needed to know

913
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,300
exactly how you felt first.

914
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I just think our planning
to go to college together,

915
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
it's a big decision.

916
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,400
Would you have said you loved me

917
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,100
if you'd known I'd
gotten in to Berkeley?

918
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,900
Great.

919
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
Wow, okay.

920
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm just going to go.

921
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,200
Taylor.

922
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
She's coming.

923
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,000
Happy birthday to you

924
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,500
Happy birthday to you

925
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Happy birthday dear Taylor

926
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,500
Happy birthday to you.

927
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,800
Come on.

928
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,900
This is where you blow out
the candles and make a wish.

929
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Don't worry.

930
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,700
Kirsten and I will
square up things here.

931
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,600
All right, great. Thanks.
And I gave Seth the car

932
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,200
to help carry the presents.

933
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
So where you going now?

934
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,700
Uh, I don't know.

935
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,100
I'll see you later.

936
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,900
Hey.

937
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,800
You okay?

938
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah. Sure.

939
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
But by the looks of it,
you and I aren't going

940
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,400
to be brother and sister
any time soon.

941
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,600
Oh, no.

942
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,800
What happened?

943
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,200
Honestly? It was me.

944
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,200
I mean, look, Ryan, I have
absolutely nothing against your dad.

945
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's just I really didn't want to
rush into an insta-family again.

946
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,600
I mean, how long
would this one last?

947
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,400
Like a month?

948
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,700
Well, you never know.

949
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,900
I, uh, moved in with the
Cohens and I gave it a week.

950
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,700
Here I am.

951
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,700
I just wish there was a way
you could tell if it was

952
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,600
all going to work out.

953
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,800
Yeah, but there isn't.

954
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
But I promise you, I will
always be your brother,

955
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,200
in a completely, non-creepy way.

956
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,100
Caitlin, honey, could
I talk to you?

957
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,700
Yeah.

958
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,500
Wait, Ryan, as your sister,
if you don't tell Taylor that

959
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,300
you love her, you're an idiot.

960
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,500
Oh.

961
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,300
She's right.

962
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,800
I just wanted him to get excited
about something, you know?

963
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,600
Anything.

964
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,900
Just give him a chance.
Oh, no.

965
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,000
Seth, I'm so sorry you
had to overhear that.

966
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,700
No, it's all right.
I mean it's true.

967
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,700
What I was going to say is, I think
what you made is really good.

968
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,500
Yeah, there's no
coherent theme.

969
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,200
Most of the shots are
too wide and the Dogma

970
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,200
thing has been done to death.

971
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,500
But you know, I get that you
wanted me to find something

972
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,000
that I'm passionate about,

973
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,000
the way you're passionate
about the environment.

974
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,200
But you love movies.

975
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,800
I do.
I love going to them

976
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,200
and then telling people
what's wrong with them.

977
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,000
What is it?

978
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
I could be a critic.

979
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,500
You mean spending your
whole life watching movies

980
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,800
and telling people
how terrible they are?

981
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,100
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

982
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,700
I just want you
to find something

983
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,700
that you really care about.

984
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,900
You want to go rent
An Inconvenient Truth?

985
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,000
Yes, I love that movie.

986
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,000
I just want to count the number
of gratuitously soulful shots

987
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,600
of Al Gore staring out an airplane window.

988
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,900
Do not insult Al Gore.

989
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,900
So what did you tell Frank?

990
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,000
I told him we needed
to slow it down.

991
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,000
Mom, if you really like him...

992
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
I do.

993
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,600
And he's not going away.

994
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,700
But I told him that right now
I need to be spending

995
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,200
some time with my daughter.

996
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Does that include
buying me ice cream?

997
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
Absolutely.

998
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
The hermit?

999
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
My soul card's the hermit?

1000
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,000
Are you kidding me?

1001
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,100
Okay, Esmerelda, I'd better go.
I guess I'll call you next year.

1002
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,000
Come in.

1003
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,300
Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting.

1004
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,700
No.

1005
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,100
I got you something.

1006
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Okay...

1007
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,300
Wait, these are all poems
that I've translated.

1008
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,100
I collected them,recopied them,
had them bound.

1009
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,500
Ryan, this is amazing.

1010
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,700
Are you sure this is from you?

1011
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,300
Taylor, I'm sorry.
I-I freaked out.

1012
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,600
What I said last
night, I meant.

1013
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,600
Really?

1014
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
I love you.

1015
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,200
And I don't want to lose you.

1016
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,200
So let's put it all on the table.

1017
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,800
Berkeley, Paris,

1018
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,400
Oxford, anything.

1019
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,200
I don't know what to say.

1020
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
That's a first.

1021
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,800
Oh, my God, Mom.

1022
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,100
It's okay, it's just...

1023
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
It's an earthquake.

1024
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,700
Get in here.Mom!

1025
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,700
Seth.

1026
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,900
Kirsten!
