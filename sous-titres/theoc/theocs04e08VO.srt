1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:01,467
The O.C.:

2
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:03,167
I thought you were going
to be a silent partner

3
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:05,067
Came to see my girlfriend.
What?

4
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:07,267
You need new recruits,
right? So sign us up.

5
00:00:07,334 --> 00:00:10,067
Your date doesn't pay you.
That... that's illegal.

6
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:11,267
Right.

7
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:12,568
 <i>I could put off RISD</i>
 <i>for a semester.</i>

8
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:13,767
We could both go back together.

9
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,167
You'd really put off
college for me?

10
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:16,434
You take it...
It's yours...

11
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:19,067
I found you.

12
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:20,401
 <i>I just had the weirdest dream.</i>

13
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:21,601
You were in it, I think.

14
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:23,301
I think you were in
my dream, too.

15
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:24,434
I'm really glad you're here.

16
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,800
Hey, I asked
you a question.

17
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,634
Yeah, no, it's just
some of these bugs

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,267
are really sort of stubborn.

19
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,301
I was using that.
Now you're not.

20
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,601
Gonna tell me
what's going on?

21
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:39,034
What if I told you
it's New Year's Eve

22
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,501
and we're on our way to Vegas?

23
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,201
I might hit you with this. Why
are the girls acting so strange?

24
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,867
I don't... I mean...
you know, I don't know.

25
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,900
SUMMER:
How long is it
supposed to take?

26
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,700
Five minutes.
How long has it been?

27
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:50,267
Okay-- four minutes
and 47 seconds.

28
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:51,833
You're lying. It's written
all over you face.

29
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,134
Well, then I shouldn't bluff
when we get to Las Vegas.

30
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:55,700
Look... what... man,
they're in the bathroom.

31
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:56,967
Why don't you just ask them.

32
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:58,000
13 seconds left.

33
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,000
Do I need to remind you
why you're even here right now?

34
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,167
11 more seconds.

35
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,767
Because you haven't
killed me yet?

36
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,833
What if there wasn't
enough pee?

37
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,601
No, because you didn't have any
New Year's Even plans
so you hijacked mine.

38
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:07,668
How many bars am I looking for?

39
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,700
Two, two bars.
Six more seconds.

40
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,000
I told you I'd pay you back.
Oh, my God, I can't look.

41
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,867
And now I'm collecting.
So tell me what's happening.

42
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:15,167
Oh, my God, three more seconds,

43
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,134
two more seconds,
one more second...

44
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:27,134
seven hours earlier

45
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:28,900
Here you go.

46
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,334
Last coffee of '06.

47
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:32,733
How much you hoping I don't
make that joke all day?

48
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,100
Not like I'll be
around to hear it.

49
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,501
So walk me through
your itinerary again.

50
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,367
You've got breakfast
with Taylor.

51
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,334
Back home to pack,
quick lunch, off to Vegas.

52
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,934
She still doesn't know
you're taking her?

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,967
Well, that's why
it's a surprise.

54
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:43,201
He's told me nothing.

55
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:46,501
And I just thought.
you know,since he went
to all of this trouble

56
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:48,967
it would be nice for me
to surprise him, too, and...

57
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:51,301
Summer, are you even
listening to me?

58
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,700
What? No... yeah...
every word.

59
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,833
'Cause you seem kind
of out of it.

60
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,434
I'm sorry, I'm just
still waking up.

61
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,967
You guys seem pretty
serious, though?

62
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:00,167
It's that old adage--

63
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:01,967
couples who have comas together,
stay together.

64
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,800
She won't think Vegas
is cheesy, will she?

65
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,201
Do you think it's cheesy
to get him lingerie?

66
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:09,000
Obviously, I'm going
to be wearing it,
but it's really for him.

67
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,201
Look, Taylor...
You're right.

68
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,967
it's way too soon
for lingerie.

69
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:14,034
Is he going to think I'm
some kind of kinky,
sex-starved, divorcee?

70
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,367
You're being paranoid.

71
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:18,501
Still, be careful, 'cause
people, they go to Vegas

72
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,534
and they come back married.

73
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,134
What about you and
Summer-- any plans?

74
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,334
Well, if it's
a typical night for us,

75
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:27,800
I'm probably in for
some Korean cinema, manga

76
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:29,700
and making new friends
on MySpace.

77
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,000
In other words...

78
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,733
No "plans"--
that's a dirty word.

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,334
That's right up there with
"responsibility" and "future."

80
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,934
There'll be plenty of time
for that when we're in college.

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,867
And she's on board with that?

82
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:41,334
Totally.

83
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,700
I hope I don't have
to kill him.

84
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:43,733
When are you
meeting Ryan?

85
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,167
Ooh, now.

86
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:46,634
All right, I will
see you tomorrow.

87
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,934
Happy New Year.

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,034
Happy New Year, Summer.

89
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Same to you.

90
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,334
Good luck tonight.

91
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,767
I'm sure everything
will just be great.

92
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,100
Oh, speak of the devil.

93
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:55,367
Summer.

94
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:56,401
Atwood.

95
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,467
Taylor.
Hi.

96
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:59,867
You looking forward
to your surprise tonight?

97
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:03,201
I am. Are you looking
forward to yours?
I am.

98
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,401
Ew. That's my cue.

99
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,568
Okay, here it is.

100
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:08,568
What is it?

101
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:09,568
Open it.

102
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,833
Hey.
Hi.

103
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,800
I wanted to talk to you
about what we're doing tonight.

104
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:19,967
Why talk when actions
speak so much louder
than words.

105
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,000
What is it?

106
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,034
I don't know.
Just open it.

107
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,267
Okay.

108
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,467
Oh, my.

109
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,601
Surprise.

110
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:29,134
"Jamaican me crazy."

111
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,601
It's funny because it's not.

112
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:35,267
Do you think I'm a whore?

113
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,900
What? No, no.

114
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,900
It's just...
I already have this.

115
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:41,167
You nut.

116
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,334
For a second there, I was like,
oh, major miscalculation.

117
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:44,534
No, no, no.

118
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:46,467
It's going to be
a great night.

119
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:47,201
All right, come here.

120
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,700
Yeah... You didn't make any
plans for us tonight, did you?

121
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:53,634
Well, I thought we would just...

122
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,967
What "Jamaican" up as you go?

123
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,134
You are
such a baby.

124
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,267
I'm done baby-sitting you.

125
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:59,434
Do you understand me?
I'm done.

129
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,867
JULIE:
I'm not questioning
the fantasy, Spencer.

130
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:08,434
We've all imagined doing it
with the delivery boy.

131
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,967
I am questioning whether we
should be paying for the pizza.

132
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:12,334
It's starting to add up.

133
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:15,101
We're running a male
prostitution ring, Julie.

134
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,034
Pizza's the cost of business.

135
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,900
Hey, who did we...?

136
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,633
Who'd we set Petrie Marchand
up with?

137
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,167
That guy you call
the Mambo King.

138
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,468
Oh, yeah.

139
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:24,501
My real question--

140
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:25,867
what do you know
about money laundering?

141
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,700
That'd be nothing. Why?

142
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,134
Because it's the holidays
and we're busy

143
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:33,367
and I can't keep filing all this
cash under "extra money."

144
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:36,167
I'll, um... I'll see
you later at the place.

145
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:37,834
Yeah.

146
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,201
That was Jimmy on the phone.

147
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,568
He's supposed to call
Kaitlin at midnight?
Yeah.

148
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,401
Well, he's hosting a party
on his boat.

149
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,301
And he wanted you to tell
Kaitlin he's sorry,

150
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,967
but he might be out
of cell phone range.

151
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:49,600
Poor Kaitlin.

152
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,967
I know she doesn't show it,

153
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:54,134
but I think she really,
really misses him.

154
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:56,301
Can I help you with something?

155
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,334
No, no.

156
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:59,101
No, I'm good.

157
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,434
Julie, I appreciate you handling
the bookkeeping,

158
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:02,501
but honestly,

159
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:04,167
I probably have
more experience.

160
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:07,234
Well... all the more reason
for me to learn.

161
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,034
I mean, what if you get hit
by a bus or something?

162
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,501
God forbid.

163
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,733
There must be something
I can do.

164
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,334
Some more coffee?

165
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,334
I got it at the place
on the corner.

166
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:24,234
Somebody going
on a coffee run?

167
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,834
I'll take a latte.

168
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,101
Hello, sweetheart.

169
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,167
Just thought I'd drop off
an invite to my soiree.

170
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:32,301
Yeah, Gordon, you
know, I received
like 11 of these in the mail.

171
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,700
Well, now you've got
an even dozen.

172
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:34,834
So read it to me.

173
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,900
"Gordon Bullit invites you
and a hot guest

174
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,267
to start 2007 with a bang."

175
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,501
(laughing)

176
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,234
That joke never gets old,
does it?

177
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:45,633
Been using it
since 1989.

178
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,867
So, uh...

179
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,733
what time do you want me
to send a limo?

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,034
You know, honestly, I'm not sure

181
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,367
that I'll get through
with everything here.

182
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:54,101
Damn it, hotcakes, when I
bankrolled this operation,

183
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,468
I thought I'd see you more,
not less.

184
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:58,301
Since I got back
from Riyadh,

185
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,501
we've had two dinner dates
and zero hanky-panky.

186
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,534
Well, it's
a new business, Gordon.

187
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,034
Well, hey, look, at least
let me get you

188
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,967
a bean counter to take care
of some of the paperwork.

189
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,401
Bullit, let me have that back.

190
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:14,267
Wow, you girls eat
a mess of pizza.

191
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,267
We work through dinner a lot.

192
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,767
Look, I really appreciate
the gesture, Bullit,

193
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:21,401
but I would prefer to do this
on my own, hmm?

194
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:23,534
Okay.

195
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,101
You coming tonight?

196
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,633
If I can.

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,067
Damn, woman.

198
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:34,568
(sighs)

199
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:37,434
And he requested me?

200
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,867
Yeah, all right, all right.

201
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:41,234
I'll see what I can do.

202
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,633
Okay.

203
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,633
Working on New Year's Eve?

204
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,633
Yeah, one of your homeless guys
from Thanksgiving

205
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,101
attacked a parking meter.

206
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,800
He couldn't remember his name,
but he remembered mine.

207
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,468
I was talking
about the sandwiches.

208
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:55,034
Oh, yeah, Ryan's putting
together a cooler for Vegas.

209
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,934
I'm his sandwich guy.

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,468
Cohens are natural
sandwich artists.

211
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,134
It's like our very own
super power.

212
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:03,334
Yeah, I don't know if
it qualifies us

213
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,134
for the Justice League, though.

214
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,201
What's up?

215
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,967
You've got that
"something's up"
look on your face.

216
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,800
Well, you know, probably
'cause something's up.

217
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:11,800
What'd you do?

218
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,501
More like what I didn't do.

219
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:16,633
Turns out Summer's expecting
me to make some elaborate
New Year's Eve plans.

220
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,101
Oh, romantic holiday plans--

221
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,201
definitely <i>not</i> a Cohen
super power.

222
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,733
We've got nine months
until we go to college.

223
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,900
This is the last time in our lives
we don't have to worry about stuff.

224
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,534
Yeah, yeah, the ladies don't
really buy that line, though.

225
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
You still have to show
her that you value her.

226
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:31,667
My advice...

227
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,334
Put some thought and effort

228
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,700
into making some real
New Year's Eve plans, pronto.

229
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,967
Well, my work
here is done.

230
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,401
I've got a date with
a bail bondsman.

231
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:43,201
And you and Summer have
a wonderful New Year's Eve.

232
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,867
And... be safe.

233
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:46,900
Hey.

234
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:49,401
Hey. You be safe, too,
in Vegas, will ya?
Yeah.

235
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:51,267
The sandwiches are
all ready. Good to go.

236
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:54,067
And if I do say so myself,
they're great.
Thank you, Sandy.

237
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,967
The only thing you have
to keep in mind--

238
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:57,568
make it personal.

239
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,733
I think I just got
the purr-fect idea.

240
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,834
Good man.

241
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,167
What was that about?

242
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:06,267
Oh, nothing-- just Summer
and I coming with you
to Vegas.
What?!

243
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,367
You may want to make
some more sandwiches.

244
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,534
I'm going to go
upstairs and pack.

245
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,800
You're late.

246
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,767
Yeah. I've been looking
for my book.

247
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,600
What book?

248
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,867
The one with everyone's
names, phone numbers.

249
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,501
(sighs)

250
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,834
I had it when
I was talking to you.

251
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,067
I put it down for a sec,
it was gone.

252
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,867
This has got to be a sign.

253
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,267
What are you
talking about?

254
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:36,534
Your father tried
to saddle me
with an accountant today.

255
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,334
What if he finds out
we've turned his investment
into a whorehouse?

256
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:40,434
Or if Kirsten finds out?

257
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,101
No, we need to shut
this down now.

258
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,434
Then... let's
just do tonight.

259
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,034
All right? We both
need the money.

260
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,867
We can manage without.

261
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,134
What if Neil
sells your house?

262
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,967
Where you going to live?

263
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:54,201
We're going to make
40 grand each.

264
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:57,934
Now, you want to close
down shop after that, cool,

265
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,468
but let's do tonight.
Come on.

266
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:02,800
We'll burn
everything tomorrow.

267
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,267
I'll light the match myself.

268
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,800
(knocking on door)

269
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,334
Frank, Frank, Frank.
Damn, damn, double damn.

270
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:17,034
Good to see you.
Good to see <i>you.</i>

271
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,667
Come on in.
Have a seat.

272
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,034
Can I fix you a drink?

273
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,900
No, I'm fine.

274
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:25,367
So, cowboy, what the hell you doing
in these neck of the woods?

275
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,234
Well, you... you once said,

276
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:30,167
if I ever needed a job...

277
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:33,733
Serious? Now, don't be jerking
the Bullit around.

278
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,867
I'm serious.
Well, now,

279
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,034
that's a good thing.

280
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:39,101
And I happen to have
a couple of places
I could use you pronto.

281
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,568
But, knowing you, you've
already picked something out.

282
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,101
You're not going
to believe this,

283
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,700
but I saw you invested
in a dating service.

284
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,900
(chuckles):
You're kidding, right?

285
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,501
A man of your talents?

286
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:51,301
I think there's
a future in it.

287
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:52,934
Yeah, but the tricky
thing there is,

288
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,034
my girlfriend, Julie--
she's kind of running that.

289
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,067
Really?
I know what you're thinking,

290
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,301
but it's not like
that barmaid in Daytona.

291
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,900
Now, that one,
she was a con artist.

292
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,934
And Julie's legit?
Absolutely.

293
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I mean, Julie's problem
is not thievery.

294
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,700
It's pride. She wants
to do everything herself,

295
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,301
and I get no chance to see her.

296
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,934
(phone rings)
Oh, wait. Bullit.

297
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,700
Oh, right. The dress shop.
Okay. On the way.

298
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,600
Sorry. I got to go.

299
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,301
Well, it was
good to see you.

300
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:21,900
You're going
to love Newport.

301
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,633
I'm sure I will.

302
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,101
Oh, and if Julie ever gets
less proud, you let me know.

303
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,401
I'd love to help out.

304
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:28,800
I'll do that.

305
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:29,800
Happy New Year, partner.

306
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:30,900
Same to you.

307
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:32,967
See you later.
Right.

308
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,800
Taylor,

309
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,067
you look terrible.

310
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:51,733
What's the matter?

311
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,067
Okay, can you keep a secret?

312
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,267
But I mean a big secret.

313
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:58,034
Like, a really big secret.

314
00:11:58,101 --> 00:11:59,301
Yeah.

315
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,067
I think you might be pregnant.

316
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,234
Um... okay.

317
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,067
First of all,
if I were pregnant,

318
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:11,468
that would be <i>my</i> secret.

319
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,700
And second of all,
I'm late, not pregnant.

320
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,134
And how did
you know that?

321
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,600
Okay, when I went
to visit you in Providence,

322
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,034
I remember that
you had your period,

323
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,067
which means you should have had
it again a week and a half ago.

324
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:22,700
But the box of tampons
that you bought

325
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,401
two weeks ago
hasn't even been opened.

326
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,800
Summer, have you had unsafe sex?

327
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:30,834
Well, there was that time
where Seth visited...

328
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,800
(scoffs):
Summer...

329
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,334
I didn't want

330
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,034
the pharmaceutical companies
playing slumlord with my eggs.

331
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,667
Well, what about condoms?

332
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,767
Latex smells funny.
So do diapers.

333
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,967
Taylor!
What? Don't pretend
you're not worried about this,

334
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:42,834
because you've been
preoccupied all day.

335
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,101
I am not pregnant.

336
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,534
Hmm. Well, prove it.

337
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
Get that away from me.

338
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,733
Hey, you decent?

339
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,633
Seth, actually,
Summer and I were just having

340
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,834
a little girl time,

341
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,568
so if you could
just come back in 15...

342
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:56,800
It's so good
to see you!

343
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,568
Hey, wow! Look at
all this affection,

344
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:01,401
and I haven't even told you
my surprise yet.

345
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:05,167
Though, to be fair, it's
really more of Ryan's surprise.

346
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,800
Seth.
But, yes, the four of us
are going to Las Vegas.

347
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,201
Ryan is in
the car, waiting.

348
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,301
Ryan's taking me to Vegas?

349
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,301
And I'm taking you,
Mrs. What-Are-Our-
Plans-For-New Year's.

350
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,967
Now, why don't you
to get packed

351
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,034
so we can get
on the road.
Actually, Summer
and I just need

352
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:18,334
to dash into the bathroom
really quick and...

353
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:19,834
That is a great idea.

354
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,800
That is the best
idea ever!

355
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,633
Why don't you help me
pick out what to bring?

356
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,034
Okay.
Okay.

357
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:27,900
Okay, well, I'm just going
to pack this toothpaste

358
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,401
because we might want it

359
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:47,501
--TAYLOR:
 <i>Hey, Ryan, can we stop soon?</i>
 <i>Summer and I have to pee.</i>

360
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,067
RYAN:
 <i>Oh, yeah? Sure. You know what?</i>

361
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:50,933
 <i>Next chance we get,</i>
 <i>I'll get some gas.</i>

362
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,967
TAYLOR:
 <i>Great.</i>

363
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,033
--Summer, I think, when we stop,

364
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,734
we should try out
our new toothpaste.

365
00:13:58,801 --> 00:13:59,900
Um...

366
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:01,234
Breath's a little stale.

367
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,834
SETH:
 <i>Ryan, are you ready</i>
 <i>for a sandwich?</i>

368
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:16,000
Hmm? Listen, I know
we're crashing,

369
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,200
but I promise you,
soon as we get to Vegas,

370
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:22,033
I'm going to buy you
the best room
Sandy Cohen's money can buy.

371
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,701
You're rescuing me,
and I want to pay you back.

372
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:26,801
Yeah, all right.

373
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,367
Hey, Seth,
hypothetically speaking,

374
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:34,734
if I was your girlfriend,
and I had health issues,

375
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,033
would you want
to know about them?

376
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,067
Um... I don't know.
What kind of health issues?

377
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,267
Diarrhea of the mouth.

378
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:41,234
Can we just,
like, stop talking

379
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,367
and turn the music up
and just drive, please?

380
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,768
Summer, there is
something in your hair.

381
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,801
Let me get it
out for you.

382
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,300
(whispering):
What are you doing?

383
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,134
I think you need
to tell Seth.

384
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,033
No. I don't think
he could handle it.

385
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,300
How do you know?

386
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,401
Aw, crap!
Forgot my toothbrush.

387
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,467
I'm going to have
to use my finger.

388
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,567
See? He's a child.

389
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:06,000
Did you get
a toothbrush, too?

390
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,667
Seth!
Don't...!

391
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:08,634
Oh.

392
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:10,667
Is this...?

393
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,467
Mine! My toothpaste.

394
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:13,601
RYAN:
What's going on?

395
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,634
Nothing. It's
just this is...

396
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:18,768
extra whitening, and Seth
needs tartar control.

397
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,134
Badly.

398
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,801
(whispering):
Thank you.

399
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:41,000
Mom?

400
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,601
Okay, the coast is clear, dude.

401
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,801
Yeah. She's probably
still at work.

402
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:47,367
You sure we did
the right thing

403
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:49,634
but not buying that little
number with rhinestones?

404
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:51,967
You asked me for my help
to pick out a dress

405
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:54,000
for my mother, so trust me.

406
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:56,634
Well, I just want to make sure
she feels like a million dollars

407
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,401
at my party tonight, that's all.

408
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,701
That's assuming
she finishes work on time.

409
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:03,033
I offered to get someone in
there to help the woman out.

410
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,634
She flat out refused me.

411
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:06,801
You really like her, don't you?

412
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:07,967
Oh, yeah, peanut.

413
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,634
She's under my skin.

414
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:11,067
The whole time I was in Riyadh,

415
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,601
didn't once try
to peek under a girl's burkha.

416
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,100
So, uh...

417
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,667
what you got going on tonight?

418
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,434
Well, I'm supposed
to talk to my dad,

419
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,367
but his boat's out
of cellphone range.

420
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:23,067
So, whatever. It's no big.

421
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:25,401
Well, dang, girl, if you're
free, why not come to my party?

422
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,401
Because I'm 40?

423
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,634
No, because
it's New Year's Eve,

424
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,100
and I got not one prince,
but two coming.

425
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,267
William and Harry?

426
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:35,801
Mm-mm--
Samir and Abbas. Saudis.

427
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,701
About your age,
and not a bad catch,

428
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:39,634
if you don't mind
raisins in your chicken.

429
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,334
You like two-steppin'?
It's a dance we do

430
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,601
in Texas-- I can show you
tonight if you'd like.

431
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:48,267
You can hold
your breath for that.

432
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,768
All right. Well,
I appreciate your help.

433
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,768
You take care now.

434
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,100
Ignore her.

435
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,667
Come again?

436
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,801
She refused your help,
so ignore her.

437
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:00,200
It's what I always do.

438
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,234
Here you go.

439
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,167
What's this for?
In case you change

440
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,601
your mind, come to the party,

441
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:13,267
you might want to buy a dress
or a lollipop or something.

442
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,534
Yo, Frank. 
Yeah, Bullit.

443
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:21,067
What's going on
this afternoon?

444
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:35,067
It's up to you.

445
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:37,334
You'll be there
when I take it?

446
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,534
Of course.

447
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,834
Let's go.

448
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:52,834
Hey, uh...
is everything all right?

449
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,667
You, uh... were acting
kind of strange in the car.

450
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:56,801
Uh-huh.

451
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,134
Okay, I just wanted to, uh,

452
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,434
you know, apologize.

453
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:01,868
I know this trip to Vegas
is supposed to be us,

454
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:03,567
but Seth kind
of hijacked it

455
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:04,801
to get out of
the doghouse, so

456
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,801
what are you
going to do?
Yeah, I know.

457
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,434
Uh... anyway,
you know, he, uh...

458
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:09,834
he's getting us a room.

459
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,601
So at least
we'll be alone.

460
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:16,667
Yeah. Uh... I don't think
that we should do that.

461
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,768
In fact,
I know that we shouldn't.

462
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,300
Uh... What...
what are you talking about?

463
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,634
Obviously, we both thought
that we were going to...

464
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,200
It's Vegas,
and there's lingerie,

465
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:27,501
and it would be great,
trust me,

466
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,200
but I just want our
first time to be special,

467
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,768
and tonight is
just not the night.

468
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,667
Okay? Sorry.

469
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,200
I got to go.

470
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,267
I have a question.

471
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,967
And let's pretend
I wasn't eavesdropping.

472
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,501
Are you absolutely positive

473
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,801
that you haven't
had sex yet with Taylor?

474
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:53,667
Not even, like a,

475
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,200
"I feel guilty about this
because you're kind of wasted,

476
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,434
but how did that
happen?" mistake?

477
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,267
Okay, I'll take
that as a no.

478
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:01,900
Hey, look at that.

479
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,801
It's a green alien. It's
crazy. Well, these windows

480
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:05,267
aren't going to wash themselves.

481
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:08,267
Seth, what's going on?

482
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,834
Okay, "Remove the test stick
from the foil wrapper."

483
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,200
Did that already.

484
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:15,200
"Position the stick
with the test windows

485
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:16,734
"facing away from 
the urine stream,

486
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,967
"and place the
absorbent tip

487
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,834
under the stream
of urine."

488
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,033
Stream of urine, Summer.

489
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,801
Uh...

490
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,601
You need something?

491
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,667
Oh, no. Thank you.

492
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:39,334
Who is it?
A slutty alien. Did you pee?

493
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,033
I'll go outside.
Wait, wait. Don't leave me.

494
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:54,067
May I help you?

495
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:55,434
You must be Julie.

496
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,567
And you are...?

497
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,933
(laughs):
I told you she was hot.

498
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,367
Julie, meet
my buddy Frank.

499
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,801
He's gonna put your
books in order.

500
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,567
Didn't I say no to this?

501
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:13,467
Oh, yes, you did, but a little
birdie told me to ignore you,

502
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:15,434
so that's
what I'm doing.
Gordon...

503
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:17,434
Is no longer willing
to negotiate.

504
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:18,967
Now, let's let Frank
do his thing.

505
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:20,467
Meantime,

506
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:22,567
let's get you out of
that Pilgrim outfit

507
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:25,534
and into a ball gown, which
I happen to have bought you.

508
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,868
And, Frank,

509
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,501
if you get finished by midnight,
you come play with us,

510
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,567
you hear?
I will.

511
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:31,634
Oh, Julie.

512
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,868
It was nice meeting you.

513
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:38,868
Nice meeting you, too, Frank.

514
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,868
Come on, sweetie.

515
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:49,967
Why are the girls
acting so strange?
Dude, I don't, you know...

516
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,267
12 more seconds.

517
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,768
11 more seconds.
What if there wasn't enough pee?

518
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,334
Ten seconds.
Here, let's switch.

519
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,134
How many bars am
I looking for?
Two. Two bars.

520
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, my God, four more seconds.
Oh, my God, I can't look.

521
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,801
Three more seconds.
two more seconds...
Oh, my God.

522
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,467
one more second.
Okay, I can't do it.

523
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,667
Just don't look at it,
I can't breathe...
Okay, okay...

524
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:07,567
Sit down. Sit
down, sit down.

525
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:08,667
I can't breathe.
Here, breathe, breathe.

526
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,067
Breathe into this.

527
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:12,567
Breathe deep breaths.

528
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:14,667
Look, Summer, I'm not gonna
make you do anything.

529
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:16,067
It's totally your decision.

530
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:19,000
But whatever you do, it
doesn't change the truth,

531
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:21,167
and-and in a few hours,
it's gonna be the new year.

532
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,300
Do you want to start that year
as an adult,

533
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,134
with your eyes
wide open, or...

534
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,868
with your head in the sand?

535
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,334
Give it to me.

536
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:32,634
Oh, my God.
What?

537
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,100
It's gone.
What?!

538
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,933
I don't believe it.

539
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,401
Well, do you think
she cheated on you?
No.

540
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,534
I mean, I-I can't believe
she didn't tell me.

541
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:42,167
Well, I'll wash the car if you
want to go smash something.

542
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,734
Like maybe
that big green bug.

543
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,701
Hey!

544
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:47,667
Excuse me! I...

545
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:52,334
You... Follow that alien!
She stole my purse!

546
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:54,467
What?
She just stole my purse.

547
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:56,534
What? Well...
Get in the car!

548
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:58,000
She just stole it from
underneath the bathroom.

549
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:58,933
Seth, hurry up!

550
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,900
 <i>She's getting...</i>

551
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:01,367
 <i>She's right there! Go!</i>

552
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,100
 <i>Ryan, go! Go!</i>

553
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,167
 SETH:
 <i>Geez!</i>

554
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:13,268
SETH:
 <i>Can't we just buy you</i>
 <i>a new purse and cancel</i>

555
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:14,368
your credit cards?
No,

556
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,567
we need that purse.
Why?

557
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,634
Because...

558
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,767
Of the pills

559
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,134
that I have in there.

560
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,167
For the allergy I have
but never told you guys about.

561
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,767
It's just...
nothing serious.

562
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,934
And she needs to take
the pills before midnight.

563
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:25,767
Right.

564
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,167
And since we are

565
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:29,301
in the middle of the desert,
and nowhere near

566
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:31,967
a pharmacy, it has to be
the pills in that purse.

567
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,433
Sorry.

568
00:22:34,934 --> 00:22:36,667
You're being awfully quiet.

569
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:39,533
There's a lot of
that going around.

570
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,600
Hey, I see brake lights.

571
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
look liked

572
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:02,101
SUMMER:
Did anyone get
a good look at her face?

573
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,800
SETH:
She's an alien-- it's not an
easy thing to lose in a crowd.

574
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:12,700
I don't believe it.

575
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,301
Everyone is an alien.

576
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:16,334
(exhales):
Hey, we're gonna go this way.

577
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,433
Okay, we'll
go this way.

578
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,567
TAYLOR:
But...

579
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:23,134
Come on. I promised
you some alone time.

580
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:47,400
Hey.
Mm... hey.

581
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,500
Spencer, let me
ask you a question.

582
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,600
When you paired these
ladies up with their dates,

583
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,734
did you know they were
coming to <i>this</i> party?

584
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,400
You don't think Kirsten's gonna
smell something fishy, do you?

585
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,600
No, no. I think
we're taking the fish

586
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,600
and slapping her
in the face with it.

587
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,734
She knows these women
are our clients.

588
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,301
Maybe she won't notice--
isn't she an alcoholic?

589
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:05,667
Recovering, unfortunately.

590
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:07,867
So did you find anything
out about Frank?

591
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:09,234
Not a lot.

592
00:24:09,301 --> 00:24:10,533
He's a friend of my dad's.

593
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,834
I'm not sure
where they met.

594
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:13,600
He took the series seven
a month ago,

595
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:14,901
but before that, nothing.

596
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,533
Doesn't exist.

597
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,067
So what do you think?

598
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:21,167
Well, I'm thinking maybe...
CIA or Special Ops?

599
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:24,134
No, Deep Throat, I mean, what
do you think we should do?

600
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,101
Does he seem like
someone we can bribe?

601
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:29,134
Eh, I wouldn't bank on it--
my dad's big on loyalty.

602
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,201
Speaking of...
where is he anyway?

603
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:34,201
He's over there introducing
Kaitlin to some Saudi princes.

604
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:36,600
This is Samir--
and I call him Sam.

605
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,734
And this is Abbas--
and I call him Boss.

606
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,067
Oh.
You are, uh,
Kait... Kaitland?

607
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:43,533
Kaitlin.
Kaitlin.

608
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,834
Kaitlin.
Kaitland.

609
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,433
Yeah.
Kaitland.
Okay, Kaitland.

610
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:58,400
(sighs)

611
00:24:58,467 --> 00:24:59,700
He says there's
no coat-check,

612
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,433
and there's no one
really in charge.

613
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,067
Oh, then he invited
me to party

614
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,167
on his asteroid, which
I think means his trailer.

615
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:07,034
Maybe we should just
find Seth and Summer

616
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:08,368
and make sure they're okay.

617
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:09,767
Taylor, I...

618
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,667
I know. Seth told me.

619
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:14,301
Told you what?

620
00:25:14,368 --> 00:25:17,334
You know... it, the thing.

621
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,201
Okay, let me explain...
I just wish
that you told me.

622
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:24,334
That's what I'm mad about,
not any of the other stuff,

623
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,700
just that you kept it from me.

624
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,800
Wait, wh-what other stuff?

625
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:29,467
Well, you know, that you were...

626
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,433
sleeping with someone
before we started dating.

627
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,301
Who says?
Well, the math says,

628
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,101
but, look, I'm not
mad about that.
See, I knew
you felt this way.

629
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,533
Well, I'm not... I'm not
accusing you of anything.
Yes, you are.

630
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,234
You are saying that I had
random unsafe sex with someone

631
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:43,433
in between
my marriage annulment

632
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,867
and us making
out at Kaitlin's.

633
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,268
Do you know how many
days that was, Ryan?

634
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,667
So what are you saying?
You're saying you were

635
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:48,800
sleeping with someone
while we were dating?

636
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,034
Is that what you think?

637
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:52,034
No! But if you were,
I couldn't be mad

638
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:53,234
because we were never exclusive.

639
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,934
Right. And why would
you want to be,

640
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:57,301
since you clearly think I am
a big fat divorcee whore!

641
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:08,034
Oh, my God.

642
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,800
Julie.
Hi. Hey.

643
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,234
Uh, where's Sandy?

644
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,500
Julie, what's going on?

645
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:13,800
What do you mean?

646
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,634
Well, it's just that
all our clients here

647
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,400
are on dates with
people that look like

648
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,368
they're college students--
I mean, weren't we supposed

649
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,201
to set up Jessica Rogers
with Dr. Weston?

650
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:23,400
Yeah, you know, we were,
but she called yesterday

651
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:25,201
and said she met someone--
that's love.

652
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:26,800
FRANK:
Hello, Julie.

653
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,967
Frank... uh, you're here.

654
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:31,368
Uh... Frank,

655
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,834
this is Kirsten Cohen,
my partner.

656
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:34,234
This is Frank...

657
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,034
Perry. Frank Perry.
Nice to meet you.

658
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:38,433
Nice to meet you.
Frank Perry. Right. Um...

659
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,634
Bullit hired him to put
our books in order,

660
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,734
and that's what he's been
doing all night so that

661
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,201
I could be here.
Oh.

662
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:45,834
Does everything add up?

663
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:48,867
Yeah. Looks good.

664
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:52,101
And business seems
to be booming, so...

665
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,567
if I had a drink,
I-I would toast you.

666
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:56,800
Well, I'll-I'll take it
anyway. Thank you.

667
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,967
All right, ladies,

668
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,167
as you were.

669
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:02,334
Kirsten, a pleasure
to meet you.

670
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:07,734
Ah, Kiki, do you ever
feel invincible.

671
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,134
Why?

672
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:11,001
Oh... no reason.

673
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:13,268
Happy New Year, sweetie.

674
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,368
Remind me again why
we're looking for a purse

675
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,567
when the larger issue
seems to be Taylor

676
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,600
thinking she has
a baby inside of her?

677
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,001
And don't give me anything

678
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,901
about any allergy pills,
'cause I'm not buying it.

679
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,301
Seth, we need the purse, because
the pregnancy test is in it.

680
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:36,767
The test that we have already
taken and haven't looked at yet.

681
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,901
The test that we need
to see before midnight

682
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:41,234
so we can start 2007 knowing
exactly where we stand.

683
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:42,700
Can I interrupt you
for a second?

684
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,634
I'm remembering something
I wanted to ask you for

685
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,201
back in the car when I found out
the test was Taylor's.

686
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:50,034
What?
Paw.

687
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,268
Up top.

688
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:53,967
You're asking me
for a high five?

689
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:55,901
Can you imagine if it was
your test we're looking for?

690
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,101
Now, I know it seems
a little bit selfish,

691
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,800
but I think we're entitled
to celebrate,

692
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,268
so come on, up top, hit it.

693
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:06,167
Hit it.

694
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:07,368
God, <i>Seth.</i>

695
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:15,934
Oh, God.

696
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:18,567
Oh, my God!
It's really you!

697
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:21,167
Seth Cohen! I saw you
at Comic-Con years ago.
Oh.

698
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:23,467
I'm a huge, huge...

699
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,834
huge Atomic County fan!
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

700
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,700
Check it out, man--
I'm Kid Chino!

701
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,934
Oh, wow, that is fantastic.
Listen, I'm looking...

702
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:32,500
We got to take
a picture, man.
Oh, oh, okay.

703
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:35,234
This... is the greatest
night of my life, Mr. Cohen.

704
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:38,400
Wow, thanks a lot.
Hey, oh, it's the alien!
Smile!

705
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,867
Thanks a lot.
Thanks, man.

706
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,600
I didn't want
to embarrass you

707
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,134
in front of your partner,

708
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:52,167
but your so-called
dating service...

709
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:53,834
is not exactly
what Bullit thought

710
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,400
he was investing in, is it?

711
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,001
Why don't you wet your lips.

712
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:00,001
Your mouth looks dry.

713
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:01,700
Kaitland?
What?

714
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,934
We are boring you, yes?

715
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:06,734
Maybe it will be more pleasing
to you if we make...

716
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,368
kissing to each other.

717
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:10,867
Yeah, y-you guys go do that.

718
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:17,567
Okay, so just what do I have
to do to keep you quiet?

719
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,334
Suite 522 at the Four Seasons.

720
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,467
Say... half an hour.

721
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:41,234
Oh, there you are.
How's your client?

722
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:42,767
Darrel?

723
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:44,967
Well, he's better off than
the parking meter he beheaded.

724
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,567
I sent him to a shelter.

725
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:49,433
How has your night been?
Oh, it's just...
it's just odd.

726
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,001
Julie's acting strange, and...
well, we have clients here--

727
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:54,867
it's just they're not with the
dates that we set them up with.

728
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:56,600
So if I'm a little
tense I apologize.

729
00:29:56,667 --> 00:30:00,234
Come on, let's work it out
on the dance floor.
Yeah.

730
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:02,001
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

731
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,500
No, my fault.

732
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,067
Sandy Cohen.

733
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:06,901
Uh, Frank Perry.

734
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:08,667
Frank works for Bullit.

735
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:09,667
Oh, is that right?

736
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:11,533
Yeah, the Big Bang himself.

737
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,433
Well, it was nice
bumping into you.

738
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,467
And, uh, happy New Year.

739
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:17,368
You, too.

740
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,034
Sandy, something wrong?

741
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,600
I feel like I know
that guy from somewhere.

742
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,268
Come on.

743
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:28,667
How about that dance?
Mm.

744
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:31,967
(lively music playing)

745
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:33,134
(chuckles):
Hey there, Miss Columbus.

746
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:34,934
How are you?

747
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,400
Good to see you.

748
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,767
Hey, now, enjoy yourself.

749
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,934
Mom, aren't you gonna stay
for midnight?

750
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:47,700
Oh, Kaitlin, your mom
has a headache.

751
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,500
But you should stay-- have
Bullit give you a ride home.

752
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:54,201
This doesn't have anything to do
with that creepy guy,

753
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:56,034
does it?

754
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:57,634
What creepy guy?

755
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,268
They guy I saw you talking to.

756
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,600
You were gonna go
meet him, weren't you?

757
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,268
This is not what you think.

758
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,600
But, please, you can't
tell Bullit about this.

759
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,334
Mom, he really likes you.

760
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,234
And-and I really
like him, too.

761
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,834
It just...

762
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:14,433
You have to trust me
on this, okay?

763
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,834
(exhales):
Okay.

764
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:18,567
Happy New Year, baby.

765
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:22,567
Uh, Mom?

766
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:28,767
I miss Dad sometimes.

767
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,301
I know, honey.

768
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:33,634
We'll call him tomorrow, okay?

769
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,268
Okay.

770
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,201
Taylor!

771
00:31:51,268 --> 00:31:53,567
Hey, Ryan.
What are you doing?
Let's go.

772
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:56,234
Ryan, you think I'm a whore,
I'm gonna act like a whore.

773
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:57,634
I don't think you're a whore,
but I definitely

774
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,934
don't think you should
be drinking.

775
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,500
Why, because I might be pregnant
with my whore baby?

776
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,167
Hey!

777
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:04,034
How about giving that back
before I atomize your face?

778
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:05,268
How about you just back off?

779
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,368
Hey, what's going on?
What are you doing?

780
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,533
I'm trying to figure out

781
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,867
why my girlfriend is taking
pregnancy tests

782
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:11,667
and I'm the last one
to find out about it.

783
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:13,101
How is that possible?

784
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,268
Because it's not hers, okay?
It's mine.

785
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,268
It's my test that
is in Taylor's purse.

786
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:18,334
What?

787
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,967
Great. This is great.

788
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:22,400
Now I'm not gonna know
if I'm pregnant before midnight.

789
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,234
There's nothing like
starting off a new near

790
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:25,867
with something like this
hanging over your head.

791
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,400
Happy New Year, Ryan.
What?

792
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:35,467
Ryan!
Dude, it's Summer's.

793
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:36,967
I know. Come on. Let's go.

794
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:39,901
CROWD:
...three, two, one.

795
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:41,268
(all cheering)

796
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

797
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,167
Come on. Wait a minute!
Come back!

798
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:52,467
Come on!
Are you kidding me?!

799
00:32:54,734 --> 00:32:56,934
--All right, thanks.

800
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:59,001
Nearest cab company's
in Baker.

801
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,967
What do you want to do now?

802
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:03,600
Oh, curl up into the fetal
position and weep.

803
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,867
Although, perhaps the unborn
baby metaphor...

804
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,001
Not really appropriate.

805
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,734
I cannot believe Summer
might be pregnant.

806
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,268
Oh, my God.

807
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:14,700
I think I saw an empty...

808
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,734
Uh, Seth.

809
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,834
Hurry up.

810
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:19,800
(laughing)

811
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,368
TAYLOR:
 <i>Don't worry, Summer.</i>

812
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:27,734
 <i>I'm sure we'll pass a 24-hour</i>
 <i>pharmacy at some point.</i>

813
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,667
The symbolism window
closed at midnight.

814
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:32,101
We'll do it
in the morning.

815
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:33,567
Okay.

816
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:36,201
Taylor, I really appreciate
everything you did for me today.

817
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,301
I really hope it didn't cause
any permanent damage

818
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:39,334
with you and Ryan.

819
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,368
Oh, don't worry about me,
please.

820
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
How did I get here?

821
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,433
How did I go from being

822
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,167
an Ivy League Al Gore

823
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:52,067
in the making to a knocked-up
college dropout

824
00:33:52,134 --> 00:33:54,034
with a boyfriend that forgets
to pack his toothbrush

825
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,101
when he travels?

826
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,301
How did this happen?

827
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,268
You know what?

828
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,700
It's a new year.

829
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:05,301
We all get a fresh start.

830
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:07,400
Okay? You and me

831
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:10,201
and Seth and Ryan, we can all be
whatever we want to be.

832
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:13,834
And everything negative
will be left in last year.

833
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,368
What's my name?
Zerk-nong

834
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:18,667
Spell it.

835
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,533
Z-U...
"E"!

836
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,867
Oh. Z... Z-E-R-

837
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:26,301
K-N

838
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:27,567
Hyphen.

839
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:32,467
Hyphen, N-O-N-G.

840
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:34,901
It was kind of mean leaving them
in there like that, wasn't it?

841
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:38,034
Yeah.
Yeah.

842
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:41,867
I'll call 'em,
see if they're okay.

843
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:44,467
I need to borrow your phone.
I left mine in my purse.

844
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,767
(laughing)

845
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,767
What does that spell?
Zerk-nong.

846
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:48,767
Zerk-nong.
Again.

847
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:49,800
Good girl.

848
00:34:49,867 --> 00:34:51,368
(laughs)
(cell phone ringing)

849
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,201
Oh, my God!

850
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,101
Run!

851
00:34:58,301 --> 00:35:00,800
(horn beeps)
Hey, Mr. Cohen!

852
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,767
Hey!

853
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,834
Hey, these alien
chicks are really easy.

854
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,467
Hey, we need
an emergency evacuation.

855
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:09,500
You got it. Hey,
too bad we don't have

856
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,467
Little Miss Vixen's
magic scooter.

857
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:12,533
We have to go!

858
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,001
They stole my purse!

859
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,201
(tires squeal)

860
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,001
All set?

861
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:20,934
What?

862
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:22,867
You still thinking
about Frank?

863
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,901
I can't shake the feeling
that I know him.

864
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:26,268
I wish you did.

865
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,667
I'd love to know who Julie
has going through our books.

866
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,734
She never said anything. Nothing
about where Bullit found him?

867
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,467
Knowing Bullit,
it could be anywhere:

868
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,533
the golf course,
Saudi Arabia, prison.

869
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,067
You going
to follow me home?

870
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,201
Yeah. No, no.

871
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:39,867
I'm going to swing
by the homeless shelter

872
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,167
make sure Daryl made it there.

873
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:42,101
Are you sure?

874
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,467
Yeah, I won't be long.

875
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:48,533
 <i>You just say where you want us</i>
 <i>to drop you off, Mr. Cohen.</i>

876
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,101
The girls and I are honored
to be helping out.

877
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:55,368
Look, as scared as you are,

878
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:56,934
I'm sure Summer's
ten times more scared.

879
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,834
Translation: I need
to be there for her.

880
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:02,800
Exactly. And you can start
by telling her how you feel.

881
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:06,533
Well, kinda depends
on what's in this purse.

882
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,167
Does it?

883
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,201
It is going to change
whether or not

884
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,433
you want to be
with her?

885
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,734
No, of course not.

886
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,334
And can you imagine
ever not wanting to be with her?

887
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,368
No.

888
00:36:20,268 --> 00:36:21,268
That's your answer.

889
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:37,334
Hey, great party.

890
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
Thank you, Peanut.

891
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,301
How'd it go
with the Saudis?

892
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,767
(blows forlorn note)

893
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,600
Well, they want to fly me over
to Dubai for their prom,

894
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:47,967
but I said there's no way

895
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:49,800
I want to wear one
of those Klan outfits.

896
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:50,767
(laughs)

897
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:51,967
I don't blame you.

898
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:53,167
Have you seen your mother?

899
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:54,634
I've been, I've been
looking for her.

900
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,101
Um, she went home.

901
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,700
She had a migraine.

902
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,400
Dang, I wish she'd have told me.

903
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:06,001
Well, I hope
she's okay.

904
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:08,001
So what was that dance

905
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,067
that you were talking to me
about this afternoon?

906
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,268
The one with the number?

907
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:13,734
(laughs)
That'd be the Texas Two-Step.

908
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,600
Can you show it to me?

909
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,667
Is the Pope Catholic?

910
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,433
Oh, come on, lucky lady.

911
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,301
It's your night.
Here we go.

912
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,067
Ready?

913
00:37:23,134 --> 00:37:26,834
And it's one, two,
one, two, back step.

914
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:29,567
One, two, one, two,
Texas Two-Step.

915
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:30,667
We got it.

916
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:32,433
And you're turning.
I'm turning?

917
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,334
You're turning. Come on.
Turn this way.

918
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,368
That a girl.

919
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:38,301
Whoa!

920
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:39,334
(laughs)

921
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,967
I nearly lost you.

922
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:43,533
We got it. Got it, got it.

923
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,567
(knocking)

924
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,834
If you're here for sex, there's,
like, five guys ahead of you.

925
00:37:54,901 --> 00:38:00,301
Okay, look, I'm sorry if I
jumped to conclusions tonight.

926
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:02,500
But you can't be paranoid
either about being divorced

927
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:03,567
or any of it.

928
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:05,334
It doesn't mean anything to me.

929
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,201
So you don't think I'm a whore?

930
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:11,034
No. No, of course not.

931
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:14,834
Good, 'cause I'm not.

932
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,533
Unless, of course,
you want me to be.

933
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:20,667
Is that my negligee?

934
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,201
Mm-hmm.
Well, I want that back.

935
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:24,301
Come on.
Before I change my mind.

936
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,767
All right,
but just to be clear...

937
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:27,201
Everything but.

938
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:30,800
(grunts)
(laughs)

939
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:42,500
Staring at that bunny thinking
of a baby, aren't you?

940
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:46,201
I'm sorry I abandoned you
in the desert.

941
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:47,400
I deserved it.

942
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,134
And it worked out
kind of well, too.

943
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,101
I found something that I thought
might interest you.

944
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,268
Oh, my God.

945
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:54,268
But I want
to say something first.

946
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,667
When I found out
it was your pregnancy test,

947
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,934
I totally freaked out

948
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,034
and I thought "This will
change everything,"

949
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:01,433
but then Ryan asked me

950
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,600
if I could imagine a time

951
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,134
when I'd ever not want
to be with you,

952
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:07,034
and I realized
that the answer is no.

953
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:08,934
I'm totally pregnant, aren't I?

954
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:10,500
I don't know.

955
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:14,034
What do you mean
you don't know?

956
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,034
Is that going to, like, squirt
invisible ink or something?

957
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,934
No, but it will make you
engaged to me.

958
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,667
What?

959
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:23,800
Are you insane?

960
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:26,167
Possibly, but I'm certain
of this.

961
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:28,268
No, Cohen, we can't.

962
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:30,467
Sure, we can. We're both adults,
we don't share DNA.

963
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:31,901
You just have
to want to.
But...

964
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:33,334
I do.

965
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,934
Don't you think we should look
at the test first?

966
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,700
And have you wonder
for the rest of your life

967
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,134
if I proposed to you
because you're pregnant?

968
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:40,634
I'm doing this because
I love you,

969
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,967
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

970
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:46,301
You know, once you do this,
you can't take it back?

971
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:48,368
I know.

972
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:50,834
Summer Roberts,
will you marry me?

973
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,967
Yes, I'll marry you.

974
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:01,433
All right.

975
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:08,500
Okay, so should we look
at the test now?

976
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,067
Sure. Let's see
what's in store

977
00:40:11,134 --> 00:40:12,800
for the future
Mr. and Mrs. Seth Cohen.

978
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,268
How many bars is that?

979
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,268
One. What's that mean?

980
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:25,634
One means I'm not pregnant.

981
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:30,967
I'm not pregnant.

982
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:32,533
Is it inappropriate
to celebrate?

983
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,433
No, please, please.

984
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:41,467
Saves us from having
to have a shotgun wedding.

985
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:44,368
Now we can just have
a normal one instead.

986
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:49,167
Yeah. You and me
and our normal wedding.

987
00:40:54,934 --> 00:40:55,867
Should we hug again?

988
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:58,201
BOTH:
Okay.

989
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:14,967
(sighs)

990
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,867
Have a seat.

991
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:38,901
I'm not trading sex
for silence, Frank.

992
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:41,001
I may be a madam,
but I'm not a whore.

993
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:44,400
Good to know, but that's not
why I brought you here.

994
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:51,800
It's not?

995
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:52,734
Sit down.

996
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,067
So, why did you bring me here?
For information.

997
00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:07,600
 <i>Information about what?</i>

998
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,867
About the Cohen family.
Why?

999
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:15,101
Because I'm not who I say I am.

1000
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:21,001
<font color="#ffff00">-=TLF SUB TEAM=- 
http://tlfsub.eastgame.net</font>

1001
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,600
And who are you?

1002
00:42:29,368 --> 00:42:31,001
I'm Ryan's father.
