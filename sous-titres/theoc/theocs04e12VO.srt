1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:01,367
sly on The O.C.:

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,667
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:04,534
Oh, I ain't here to work,
came to see my girlfriend.

4
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:06,567
<i>You are an ignorant buffoon.</i>

5
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:07,767
Mom, aren't you going
to stay for midnight?

6
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,567
Your mom has a headache.

7
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,133
<i>But you should stay, have</i>
Bullit give you a ride home.</i>

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,234
In my dream, I had found
my other half,
and it was an otter.

9
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:18,667
Tell me about
your spirit animal.

10
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,567
It was this otter.
An otter?

11
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,667
<i>When Henri-Michel would</i>
tell me he loved me,</i>

12
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:25,567
it was like the whole world
melted away.

13
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:26,901
So what are you saying?

14
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:28,434
I don't think that
I should be with anyone.

15
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,601
Bye, Ryan.

16
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:43,534
Hello.

17
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:44,667
Taylor, where are you?

18
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:45,834
I thought you were going
to come to dinner.

19
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,200
Oh, uh... you should just go on
without me.

20
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:49,834
I haven't finished
my errands yet.

21
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,601
Wait, you've been gone all day.

22
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:55,634
Well, I had to go to the dry cleaner
and get my nails done and then go
to the Matthew Barney exhibition.

23
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,133
Oh, okay.
Well, is Ryan with you?

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,367
No, Kaitlin, I told you.

25
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,667
We're giving each other
some space.

26
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,701
I haven't spoken to him
in over a week.

27
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,501
Okay, well then, I guess you're
not going to Kirsten's thing.

28
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,133
What thing?

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,133
Her party.
She's turning 40.

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,868
I was kind of hoping that you were going to be there
to do something weird,so it's not so boring.

31
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:12,334
Wait, do you want to know
where it is?

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,701
No. Uh-uh.

33
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't.
Uh...

34
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,901
I have to go.
Good-bye.

35
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,667
Excuse me, miss.

36
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:19,733
Yes?

37
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm afraid you're making
some of the business owners
around here a little nervous.

38
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:24,400
Why? What are you
talking about?

39
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:27,434
Well, you've been loitering here
for the past seven hours.

40
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:29,067
(laughing):
Loitering.

41
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:30,868
What's loitering?
I've been... just...

42
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,467
What are you doing
with those binoculars?

43
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,734
These...

44
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,467
are for bird watching.
Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,567
There's a very interesting
oriole in that tree right there.

46
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:40,701
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

47
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,901
Okay, Ryan's off work
in ten minutes.

48
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,000
Can you just give me a...

49
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,267
Ten minutes!

50
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:46,801
You want a donut?
No.

51
00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:48,234
Hey, Taylor's not joining us?

52
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,434
Nope.

53
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,767
Lucky her.

54
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:53,033
Sorry this isn't up to
your standards, honey.

55
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,167
I'm a little short
on cash right now.

56
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:56,601
So why'd you leave New Match?

57
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,100
Because Kirsten and I are better friends
than business partners, okay?

58
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:00,534
Could we just leave it at that?

59
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:04,934
Excuse me.

60
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,000
Five people in this house and I
end up eating dinner by myself.

61
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,200
Hi.

62
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,801
So we're still on
for Friday, right?

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,667
Well, I don't like sneaking
around either,

64
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:21,634
but we don't have much of
a choice, do we?

65
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:24,033
I know, I miss you, too.
(Che chanting)

66
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,400
What?

67
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,701
Oh, no, that's just
Summer's boyfriend Che.

68
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:30,300
Hold on, um, I'll go outside,
okay?

69
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,434
Che, what are you doing?

70
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,801
The I-Ching was devised by
ancient Chinese mystics

71
00:02:55,868 --> 00:03:00,067
as a way to interpret
the invisible current
of the universe.

72
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,901
What are you trying
to figure out?

73
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:04,400
I had a dream, Summer...

74
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:08,634
...in which my soul mate
was revealed to me.

75
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,567
That's great.

76
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:13,901
It's great, but...
it's complicated.

77
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:16,267
I must be certain--

78
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,067
Dragon on a mountaintop.

79
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,434
That's interesting.

80
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:24,634
Um... Che?

81
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,834
Nothing against
Chinese mystics,

82
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:29,100
but, uh, if you want to find out
if someone's your soul mate,

83
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,634
why don't you just try
spending time with them?

84
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,367
You think that's what
I should do?

85
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah. Why not?

86
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:35,467
See if you have
anything in common.

87
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:40,834
Because the day after tomorrow
is Groundhog Day

88
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,434
and I'm planning a little
black ops mission to free
Newport Chuck.

89
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,033
The groundhog?
Yeah.

90
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,367
You've heard of this travesty?

91
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:48,934
I've heard about
the festival.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,767
They put him onstage
with the mayor
and if he sees his shadow,

93
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,200
it means six more
weeks of winter.

94
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,567
Which is crazy considering
we don't even have winter
to begin with.

95
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:56,968
But I think they treat him okay.

96
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:00,133
No, 364 days a year, little
duder is stuck in a cage.

97
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,167
Now he gets to play circus freak
for a day?

98
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:03,868
No, that's absolutely criminal.

99
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:04,433
OK

100
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:07,567
Just don't involve me
'cause that's how I got
kicked out of Brown.

101
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,634
You coming to dinner?
No, go without me.
Summer...

102
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,801
besides getting you
kicked out of college,

103
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:15,033
you know I'd never
do anything to hurt you.

104
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:17,734
Of course.

105
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:21,133
I'll see you
in a little bit.

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,367
Tomorrow, brother.

107
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:32,100
Tomorrow...

108
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,100
we'll get this whole thing
figured out.

109
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:39,434
That, right there,
is grasshopper at night.

110
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:40,767
Are you sure you
don't want to come?

111
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,300
Watching a movie about a guy
eating a live octopus?

112
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,334
I think I'll pass.

113
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:47,334
It's also got one of the greatest
fight sequences
in probably
the last five years.

114
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,667
Oh, yeah,
that'll convince her.

115
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:52,567
Listen, Mom, what better way
to see out your 30s than a little South
Korean shock cinema?

116
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,334
So tempting.

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,467
You're going to be late.
You better go.

118
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,701
Oh, hi, it's Kirsten Cohen.

119
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,934
I was wondering if Dr. Harris
could see me; it's urgent.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,100
<i>SETH:
Are you sure it's</i>
all right to leave her?</i>

121
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,133
<i>She seems a little down.</i>

122
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,667
Oh, she's turning 40.

123
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:17,968
Even for a woman as beautiful
as your mother,
that's not easy.

124
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,100
Well, maybe we
should stay.

125
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,767
No, trust me.

126
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,734
Right now, all she wants
is a little time alone

127
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,868
to process everything.
You don't think she
knows about the party?

128
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,033
What? No.
Are you kidding me?

129
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,133
Nobody plans a surprise
party like Sandy Cohen.

130
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,400
I could've been
with the CIA.

131
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,467
I hear they're known
for their birthday parties.

136
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,934
Che, what are you...?

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,034
I mean, this is real, right?
This isn't a dream?

138
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:37,134
Unless this whole
life is a dream.

139
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:39,201
But, no, for our purposes,
you are awake.

140
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,434
Seth, how do you feel about
the subjugation of animals?

141
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,934
Um...

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,568
I hate it.
When you hear

143
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,733
that a fellow mammal
is being exploited
for cheap entertainment

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,501
instead of being allowed
to burrow
in the soft soil
of Mother Earth,

145
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,101
does it make you want
to tear your hair out?

146
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,201
Mm-hmm.
Well, then rise
and shine, brother,

147
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,733
for the clarion call of justice
has rung across the land.

148
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,067
I'm glad I don't sleep naked.

149
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:08,267
Yeah, me, too.

150
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,267
I didn't think about that.

151
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,134
You could've had...

152
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,900
<i>Tell him you want</i>
to feel his butt.</i>

153
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,134
<i>Yeah, say how you can't wait to
get two big</i> handfuls of butt.

154
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,667
Okay, you guys,
that's gross.

155
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm supposed to be
my mom, okay?

156
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,733
Exactly.

157
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,767
Look, you want this guy
to think your mom
loves him, right?

158
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:27,101
This is how adults
talk to each other.

159
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,733
I've been e-mailing Bullit as
my mom for, like, a month now.

160
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,167
You don't think it'd be
a little weird
if I randomly asked him
about his butt?

161
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:35,568
No. It just shows that
she cares for him.

162
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:36,834
And his butt.

163
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,633
Do you guys not realize
how much you talk about
other guys' butts?

164
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,101
Do you want your mom to close
the deal or not?

165
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,301
(typing)
"I miss your butt.

166
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,468
Love, Julie."

167
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,867
Awesome.
Awesome.

168
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,134
Hey. You busy?
No.

169
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,201
I'm just going in to pick up
Kirsten's birthday present.

170
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:01,600
Thought you might
want to come along.

171
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,900
You know,
grab some lunch.

172
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,667
Ah, yeah, sure.

173
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:05,534
Is everything okay?

174
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,800
Mm-hmm. Fine.

175
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,267
How are you doing with all
that's going on with Taylor?

176
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:12,834
Okay.

177
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you sure?

178
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,134
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,

179
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:16,767
she says she needs time.
I get it.

180
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,800
I got plenty of other things
to keep me busy.

181
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,201
Sandy, I'm fine.
I'm not sitting around
missing her if that's
what you're asking.

182
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,167
All right.

183
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:26,267
Okay.

184
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,301
Good.
Yep.

185
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,234
Let's say half an hour?
Yep.

186
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,401
All right.

187
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:45,834
I need help, Doctor.

188
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,301
Well, Taylor,
admitting that

189
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,201
is the first step
in recovery.

190
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,134
But tell me, how did
you hear about me?

191
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh, I read your article about
emotional addictions
<i>in The Journal</i>
of Abstract Thought.</i>

192
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,167
I saw you teach at UCI,
and it just kind of
seemed like fate.

193
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,867
And you think that
you're suffering from
an emotional addiction?

194
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:03,234
Yeah, pretty much
all my life.

195
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,900
'Cause I never
really knew my dad
and my mom is...

196
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,034
kind of like Idi Amin
with fake boobs.

197
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:11,234
You know, big on the
torturing and the tyranny,
not so big
on the nurturing.

198
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,401
I see.
And then from there,
I just kind of became

199
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,101
this person who whenever
anybody would hold out, like,

200
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,201
the slightest prospect
of emotional support,
I would just seize on it.

201
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,800
Like, I married a man
who I knew for two weeks
just because he told me
he loved me.

202
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,568
And how has that manifest
itself now?

203
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,834
Well, I'm dating this guy, Ryan.

204
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,733
And he's just really wonderful
and...

205
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,134
I really care about him a lot,

206
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:34,534
but I told him that
I needed some space because...

207
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,034
Because you know
that you're not ready

208
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,134
for a mature relationship
and you don't want to ruin it?

209
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:40,034
Yes. Exactly.

210
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,234
And how has that been?

211
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,367
This time apart?

212
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,800
Well, that's kind of
the other problem.

213
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,067
Um...

214
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:50,434
sometimes, when I like someone,
I... sometimes...

215
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:54,134
kind of, uh, stalk them.

216
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,733
Uh-huh.

217
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,568
<i>Not in like a scary Star 80</i> way.

218
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,201
Just to, you know, like,
follow them around

219
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:03,468
and take pictures
and log their activities
and then compile it all
in a factually accurate,

220
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:06,667
yet aesthetically pleasing
scrapbook,
and it's all really very...

221
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,134
Oh, my God, I'm a total lunatic.

222
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:09,834
Taylor, you are not a lunatic.

223
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,134
You recognize that this behavior
is not healthy and you want to correct it.

224
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,600
I do.
I really, really do.

225
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:16,900
All right, well...

226
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,334
as you know, from my article,
my methods are very aggressive.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,934
Okay.

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,633
I'm in your hands, Doctor.

229
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,633
What are you doing?

230
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,267
Neil and I bought
these in Cabo.

231
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,534
I'm selling them.

232
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,700
Why?

233
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,101
Because times are tough,
Kaitlin.

234
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,501
Well, do I need to remind you
that your boyfriend's
a billionaire?

235
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:46,600
No, he's not.
I mean...

236
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,434
Are you cheating on Bullit?

237
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,700
No, I'm not even dating him.

238
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,867
That fizzled when
he went to Dubai.

239
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,134
Oh.

240
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:55,534
Well, he thinks you guys
are still dating.

241
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,867
Have you been
talking to him?

242
00:10:57,934 --> 00:11:00,000
No. Just a couple e-mails.

243
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,800
And what have you
told him?

244
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:02,967
Nothing.

245
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:04,967
Just... I know
he really likes you.

246
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,000
And I know he thinks you guys
are still a couple.

247
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,201
But wait, are you
seeing anyone else?

248
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:11,834
That's none of
your business.

249
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,000
Fine.

250
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,134
Okay, well, what are you going
to tell the Bullit?

251
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,301
'Cause he comes back today.

252
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:21,568
Will you please answer that?

253
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,468
Julie Cooper?

254
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,134
Um... yeah.

255
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,900
Thank you.

256
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,201
"Can't wait till tomorrow night.

257
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:38,967
Miss you already."

258
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,900
Mrs. Cohen,
thanks for waiting.

259
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:00,167
So, tell me what's going on?

260
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:03,700
Well, the last few weeks
I've been feeling weak...

261
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:05,534
just drained of energy.

262
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,568
There's been
some nausea
and light-headedness.

263
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,934
Now, I have to ask:
have you been drinking?

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,900
Not a drop.
And has there
been any undue stress?

265
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,700
No.
I mean, not more than usual.

266
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,468
Well, let's take some blood.

267
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:20,600
Then we'll be able
to tell you something.

268
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,633
Ooh, you turn 40 tomorrow.

269
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:25,867
Happy birthday.

270
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:28,201
Thanks.

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,134
SETH:
You're crazy.

272
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:44,201
Seth...
I thought you wanted

273
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,834
to release turtles into
the ocean or something.

274
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,501
I'm not going to help you
steal Newport Chuck.

275
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,334
Why, 'cause he looks so happy
down there?

276
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,568
I don't know,
he seems
to be doing all right
with the free carrot deal.

277
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:59,101
Well, I see this was a mistake.

278
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,600
I guess we don't have all that
much in common after all.

279
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, well.

280
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,501
Who knows what might have been.

281
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:09,401
Oh, God. Fine. Okay.

282
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,134
What?

283
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:15,267
You know, you helped me
heal my inner otter, I owe you.

284
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,534
You mean, you want to help?

285
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,101
Yeah, that's it--
I feel we have a bond.

286
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,434
So what's the plan?

287
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,867
Hey, Peanut.

288
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,000
I just left the airport.

289
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,600
We need to talk.

290
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,367
Not if it's about that duty-free
booze you asked me to buy.

291
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:37,633
No, it's definitely
not about that.

292
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,034
There's a little something
that I should talk to you about.

293
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,867
Okay, then why don't you
meet me at the jewelry store.

294
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:44,434
What are you talking about?

295
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,101
Well, Squirt, I liked
your mother before I left,

296
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:51,034
but these e-mails I've been
getting lately,
especially the last one...

297
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:54,267
let's just say,
I like the way her mind works.

298
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,067
Yes, she is the girl for me.

299
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:59,101
You're going to ask her
to marry you?

300
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,600
Oh, damn am.

301
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,034
Why? What were you going
to tell me?

302
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:03,733
Nothing.

303
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,834
She loves anything
that's an emerald cut.

304
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,468
So you're saying
I should ask her?

305
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:11,501
Yeah, absolutely.

306
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:12,767
You should totally ask her.

307
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,301
Totally.

308
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,633
--You saved a valet ticket?

309
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,267
Oh, yeah, that's from
our third date.

310
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:27,600
He's a very
generous tipper.

311
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,834
You wouldn't know it
to look at him.

312
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,667
What's this?

313
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,067
Toothpick.

314
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:34,600
Gross.

315
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,401
Well, he didn't
use it... much.

316
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:39,967
Okay, Taylor...

317
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:45,301
although I wholeheartedly support you
getting rid of everything in this box
for purely sanitary reasons,

318
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:50,167
If you like Ryan and he likes you,
screw the therapist and figure out
your stuff together.

319
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:51,934
I mean, all of this
just seems a little insane.

320
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:55,934
Summer, my whole life I've been
completely powerless

321
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,934
before people who say they have
feelings for me.

322
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:01,201
I feel like I need to do this
for myself
as much as for me and Ryan.

323
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,267
Even if you lose him?

324
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,767
If I don't do this,
I'm going to lose him anyway.

325
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,267
I don't have a choice.

326
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:13,067
Okay.

327
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:15,667
Well, I hope you know
what you're doing.

328
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,468
Yeah.

329
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,867
Me, too.

330
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,667
Kaitlin.

331
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,434
Ryan.

332
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Hi.

333
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,468
Hey.
You buying some jewelry?

334
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:47,267
Yeah, just buying
some class rings.

335
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,334
Are you here with someone?

336
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:49,800
No. Are you?

337
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,734
Yeah, Sandy's buying part of
Kirsten's birthday present.

338
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,001
Hey, how's Taylor been?

339
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,201
Well... weird.

340
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,434
Weird like...?

341
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,734
Weirder than normal.

342
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,734
Really?
Yeah.
A little bit.

343
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,900
Hi, Mr. Cohen.
Kaitlin, you coming
to the party tomorrow?

344
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,234
Um, yeah, totally.

345
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:09,134
Listen, I got to go,
but I'll see you guys.

346
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,834
Everything okay?
No.

347
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,301
The guy in Carson.

348
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:14,667
I just got a message.

349
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:15,934
He lost it.

350
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,234
He lost it?

351
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:18,434
Yeah.

352
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,468
I don't know
how you do that.

353
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:24,401
The hell you hiding from?

354
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,834
You scared me.

355
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,734
Well, quit hiding
out in the shadows
like some
Al Quaeda wacko.

356
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,600
I just thought I saw my mom.

357
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,334
So what'd you
end up getting?

358
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,600
Yeah, I did.
How you like that?

359
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,800
Wow.
Is it the most expensive one?

360
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,967
Well, Bullit bought it.
Of course it is.

361
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,267
And your mama deserves it.

362
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,267
Good. All right.

363
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,401
Now let's talk about
that proposal.

364
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:45,700
No, I got it worked out.

365
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:49,700
This Iranian fellow
on my flight
played me this Persian
love song on his cell phone.

366
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,101
So I downloaded it.

367
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,834
Check that out.
(chuckling)

368
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,001
Whoa, huh?

369
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,434
Mm-hmm, let's definitely talk
about that proposal.

370
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,001
It's gonna work.

371
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:14,567
No, once the truck is outside
for the ceremony tomorrow,

372
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,867
there's going to be
too many eyes.

373
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,667
The best bet is to
break into the lobby

374
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:20,401
and take him from the city hall.
But the door is locked.

375
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:21,667
The main door's locked, yes.

376
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,867
But yesterday, I took a tour
of the city hall

377
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:26,301
and I taped the lock on
the fire door on the roof.

378
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:28,301
How is that tour by the way?
I've always wondered.

379
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:29,633
You know,
it's surprisingly good.

380
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,934
Good local history,
doesn't get too anecdotal.

381
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,368
Oh, great.
How do we get on the roof?

382
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:34,734
Oh.

383
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,334
Hmm?

384
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:37,567
You know what this is?

385
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,368
A grappling hook.

386
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,267
I climbed Denali last year.

387
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:42,234
It's an Outward
Bound course.

388
00:17:42,301 --> 00:17:43,600
This is gonna be
like a piece of cake.

389
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,134
I've never climbed.

390
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,401
I brought
a papoose for you.

391
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:49,567
Oh, great.
Okay, so we
climb on the roof,
we break in,

392
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,067
we break Chuck
out of his cage,

393
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,234
we climb down the roof.

394
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,434
And return him to the savannahs
of his childhood.

395
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,468
I actually heard he was captured
in Irvine, but just one thing...

396
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,700
Yeah.

397
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,067
You know this plan
is insane, right?

398
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:00,101
It'll never work.

399
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:04,101
Seth, when the universe intends
for something to happen,

400
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,468
it will happen.

401
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,600
How about a pre-op snow cone?

402
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,334
Oh, great.
I'm talking your
language now, huh?

403
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:13,267
You like snow cones?
I like... my favorite
flavor is cherry,

404
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:14,500
but my dad's
is blueberry.

405
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:17,134
Hi.

406
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:18,267
Are you Ryan Atwood?

407
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:19,301
Yeah. Can I help you?

408
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:20,500
This is from Taylor.

409
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,001
O... kay.

410
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,101
Excuse me.

411
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,334
Wait.

412
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:25,600
Who are you?

413
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,633
Dr. James.

414
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,434
I'm helping Taylor
through some issues.

415
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,867
So you're her therapist.

416
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:33,234
More of an emotional
crisis manager.

417
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,167
And she gave you...

418
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:36,234
Is she in your car?

419
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,368
Uh, Mr. Atwood...

420
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:41,234
Taylor, what is this?
What's going on?

421
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:44,633
Ryan, I have instructed her
that she should have
no direct contact
with you for one week.

422
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,067
Uh, okay, but she's right here.

423
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,533
Taylor. Taylor.

424
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
Can you just please tell him
that I'm sorry,

425
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,834
but I really think this is
what's best for me and us?

426
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,201
Ryan, she's sorry,

427
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,533
but she...
Yeah, I heard that.

428
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,900
Taylor, would you
talk to me, please?

429
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,334
This is crazy.

430
00:18:57,401 --> 00:19:00,567
All right, would you at least
tell me what this is about?

431
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,700
Are you breaking up
with me?

432
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,900
She asks that you trust
her for a while longer.

433
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,934
(sighs):
Taylor, look,

434
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:11,500
whatever the reason
you're doing all this,

435
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,500
you don't have to--
we can work on it together.

436
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,234
Please.

437
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,101
Please.

438
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,101
Good-bye, Ryan.

439
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,734
Does that mean...
(engine starts)

440
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,900
Okay, you're gonna...

441
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,267
Hey, little buddy.

442
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,267
Che.

443
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:52,334
Che.

444
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,967
What was wrong
with the elevator?

445
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,001
Nothing.

446
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,800
I just really love doing that.

447
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,267
Hey, little duder.

448
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,767
(rattling)
What was that?

449
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:09,301
Let's get... let's get it out.

450
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:14,500
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

451
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:18,800
Okay, where are the ropes?

452
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,234
I left them inside.

453
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,468
Dude...

454
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,667
No, it's all right.

455
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,401
Uh... relax.
I'll go get them.

456
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:27,567
Here.
Do you want to...?
Give it here.

457
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,633
(whistles):
Hey.

458
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,567
There some sort of problem?

459
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:38,500
Uh...

460
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,667
it is possible
that the piece of tape

461
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:42,067
I put over the lock
got torn through.

462
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:45,401
So are you saying
we're stuck up here?

463
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:46,900
No.

464
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:49,301
As long as I can...

465
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,101
Yeah.

466
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,901
--Get out.

467
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:15,500
Che, what are you doing?

468
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,368
I didn't mean to wake you up.

469
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,700
I'm meditating over a dream.

470
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:22,433
You realize this is
the second time you and I have

471
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,934
spent the
night together?
So?

472
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:28,001
So... does that mean
anything to you?

473
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:32,533
You'll be going
on your little adventures
by yourself from now on?

474
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:38,500
Seth...

475
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,001
when the universe...

476
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,667
intends for something
to happen...

477
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:45,500
<i>...it will</i> happen,

478
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:50,734
and our personal desires
or natural predilections,
they just don't
figure in.

479
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,001
In fact...

480
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:56,967
there's something that I've
been meaning to tell you.

481
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,500
This belong to you two?

482
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:03,700
Crouch behind me.

483
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:07,533
Oh! Happy birthday,
sweetheart.

484
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,867
Thanks.

485
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:10,533
Hey. Come on. Sit down.

486
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,433
I am making you
a birthday breakfast
you won't believe.

487
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,834
Oh, that's sweet,
but, Sandy,

488
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,001
I don't think I'm
in the mood for a big breakfast.

489
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,767
Oh, you're taking this
turning-40 thing a little hard,

490
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,700
aren't you? You know, it's not
the end of the world.

491
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:22,533
You're more beautiful now
than the day we met.

492
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Soon, Seth and Ryan'll be gone.

493
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,234
We'll be able to do
whatever we want.

494
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,268
We'll be like kids again.

495
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:28,734
And live in the back
of a mail truck?

496
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,967
Why not?

497
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,734
'Course, maybe we'll throw in
a pillow-top mattress.

498
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,134
My back's not what
it used to be.

499
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:37,134
Sandy...

500
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:39,767
Hey!

501
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,034
Happy
birthday.
Oh...

502
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:44,533
Hey, thanks.

503
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,101
Did I interrupt something?

504
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,600
No.
No!

505
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,268
Okay.

506
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,268
Oh.

507
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,700
Excuse me.

508
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,500
Hey, dinner
reservations 8:00.

509
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:59,134
Don't make any plans.

510
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,301
Any luck yet?

511
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:02,800
Nothing. I must've made
30 calls yesterday.

512
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:05,533
All right.
Well, anything you need me
to do today, I'm all yours.

513
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,567
Thanks.

514
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:08,934
I feel she really needs this.

515
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:13,767
Of course I can see
the doctor today,
but can't she just tell me?

516
00:23:16,268 --> 00:23:19,134
I understand.
She wants to tell me in person.

517
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,767
Hi, babe.

518
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,268
Mom, where are you?

519
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,467
I'm at the spa getting
shined and buffed. What's up?

520
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,334
What does it feel like
when your appendix bursts?

521
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:32,467
<i>I don't feel</i> proud.

522
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:33,667
Well, you should be.

523
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,001
What you did yesterday
was very difficult.

524
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,667
Yeah, but the look
on his face...

525
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:39,001
I just wanted
to hold him.

526
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,467
And you will, but first you
have to take care of yourself.

527
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,800
Excuse me.

528
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,167
Hello.

529
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:46,500
Yes.

530
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:47,800
Oh.

531
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,034
All right.

532
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,167
Listen, I've got to go.

533
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:51,433
Another patient's
having a crisis.

534
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
But we'll talk later.

535
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:53,533
Okay.
All right.

536
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,834
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Sorry about that.

537
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,001
You guys must be getting
ready for the festival.

538
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,533
Yeah. Thanks.
Uh... okay.

539
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,834
Come on, guys,
let's go. Uh...

540
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:09,167
We don't want
to be late.

541
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,167
Kaitlin?

542
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:17,334
Mom, I'm fine.

543
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,234
What? Wh...?

544
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,167
What are all these
flowers doing here?

545
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:25,834
There's someone who wants
to ask you something.

546
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:28,034
What are you
talking about?

547
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:29,067
There you are.

548
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,167
Gordon!?

549
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:31,500
You are a sight for sore eyes.

550
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:32,967
Come to Big Daddy.

551
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:34,234
Okay, everybody stop.

552
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:36,934
What is going on?
You're not dying and...

553
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,567
Gordon, what are
you doing here?

554
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:40,400
It's time, squirt.
Hit it.

555
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,167
I really don't think
that it's...

556
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:43,533
Trust me.
Hit it.

557
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,101
Okay.

558
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,034
Oh. My God.

559
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:51,067
Julie Cooper,

560
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:54,301
I've traveled
the world over,
had everything
money can buy,

561
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:58,634
but there comes a time
in a billionaire's life
that his money
ain't worth a dime

562
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,001
unless he has someone
to share it with.

563
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:04,201
Will you marry me?

564
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:12,167
I don't know what to say.

565
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:14,433
Oh, a "yes" works for me.

566
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,600
Mom, isn't this great?

567
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,368
Y... I-it's very, very nice,

568
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,500
but, please, stand up.

569
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:20,600
Um...

570
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,500
I'm, I'm flattered, but...

571
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:23,867
w-will you turn
that off, please?

572
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,067
Okay.

573
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:26,101
Fine.

574
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,800
Thank you.

575
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:30,533
I guess I'm just surprised.

576
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,467
Well, when I see
something I want,

577
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,234
I go for it like a bullet. Bang.

578
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,967
But, Gordon, we haven't spoken
since you went to Dubai.

579
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:42,001
Mom, he just asked you
to marry him.

580
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,467
I mean... look at the ring.

581
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:44,734
It's ri-dog-ulous.

582
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,600
An-and what about
all those e-mails?

583
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:51,201
I've never seen so many
X's and O's and that would be
hugs and kisses, right?

584
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:52,867
W-what e-mails?

585
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,067
You know, the music was
actually really awesome.

586
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:58,234
GORDON:
And especially
that last one--
you know the one,

587
00:25:58,301 --> 00:25:59,800
where you said...

588
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:08,467
Oh, crap.

589
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,934
Hello.
Caterpillar.

590
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,834
Che, oh, my God,
he looks so sad.

591
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:22,967
Who?

592
00:26:23,034 --> 00:26:24,433
Newport Chuck.
I'm looking at him

593
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,600
right now-- I thought you were
going to rescue him.

594
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,800
Well, things didn't go
exactly as planned.

595
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,433
Are you at the pier right now?
Yeah. They're setting up

596
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,467
for the ceremony right now.
Where are you?

597
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:34,467
The Man caught me.

598
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,368
What?
You're in jail, Che?

599
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:37,934
No, don't. No, don't
worry about me.

600
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,201
You have to focus on Chuck.
He needs you right now.

601
00:26:40,268 --> 00:26:42,467
Caterpillar, you have
to rescue him.

602
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:44,500
No. Che, I told you
not to involve me.

603
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:49,001
Sometimes, Summer...

604
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,800
our destiny is chosen for us.

605
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:54,234
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

606
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:55,301
Okay.

607
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,500
It's all you.

608
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,167
I was next.

609
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:06,334
Who should I call?

610
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,967
<i>TAYLOR:
I see. So, who else</i>

611
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:11,700
is on stage other than the mayor
and, obviously, Newport Chuck?

612
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:13,301
Well, a couple
of the mayor's men,

613
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:16,368
some city
council members,
a few police officers.

614
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:17,567
And so, uh, that's it?

615
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:21,368
Mmm. Wait. There's
also a few people
dressed as groundhogs.

616
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:25,034
What paper did you
say you're with?

617
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,400
<i>Uh... Groundhog's Day Weekly.</i>

618
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,867
which comes out once a year,
usually around...

619
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:30,634
Groundhog Day?

620
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,201
Yes. Thank you so much.

621
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:33,234
Mmm.

622
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,767
You were e-mailing him
and pretending to be me?

623
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:48,634
I just know you
don't deal well
with long-distance
relationships.

624
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,867
I thought you
might regret it.

625
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,334
Really? That's the reason?

626
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,834
Has nothing to do with you being
sick of eating frozen dinners?

627
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:57,101
What? And your saying
no has nothing to do
with the fact you're
seeing a mystery man?

628
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,800
A.) I never said no.

629
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,134
B.) That is my private life.

630
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:05,034
Kaitlin, there is more to
relationships than just money.

631
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,433
I don't care for The Bullit
just because he's a billionaire.

632
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,234
Maybe I care a little bit.

633
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:14,334
But the reason why I would've
told him to marry you
is because I know he loves you,

634
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,334
and he's a
really nice guy,
and he's really funny...

635
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:21,901
...and he'd make
an amazing step-dad.

636
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:39,234
You have to tell
him the truth.

637
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,734
What are you
gonna tell him?

638
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,301
I don't know.

639
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:48,700
Well, better make up
your mind quick...

640
00:28:50,734 --> 00:28:53,467
...'cause I'm taking him with me
to Kirsten's party.

641
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:10,400
Hello.

642
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:12,400
Kirsten. I need your help.

643
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,433
Uh-huh.

644
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,467
Oh. Happy birthday.

645
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:15,634
Thanks.

646
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,533
Bullit just proposed to me.

647
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,533
That's nice.

648
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,368
I told him I'd give him
an answer by tonight,
but the truth is...

649
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:24,967
...I've been seeing
someone else in secret.

650
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,268
You'll never believe who.

651
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:27,500
Julie, I'm, I'm gonna lie down.

652
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:28,734
Congratulations.

653
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,500
That was a guy
at the junkyard at Chatsworth.

654
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,167
He's got one.

655
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:42,834
<i>He says</i> he can have it
at the yacht club in an hour.

656
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:44,234
Sounds like everything's
gonna be okay.

657
00:29:44,301 --> 00:29:45,533
Well, let's hope.

658
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,167
What's going on
with you and Taylor?

659
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:55,201
Come on. You've been
in the dumps today.

660
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:57,234
Honestly, I don't know.

661
00:29:57,301 --> 00:30:00,334
She said she needs
space; I said, "Sure."

662
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,334
TAYLOR (muffled):
Stupid tree.

663
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,467
Oh... dumb branches.

664
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,667
RYAN:
I sort of
talked to her.

665
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:07,201
Taylor was right
there, right?

666
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:09,901
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah;
but she wasn't
supposed to be
talking to me.

667
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,834
She would say
something and then
the therapist would
say it again to me.

668
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,867
Wow.

669
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:20,967
It's crazy, huh?

670
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:23,001
SANDY:
Yeah. I mean, a little, but...

671
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:25,433
And, I mean, I want her
to do what she needs to do.

672
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,567
Did you tell her that?

673
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:27,767
I tried.
(phone ringing)

674
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:28,867
Excuse me.
Yeah, sure.

675
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:31,800
SANDY:
Yeah, hello. Seth?

676
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:32,967
Where are you?

677
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:41,901
Oh, no...

678
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:45,167
Oh, whoa, you...

679
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:46,268
You okay?

680
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:47,901
Taylor?

681
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:50,901
What are you doing?

682
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:53,867
I was just...

683
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:54,834
Taylor, are you okay?

684
00:30:54,901 --> 00:30:57,567
I'm sorry. Just...

685
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:58,934
forget you ever knew me.

686
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:06,567
--Newport Plaza turned
into a crime scene today

687
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:09,301
as a young woman
dressed up as a groundhog

688
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,667
grabbed Newport Chuck
and made a dash for it.

689
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:14,268
And, while Newport's
beloved groundhog

690
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,934
has yet to be recovered,
the Newport Police Department

691
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,101
has taken a woman into custody

692
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:22,433
whom they believe
to be the kidnapper.

693
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,967
My dad said
he'll be right over.

694
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:25,967
What about me?
Don't worry, Dale.

695
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:27,001
He knows
you're here, too.

696
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:29,034
But I don't wanna leave.

697
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:34,134
Seth, I haven't
been honest with you.

698
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,533
Uh... remember
in the sweat lodge

699
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,067
when you discovered that
your animus was a sea otter?

700
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,167
Mm-hmm.

701
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,901
Well...

702
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:48,533
see, I had a dream
that night, too.

703
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,901
Uh... and I discovered
that my animal self
was a bullfrog.

704
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,301
Oh.

705
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:55,234
And, uh...
Oh, that's awesome;
frogs are cool.

706
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,734
Yeah, but there's, there's
kinda more to it.

707
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,600
See... (clears throat)

708
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:07,567
I also discovered that the
animus of my soul mate...

709
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:09,834
CHE:
Well, see, my...

710
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:12,533
in the dream, my bullfrog


711
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:17,534
was in love...

712
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,134
w-with...

713
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:43,767
...a groundhog.

714
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,034
It wasn't an otter at all.

715
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,734
What? Wha-What wasn't an otter?

716
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,301
Uh...

717
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:56,901
Never mind.

718
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,767
(chuckles):
No, nothing. What?

719
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,201
You were gonna say...  Che!
Never mind.

720
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:01,234
Che, what wasn't an otter?

721
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,167
I ate a squirrel once.

722
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:30,700
That's great.

723
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:35,034
Cohen, Cook,
someone's posted bail for you.

724
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,101
Whew!

725
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,934
You coming?

726
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,500
No, you go.

727
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm not leaving
till we're both free.

728
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:45,500
Works for me.

729
00:33:58,268 --> 00:34:00,134
Sandy, where have you been?

730
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,533
I called you three times.

731
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,301
Well, it's been
a busy afternoon.

732
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:06,268
Please tell me that you haven't
planned anything big tonight.

733
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,433
<i>Well, on your</i> birthday, sorry,
but I plead the Fifth.

734
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,301
Listen, can you meet me
at the yacht club?

735
00:34:10,368 --> 00:34:11,634
I thought
we were going together.

736
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,901
Yeah, I know, but I had to make
other arrangements.

737
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,634
Sandy...

738
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,101
I'll see you
in a few minutes.

739
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:21,433
Hi, Dad. I hope I'm not
late for Mom's party.

740
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:26,434
--Kirsten Cohen?

741
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:28,767
Yes?
I'm here to take you
to your husband.

742
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,034
<i>RYAN:
I cannot believe that you tried</i>
to steal Newport Chuck.</i>

743
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,900
<i>Sometimes the universe
makes you do things that
you</i> don't even understand.

744
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:43,501
Sure. Well, Sandy didn't
seem to upset about it.

745
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:47,534
Are you kidding?
He's waited 18 years
for me to be arrested
for political activism.

746
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:50,100
It's probably the proudest
moment of his entire life.

747
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,267
Ah!

748
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:54,301
It's your mom.

749
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:57,700
Good evening.
Good evening.

750
00:34:57,767 --> 00:34:59,267
Thank you.
You're welcome.

751
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:01,000
Happy birthday.
Oh, thank you.

752
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:04,700
I hope your father didn't do
anything too extravagant.

753
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,201
Ooh, might be
(laughing)

754
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:08,301
a little late
for that, yeah.

755
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:12,034
(laughs)

756
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:15,634
Oh, my God.

757
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,201
Yeah, that was
my first thought, too.

758
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,867
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

759
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:26,301
Oh...

760
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:28,900
Sandy, it's...

761
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:31,267
No, it's not
the same mail truck
we had at Berkeley,

762
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:32,800
but it is exactly
the same model.

763
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,634
It's amazing.

764
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,934
Thank you.
And here's your real present.

765
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,401
Happy birthday.

766
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:44,401
Around-the-world
first-class air tickets.

767
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:45,501
Just you and me.

768
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:48,900
That's not bad, huh?

769
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,367
Ah...

770
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:53,267
I-I think I can...
I can top it.

771
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:55,700
Can I talk to
you in private?

772
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:56,867
Yeah.

773
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:58,034
You two stay here.

774
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,301
Fellas, watch the truck.

775
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,568
Okay.

776
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:07,534
I want you seated for this.

777
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,034
Is everything okay?

778
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,934
I went to a doctor.

779
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:13,700
Are you sick?

780
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:15,067
Yes.

781
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:17,267
But only in the mornings.

782
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,900
What?

783
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,601
I'm pregnant.

784
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:25,434
Wait, one more time.

785
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:28,267
Sandy, we're having a baby.

786
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:30,267
We're having a baby?!

787
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:33,067
Everything's gonna change.

788
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:34,733
You're not kidding.

789
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,267
I love you.

790
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:43,501
Well, that's good,
because there's gonna be
a lot more of me to love.

791
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:51,067
Oh, my gosh.

792
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,067
And then Brad was, like,
"Oh, no,"

793
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,934
and I was, like,
"Oh, yeah."

794
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,767
Well, that Brad sounds like
a piece of work.

795
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,668
And I still can't believe you
wrote me all those e-mails.

796
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:07,501
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

797
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:10,767
And that last one,
a little frisky,
a little inappropriate.

798
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,601
Aw, but what the hell.

799
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:14,201
The offer still stands--

800
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:17,867
she's still the
most exciting woman
I've ever met.

801
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:20,334
Kaitlin. Gordon.

802
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,601
Mom, did you hear that?

803
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:23,367
The Bullit still wants
to marry you.

804
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,800
(exhales):
Yes.

805
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:28,167
Well, Gordon,
that's very generous.

806
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:33,134
But I'm afraid my answer
has to be no.

807
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:39,134
Sit down;
I'm not finished.

808
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:42,767
As I was saying, no--

809
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,867
because we don't know each other
well enough.

810
00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:47,067
But... I'm willing
to correct that.

811
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:51,534
I like you, Gordon,
and if after spending time
together,

812
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:53,967
I can grow to love you,
then...

813
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,967
yes, I would be proud
to be your wife.

814
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:00,967
Wow. (chuckles)

815
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:02,668
Oh, wow.

816
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:04,967
Come here.

817
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,434
Can I get up now?

818
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:14,234
Yes, of course
you can get up.

819
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:29,067
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

820
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:30,568
<i>That's what I</i> said.
I know

821
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,067
this isn't what
everybody expected.

822
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:34,234
That's family, there's nothing
more important than that.

823
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:35,501
I mean...

824
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:38,767
<i>I mean,</i> you're...
you're pregnant.

825
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,100
SETH:
It's so weird.

826
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,134
Yeah, well,
congratulations.

827
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:44,700
SETH:
Yeah, it's great.

828
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,067
Especially since it makes me
getting arrested
seem trivial now...

829
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:49,267
You got what?
Thanks for prepping her, Dad.

830
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,167
Oh, that--
we'll deal with that later.

831
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:54,367
Uh, right now...
we've got some guests inside.

832
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,134
Actually, I was gonna run
and pick up Summer, so...

833
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,767
Oh, could you give me a
ride, 'cause I got...

834
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:01,201
Go tell Taylor that you
love her and you can't
live without her?
Mm, something
like that.

835
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:03,601
Hey, I'll see you guys
in a few minutes.
Yeah.

836
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,067
And suddenly, we're alone again.

837
00:39:10,134 --> 00:39:12,000
Eh, not for long.

838
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:29,201
(sighs):
Okay.

839
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,301
(exhales):
Take care of him.

840
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:37,067
Don't worry-- soon enough
he'll be burrowing away with
his little brothers and sisters.

841
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:38,900
Listen, I'm so sorry
that I got you arrested.

842
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:40,534
I should've never asked
to borrow your costume.

843
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,700
I didn't mean
to get you into trouble.

844
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:46,167
It's okay-- turns out
the mayor's a lover of
our animal brethren.

845
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:48,434
He gave us both amnesty.

846
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:49,833
Yeah, and this way
we got to meet.

847
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,668
The universe works
in mysterious ways.

848
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:55,967
So your dream was right
all along-- that's amazing!

849
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:57,301
SETH:
Hey.

850
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:58,733
Wow, crowded room.

851
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,234
Hi.
You guys off?

852
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:03,467
Yes. To where the winds
of libery blow over
the mountaintops.

853
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,434
You mean Chicago or something?

854
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:06,534
Take care, you two.

855
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,668
In another life, brother.

856
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,267
Hey...

857
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:13,800
Hey.

858
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:16,634
So, are we too late
for your mom's birthday party?

859
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,167
Uh, actually, I think it
may be more of a baby shower

860
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:21,234
now, but I'll explain
in the car, or maybe

861
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:22,767
I won't-- I think it's
supposed to be a secret.

862
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:26,067
Listen, what did, uh, Che mean
when he said "in another life"?

863
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,234
In another life what?
Um...

864
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,833
Hello?

865
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,334
(heavy breathing over phone)
Hello?

866
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:43,668
MAN (breathy whisper):
Oh, yeah...
Who is this?

867
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,668
What are you wearing?

868
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:47,733
Ryan?

869
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:51,000
Hi.

870
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:53,201
Were you just trying
to stalk me?

871
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:54,900
Yeah, I guess I need
a little more practice.

872
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:58,267
That is the most romantic thing
anyone has ever done for me.

873
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:00,201
Mm.

874
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:03,334
So does that mean the whole,
uh, space thing...

875
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:04,833
Yeah, terrible idea.
Mm.

876
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,833
You don't mind dating someone
who's a total weirdo?

877
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,967
No, no. In fact, I was thinking
we could work around it.

878
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:14,501
Like, I have to go
to Kirsten's party,
but if you wanted...

879
00:41:14,568 --> 00:41:15,700
you could follow me.

880
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,234
Yes, and then
when we get there,

881
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,000
I could hide behind
a plant and just

882
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:20,501
kind of watch you.
Exactly, exactly.

883
00:41:20,568 --> 00:41:22,867
<i>And then, on the way home,
I could stalk you.</i>

884
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:24,568
<i>Yes! And then
I stalk you.</i>
Yes!

885
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:53,367
* *

886
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,067
Hi. It's me.

887
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:09,234
No, I-I won't be
making it tonight.

888
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:10,733
Um...

889
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,733
Listen, I, uh...

890
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,367
I'm back with Bullit.

891
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,634
I know.

892
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,267
I know.

893
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:23,767
But this is the best thing
for my family.

894
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,334
I'm sorry.

895
00:42:30,568 --> 00:42:31,833
Me, too.

896
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,501
Good-bye, Frank.

897
