1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,860
previously on the o.c.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,050
am only here to promote my book.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,830
Good,because if you think this little trip of yours is gonna send me scurrying back to France...

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,850
Taylor told me of your studies,the series of articles you wrote.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,070
You lied to make me look good- I get that- but I think part of you wishes it were true.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,240
I think I should go.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,990
xx

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,790
xxxxxx

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,260
xxxxxxxx

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,810
I think we should stay engaged.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,880
I don't think that you can be with someone until you can be with yourself.

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,130
Oh,that sounds like a...

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,170
I guess it's a no.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Dude,I asked the girl to marry me.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,960
Yeah,and she said no.

16
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,030
It's not like she broke up with you.

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,100
That would have been better.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,390
Someone says they don't want to marry you,you're supposed to break up.

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,010
Now we got to keep on dating like everything is normal,when there's this gi-normous...

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,320
elephant in the room.
Yeah,there's an elephant?

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,390
The "I don't want to marry you" elephant.
All right,look.

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,340
There's no elephant,and there's no breakup.

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,410
It's a breakup.

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,730
How else do you explain 17 unreturned phone calls?

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,760
Seventeen?

26
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,740
The first 12 were apologies for that stupid lie I told Henri about Ryan.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,160
And after that,it was just kind of a blur.

28
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,980
Sooner or later,he has to call me back,right?

29
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,920
I'll call her when I'm ready.

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,390
What?

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,370
She lied to me about her French ex-husband.

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,640
And she also apologized.

33
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,720
Taylor doesn't respond well to neglect,man.

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,020
You should call her.

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,690
Yeah?Maybe you should call Summer.

36
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,820
Is that Seth?

37
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,570
Che.

38
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,040
I'll call him back.

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,650
He's flying here.He was feeling weird Seth vibes.

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,930
All the way from Rhode Island?

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,450
Che transcends space and time.

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,770
Ryan?

43
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,260
No,Henri-Michel.

44
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,360
God,Frenchie's really putting on the full-court press,huh?

45
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,120
Yeah.

46
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,060
Nothing's happened yet,though.

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,280
I keep telling him I've got a boyfriend.

48
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,100
Even though,technically,I guess I don't anymore.

49
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,360
You know,I think Ryan's just waiting for Henri to go back to the motherland.

50
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,340
She said in her message he's still in town.

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,120
Until he leaves,we can't have a real conversation.

52
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,600
I don't get it- when is he leaving?

53
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,330
That's just it; he's not leaving.

54
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,660
He's renting a house in Newport,and he asked me to move in with him.

55
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,790
What?

56
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,990
You're not considering it,are you?

57
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,030
It's just that I've been mooching off of you and Julie for months now,

58
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,470
and I've lived with Henri-Michel before,and he's really not a bad roommate,

59
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,400
you know,aside from his natural odor and- I don't know- maybe I can force myself to fall in love with him.

60
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,330
Why would you want to do that?

61
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,170
Because I'm going to need some help getting over Ryan.

62
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,700
They're going to call.

63
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,660
Maybe we should call.

64
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,550
They're going to call.

65
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,300
Right?

70
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,950
Hey,Roberts.

71
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,310
Hey,look,I'm sorry to bother you at work,but I just really needed to talk to you.

72
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,310
Oh,no macho nacho supreme?
No.

73
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,530
Are you sure?It's really good.

74
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,730
How's Seth?

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,400
See,I kind of turned down his proposal and never heard from him again.

76
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,500
Proposal?

77
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,300
That's the first time I'm hearing about it.

78
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,020
Right.

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,620
For a week now,Seth has been off the map.

80
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,900
You expect me to believe that not once did he mention anything about a proposal going awry?

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,200
Right,well,he had pinkeye.

82
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,510
Pinkeye?

83
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,990
Did you have pinkeye,too?

84
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,690
What?Why?

85
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,010
Well,'cause Taylor said she didn't hear from you,either,and she was asking about you.

86
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,460
Well,see,that was 'cause I was,I was helping him with his recovery.

87
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,620
And waiting for Henri-Michel to leave.

88
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,180
Actually,I don't really mean to be the bearer of bad news,

89
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,830
but he's looking for a house to rent in Newport.

90
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,460
Great.

91
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,190
Summer?

92
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,380
Hey,Che,what are you doing here?

93
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,080
Tai Chi.

94
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,280
The soft and pliable will destroy the hard and strong.

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,680
I guess I meant what are you doing in Summer's living room?

96
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,360
I'm here for you.

97
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,670
Fig?

98
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,140
Did you know that figs are nature's biological response modifiers?

99
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,870
And since I know that you're ailing spiritually...

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,890
What?

101
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,570
Come on,man,you can't lie to me.

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,660
I can see your aura.

103
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,710
Besides,Summer told me she rejected your proposal.

104
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,340
Well...

105
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,240
When she hadn't heard from you for a couple days,she got pretty worried.

106
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,350
Yeah.No,that was just my sciatica acting up.

107
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,760
Seth,you put something out into the universe,and you didn't get it back.

108
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,210
I mean,I really can't imagine what a blow that must have been to your male animus.

109
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,140
You've been emasculated.

110
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,400
My masculinity is intact.

111
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,870
Look,you and Summer revealed my hypocrisy,man.

112
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,390
You saved me,so I hear that you're hurting,I just want to come and try to save you.

113
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,580
Thank you,but,you know,I'm good.

114
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,470
I'm very good.

115
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,900
Hey.
Summer.

116
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,920
Hi.

117
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,080
Your pinkeye is all clear.

118
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,230
Pinkeye?
Yeah.

119
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,880
The reason why I haven't heard from you.

120
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,920
I talked to Ryan.

121
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,000
It was his sciatica.

122
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,280
Yeah,when it gets in your eye,it goes,it goes pink.I'm great.

123
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,460
You are?
Are you?

124
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,830
Yes.

125
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,860
Good.

126
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,960
'Cause I missed you.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,580
Tonight,we are going to have a date.

128
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,310
Hey,a date sounds perfect.

129
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,270
A romantic date.
Aren't they all,Summer?

130
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,320
Aren't they all?High fives all around.

131
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,460
High fives...all around.

132
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,900
Seriously,I'm good.

133
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,250
I'll see you tonight for this date.

134
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,090
Uh,perhaps I was wrong.

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,020
Seth is actually stronger than we thought.

136
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,110
I wouldn't leave town just yet.

137
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,020
There's lots of closet space.

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Plenty of room for your pants.

139
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,060
Each pair could have its own walk-in.

140
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,150
What is this American obsession with closets?

141
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,540
It's a capitalist conspiracy to hide what you own so you will buy more?

142
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,720
Or does it have to do with sex?

143
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,810
Henri,are you sure you really want to move here?

144
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,210
I will do whatever it takes to win back your love,Peaches.

145
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,890
You see,that is very brave of you.

146
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,480
You're really putting yourself out there.

147
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,840
You're really taking an emotional risk.

148
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,730
Unlike some people.

149
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,090
Still have not heard from Ryan?

150
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,740
No,and you would think that he would at least have the decency to dump me on the phone.

151
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,250
But it's fine,though.

152
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,170
I'm fine,because Ryan and I were never really going to work,anyway.

153
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,200
He doesn't even like cheese.

154
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,580
I must admit,I feel for him.

155
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,080
I know the excruciating pain of living without you.

156
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,430
And a life without cheese,well...

157
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,260
You know,it's probably good that you came back when you did,before Ryan and I got any more serious.

158
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,650
I know it is good for me.

159
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,570
Je t'aime,Peaches.

160
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,700
Oh,no,no.

161
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,210
Henri,you don't have to say that.

162
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,630
But I love to say that,because it is the truth.

163
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,020
I will say it a thousand times,if you like.

164
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,570
That's,uh- okay,yeah,say it a thousand times.

165
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,290
I love you,un.

166
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,580
I love you,deux.

167
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,000
I love you trois.

168
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,020
Look,I got my first non-cheating A.

169
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,270
Your tutoring is really paying off.

170
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,310
Kind of weird,since we barely studied last night.

171
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,300
Yeah,I guess you can learn chemistry from making out.

172
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,660
I actually did some studying after you left.

173
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,840
I guess your work ethic is kind of contagious.

174
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's see what else I can catch.

175
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,840
Um,why is this girl staring at me?

176
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,400
I don't know.

177
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,740
Hi,Will.

178
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,230
Your solo at practice this morning was so amazing.

179
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,100
Thanks.

180
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,120
Um,Lucy,this is Kaitlin.

181
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,720
Kaitlin,this is Lucy.

182
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,180
She's in band with me.

183
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,930
No kidding.

184
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,150
You still in for Friday night?
Yeah,sure,I'll be there.

185
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,140
Great,I can't wait.
What's Friday night?

186
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,300
We're having a bake sale in the student lounge,to raise money for new uniforms.

187
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,830
Will and I are manning the Rice Krispy treats table.

188
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,410
See you later,Will.

189
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm going to go practice my scales.

190
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,160
All right.

191
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,710
You should come; it'll be fun.

192
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,500
Band geeks and baking goods.

193
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,340
Definitely sounds like the feel-good hit of the year.

194
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,730
Well,maybe we can do something after.

195
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,010
Well,I do have a Latin test coming up.

196
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,770
Maybe you can help me study.

197
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,050
All right.

198
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,790
Um,well,I guess I'll see you a little later.

199
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,180
New Match.

200
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,800
Hi,Kiki,don't hang up.

201
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,730
You turn our business into a prostitution ring,and you get hung up on- company policy.

202
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:00,940
New Match.

203
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,540
Did you at least get my cookie bouquet?

204
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,310
I'm allergic to chocolate.
No,you're not.

205
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,500
Then I'm allergic to you.

206
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,400
Just tell me how long you're gonna be mad at me about this.

207
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,190
You're kidding,right?

208
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,870
Kirsten,our friendship can't just end like this.

209
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,220
There must be something I can do.

210
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,180
If you'll excuse me,I have a legitimate business to run that doesn't involve hookers.

211
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,070
Ryan.

212
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,730
Finally.

213
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,580
Is Taylor in?

214
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,720
You know,she's been asking about you every day this week.

215
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,510
I'm here now.
She's not.

216
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,640
Try the Four Seasons.

217
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,790
Where her French ex-husband is staying?

218
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,670
All right,I guess I can head over there.

219
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,730
So what did you end up getting her?
Huh?

220
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,800
Don't tell me you came with no gift.
I don't need a gift.

221
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,280
Ryan,Pep\ Le Pew is buying her a house.

222
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,180
She's moving in with him?

223
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,360
You honestly got her nothing?

224
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:08,040
I mean,you couldn't have gone to the Quickie Mart to get her a stuffed animal and some gummy bears?

225
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,930
Gummy bears.

226
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,440
Talk is cheap,Ryan.

227
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,490
If you're going toe-to-toe with this Frenchie,you're going to need to step your game up.

228
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,430
I can't believe I'm getting advice from a 15-year-old.

229
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,890
A 15-year-old who's right.

230
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,070
Okay,so the big date's in your bedroom?
Uh,yeah.

231
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,240
You saved some money on gas.

232
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,960
Ryan lent me some videogames.

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,960
There's Thai takeout and some of your favorite whiny records.

234
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,650
And...

235
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,880
I still really love you.

236
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,070
But,I hope we get married someday,I'm just not ready now.

237
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,390
Hey,forget the whole thing ever happened.

238
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,610
I know I have.
I don't want to forget about it.

239
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,120
What you did was amazing.

240
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,580
It was so sweet.

241
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,950
The words you said and how sincere you were when you said them.

242
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,420
And the glow-in-the-dark ring,it was so cute.

243
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,590
Yeah,it's so hot in here.

244
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,740
Yeah,that's a good thing.

245
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,750
No,I,I think the...air conditioning is broken or something,maybe.

246
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,930
It's winter.
I'm going to go get a glass of water.

247
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,860
Do you want anything?
No.

248
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,110
No water?
Seth.

249
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,210
Hey,Che.

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,950
Seth.

251
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,510
Hey.You look...
Not good,I know.

252
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,740
So,the thing you said about my animus...

253
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,500
I was right,wasn't I?

254
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,950
See,'cause the flesh can lie but the aura never does.

255
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,570
It's been eating at you,little buddy,I can tell.

256
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,390
And you can fix me?

257
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,570
That's what I do.

258
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,360
xxxxxxxx

259
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,490
Hey,Seth,it's me.

260
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,650
Just calling to see how you're feeling.

261
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,760
Hope that crazy 24-hour flu thing cleared up.

262
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,500
And,uh...

263
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,370
also I don't believe that you have the flu.

264
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,470
Okay,bye.

265
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,140
Dear Caterpillar,Last night,Seth came to me for help.

266
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm taking him to the forest.

267
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,990
He needs to pick up the sword and embrace his inner warrior.

268
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,560
Only by running with the wolves shall he learn to walk like a man.

269
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,860
Are you sure I don't need to bring my phone?

270
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,510
It's got GPS.What if we get lost?

271
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,830
No,you don't need anything.

272
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,810
What about a jacket?What if it's cold?

273
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:23,460
All we need is my harmonica- got it- your broken spirit and these giant backpacks.

274
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,810
I will help your soul mate find himself.

275
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,680
But where are you,Summer Bear?

276
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,550
Where is the Iron Butterfly who once inspired me so?

277
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,690
As we had into the trees,perhaps you need to find your own path.

278
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,500
Peace and Love,Che.

279
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,210
Oh,Crap.

280
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,300
Ryan.

281
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,710
Entr\e.

282
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,210
So,you are here to beat me up.

283
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,410
I warn you- my family is hemophilic; I will bleed.

284
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,560
I'm actually looking for Taylor.

285
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,120
Kaitlin told me she was hanging out here.

286
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,620
But if she's not around...
I was kidding.

287
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,990
You are welcome.Can I get you some coffee?

288
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,030
It tastes like urine,but apparently that is how you Americans drink it.

289
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,800
You mind me asking when she's gonna be back?

290
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,190
Ah,she is shopping for furniture.

291
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,380
We move in to our new house on Monday.

292
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,770
Monday?

293
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,820
All right,well,look.

294
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,860
If you could just,um,tell her I stopped by.

295
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,420
Stop.

296
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,330
What is that in your hand?Uh?

297
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,000
It's noth...it's stupid.

298
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,530
It's not stupid.It's a teddy bear.

299
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,850
what is in his mug?

300
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,110
Gummy bears.

301
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,420
Ah,how amusing.

302
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,380
It is for Taylor?

303
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,170
Yeah.

304
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,020
Well,I will deliver it to her.

305
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,920
It's a tad juvenile,but it is from the heart and that is what matters.

306
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,660
You know what?No,it's fine.

307
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,110
Really,it's from the Quickie Mart and...
Stop being modest.

308
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm not afraid of a little competition,Ryan.

309
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,040
It is more fulfilling if Taylor chooses me in spite of you wanting her back.

310
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,030
Well,that's comforting.

311
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,980
Now,I feel a poem coming.

312
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,950
All right.

313
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,440
Hello?

314
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,020
Hey,Kirsten,it's Spencer.

315
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,780
Is Julie there?

316
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,340
She doesn't work here anymore,Spencer.

317
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,550
You should call her at home.

318
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,610
I can't,I'm in Mexico about to get on a boat.

319
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,670
But we have a problem.

320
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,900
What problem could we possibly have?

321
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,800
One of my boys,Chaz,called me last night and,uh,turns out he has chlamydia.

322
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,360
What?

323
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,950
Yeah,so you're probably gonna want to call and tell everyone he slept with.

324
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,150
I most certainly will not.It's up to you and Julie.

325
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,980
Hey,I'm out of the country.

326
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,630
And,you know,you just told me that Julie doesn't work there anymore,so...good luck.

327
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,950
Julie has the list.

328
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,910
Bye.

329
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,960
Isn't that her?

330
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,270
Yeah.

331
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,140
I've been looking for you.

332
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,280
Oh,hi,friend of Will's.

333
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,720
Nice hat.

334
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,300
Listen,skank.

335
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,440
What'd you just call me?

336
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,410
If you show up at our bake sale tonight,I'll kick your face in.

337
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,370
I'd definitely like to see that happen.

338
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,700
I happen to be a brown belt in Tai Kwon Do.

339
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,640
I happen to be going to second with the guy that you like.

340
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,140
Go.Now.

341
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,650
Before the Munchkins ask for their mayor back.

342
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,110
If we see your face tomorrow,you will regret it.

343
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,650
What,you going to blow your little trumpet at me until I cry?

344
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,380
You know,I was thinking about doing something fun tomorrow night.

345
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,860
But now I think I will go to your little geek fest and buy some brownies.

346
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,660
Bonjour.

347
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,050
I am exhausted.

348
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,930
If I have to look at one more mid-Century sofa,I'm going to kill somebody.

349
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,280
Well,you should have a nap.

350
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,760
Perhaps we both should.

351
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,510
Yeah,it's just,you know,I saw this special on hotel rooms,

352
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,280
and they search them with UV lights and,gah,you don't want to know.

353
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,310
Oh,you Americans and your germs.

354
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,860
By the way,Ryan...

355
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,350
brought this for you today.

356
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:16,200
He is not a classic romantic to be sure,but,uh,the bear has a sweet smile,hmm?

357
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,530
It must make you feel something.

358
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,710
Touched?

359
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,920
Nostalgic?

360
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,250
You know what this makes me feel?

361
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,250
This makes me feel...nothing.

362
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,630
Now tell me again why you love me.

363
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,530
But then I would have nothing left for my poetry reading tomorrow.

364
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,120
Kiki,you're calling me.

365
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,070
I'm delivering a message.

366
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,320
Spencer called.

367
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,570
It seems that one of your whores,Chaz,has chlamydia.

368
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,370
Chlamydia,ooh,that's rough.

369
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,100
Well,all the women that this guy slept with is going to have to be informed.

370
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,470
Spencer says you have a list.

371
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,690
Yes,of course.I'll drop it off tomorrow.

372
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,300
Drop it off?

373
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,970
Julie,I am not doing this.You're going to have to tell them.

374
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,110
Well,Kirsten,I'd love to,but I kind of don't work at New Match anymore.

375
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,190
Oh,no,no,no.

376
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,690
You are not making this my responsibility.

377
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,510
How about a compromise?

378
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,410
I'm listening.

379
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,240
We do it together.

380
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,120
I'm not facing those women.

381
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,440
I'll do the talking,you drive.

382
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,480
And how come you can't drive?

383
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,840
Oh,I'm sorry,do you want to do the talking?

384
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,480
It was our company.

385
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,430
You're liable.

386
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,060
I'll pick you up in the morning.

387
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,140
I'll find my little black book.

388
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,930
Come on,Taylor,I need you to come over.

389
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,680
Because I am making dinner.

390
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,920
A gourmet dinner.

391
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,860
Mm-hmm.

392
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,030
And I know you,more than anyone,appreciate fine food.

393
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,090
What am I making?

394
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,860
I am making quail and some caviar.

395
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,020
Maybe even a souffl\.

396
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,340
That is noov ier my head,okay?

397
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,170
ay r your information,I recently made a brisket and it was delightful.

398
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,670
Okay,great,I will see you soon.

399
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,650
Bye.

400
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,440
So she's coming.

401
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,650
Now you're going to tell me why I just had to lie to my friend?

402
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,160
Uh,because I need to see her.

403
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,850
cause?

404
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,390
I need to tell her how I feel.

405
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
Mm-hmm.

406
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,780
What?

407
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,890
Nothing.

408
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,620
You just don't really strike me as the coffee cart type.

409
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,820
And what does that mean?

410
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,230
Look,I'm sure you have changed- being with Taylor made you more expressive-

411
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,550
but articulating your feelings to your girlfriend,kind of a challenge.

412
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,250
Yeah,but if I don't make some sort of declaration...

413
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,210
You might lose her.

414
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,360
Okay,you just need to take a deep breath,look inside and say what's from your heart.

415
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,360
I can do that.

416
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
Good.One more thing.
Yeah?

417
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,990
Taylor has a super big heart,and she's super forgiving,

418
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,400
but,uh,there is a French guy circling like a great white shark.

419
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,220
Okay,you're just reminding me of the stakes.

420
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,280
No.

421
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,020
I'm giving you advice because you're my friend and I really want you to work this out.

422
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,770
All right,I'm listening,I'm listening.

423
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,990
Do not choke.

424
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,930
Okay,I wasn't going to until you did that.

425
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,800
You kind of have a wide neck.

426
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,330
Yeah,you got really small hands.Thanks for the advice.

427
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,410
No problem.

428
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,780
Are we almost there yet?

429
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,960
Why is everything a destination?

430
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Do the fish care where they swim each day?

431
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,770
Uh,actually,I think they do.

432
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,970
You still haven't told me what we're doing here.

433
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,470
Seth,relax.

434
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,090
Smell the trees.

435
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,890
Let the oxygen clean your blood.

436
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
Boy,I sure feel better.

437
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,290
Can we go back now?We've been hiking for hours.

438
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,840
I'm exhausted and I'm starving and my ass is cramping up.

439
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,310
Let's get to the top of the hill.

440
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,060
We're going to sing a song to the sunset...

441
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,050
And then we can go home?
No.

442
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,790
I think it's time I told you.

443
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,980
Your spirit animal is trapped.

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,560
What?

445
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,140
See,when a baby is born,an animal spirit enters the child in order to guide and protect him on his journey.

446
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,650
Somehow Summer's rejection caused your spirit animal to get sick.

447
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,400
In order to contact your animal,you must learn to live like him.

448
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,110
To spend the night in the forest.

449
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,270
Ah,we're here,Seth.

450
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,610
We've reached the sacred spot.

451
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,790
Now,we got to build a sweat lodge.

452
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,840
Che,look at me.

453
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,430
We're not staying here.

454
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,020
Where's the car?

455
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,200
The car is six hours away.

456
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,170
I mean,if we could even find it in the dark.

457
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,280
We have no choice but to stay here until tomorrow.

458
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,880
Go grab some willow branches.

459
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,520
I brought hides- buffalo,elk.

460
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,200
Willow branches- you know what willow looks like?

461
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,880
Summer!

462
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,430
Summer,where are you?

463
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,400
Summer?

464
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,230
God,you call someone,the least you can do is show up...

465
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,630
Ryan,what are you doing here?

466
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,770
I had Summer call you.I'm sorry.

467
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,300
I wanted to talk to you.

468
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,460
Well,it worked,weasel.

469
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,300
What do you want?

470
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,210
I wanted to apologize.I made a mistake.

471
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,140
When?

472
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,070
When you abandoned me on the set of a French talk show?

473
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,250
Or when you didn't call me for a week?

474
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,920
All of the above?

475
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,970
Well,you hurt me,Ryan.

476
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,010
Why couldn't you just have had faith in us?

477
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,800
I don't know,I guess I thought we were too different.

478
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,630
Maybe you were right.

479
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,160
No,I know I wasn't.

480
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,960
And I realize now that how we feel is much more important than what we have to talk about.

481
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
And how do you feel?

482
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,420
I...

483
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,340
I...

484
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,110
That stuffed animal that you bought me is more expressive,Ryan.

485
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,160
Henri-Michel is reading a poem that he wrote for me at the bookstore tomorrow night.

486
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,830
It's a love poem,Ryan,and it's long.

487
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,960
Hey,no snoozing,man.

488
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,950
You drift off to dreamland now,this whole thing is for naught.

489
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,920
You know,the Australian aboriginals believed...

490
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,440
Shut up,Che.

491
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,910
Little cranky today,are we?

492
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,200
I'm deranged.

493
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,310
I haven't been to sleep,I haven't eaten.

494
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,600
Hey,I got to break you down before we build you back up.

495
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,930
Now go gather rocks.

496
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,040
Okay,bye.
Bye.

497
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,000
All done.

498
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,930
She took it pretty well.

499
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,270
Excuse me.

500
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,240
Fiona.

501
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,230
Hi.

502
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,680
Hi.

503
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,150
I'm really sorry to have to tell you this.

504
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,360
One of Julie's boys...

505
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,790
What kind of unclean operation are you people running?

506
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,080
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

507
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,610
Look,I understand that you're really upset,but I don't think you want to take this to court.

508
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,850
The publicity alone...
Don't look at me.

509
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,460
Just...

510
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,730
Oh,my God.

511
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,790
That was brilliant.

512
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,370
You had to do one thing.

513
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,590
I choked,I'm sorry.

514
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,220
I promise,next person I really will tell.

515
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,490
Or we could get our nails done.

516
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,970
Oh,okay.

517
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:23,070
So what do Brutus,Judas,Benedict Arnold,Julius Rosenberg,Ethel Rosenberg,

518
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,650
although that's debatable,and you have in common?

519
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,510
Uh,we all did what we thought was right.

520
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,780
Eyes rolling.

521
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,350
I'm sorry about yesterday,okay?

522
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,290
But Ryan looked like a poor,sad koala bear,and I'm trying to help animals.

523
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,380
Yeah,why does your room look like a bird cage?

524
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,440
Because I decided its time to get off my butt and do something with my life.

525
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,920
I'm going to start a nonprofit.

526
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,160
You know,I read that if you can just focus on saving one animal,you can really make an impact.

527
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,720
Did you read this article?

528
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,560
It's how we're giving elephants post-traumatic stress disorder.

529
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,630
Those poor elephants.

530
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,610
All they want is to be cared for and nurtured and

531
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,590
not left on the set of a European talk show after party by their stupid,stupid...

532
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,330
Ryan?
Yeah.

533
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,720
And speaking of stupid,did you see the total Quickie Mart teddy bear that he brought me?

534
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,230
Ryan bought you a stuffed animal?

535
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,430
Oh,my God.

536
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,730
Look,in all the time I've known him,I've never seen him do anything so sweet.

537
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,130
Never?
Never.

538
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,070
That's probably the nicest gift he's ever given.

539
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,070
I,uh,I should go.

540
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,740
You going for a run?

541
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,490
Yeah,I'm just trying to clear my head.

542
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,470
Yeah,I saw that your light was on pretty late last night.

543
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,610
Yeah.

544
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,920
Yeah,I was trying to think of a good gift for Taylor.

545
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,110
Oh,so what did you come up with?

546
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,430
You know the Quickie Mart down by the pier?

547
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:46,830
Yeah?

548
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,480
They had a special on a bear with a mug of candy.

549
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,270
So you didn't quite hit it out of the park,did you?

550
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,550
I may have done more harm than good.

551
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,610
You know,it is obvious to almost everyone that Taylor feels very strongly about you.

552
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,340
Well,Henri-Michel said he loved her.

553
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,340
He wrote her a book and he's performing some poem about it.

554
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,240
And then she asked me if I felt the same...

555
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,310
You couldn't say anything.

556
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,740
Between us,how do you feel about her?

557
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,570
Well,being with Taylor's like being on a roller coaster.

558
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,910
And that's what,unsettling?

559
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,710
For a guy who's afraid of heights,it's not exactly the best fit,but,uh...

560
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,250
I don't know,it's exciting I guess.

561
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,360
Tell her that,before it's too late.

562
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,520
Tell her that.

563
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,930
This is all I know.
Hmm?

564
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,850
A situation like this,you could do something,you could do nothing.

565
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,690
It's as simple as that.

566
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,130
All right.

567
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,450
Do something.
Yeah,see you around.

568
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,740
A mug!

569
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,930
Hi,you're home.

570
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,550
What are you doing with the refuse?

571
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,700
I was making sure that the maid service here is efficient.

572
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:09,200
Or looking for Ryan's mug of stale candy and bear that holds a balloon?

573
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,210
Well,the guy did get me a gift,and the balloon was really shiny.

574
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:19,260
Peaches,there is no shame in wanting to keep a gift that was bought for you by a lover.

575
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,870
Really?

576
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,060
It makes one feel special to know thathew y were adored.

577
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,410
Well,I don't know if I would use the word adored exactly.

578
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,950
prthoblem lies in whether ryou are wanting a memento,or wanting Ryan.

579
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:40,420
I want to be with somebody who really wants to be with me,and who's not afraid to say it.

580
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,180
Well,in that case,you better tape your socks down,because pcaoem is going to knock them right off.

581
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,220
I must dress.

582
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,560
Okay.

583
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,790
Yeah,the rocks are hot.

584
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,030
So now we got to get them all moist and sweaty.

585
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,420
Then we can sleep?

586
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,360
As soon as you shovel these rocks into the tent.

587
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,010
Unless you're too weak from hunger.

588
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:12,030
No,I um,actually,I found some berries down below.They were pretty tasty,so...

589
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,210
You ate the berriebe 
Yeah,why?

590
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,000
whls that a prlet m?

591
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,730
No,dude,it's no pbls em.

592
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,680
Not yet.

593
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,560
This is all I could use at the time.

594
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,620
I didn't have anything else.

595
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,020
He guys.

596
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,790
,Kaitlin,gla n,yomade it.

597
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,490
Will was just telling me a story abt how he lost his drumsticks.

598
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,450
But luckily he hy Chinese that night so he used his chopsticks.

599
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,890
Okay,well,that's definitely a knee-slapper.

600
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,100
Will,do you mind getting me a soda?

601
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,560
sure.You ntYo to come?

602
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,900
ally,I'm going to stay here and talk to Lucy.

603
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,320
All right.

604
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,680
Just so you have it eaver- the only reason eaI'm here is becaes I know youonow't want me to be.

605
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,830
So get ready to have some fun.
Oh,I'm having fun.

606
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,060
Lots of n.

607
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,630
ts You're in our world now.

608
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,310
And girls like you aren't enwelcome here.

609
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,580
Girls like me.

610
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:20,250
What,girls who don't like wearing polyester pantsuits or baking pies earing lame feathered hats?

611
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,390
Everything okay?

612
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,810
Not really.

613
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,340
Kaitlin just insulted our uniforms and called our hs olame.

614
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,510
Actually,they kind of are.

615
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,020
I have to go to the bathroom.

616
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,680
How are you feeling,friend?

617
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,120
Like I'm sharing a sauna sawith Blue Man Group.

618
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,730
Go with it.

619
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,860
You're it'e spirit world,man.

620
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,100
This is the very It vepart ofpaour journey.

621
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,570
Ryan likes Journeyou

635
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:31,070
Anyou can do otter-related activities.

636
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,760
Don't worry.

637
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,680

638
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,400

Ch Che,wake up.

640
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,310
I had the greatest dream.

641
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,320
Me,too,man.

642
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,380
Anju hjuealed animal spirit.

643
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,570
I've got to get back home to Summer.

644
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,920
Mazel tov,brother,what an azing accomplishment.

645
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,420
Well,tell me about your spirit animal.

646
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,360
Oh,it waso itcute,man.

647
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,150
It was this otter,and it was lost.

648
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,330
An otter o
Yeah,why is that okay?

649
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,270
Yes.

650
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,210
Is that bad?

651
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,700
No,I mean,it's amazing.

652
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,930
Good.

653
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,000
Great,because I thought,like,it would sucifld it wasn'wat.

654
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,640
But we should get out of here.

655
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,760
"The tree from whence she fell is blessed.

656
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:33,220
"He held her erfor the world to see,"but now to my deep distress,le peach...

657

" I would ginyuld thing,ything for a man to write a poem like that for me.

659
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,280
That was simply...

660
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,150
Um,you'd care to stay,,and who wouldn't,

661
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,640
the author will be signing copies of his book,bo A Season Foreaonches.

Wait.

Young man,this is not karaoke.You don't get a turn.

Get down from there before cbeall serialty.

667
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,740
Let's hear what the boy has to say,hmm?

668
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,880
We should not deny him the opportunity to bear his soul in front of all these people.

669
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,390
Thank you.

670
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,150
"A sonnet...

Monsieur?

683
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,330
Look,uh,Taylor,I know that my poem might not be quite as good as Henri-Michel's,

684
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,760
but I wanted you to know how I feel.

685
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,120
No,Ryan,I loved it.I really...

686
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,920
Where is he?He was just here.

687
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,630
I'm sorry.

688
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,620
We had a good day.

689
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,650
Three out of five women now know they've been exposed to a sexually-transmitted disease,we should be proud.

690
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,080
You're on your own for the next two.

691
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,240
Okay,I understand.

692
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,530
Aren't you supposed to be in Mexico?

693
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,340
Julie made me do it.

694
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,350
So you mean...

695
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,390
Yeah,so no one has...

696
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:13,650
You know.

697
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,310
What?!

698
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,520
Yeah.

699
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,230
I'm going to go.

700
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,430
Kirsten,I'm sorry.

701
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,380
It was the only way I could think to get you to spend the day with me.

702
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,620
So you told all those women they have chlamydia when they don't?

703
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,510
They might.

704
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,150
They did have sex with male hookers.

705
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,450
Plus,I picked the five meanest women in Newport.

706
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,800
What is wrong with you?

707
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,310
I was desperate.I missed you.

708
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,310
I hate not having you in my life,Kirsten.

709
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,480
I can live without you as my business partner,but not without you as my friend.

710
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,400
You are going to call all those women tomorrow,and you are going to tell them the truth.

711
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,390
Okay,but not Linda.

712
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,910
Please let Linda think she has an STD.

713
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,520
That is not only unethical,it is just plain mean.

714
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,800
I disagree.

715
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,660
Do you want to debate about it over dinner?

716
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,670
You know you miss me.Come on,say yes.

717
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,570
Kirsten?

718
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,270
You know,you been in here for so long I was afraid you got flushed down.

719
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,380
Go away.

720
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,440
Hi.

721
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,130
Go away.I hate you.

722
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:39,340
Look,I'm sorry that Will doesn't like you back,but I didn't do anything.

723
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,360
I have loved Will since the day he transferred here.

724
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,870
I lent him a pen.

725
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,410
And he is the most wonderful,sensitive,sweet...

726
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,270
And you don't even appreciate him.

727
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,670
Yes,I do.

728
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,690
I mean,he's smart and he's hot and he's an excellent kisser.

729
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,180
Then why do you make fun of the things that make Will Will?

730
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,040
His band uniform and his love of marching and baking and his friends?

731
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,890
Because that's just what I do.

732
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,940
I mean,I make fun of everyone,usually 'cause I'm high.

733
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,420
You make him not want to be himself.

734
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,460
You don't know what you're talking about.

735
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,700
Oh,that's the best you can do?

736
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,140
You know I'm right.

737
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,350
Shut up,okay?

738
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,870
Just shut up.

739
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,960
Henri?

740
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,790
Henri?

741
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,630
"I love you,but I love love more.

742
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,220
"And I don't want to be alone in it.

743
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,420
Au revoir,Peaches.

744
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,320
Hey,I've been worried about you.

745
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,250
You okay?

746
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,830
Oh,I'm okay.

747
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,190
It's a long story.

748
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,210
Well,I can't wait to hear it.When are you coming home?

749
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,790
Soon.

750
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,570
I'm having dinner with Julie.

751
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,240
Julie?

752
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,340
Yeah.

753
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,940
She is the most manipulative,scheming partner in the world,

754
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,120
and it was stupid ever to get into business with her,and I'll never make that mistake again.

755
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,810
But she's the best friend you got.

756
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,570
Something like that.

757
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,180
I was thinking maybe tomorrow we could do something you might want to do.

758
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,360
Well,I thought tomorrow was night two of your dorked-out bake sale.

759
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,720
I mean,it is,but they can hold it down.

760
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,290
I mean,I'd rather spend time with you.

761
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,300
I thought it was important to you.

762
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,840
If you want me to do it,I'll do it.

763
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,990
I'll go.I can go.

764
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,160
I just thought,you know,that they wouldn't know what to do without you.

765
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,570
Since you're the king of dorks and all.

766
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,330
Excuse me?

767
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,660
Well,after observing you in your natural environment,

768
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,080
it was just clear,we're not a good fit.

769
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,100
We're like oil and that other thing.

770
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,080
But I thought you liked that.

771
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,730
You know who else is a dork is that Lucy chick.

772
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,930
I mean,she's got a pretty hot bod for a dork.

773
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,920
I mean,if I was a dork like you,I'd totally go for her.

774
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,450
Real nice.

775
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,590
You know what,I think you're right.

776
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,080
Good,'cause I think Brad and Eric are down there,probably night surfing or something.

777
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,310
So I'll see you around.

778
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,130
Nah.

779
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,510
Che,what are you still doing here?

780
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,040
I had a dream.

781
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,620
In my dream,my spirit animal was a frog and I was in a stream.

782
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,410
I had the most magical day.

783
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,700
Oh,God,we've got to change the locks.

784
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,510
Whoa,hi.

785
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,360
I healed my spirit animal and I'm ready to love again.

786
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,290
Did you say spirit animal?

787
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,320
Yeah,and it was lost,but through my connection to the ancient rituals of the Earth,

788
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,070
I was able to save my inner otter.

789
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:44,770
I swam and I splashed.

790
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,830
And for the first time,I felt whole.

791
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,010
I had found my other half.

792
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,620
And it was an otter.
Otters are so cute.

793
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,540
Oh,my gosh,their whiskers and how they use their belly to crack open their abalone dinner.

794
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,870
I am going to start a foundation to save the sea otters.

795
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,930
Do you know there are less than 3,000 left in California?

796
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,990
No,that's really sad.

797
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,530
You found love with an otter?

798
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm happy for you.

799
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,000
I know it sounds crazy,but dreams don't lie.

800
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,820
Now I just have to explain it to the otter.

801
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,080
Summer.
What?

802
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,370
Do you think the otters could wait till tomorrow?

803
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,570
No.

804
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,760
Hey.

805
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,870
Hi.

806
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,390
Henri-Michel's gone.

807
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,460
He's gone?Gone where?

808
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,440
Back to France,I guess.

809
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,000
Why?

810
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,240
Uh,I think he understood even better than I did that as much as he loved me,I didn't love him,

811
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,920
and I probably never will.

812
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,110
Does that mean...?

813
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:13,260
When Henri-Michel would tell me he loved me,it was like the whole world melted away.

814
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,350
Those words just have more power over me than anything.

815
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:24,550
It's scary how much I want,how much I need to hear them.

816
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,300
Well,if that's important to you...

817
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,180
I would never ask you to be able to say that yet.

818
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,800
And even if you could,I don't think I'm ready to hear it.

819
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,990
So what are you saying?

820
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,360
Until I can be stronger on my own,I don't think that I should be with anyone,

821
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,030
including you.

822
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm sorry.

823
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,010
Okay.

824
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,080
Actually,that makes sense.

825
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,590
But I'm going to treasure this poem forever.

826
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,820
I meant it.

827
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,780
Just so you know.

828
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,770
I do.

829
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,040
Bye,Ryan.
