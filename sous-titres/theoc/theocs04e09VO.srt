1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:00,167
O.C

2
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:02,700
Can you keep a secret?

3
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:04,767
Yeah.
I think you might be pregnant.

4
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:05,901
MAN:
Meet my buddy, Frank.

5
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:06,967
He's going to put
your books in order.

6
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:08,367
Your so-called
dating service--

7
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,700
not exactly what Bullet
thought he was investing in.

8
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:11,934
It's going to be different now.

9
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,433
That's what you said
when Dad got arrested.

10
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,467
I didn't know what I was doing
when I married your dad.

11
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:17,168
So why did you bring me here?
For information.

12
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,801
I'm not who I say I am.

13
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,034
And who are you?

14
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,268
I'm Ryan's father.

15
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,934
Summer Roberts,
will you marry me?

16
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,001
Yes.

17
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,834
I'm not pregnant.

18
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,300
Saves us from having to have
a shotgun wedding.

19
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:29,801
You and me
and our normal
wedding.

20
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,367
Okay.

21
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:41,567
So I woke up early this morning
to make my New Year's
resolutions,

22
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:43,034
but I think
I need your help.

23
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:45,067
Okay.
So number one,

24
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:47,734
stop mooching off
other people's families,
and get a job.

25
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:51,134
Number two, start taking
calcium supplements.

26
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,567
Do you think
that's enough?

27
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:55,134
Uh, how about number three?

28
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:57,901
Plan Summer's wedding.

29
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,901
But engaged?
Oh, my God.

30
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,834
Why didn't you
say something sooner?

31
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,801
Denial.
Hmm. How romantic.

32
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,367
Look, someday I
want to get married,

33
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,534
and I'm guessing that
it will be to Seth.

34
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:11,901
But now that I'm
without child...

35
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,400
Well, have you told Seth that?

36
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,634
'Cause getting married
is kind of a big deal.

37
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,901
I should know.

38
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,667
Well, Taylor,
I cannot break it off.

39
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,867
You should have seen his face
when he asked me.

40
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:23,034
He's never been that sincere
in his entire life.

41
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:26,168
Usually everything
he says is laced
with irony
and contempt.

42
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:27,767
But he meant it.

43
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,034
So did I.

44
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:31,001
Except you didn't, not really.

45
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,367
Summer, you have to tell him
how you really feel.

46
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,067
Okay, great.

47
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,634
I've always wanted
to plan a wedding.

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,967
I'm thinking bagpipes.

49
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,367
Maybe a replica
of the Starship <i>Enterprise.</i>

50
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:53,534
Hey. Why are you
still in bed?

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,801
Are you sick or something?

52
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:56,734
I am sick, Ryan.

53
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,034
(sighs)

54
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,801
I'm sick of being engaged.

55
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:02,767
So you asked her before
you looked at the test?

56
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,834
I was trying
to be a man,
a plan with a fundamental
conceptual flaw.

57
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,367
And now?

58
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,700
Well, it'not that
I regret it, exactly.

59
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:11,801
Okay, that's exactly
it: I regret it.

60
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,268
Acting impulsively when your
girlfriend is pregnant,

61
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,901
believe me, I
know about that.

62
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:19,967
But you can't ask
Summer to marry you
if you don't want
to get married.

63
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:22,034
Well, I can't ask her
and then take it back.

64
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,934
You should have seen the look
on her face; it'd crush her.

65
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,034
All right, that's
cool, that's cool.

66
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,134
Let's go call
Sandy d Kirsten.

67
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,234
No.
No, no.

68
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,268
They might think
you're too young,

69
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,433
but I'm sure
after we tell them

70
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,600
about the whole
pregnancy scare,

71
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,234
they'll totally
get behind it.

72
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,500
(whispering):
Ow.

73
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,500
So just you know, Seth
doesn't want to get married.

74
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,867
Well, it's not like
Summer wants to be
a desperate housewife.

75
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:50,134
Right.

76
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,767
Yeah, it's going
to be easy then.

77
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,467
All it will take
is one of them

78
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:55,467
to say they think they
should wait a while,

79
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,500
and the other will happily
agree, and that'll be that.

80
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,300
Yeah.

81
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,767
Except that it is
Seth and Summer.

82
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:01,867
Right.

83
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,101
Oh, here they come.
Okay.

84
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:06,634
Hey.

85
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,333
Hi.

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,500
So Seth and I
had a long talk.

87
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,201
Ryan, I'd like you
to be my best man.

88
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,901
And I'd like you to
be my maid of honor.

89
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,467
Well, I'd be honored.

90
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:25,834
Yes, me, too.

91
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,500
Super. Let's go talk
wedding stuff.

92
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,600
Okay.

93
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,134
Uh...

94
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,901
I feel good about this.

95
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:36,467
I think a little long-term
lifelong commitment

96
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,500
is exactly what I needed.

97
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,333
This is bad.

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,867
This is so bad.

99
00:03:56,667 --> 00:04:00,700

102
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,268
Thanks for meeting me.

103
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,433
Thanks for calling.

104
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,734
So you're Ryan's father.

105
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,967
That's funny, 'cause I was
just going to say
the same thing to you.

106
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:41,168
House drip? I ordered
a bone-dry cappuccino.

107
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,067
This one's for u.

108
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:44,433
I didn't know
what to get Frank

109
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,067
and everyone likes
the house drip.
Frank?

110
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:47,134
Our new accountant.

111
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,333
Did he go to Dubai
with Bullet?

112
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,834
Um, actually, Keeks, I was going
to talk to you about that.

113
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,134
FRANK:
 <i>I know I've got</i>

114
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:55,801
a lot of explaining
to do, Sandy.

115
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,667
Well, yeah, you can start with
what you're doing in Newport,

116
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,433
using a fake name,
working for my wife.

117
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,433
I want to see Ryan.

118
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
So ring our doorbell,
introduce yourself.

119
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,967
And have Ryan answer it?

120
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:10,001
I don't think he'd be
thrilled to see me.

121
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:13,001
KIRSTEN:
 <i>So how did Frank Atwood</i>
become our new accountant?

122
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:15,567
He became friends with Bullet
while they were both locked up,

123
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:16,867
and Bullet offered him a job.

124
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,667
Frank saw that he
had holdings in Newport,

125
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,634
saw your name
on the New Match portfolio.

126
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,867
He found out
from Social Services that Ryan

127
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,001
was living with you.

128
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,500
I got to be honest, Frank,
knowing what I do

129
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,234
about you,
and your past,

130
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,067
it's tough to root
for that family reunion.

131
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:34,201
I only ask that you hear me out.

132
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,534
KIRSTEN:
 <i>Rehabilitated?</i>

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,433
He used to hit Dawn
and the boys.

134
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,967
How rehabilitated could he be?

135
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,700
Well, he owned up to all
that, made no excuses.

136
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,934
Apparently, the
violence always started

137
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,134
after he'd been drinking,

138
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,500
and he hasn't had a drop
in eight years.

139
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,001
He went to anger
management,

140
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,667
got his GED, took
some business classes
by correspondence.

141
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:54,600
I know about that;
I checked your record.

142
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,700
You ever think maybe
the system works sometimes?

143
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,834
Yeah.

144
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:04,201
But how come you're reaching
out to Ryan only now?

145
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:07,201
JULIE:
 <i>He only got out six weeks ago.</i>

146
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,034
What was he supposed
to do before that?

147
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,567
Send a postcard from prison?

148
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:13,201
"Great food. Love the view.
Wish you were here."

149
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,367
Look, his entire family
hated him.

150
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,667
He's the first to admit
he deserved it.

151
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,400
So you think
he's really changed?

152
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,333
Yeah, I guess I do.

153
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,433
I know it's on me to prove it
to Ryan and to you,

154
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,467
that I'm a different guy.

155
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:31,767
BuI'd like the shot.

156
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:38,333
With your blessing, of course,
and hopefully with your help.

157
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,901
Of course you had a
chance to break it off,
you just chickened out.

158
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,034
Summer had
the same chance.

159
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:53,433
Yeah, maybe she's
a chicken, too.

160
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,600
Summer Roberts
is not a chicken.

161
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:55,834
She wants
to get married.

162
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,067
Yeah, you sure
about that?

163
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,834
Why, did Taylor say
that she doesn't?

164
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,500
Will it hurt your
feelings if I say yes?

165
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:01,600
No.
Then yes.

166
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,600
She says someday.
But not now.

167
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,333
I said the exact
same thing.

168
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,634
All right, well, then
tell her you don't
want to be engaged.

169
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,901
She'll be fine with it.

170
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,667
And spend the rest of my life
living down the fact

171
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,001
that I left her at the altar?

172
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:13,433
The ring you gave her
glows in the dark.

173
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,700
I know; it's so cool.

174
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,600
Yes, and I think
she'll get over it.

175
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,268
Yeah, she says
she'll get over it,

176
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,934
but what she means
is she'll get even, okay?

177
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:25,168
Now, if she doesn't
want to marry me,
she can tell me
that herself.

178
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:26,700
Hmm, good point.
Really?

179
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,367
No, but if you're too chicken
to tell Summer how you feel,

180
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,767
give her no choice but
to tell you how she feels.

181
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,367
Smoke her out.

182
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:39,201
(muttering softly):
...chicken.

183
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:44,534
As a dog, Buck has
the opportunity to view man

184
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,134
when he doesn't even know
he's being watched.

185
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:47,767
Personally, I think all
books should be written

186
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,500
from the point
of view of a dog.

187
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,534
But seriously,
seeing the world

188
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,967
through the eyes of an animal,
forces us to see the world

189
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:55,734
and ourselves
in a new light.

190
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:56,500
Thank you.

191
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,333
That was excellent, Will.

192
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,801
For a new student,
you're really
catching up nicely.

193
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,700
Kaitlin, you're up.

194
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,333
Thanks for the nap.

195
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,234
I really needed
to be put to sleep.

196
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,234
She's not really
going to do it.

197
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,834
Yeah, she is.

198
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:12,767
We're supposed to talk
about the book like Buck would.

199
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,268
And, well, Buck is a dog.

200
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,734
So, I think that Buck

201
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:17,168
would say...

202
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:20,500
Ruff, ruff, ruff.

203
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,467
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff,
ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.

204
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,067
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff...

205
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:27,500
Okay, Kaitlin, that's enough.

206
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,734
You can sit.

207
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:29,834
But the assignment
was 500 words.

208
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:30,967
I'm not done yet.

209
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,834
"Ruff, ruff, ruff."
Think we got it.

210
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,067
Okay.

211
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:36,734
See you all
tomorrow.

212
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:37,567
Kaitlin...

213
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,734
you I'll see right now.

214
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:48,067
You think this is funny?
Kind of.

215
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:49,567
I mean, it was
original at least.

216
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,534
Well, I'll give you
an A for originality.

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,500
Cool.
But your presentation gets an F.

218
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,934
You're failing English.

219
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,067
You think beininheld back
is funny, too?

220
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:00,400
An extra year in high school
is definitely not funny.

221
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:03,168
Sorry, I forgot my books.

222
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:06,001
Will, you seem to have a real
handle on public speaking.

223
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,500
Would you mind helping Kaitlin
with a revised
presentation?

224
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,867
Well, you know, I...

225
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,700
Great.

226
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:12,834
One more shot, Kaitlin.

227
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,567
And every word better
be different.

228
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:24,467
Hey.
Hey.

229
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:26,534
No shrimp tacos today;
we got fish.

230
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,901
You like tilapia?

231
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,467
Oh, I love the tilapia,
but I'm actually not hungry.

232
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:31,767
Thanks, though.

233
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,201
What's up?

234
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:36,201
Are you on a break anytime soon?

235
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,400
You talked to him today?

236
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,834
We met, yeah.

237
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,067
Always knew one day he'd be out.

238
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:53,034
Well, he's out.

239
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:55,801
Yeah, yeah.

240
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,801
It's... weird.

241
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,467
And I know I'm supposed to have
a lot of questions, but...

242
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:06,101
it's like my dad's from another
life it's so far in the past.

243
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:09,467
Well, if that's how you want
to keep it, that's fine with me.

244
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:12,400
No speech about
the importance of family?

245
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:14,901
You're my family.

246
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,134
What's important to me is you.

247
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:29,433
I don't want to see him.

248
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,268
Maybe later, not now.

249
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,067
Then that's what I'll tell him.

250
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:40,700
Yeah.

251
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,767
And no need to explain.

252
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,034
Thanks.

253
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:47,201
So I'll see you at home.

254
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:48,967
Uh-huh.

255
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,767
Sandy, how'd he seem?

256
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,268
He seemed good.

257
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,067
Good.

258
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,567
Hello.

259
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:24,034
Frank, Sandy Cohen here.

260
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,367
Hey, Sandy.

261
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,867
y, listen, I spoke
to Ryan, and, uh,

262
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm sorry, but he does not
want to see you.

263
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,700
Not even a half hour
for a cup of coffee?

264
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,234
No. Not now.

265
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,333
I'm sorry, Frank.

266
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,034
Best of luck to you.

267
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:46,067
Yeah, um, thanks for trying.

268
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,534
Ryan said no?

269
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,667
What are you gonna do?

270
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:02,634
A cookbook? I thought
you got me a present.

271
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,101
That's just
the first part of it.

272
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:06,234
I also signed you up
for some cooking classes.

273
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,400
Here you go.

274
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,734
But... I don't even
like cking.

275
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:11,867
Well, that's just something,
I guess, you better work on,

276
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:13,101
if we're gonna get married,

277
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:15,234
since I expect a nice,
home-cooked meal

278
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,967
on the table every day by 5:00.

279
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,101
Since when?
Your mother never cooked.

280
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:21,168
Since I decided to get
a wife of my own.

281
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:22,400
I also brought over the Torah.

282
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:23,534
You're converting
to Judaism. Yes?

283
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,134
He's totally trying
to smoke me out.

284
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,467
He wants me

285
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:29,534
to break off thengagement
so he can live a long,

286
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,967
guilt-free life being
a big, fat victim.

287
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,734
It is sneaky, cowardly
and passive-aggressive.

288
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:36,201
And you wish you'd
thought of it first?
Totally.

289
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:37,500
So what are you gonna do,

290
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,134
level with him
and tell him the truth?

291
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:41,168
Crack that. He wants
a game of chicken?
He's gonna get it.

292
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:42,634
I'm going bridezilla
on his ass.

293
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,168
Hey, honey.

294
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,634
Hey, Sandy.

295
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,500
I didn't know
you were in a meeting.

296
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,268
Are you okay?
What happened?

297
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,268
We need to talk.

298
00:12:58,201 --> 00:12:59,767
What are you doing here?

299
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,600
Frank's not leaving.

300
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,168
Well, I'm sorry, but I spoke to
Ryan, and that's what he wants.

301
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,500
There's something I didn't
tell you when we spoke.

302
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,400
I was hoping I wouldn't
need to mention it.

303
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:13,934
But then I was saying
good-bye to the ladies,

304
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,834
and it just came out.

305
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:36,901
--I felt terrible at
dinner last night,

306
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,600
not saying
anything to Ryan.

307
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,700
Well, you shouldn't.

308
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:40,700
Did he mention Frank?

309
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,400
Did he seem remotely
curious at all?

310
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,500
Well, he's Ryan. I'm sure
he's full of questions.

311
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:45,600
He's just
sitting on them.

312
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,300
You know, I asked him
point-blank,

313
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,901
and he said he did not
want to see him.

314
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,101
He doesn't know
he's sick.

315
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,101
If he's ck.

316
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:54,734
You think Frank's lying
about having cancer?

317
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,034
Well, yeah, he's not the most
trustworthy guy I've ever met.

318
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,234
Yeah, he'd lie about that.

319
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,834
He smoked two packs
of cigarettes a day

320
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,168
since he was
14 years old.

321
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:03,201
It would be weird if he
didn't have lung cancer.

322
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:07,500
I appreciate you being cautious,
but this seems personal.

323
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,101
It is personal.

324
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:10,667
Ryan is our son.

325
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,134
Because Frank turned
his back on his family.

326
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:14,734
He has hurt Ryan before.

327
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:18,034
I'm not gonna let him
do it again.

328
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:20,201
But what if
he's not lying?
Please.

329
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:22,534
What if Ryan finds out
that we knew the truth

330
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,901
and didn't
tell him?

331
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,567
Just let me talk to him, please.

332
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:33,834
Shalom, Cohen.

333
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:37,300
Well, since you brought me
presents yesterday,

334
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:38,567
I thought I'd return the favor.

335
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,433
Oh, that is sweet.
Yeah.

336
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,433
So here's information
on the four "C"s:

337
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,034
carat, clarity, color and cut.

338
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:47,500
Ah, diamonds.

339
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,201
Sure, sure.

340
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,101
Well, if we're really doing
this, we better do it right.

341
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:54,101
Exactly.

342
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:56,001
Which means nothing less
than two carats.

343
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:58,333
Why not three?
You're worth it.

344
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Oh, there's just one more thing.

345
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,168
Pancakes?

346
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,433
Pancakes.

347
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,400
I thought he should live
with you for a little while.

348
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:07,801
You know, I just need to make
sure my husband can take care

349
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:08,967
of something small
and vulnerable.

350
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,534
Sure, sure, I've been
meaning to spend

351
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,201
a little one-on-one time
with the little guy.

352
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:15,134
Oh, and I've been thinking,
uh, Yates or maybe Shelley.

353
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,934
You're working
on the guest list?

354
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,500
Those are
poets, Summer,

355
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,268
and their words will
inspire my vows.

356
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,268
Have you been
working on yours?
Uh-huh.

357
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,268
Mm.
Why, yes.

358
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,034
I was thinking of
Shel Silverstein

359
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:28,300
with a dash of Dr. Seuss.

360
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,433
"I meant what I said,
I said what I meant,

361
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,634
an elephant's faithful
a hundred percent."

362
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,600
Very moving, Summer.

363
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,201
(chuckling):
I know.

364
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,734
Okay.

365
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,600
We sort of had a dog once.

366
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,767
Hey, band geek.

367
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,967
Sorry, I meant that band geek.

368
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:58,700
So Miss Tidy says
that you're my tutor.

369
00:15:58,767 --> 00:15:59,834
That's what she says.

370
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,333
And you never
disobey Miss Tidy?

371
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,300
Let's just get this over with.

372
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:06,134
Actually, I was wondering
if you could just

373
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,333
write something down and
give it to me tomorrow.

374
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,234
Well, I'm not like
the other guys at this school.

375
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,767
I don't play water polo, and
I really do't listen to you.

376
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,333
Look, little drummer boy,

377
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,333
Miss Tidy said that you had
to help me with my assignment.

378
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,300
If I fail, you fail.

379
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:23,268
You can do this yourself,
you know.

380
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,967
You're not as stupid
as you want to be.

381
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:26,333
Stupid has nothing
to do with it.

382
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:30,001
See you before class.

383
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:39,101
I didn't know
u were coming by.

384
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:41,201
Oh, well, I knew you'd be
at court all morning,

385
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,600
and doing all that good
can work up quite an appetite.

386
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:44,901
You're telling me.

387
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,567
Roast beef is rare,
and the mustard is spicy.

388
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,634
Then I'm a happy man,
but I'm guessing a picnic

389
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,567
isn't the only reason
you stopped by.

390
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:55,300
Aw, Sandy, I don't want
to fight with you.

391
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:56,834
We both love Ryan and we both

392
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,333
want what's best
for him.

393
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,867
Sometimes we're just not
gonna see eye to eye.

394
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:03,500
No, and our yin-yang style
of parenting has produced

395
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,201
two pretty good kids,
so why stop now?

396
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:07,367
Does that mean
everything is okay?

397
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,667
I know you want to talk to Ryan.

398
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,767
I respect that.

399
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:14,034
But you should know I called
Dr. Alessi at the prison.

400
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,034
I asked him to look into Frank
Atwood's medical records.

401
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:18,834
Sandy, that's an invasion
of privacy.

402
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:19,700
Yin and yang, baby.

403
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,034
If I'm wrong,

404
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:23,168
I'll eat my words,
but if I'm right,

405
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:24,433
the sooner we know, the better.

406
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,934
Does that mean I'm the yang?

407
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,168
Maybe.

408
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,433
See you tomorrow.

409
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,634
Hi.
Hey.

410
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,433
What do you
want to do?

411
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,867
Maybe get some
Mexican food?

412
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,001
(chuckles)

413
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,234
That is the last thing
I want to do ever again.

414
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,801
Occupational hazard.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

415
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:45,433
Actually, I have to stop
by Kirsten's office.

416
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
She said she wanted
to talk to me.

417
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,967
Do you think it's
about your father?

418
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,634
Uh, well, I hope not.

419
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,867
I made it very clear
I don't want to see him.

420
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:53,934
Right.

421
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,367
Which I totally
support.

422
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:56,534
Mmm, you just don't agree.

423
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,801
Well, it's none
of my business.

424
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,067
Ah, that's never
stopped you before.

425
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:00,834
(chuckles)

426
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,500
Look, all I know is that
if my father wanted to see me,

427
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,700
even if he was a lying,
violent, drunken card shark

428
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:09,001
who holds up liquor stores
with a sawed-off shotgun...

429
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,634
My mother's a card
shark, but whatever.

430
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,433
I would stl want to see him.

431
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,801
If only to get whatever
feelings I had off my chest--

432
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:17,801
to tell him that I think
he's a total ass

433
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:19,268
and I never want
to see him again.

434
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,567
That would feel good.

435
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,567
Ryan, my dad lives in San Diego

436
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,168
with his new family.

437
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:30,400
He comes to Newport
once a quarter to check on

438
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,734
his car dealership
and play around at Big Canyon.

439
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:37,433
I haven't even spent
more than 20 minutes with him

440
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,600
since I was in second grade.

441
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:43,700
It's just...

442
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:46,201
really easy to ignore your kids,

443
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,567
and the hard part is
trying to have a relationship.

444
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,901
Look, I'm sure everything
you're saying is right,

445
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,268
but you don't know my father.

446
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,734
You haven't seen him
since you were a little kid.

447
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,134
No offense, but you don't
really know him either.

448
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:01,333
Alef.

449
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,600
Bet.

450
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,934
Gimmel.

451
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:08,201
It says Dalet.

452
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,201
Damn it.

453
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:14,101
Oh, my brisket is burning. Ooh!

454
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:15,467
I like it chewy.

455
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,168
Julie, I really appreciate

456
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:20,400
you helping me and filling in
for Rabbi Gutterman,

457
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,367
but this just is not working.

458
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:25,534
Right, and whenever you want
to let me know what <i>this</i> is,

459
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,134
I'm all ears.

460
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:29,767
As much as I've enjoyed learning
the Hebrew alphabet with you.

461
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,867
Well, this is a ridiculous sham.

462
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,500
I mean, not that
I don't look forward

463
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:34,534
to one day becoming Jewish.

464
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,333
Did Seth dare you to do this?

465
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,168
Um, in a way, yes.

466
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:39,901
We're engaged.

467
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,400
Oh, that's great!

468
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,001
I think.

469
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,400
You're young,
but, hey, worked for me.

470
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,867
You can't tell anyone.
No, no, but Summer, did...

471
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:50,967
Are you...?

472
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:53,634
No, no... we thought
that I might be.

473
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,801
Then why are you
getting married?

474
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,734
Because he asked me,
and I said yes.

475
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,534
And now you don't
want to call it off

476
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,134
because you don't want
to hurt his feelings.

477
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,534
Mmm.

478
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,433
Or 'cause if you do,
he'll get the upper hand.

479
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,634
Exactly.

480
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,001
Now we're talking
my kind of dating game.

481
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,367
Manipulating the opposite sex.

482
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,234
God, Julie, why didn't I
come to you earlier?

483
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,333
Thank you, Summer.

484
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,734
Look, if you want
to take him down,

485
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,600
you have to kick it up a notch.
It's called chutzpah.

486
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,268
I think it's chutz... chutzpah.

487
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,667
Chutzpah.
(both making throat sounds)

488
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,600
Okay, never mind.
What are you thinking?

489
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:26,634
After I talked to Sandy,

490
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,600
I didn't think I'd hear
from you again.

491
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,134
I'm sorry he was
so abrupt with you.

492
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:32,268
Can't say I blame him.

493
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,634
He's really protective of Ryan.

494
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,734
But we talked.

495
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,734
d, well,

496
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,067
there's someone here
who wants to meet you.

497
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,934
Hi.

498
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,567
Hi.

499
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:07,367
Want to grab some coffee?

500
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,033
--It was fine.

501
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,067
You haven't seen your father
in eight years, and it was fine?

502
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:20,234
Yeah, well, fine is
not a total disaer.

503
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,601
I'll take fine.

504
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,801
What'd you guys
talk about?

505
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:24,267
Politics, movies?

506
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:26,467
His Netflix queue
must have been jam-packed.

507
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:28,768
Has he seen <i>Titanic?</i>

508
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,401
I don't kn.
We just kind of talked.

509
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:32,401
I mean, I don't know.

510
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:34,601
I must have thought hundreds
of times about what I would say

511
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,267
to my dad when I
saw him again, but...

512
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,467
sitting in the diner,

513
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:41,000
I just didn't want to say
any of those things.

514
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,467
Oh, because he's sick?

515
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:44,501
Because he's normal.

516
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:45,701
Look, you can
meet him tonight.

517
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:46,734
See for yourself.

518
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:47,868
He's coming over for dinner.

519
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,734
I would, but Summer and I
have a date

520
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:52,534
to build our chuppah together,
but maybe if we get done early.

521
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:54,534
You know, you can stop that
crazy train anytime you want.

522
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:56,967
Yeah, I love her enough
to ask her to marry me.

523
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,367
I am not gonna lose her.

524
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:00,701
Uh, you mean you don't
want to lose <i>to</i> her.

525
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:04,401
Exactly. Plus, the little guy is
kind of starting to grow on me.

526
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:05,868
Ain't that right, Pancakes?

527
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, hi! Hi!

528
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:10,801
Dude, you can't bring
an animal in here.

529
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:11,933
What are you doing?

530
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,367
How dare you talk
to your nephew that way.

531
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:14,701
Don't listen to mean
Uncle Ryan, Pancakes.

532
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,868
That's just the 'roids talking.

533
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,401
They do make him huge, I know.

534
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,501
Would you get him out of here,
please, before he ends up

535
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:21,501
in a quesadilla?

536
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,401
Ah.

537
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,601
We'll be on the patio.

538
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:27,601
Please bring us
another side of carrots.

539
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:38,401
You got my speech?

540
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:41,868
Here.

541
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,200
I knew you'd come through.

542
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:48,200
You asked him to
do your homework?

543
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,401
Yeah, what about us?

544
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,334
I'm sorry, guys.
You've been replaced.

545
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,267
Dude, I feel so betrayed.
Me, too.

546
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,567
Kaitlin,

547
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,100
you ready to start
us off today?

548
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,100
Yes, Ms. Tidy.

549
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,367
This better be good.

550
00:22:58,434 --> 00:22:59,734
Oh, I worked really hard.

551
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:11,401
We're ready
when you are, Kaitlin.

552
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:14,701
Ms. Tidy, there's been
some kind of a mix-up.

553
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:16,701
And Will here, he...

554
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:18,200
No excuses, Kaitlin, let's go.

555
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,634
Um...

556
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,033
Buck is, like,

557
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,567
this spoiled
and pampered dog

558
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:35,067
who lives a sweet life
in a big house in California.

559
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:37,000
And also, he's got
really pretty hair.

560
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,234
Then, one day,
like the book says,

561
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,567
the facts of life
take a fiercer aspect,

562
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,801
and then things just
kind of start to suck.

563
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:50,933
Buck goes through so much crap

564
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,467
that he goes to live
with some wolves,

565
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:56,000
and he'd rather kill for his own
food than talk to other people.

566
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,534
I mean, not talk
to other people,

567
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,634
because he's a dog,
and he doesn't...

568
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:00,834
You guys know that.

569
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,734
I think that...

570
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:09,134
that Buck's story
is kind of like a metaphor.

571
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
A taphor for being a teenager.

572
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:14,100
Just like...

573
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,434
the more crap you go through,

574
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:20,501
the more you
kind of want to be alone.

575
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,067
Dude, she's pretty deep.

576
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:23,167
Shut up, dude.

577
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:24,200
I'm trying to listen.

578
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,367
Fish?

579
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:28,734
Are you sure about that?

580
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,334
What's wrong with fish,
Taylor? Everyone likes fish.

581
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:34,933
Well, what if Ryan's dad was
a fisherman on choppy seas,

582
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,200
and the smell of fish
brings back bad memories?

583
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,134
Chino is inland, and Frank was
a mechanic-- cars, not boats.

584
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,300
Oh.

585
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:43,501
Okay, then.

586
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,534
Wait. What is the FDA's official
position on the spinach recall?

587
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:49,734
Spinach has
a clean bill of health.

588
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,734
I don't think we should
take any chances.

589
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:53,768
I'm gonna go to the store
and get some broccoli.

590
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,167
Taylor...

591
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:56,501
what's wrong?

592
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:57,801
Even for you, you're acting
a little strange.

593
00:24:57,868 --> 00:25:00,200
Yeah, I know.

594
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,601
I'm just really nervous.

595
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,834
I'm meeting Ryan's dad.

596
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,768
The guy hasn't seen
a woman in eight years.

597
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,367
I think he'll like you.

598
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:08,567
Well, it's not about that.

599
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,200
I mean, of course
he's gonna like me.

600
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:13,267
It's just, my first
real Ryan situation.

601
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:14,434
Everything else has been all

602
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:16,234
French husbands
and slutty aliens.

603
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,200
Excuse me?

604
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,467
It's like the first major test

605
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:20,267
of our relationship,
and I just...

606
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:22,834
I really want him to see

607
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,701
that I can be there
for the serious stuff, too.

608
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:28,033
The fact that you're there
for him means everything.

609
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,000
Ooh.

610
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,234
Thanks, Keeks.

611
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,634
You could make

612
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:33,900
such a great mother-in-law.

613
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,167
(chuckles)

614
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,200
SANDY:
What's going on here?

615
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,501
We having some kind of feast?

616
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,401
Frank's been eating
prison food for almost a decade.

617
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,267
The least we can do is
grill him some fish.

618
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:42,267
If he likes fish.

619
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,534
Do you think
he's gonna like fish?

620
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:46,267
You invited Frank to dinner?

621
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:48,634
No, Ryan did.

622
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:53,434
Hmm.

623
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,967
Sandy, I told you that
I was gonna talk to him.

624
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,534
He just wants
to see his father.

625
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,167
Well, now we all
get to see him

626
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,100
at the delightful
extended family dinner.

627
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:09,300
Have you heard back from
the doctor at the prison?

628
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,667
No. Not yet.

629
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:14,434
Well, I guess we just
make the best of it.
We always do.

630
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:15,933
With Dawn, with Trey--

631
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,768
I think we've been very open
with Ryan's family.

632
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:18,801
Until now?

633
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,734
Ryan's been
through hell this year.

634
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:28,667
And there is just something
about this guy...

635
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:29,933
That he's not a total screwup?

636
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:32,933
Look, I get it.

637
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,567
We all imagined
that Ryan's father

638
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,801
would be some kind of monster.

639
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,601
And then he shows up,
and he's smart,

640
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,300
and he's funny,
and he's nice.

641
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:42,033
Yeah, minus his record for
spousal abuse and armed robbery,

642
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,134
the guy's a real prize.

643
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,300
Move over, Bachelor Bob.

644
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:49,501
Sandy, your relationsh
with Ryan is your relationship.

645
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:53,900
Nothing's gonna change that.

646
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:57,534
Well, I know that.

647
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:59,300
And I know this is
important to Ryan.

648
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,300
So important.

649
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,300
All right.

650
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,300
Let me change.

651
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:03,467
I'll fire up the grill.

652
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,334
I'll put a smile on my face

653
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,534
and conjure up some embarrassing
stories about the family.

654
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:08,467
Thank you.

655
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,900
Hey.

656
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,900
Hi.

657
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,134
Is everything okay?

658
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,967
When you called, you made it
sound like an emergency.

659
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,267
It sort of is.

660
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,367
Jacket or no jacket?

661
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:26,900
(chuckles)

662
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:28,567
Whatever makes you
feel comfortable.

663
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:32,734
In case you can't tell,
I really want this to go well.

664
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:35,167
Just relax, be yourself,
everyone will love you.

665
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:37,401
Thanks. Sound pretty
sure about that.

666
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:40,834
Well, we've all done things
we're not proud of, Frank,

667
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,567
but people change.

668
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:44,200
Ryan knows that,
so do the Cohens.

669
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:46,534
No, I know, it's just...

670
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:47,667
Hey, you'll be fine, Frank.

671
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,534
It will all be fine.

672
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,434
Right.

673
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,701
But maybe I'll bring the jacket,
you know, just in case.

674
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,401
Good luck.

675
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:02,900
Call me.

676
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:04,067
Let me know how it goes.

677
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:07,801
Yeah.

678
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:08,834
Julie...

679
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,567
Hmm?

680
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,768
Thank you.

681
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,601
Cohen.

682
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,900
Pancakes.

683
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:36,033
Hey, you ready for some
chuppah construction,

684
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,667
or you just want to take it easy

685
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:40,234
and maybe brainstorm some ideas
for the centerpiece?

686
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,734
Actually, I've changed my mind.

687
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,100
You have?

688
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,768
Yes.

689
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:48,401
I don't want some big,
formal wedding extraganza.

690
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:50,801
I want something smaller.

691
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:53,667
Great, great.

692
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,567
It'll just be our families,
really intimate, be cozy.

693
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,701
Even smaller.

694
00:28:57,768 --> 00:28:58,900
Me, you and Elvis!

695
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,467
Let's elope,
Vegas-style.

696
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:02,868
Oh, wow, okay, well,
yeah, you know.

697
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:05,134
Planning a wedding can be
such a pain in the ass.

698
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,734
So we'll just have
to pick a time

699
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,501
that works for
you and I...
How about now?

700
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:09,834
Now works, too.

701
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,734
Let me just see if
I can get a flight.

702
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:13,234
You know, they may
be all booked up.

703
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,234
Well, hey, let's gas up

704
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,334
the car and drive there.

705
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:16,768
Awesome, a road trip,
I love them.

706
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,234
Well, hey, if you
don't want to...

707
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,701
No, of course I want to go.
I really want to go.

708
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,200
I just think I need to stop
at home first to, um,

709
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:24,467
change my underpants,

710
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,234
'cause you know how
I feel about underpants.

711
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,467
Well, come on.
It's our honeymoon.

712
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:28,467
Go commando!

713
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:29,467
Awesome.

714
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,801
Come on, no stops, no excuses.

715
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,067
I am marrying you tonight.

716
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:33,634
Not if I marry you first.

717
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,601
RYAN:
Yeah, so I guess the plan is

718
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,234
that I'd start there
in the fall.

719
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,534
Well, Berkeley's
a great school.

720
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:41,734
Or, you know,
so I hear.

721
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,367
How'd you pick it?

722
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:44,634
SANDY:
Kirsten and I went there.

723
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,933
We met there, so it's a very
special place for us.

724
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,868
Well, that's-that's great.

725
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,134
Family tradition.

726
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,967
(chuckles)

727
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,567
(chuckles)

728
00:29:57,634 --> 00:30:00,267
Ryan, do you remember the time
we went to San Francisco?

729
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,100
Uh, no.

730
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,534
That's 'cause we never
quite made it.

731
00:30:05,768 --> 00:30:08,000
Your mom and I had
this idea in our heads

732
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,501
that we should take
a family trip.

733
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:12,868
So we all piled into that
old pickup truck we had

734
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:14,300
and drove up north
for the weekend.

735
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:15,667
But it was just miserable.

736
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:18,734
Trey got carsick.
We got two flat tires.

737
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:19,967
Of course,
we only had one spare.

738
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:21,300
Day in the life of the Atwoods.

739
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,334
You know what?

740
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,667
I actually have
a photo from that trip.

741
00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:26,067
Oh, there's no reason...
(Taylor gasping)

742
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:28,000
Baby pictures, yay!

743
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:30,534
Oh, my G,
look at baby Ryan.

744
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:33,100
(squeals)

745
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,734
You could already see
that strong jawline,

746
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,167
those piercing
blue eyes

747
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,200
that just stare
right into your soul.

748
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:40,134
That's my cue to get dessert.

749
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,234
(laughter)

750
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,467
Kirsten makes a
great key lime pie.

751
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:44,000
Only if you like
key lime, though,

752
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:45,701
because I actually thought
lemon meringue.

753
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:47,834
And if you want I can just
go inside and whip it

754
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,933
right up or...
Peach tort, I make peach...

755
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,401
You know, key lime sounds great.

756
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:53,601
You were right.

757
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,067
I should clear
the table.

758
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:57,534
Well, let me give you a hand.
No, no, sit down, sit down.

759
00:30:57,601 --> 00:30:59,868
You slaved in the kitchen
all day, and you are our guest.

760
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:01,868
So please, just relax.

761
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,634
Thank you.

762
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,000
Thanks.

763
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,267
So we all survived dinner.

764
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:12,933
Yeah.

765
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,534
I got to say I didn't start off
a big fan of your father's.

766
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:16,634
Join the club.

767
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:18,501
But he's kind of
winning me over.

768
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:19,701
Yeah, huh?

769
00:31:19,768 --> 00:31:20,900
He's different than
I remember him.

770
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:24,067
Well... people can change.

771
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,467
Too bad all it took
was a terminal illness.

772
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:31,167
But better late
then never, I guess.

773
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:33,567
True.

774
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:34,601
(cell phone ringing)

775
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:36,067
Looks good.
Yeah.

776
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:38,534
Will you excuse me for a second,
I got to take this.

777
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:42,033
Yeah, sure, I'll just
take this outside.

778
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,033
Hello.

779
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,234
Yeah, this is Sandy.

780
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,167
Thanks for getting back to me,
Dr. Alessi.

781
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:51,234
I really appreciate
you doing this for me,

782
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,467
and I understand the position
it puts you in.

783
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:56,534
Uh-huh.

784
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:02,567
I see.

785
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,401
Well...

786
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,768
Okay.

787
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,367
Thank you.

788
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,267
--Are you okay?

789
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,834
You want to stop?

790
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:37,667
No, I'm good.

791
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:39,467
Are you hungry?
Are you thirsty?

792
00:32:39,534 --> 00:32:41,334
Sated and quenched,
thanks.

793
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,567
(sighing)

794
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:53,701
I can't do this.

795
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:54,634
You can't?

796
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:56,400
No, I can't.

797
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:57,534
Because, you know,

798
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,734
as much as
I love you...
Yeah?

799
00:32:58,801 --> 00:33:01,501
It just doesn't feel right
getting married.

800
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:03,200
(sighs)

801
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:05,868
You know, without asking
your father...

802
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,667
for your hand.

803
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,834
You want to ask, um, my dad's
permission to marry me?

804
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:14,901
I do. Yes, I do.

805
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:16,334
Cohen, that is such
a holdover

806
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,701
to when women were chattel,

807
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,434
Traded between men like they
were property and animals.

808
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,667
Okay, I took two-thirds

809
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,067
of a semester
of women's studies and...

810
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,834
Well, I just, I can't do this
to your father, Summer.

811
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:28,267
We've watched too
much golf together.

812
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:29,567
I love that man.

813
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,434
Okay...

814
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:34,033
you know, once we ask my dad,
there's no turning back.

815
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,033
Oh, yeah, I know.

816
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,067
Okay.

817
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,367
Hey, well,

818
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,100
let's head on home
and make it official.

819
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:44,434
Okay.

820
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:48,300
All I know is you're
a ballplayer and then I go away

821
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,100
and suddenly,
you're in musicals?

822
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:51,400
Mom had her dreams.

823
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,033
Don't you worry,
Mr. Atwood,

824
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,200
I'll straighten him out.

825
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:55,834
Hey, you know what?
I like this girl, Ryan.

826
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,267
I told you he'd like me.

827
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:59,067
I should make
some coffee.

828
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:01,667
Sorry, I had a call.
Decaf, hon?

829
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:02,934
No, I'm good. Frank.

830
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,901
Hmm?

831
00:34:03,968 --> 00:34:05,334
Can I speak to you for a minute?

832
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:10,267
Yeah, sure, excuse me.

833
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,767
Hey, Sandy, thanks
again for everything.

834
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:21,200
I mean, this has been a great
evening, great dinner.

835
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,634
Yeah, well, when
a man doesn't have

836
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:25,033
a lot of time left,
every meal counts.

837
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,067
Yeah, right.

838
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,200
Why are you doing this, Frank?

839
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,234
What are you talking about?

840
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,701
You're his father. He would have
wanted to see you either way,

841
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:34,467
and now he's going to find out
you lied to him.

842
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,100
I made some phone calls.
You're as healthy as a horse.

843
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,267
You, uh... you checked up
on my story?

844
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:44,400
Yeah, for good reason.
Your story doesn't check out.

845
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,567
The cab is on its way.

846
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:48,901
Now before you go,

847
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:50,133
tell Ryan the truth.

848
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:53,501
Or I will.

849
00:34:55,567 --> 00:35:00,067
Look, you're wrong about him
wanting to see me.

850
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,334
He didn't.

851
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,868
You know, he... Even though
I came here clean

852
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,300
and I-I-I was sorry, he still
didn't want to see me.

853
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:10,033
Are you going to tell Ryan,
or am I?

854
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,701
KIRSTEN:
Is everything okay?

855
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:21,067
Frank?

856
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:25,567
Frank, you got something
you want to say?

857
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:27,000
Nope, nothing.
What's the matter?

858
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:28,200
Then I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

859
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,801
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my house.

860
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:31,968
And he's my son.
Not anymore.

861
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,434
I've extended you
every courtesy.

862
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,000
Now, I'm going to have
to show you the door.

863
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,033
Hey, don't touch me.

864
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,567
Oh, come on.
Let's go.

865
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:42,334
Or what? You don't
want to hit me.

866
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:44,501
Oh, yes, I do.

867
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,601
That was a mistake, Sandy.

868
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:49,734
I'm standing right here, Frank.

869
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:51,267
Hey, hey, hey, stop. Stop!

870
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:54,667
What the hell is going on?

871
00:35:54,734 --> 00:35:58,400
Ryan, your father wants
to tell you something.

872
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:03,000
All right, come on.
Let's talk outside.

873
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,667
Sandy, what on earth?

874
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,067
Well, the good news is,

875
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,501
Frank Atwood is going
to outlive us all.

876
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:14,334
The bad news?

877
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,067
My hand is killing me.

878
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,667
I'll get you some ice.

879
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:19,734
Thank you.

880
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,367
That was pretty good.

881
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:28,400
Oh, you saw the halftime show?

882
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,200
I don't watch girls' basketball.

883
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:31,667
Chicks with big hands
freak me out.

884
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:33,634
So you must mean, like,
today in class, huh?

885
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:34,934
You liked that?

886
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,133
Maybe you're not
a total geek after all.

887
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,100
I mean,

888
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:40,234
you're still a geek,

889
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,133
but you got me pretty good.

890
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,801
I've got to respect that.

891
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,334
Well, your speech
was pretty good.

892
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,701
And I've got to respect that.

893
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,901
It's not like I care
if you respect me or not.

894
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:50,033
But thanks.

895
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:58,100
So got anything else
to say?

896
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:01,234
No. What else would I say?

897
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,133
I don't know, it's just that
you're still standing here.

898
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
So are you.

899
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:09,434
Do you maybe, like,
want to do something?

900
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:12,100
Something with you?

901
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:16,367
I don't think so.
Good, 'cause,

902
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,000
'cause I didn't want
to do nothing anyway.

903
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,434
I was just asking.

904
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:21,801
Really, because
that's what you do?

905
00:37:21,868 --> 00:37:23,234
Just ask people
what they're doing?

906
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,734
Exactly, yep.

907
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:26,968
Well, then why don't you ask
this guy what he's doing?

908
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:28,501
What? Nah, I'm good.

909
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,667
Hey, guy, do you want to
do something with him?

910
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:32,100
Because he's...
Shut up.

911
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,767
Hey, she playing,
she playing.

912
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,634
What?
Sorry.

913
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:36,834
Trying to be funny, huh?

914
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,234
Ryan, it was one lie.

915
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,267
Kind of a big one.

916
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:41,501
I needed to
buy some time.

917
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:44,100
I just wanted you
to get to know me better,

918
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,968
so that, you know, maybe you
could forgive me.

919
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,634
Of all the bad
things I've done,

920
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:50,367
this doesn't even
make the top ten.

921
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,934
Yeah. That's a hell of a point.

922
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,133
Look, I want to do better.
Will you help me?

923
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:03,300
I think you should just go.

924
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,634
Ryan!
It's too soon.

925
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,000
I've worked so hard to get...

926
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:06,968
Not for you, for me.

927
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:16,200
Oh. Yeah.

928
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:17,667
Okay.

929
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:25,901
Sorry, not much of a hugger.

930
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:27,167
Yeah, I know.

931
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:29,534
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened in there.

932
00:38:31,968 --> 00:38:34,167
All right, see you.

933
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,567
I'll call you.

934
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:04,501
Hey.
Hi.

935
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:05,601
Did your dad leave?

936
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:07,000
When you get decked
after dessert,

937
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,868
it's usually a time
to call it a night.

938
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:10,100
Good tip.

939
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,968
So are you okay?

940
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:16,200
First dinner with the family.

941
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:17,901
Very impressive.

942
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,567
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

943
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:22,067
Are you kidding? It was amazing.

944
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:25,767
Well, not amazing,
but, you know intense.

945
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:28,534
And we went through it together,

946
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:31,701
so it was kind of like our first
major relationship milestone.

947
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah, I guess it was.

948
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:35,000
And now you are totally prepared
for dinner with my mom.

949
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:37,033
Huh.

950
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,934
Well, no family
is perfect, right?

951
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,267
Mmm. Yours is pretty close.

952
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:45,467
You should go spend time
with them.

953
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:46,767
Okay.
Okay.

954
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,067
I'll call you tomorrow.
All right.

955
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:57,334
(sighs)

956
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Hey.

957
00:39:58,467 --> 00:39:59,567
You all right?

958
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:00,567
I'm from the Bronx.

959
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:02,300
I used to hit guys all the time.

960
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,968
Key term: "used to."

961
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:07,634
I am sorry I lost my cool
back there.

962
00:40:07,701 --> 00:40:09,434
He kind of
asked for it.

963
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:11,501
And I'm sorry things didn't
work out with your dad.

964
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:15,133
My dad is right here.

965
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,234
But you know,
if you want,

966
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,501
I can teach you a mean
left hook, just in case.

967
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:20,634
Just in case what?

968
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,467
You got more relatives
showing up here or what?

969
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:24,334
I have some
mean uncles.
I bet you do.

970
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,968
Well, you get caught
lying about cancer,

971
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:30,834
you're going to get punched,
those are the rules.

972
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:32,601
Yeah, I just wanted time
with the kid.

973
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,667
I don't think I would have
said or done anything.

974
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,667
I understand,
believe me.

975
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,634
No matter what lie I told,

976
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:40,367
I would have got caught
eventually.

977
00:40:40,434 --> 00:40:41,834
God knows Sandy's
caught me

978
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:43,234
in more than
a few whoppers.

979
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,601
He's just looking out
for Ryan.

980
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,868
If I'd done a little more
of that in my day,

981
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:49,701
I wouldn't be in this position
in the first place.

982
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,167
So where you
going to go now?

983
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:53,767
Bullet's got opportunities
all over.

984
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,734
I'll think of something.

985
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,200
As for you,

986
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:02,634
this ought to keep things
straight with Gordon.

987
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,667
I think you'll find
these books are cooked,

988
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:07,534
so you can hide as
much as you make.

989
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,834
Oh, the prostitution ring. No.

990
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,834
After you busted me
on New Year's,

991
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:13,167
I made a resolution to quit.

992
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:14,667
It's hard out there for a pimp.

993
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:17,434
It's a nice little operation.

994
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:20,667
I mean in no time, you could pay
for that house you live in.

995
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:23,901
Be financially
independent.

996
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,167
Here, you think about it.

997
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,234
Okay.

998
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:33,367
I, uh, I want to thank you
for everything, Julie.

999
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,133
See you.

1000
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,868
Yeah. Uh, keep in touch.

1001
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,434
MAN (on TV):
They enjoyed the sunset
and wrestled a bit.

1002
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:06,067
Hey.
Hi.
Hi, everybody.

1003
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:07,334
Look at you.
Where were you?

1004
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,434
Uh, I was working late.
Sorry I missed dinner.

1005
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,467
That's all right.

1006
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:11,901
I noticed you're
not nursing a bunny.

1007
00:42:11,968 --> 00:42:12,968
I noticed that, too.

1008
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,133
Yes, Pancakes is with his mother

1009
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,000
since I'm going
to be heading up to Seattle

1010
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,067
to visit Dr. Roberts.

1011
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:20,200
Oh, that's odd.

1012
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:21,767
Speaking of fathers,
where's Ryan's?

1013
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:24,968
Sandy punched him.

1014
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:27,133
You punched a dying man?

1015
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,501
Well, it turns out
he wasn't dying.

1016
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:30,567
That's why he punched him.

1017
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:31,834
Miss one dinner around here...

1018
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:33,033
Well, you're home now.

1019
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,467
Get on the couch.
It's family time.

1020
00:42:34,534 --> 00:42:35,701
Is it family time?

1021
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:37,801
Come on.
Sit thee down.
Aw.

1022
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:40,167
All right,
what are we watching?
Yay.

1023
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:42,467
SANDY:
Well, it's about meerkats.
Meerkats.

1024
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:44,534
Why are we watching it?
Because I wanted to.

1025
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:46,334
And we don't want to get
your mother angry.

1026
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,567
You haven't seen
her right cross.

1027
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:48,667
Dad's pretty good though.

1028
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,567
That makes sense.
He was in a gang.

1029
