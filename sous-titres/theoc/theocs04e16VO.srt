00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,457
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.:

2
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:03,091
You're leaving me for
a guy named George?
No.

3
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:05,494
I'm Paul, I'm here for GEORGE.
George?

4
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:08,725
The Global Environmental
Organization
Regarding Greenhouse Emissions.

5
00:00:08,726 --> 00:00:10,498
This guy came by from
GEORGE to recruit me.

6
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:12,715
 you have to choose
between me and GEORGE

7
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:15,199
You haven't given me the green
light on that marriage proposal

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,464
I love u
the real you.

9
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,134
Julie's had enough
of the old Bullit head.

10
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,267
We can still play Ping-Pong.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,634
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,474
six

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,668
Eggs...
And flour.

14
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:36,634
There we go.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,668
Milk.

16
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:42,134
Okay, now, Ryan,
fire up the griddle.

17
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:44,833
And Sandy,
beat until smooth.

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,833
Hey, Mama,
have a seat.

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,067
In the mood for crêpes?

20
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:49,501
You're making crêpes?
Yeah!

21
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,501
Taylor sent Kaitlin
a griddle from France.

22
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:55,134
With a super-long note
about how I need to broaden
my breakfast horizons.

23
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,700
She's 6,000 miles away
and still annoying.

24
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,634
Ryan, have you talked to her?
Oh, no.

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,000
Haven't read her blog,
haven't looked at
her scrapbook.

26
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:02,367
It's over and I'm okay.

27
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:04,067
It's been months.
I barely even think about her.

28
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:05,334
Even though you're
living in her room.

29
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:07,401
You know, we've all had to make
adjustments
since the earthquake.

30
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,767
Especially Kaitlin,

31
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,367
with the entire Cohen
family taking refuge here.

32
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,867
No, it's been nice.
I mean, I've perfected
my Sandy Cohen.

33
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:14,867
Listen to this.

34
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:16,534
I'll schmear it for ya.

35
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:19,767
Well, you know, not bad.

36
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,534
I am very sexy.

37
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:24,201
Baby, stop mimicking Sandy.

38
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,034
Julie! Crêpe?

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,900
I think I'm too
nauseous to eat.

40
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:29,000
Morning sickness.

41
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,867
Or wedding jitters.
Who can tell?

42
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,534
Well, your fianc\ is certainly
excited about the nuptials.

43
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:37,067
Yeah, he's kind of become
a broken record
over and over again.
He keeps saying...

44
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,668
Bang!

45
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,634
Hey, Sandy.
Bullit.

46
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,900
Ryan. Peanut.

47
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,334
Hey, Blondie.

48
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:44,401
And there she is,

49
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:46,401
the future
Mrs. Gordon Bullit.

50
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:50,067
KIRSTEN:
Well, wedding days
can be nerve-wracking,
but just think,

51
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:52,634
after tomorrow you will be just
another old married couple.

52
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,767
Just like that one
living upstairs.

53
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,134
(sighing)

54
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,767
Hey, breakfast time.

55
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,100
Toaster strudel!

56
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,700
Oh, you're the best cook ever.

57
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,833
Shh, enough talking,
what do you want to watch?

58
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,334
Oh, I think you know
what I want to watch.

59
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,833
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,
<i>Briefcase or No Briefcase?</i>

60
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,067
The premise is so simple.

61
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,134
Yet so compelling.

62
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,201
(knock at door)

63
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,434
Can I come in?
Hey, sure.

64
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,334
I know you don't
like to leave your lair,

65
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,833
but the inspector is coming
to the house today.

66
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,334
I think everybody
should be there.
But this chair is my home now.

67
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,301
Downstairs in ten minutes.

68
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:33,601
Boy, his body language
is very negative.

69
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:34,634
You think?

70
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,668
Wait, he just smiled.

71
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,434
I think it was
more of a smirk.

72
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,833
KIRSTEN:
Everyone keep
your fingers crossed.

73
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,668
So what's the good news?
When can we rebuild?

74
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,867
I hate to say this,
but how about never?

75
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,301
Excuse me?

76
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,934
The amount of structural
damage is substantial.

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,767
But Dad, we can pay
to fix it, right?

78
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,534
Yeah, we've got
insurance, savings.

79
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:53,867
Well, the cost
of repairing the damage
is more than the value
of this house.

80
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:56,134
I'm sorry, but there's
no saving your home.

Nice view,
infinity pool...

85
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,367
Yeah, but no pool house.

86
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:46,168
Yes, well, six bedrooms.
I think there's room
enough for everyone.

87
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,534
Yeah, but it still just
doesn't feel like home.

88
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,567
You know, maybe I'm not ready
to leave the old place yet.

89
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:51,901
I'm going to miss it.

90
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:53,567
Doesn't mean I'm not
looking forward to Berkeley.

91
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,400
Oh, Berkeley.

92
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,567
Now, there was a house.

93
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:59,567
The minute we walked
in the front door,
we knew we were home.

94
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:00,867
Wood floors, exposed beams,

95
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,534
that house had character.

96
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,467
And this house has none
of those things.

97
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:07,367
Well, it's got a Viking range,
granite countertops...

98
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:08,834
It's average and generic.

99
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:10,434
I couldn't agree with you more.
Let's get out of here.

100
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I think we should
make an offer.
You do?

101
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,233
You do?
Well, we've seen five
versions of the same house.

102
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,934
Does it really matter
which one we pick?

103
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:19,200
REALTOR:
I'll draw up the papers.

104
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,901
Whatever you want, honey.

105
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,567
It's hard to believe that soon
all this will be gone.

106
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:33,967
Take a good look around.
Everything is about to change.

107
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:36,200
Actually, I have a surprise.

108
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,400
Look.

109
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,567
The floor plan to our
apartment in Providence.

110
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:42,367
Hey, big-screen TV,

111
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:44,068
La-Z-Boys, hot plate.

112
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,667
It looks exactly like here.
Mm-hmm.

113
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,068
Awesome.

114
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:49,867
Do you think our TiVo will keep
its memory if we pack it?

115
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,967
I don't know. I should call
the help line right now.

116
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:56,600
Pen...

117
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:00,534
Oh...

118
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,567
What?

119
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,134
Nothing.

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,400
You know, I think I'm
going to call later
when there's less
phone traffic in India.

121
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,734
What?

122
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:14,967
Isn't it awesome
we get to live like this
for the next four years?

123
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,001
Mm-hmm.

124
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:17,333
Okay, got to run.

125
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,168
Hey, Atwood.
Hey.

126
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,434
Ryan. Come in. Sit.

127
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,300
Yeah, not going to happen.

128
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,500
But I do need your help
with a plan.

129
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,967
Does it involve
leaving this room?

130
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:31,834
It involves leaving the city.

131
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,500
Welcome back from Paris,
Ms. Townsend.

132
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,767
You here for business
or pleasure?

133
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,767
That is an excellent
question, sir.

134
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,667
The answer to which I
spent the better part

135
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,168
of my trans-Atlantic flight
trying to determine.

136
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,967
Because it's not business,
but it's not pleasure.

137
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,867
Because that would imply
that seeing Ryan Atwood
again is pleasurable,

138
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,767
when really, all it is
is stressful and...

139
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,801
you know, really
kind of surreal
that we ever dated
in the first place.

140
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,367
Because it's not like we have
anything in common.

141
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,333
You know, not that we didn't try
though, because we really did.

142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,734
Like I stopped
wearing shoes

143
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:58,134
and learned hacky sack in an
effort to fit in at Berkeley,

144
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,534
and then he learned French
and learned to appreciate

145
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,701
the difference between
a Brie and a Camemburt

146
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,701
And then he grew this little
mustache in an effort

147
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:07,667
to appear more French-like,
but you know, he's fair-haired,

148
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,734
and it was really just kind
of an above-lip disaster.

149
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,834
And from there we just realized
it didn't work, you know.

150
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:14,867
We didn't work and I left,

151
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,901
to escape the painful reality of
yet another failed relationship

152
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,434
and at least this time I
didn't stalk him though.

153
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,667
Because sometimes I do that.

154
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:25,634
Good thing I never fell in love
with the president, huh?

155
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,600
That would be bad.

156
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,901
Right.

157
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:37,500
Summer!

158
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,667
Hey, Taylor.

159
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,134
Hi.
Hi!

160
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,300
So good to see you.

161
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,600
Oh, you, too.

162
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,901
Did you come alone?

163
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,667
Ryan doesn't know
that you're coming.

164
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:47,600
You told me not to tell him.

165
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,267
Who said anything about Ryan?

166
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,667
We're so over.

167
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:52,967
I just, I can't even believe
we ever even dated, you know?

168
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:54,667
I don't even think
I would recognize him.

169
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:56,534
You know, I just hope
he shaved that mustache.

170
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,001
SETH:
Did you get a rental car?

171
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,834
Yeah.
You got the address?

172
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,701
Ryan, hi.

173
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,600
You found out I was coming
and decided to surprise me?

174
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:13,500
No, I didn't know you were
coming back and I'm leaving.

175
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,001
Oh, well, now I'm surprised.
Where are you guys going?

176
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,867
Oh, not far.
We'll be back by tonight.

177
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,767
Yeah, it's a mission.
I'm going to call you.

178
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,434
Okay, well,
brilliant catching up.
It's good to see you.

179
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,001
That wasn't awkward at all.

180
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:28,801
No, no, why would it be?

181
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,400
It's not like I'm still in
love with her or anything.

182
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:36,300
Taylor, are you okay?

183
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,168
No, I'm not.

184
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,834
I'm still in love with him.

185
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:42,200
I can't believe
the Bullit's got 12 sons.

186
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,200
One from every major
oil refinery in Texas.

187
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:47,267
I mean, I've always wanted brothers
and now I'm going to have a dozen.

188
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,767
I mean, it'll be cool,

189
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,200
if they're all like you.

190
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:52,701
Well, that's the thing.

191
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,267
Oh, there she is.

192
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,967
Bullits, meet the Squirt.

193
00:07:59,034 --> 00:07:59,967
ALL:
Howdy, Squirt!

194
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:01,200
Squirt, meet the Bullits.

195
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:04,701
This is Austin, Dallas,
Houston, Lubbock,

196
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,867
Odessa, El Paso,
Amarillo, Texarkana,

197
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:09,233
San Antonio, Corpus Christi

198
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,500
and Hanoi.

199
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,767
Wow.

200
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:14,801
Okay.

201
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,200
Ain't that something?

202
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,734
Now you got yourself a whole
buffet of Bullits to love.

203
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:20,534
ALL:
Bang!

204
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,001
Wow.

205
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:25,400
Well, I guess the apple really
doesn't fall far from the tree.

206
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:28,634
Oh, not my apples.
The Bullit's DNA is bulletproof.

207
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:31,333
Not a recessive gene in the
whole damn double helix.

208
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,300
Oh, looky here,
the wife-to-be.

209
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,600
What's the word, sweetie?

210
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,834
It's a boy.

211
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,400
(Bullits whooping)
Bang!

212
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:42,434
GORDON:
Lucky number 13, yes!

213
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:51,701
This is it.

214
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,333
The Berkeley House.

215
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,500
RYAN:
Yeah, exactly how
Sandy described it.

216
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,500
You ready for this?

217
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,767
Hello.

218
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,101
Hi.

219
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,834
So we'd like
to buy your house.

220
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,734
--Please don't shut the door.

221
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,433
We'd really like
to buy your house.
And you're an adorable couple,

222
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,168
but this house
isn't for sale.

223
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,168
We should tell
them everything.
Okay, right.

224
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:30,333
Uh, this is my house.

225
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,367
Just shut the door.

226
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,667
No, no, he means
it used to be his house.

227
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:34,734
Yeah, those baby handprints
in the cement,

228
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,101
those, those are mine.

229
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:38,367
Oh, those little
hands are yours?
Those are so cute.

230
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,767
I know, thank you.

231
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:42,300
Anyway, my parents moved us
to Newport when I was two,

232
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,433
which was a mistake
on many levels,

233
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,767
but it did allow us to adopt a
young ex-convict named Ryan.

234
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,834
Shut the door.
I'm not actually a convict.

235
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,101
Right. Now our house is
condemned due to an earthquake.

236
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:53,801
My mom's about to have
another baby,

237
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:56,867
and I feel like there's
this chance for our family
to have a fresh start.

238
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,467
RYAN:
Yeah, his parents are always
talking about the time

239
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:00,433
they spent here being
the best of their lives.

240
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,134
It'd be like coming home.

241
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,300
Look, I hear you.

242
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:08,268
But this already is
a home, it's ours.

243
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,801
And it's not for sale.

244
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,934
I thought I had them with the
hands in the cement thing.

245
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,234
Me, too.

246
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,634
We should call your dad.

247
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,667
Sure, nobody can change
somebody's mind like my dad,

248
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,034
but he's not going
to leave my mom,

249
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:23,534
and the airlines won't let
women fly in their
ninth month of pregnancy.

250
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,534
What if she didn't fly
on an airline?

251
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:34,634
And you also sign here,
and here and this is your offer.

252
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,400
Well, we'll live there a year,
get settled with the baby,

253
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,967
and then we can look for a house
without feeling rushed.

254
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:47,134
And I know we can't impose
on Julie much longer.

255
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:48,101
I just wish...

256
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:49,467
Oh, me, too.

257
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:52,767
But wherever our family is,
that's home.

258
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Drop that
pen, amigo!

259
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,801
I'm kidnapping the both of you.

260
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,600
Come on.
The jet is gassed up.

261
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,634
Is he drunk?

262
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,634
No. Your boys called.

263
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,734
They're up in Berkeley

264
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:07,400
trying to buy back
the old homestead.

265
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,467
Just need you two up there
to seal the deal.

266
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,634
I figured the least I could do
is lend my jet,

267
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,634
since old Sanford here
introduced me to my lady love.

268
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,433
I can't fly.
I'm nine-months pregnant.

269
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,367
Oh, my son Amarillo,
he's waiting at the plane.

270
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,134
He's one of those doctors
for women's private parts.

271
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,934
Come on, sunshine's burning.
Let's go.

272
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,400
Not to pressure you,

273
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,168
but the owners are expecting
other offers.

274
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:28,268
Oh, what the hell, blondie,
I'll buy this house.

275
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,101
There you go.

276
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:31,300
There you go.

277
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,801
Thank you. <i>Andele!</i>

278
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,867
I'm not saying things will just
snap back to how they were,

279
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,001
but maybe we were too quick
to give up.
Mm-hmm.

280
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,634
So we'll be 6,000 miles away.

281
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,600
I'll be in Newport for Christmas
and the summer,

282
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,034
and you know,
we'll make it work.

283
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,367
I should call him,
don't you think?

284
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,901
Oh, real-life Jake broke up
with real-life April.

285
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,400
What are you doing?

286
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,134
I told Seth that
I wouldn't watch <i>Briefcase</i>

287
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:52,467
<i>or No Briefcase</i>
till he got home,

288
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:53,500
so I'm reading about <i>The Valley.</i>

289
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,001
Oh, my God,
that show's still on?

290
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,934
It just got picked up
for five more seasons.

291
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,600
You know, these teen dramas,
they just run forever.

292
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,467
Okay, enough,
this is insane.
Hey!

293
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:03,168
Summer, when I left, you were
a committed environmentalist.

294
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:04,801
You were passionate.

295
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,300
You engaged
with the world.

296
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:07,667
You... bathed.

297
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,333
I still care about things.
Like what?

298
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,168
Besides <i>Briefcase</i>
<i>or No Briefcase</i>

299
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:12,700
and the stars
of <i>The Valley?</i>

300
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:16,867
Ooh.

301
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,600
Sweetie, tell me what happened.

302
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,734
I don't know.

303
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,433
Well, the earthquake happened,

304
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,034
then the comic bookstore
closed down,

305
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,801
and Seth's room
was destroyed.

306
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,101
I didn't join GEORGE,
and then he moved in.

307
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:30,367
We talked about
everything there
was to talk about.

308
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,168
Then one day we turned
on the TV.

309
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:33,734
And there it was.

310
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,867
<i>Briefcase or No Briefcase.</i>

311
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:38,067
And suddenly,
we weren't worried
about the future.

312
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:39,500
We weren't wondering
who we were.

313
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,667
For the first time, I think
we were really comfortable.

314
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,467
Maybe a little
too comfortable.

315
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:45,333
You ever think
about that?

316
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,168
No.
(thudding)

317
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:48,700
Oh, my God, what is that?

318
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,034
I don't know.

319
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,168
(gasps)

320
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,333
Pancakes had babies!

321
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,467
When did this happen?!

322
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:00,767
You didn't know
she was pregnant?

323
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,300
I didn't he was a she.

324
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,567
Oh, my God,
I'm a bad crack mother.

325
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,400
RYAN:
Shouldn't we be waiting
at the house?

326
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:10,767
Uh, we've got a little bit of time
until the Bullit is wheels down with our parents.

327
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:13,201
Take a look around, man.
In a few weeks,

328
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:15,300
you're going
to have all these
new faces to punch.

329
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,667
Aw, you getting
nostalgic on me?

330
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,234
No. Seriously,
everyone's moving.

331
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,934
Newport's over.
This is the future.

332
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:23,700
And it's also possible
you may meet another
Taylor Townsend.

333
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,268
What was that?

334
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,667
There is no other
Taylor Townsend?

335
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:29,400
There's only one
and you're in love with her?
All right.

336
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:30,901
Listen, you haven't said a word
since we bumped into her.

337
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,268
I know it means you can't stop
thinking about her.

338
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,067
I'm going to get some coffee.

339
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:35,367
You love her,
I know it.

340
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,433
Stop it.
I know it!

341
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,600
Join GEORGE.

342
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,767
Fight the industrial
devastation of our planet.

343
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,901
Hey, are you Paul
from GEORGE.?

344
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,600
No, Tom from GEORGE.
You know Paul?

345
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,867
Uh, no, my girlfriend
Summer Roberts met him.

346
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,101
Sure, yeah.

347
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:49,967
Paul was really disappointed
when she turned us down.

348
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,300
What's she up to now?

349
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,600
Uh, not much of anything,
really.

350
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,367
Well, um, give her this,
would you?

351
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:59,567
I hate to see someone like
Summer just waste their passion.

352
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:01,268
Yeah.

353
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,567
She... she loves otters.

354
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,067
Thank you.

355
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:16,600
Hello.

356
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,400
Ryan, hi, it's me.

357
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,901
Oh, hey.

358
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,634
SUMMER:
Ouch, this soap stings!

359
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,268
Well, that's because it's lye.

360
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,967
Sorry.

361
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:30,300
So I was, um, thinking
maybe we should get together
and talk about things.

362
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,001
Oh, uh...

363
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,600
But you don't want to?

364
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:36,500
No, no, it's just I don't know
when Seth and I are going
to get back from Berkeley.

365
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,433
Oh. Why are you in Berkeley?

366
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,134
Long story, but basically trying
to get the Cohens
their old house back.

367
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:45,667
The Cohens are moving
to Berkeley?

368
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,801
If things work out.

369
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:52,400
So, that would mean you wouldn't
be coming back to Newport

370
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:56,001
for Christmas or summer or...

371
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,034
ever.

372
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:59,300
I guess not.

373
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,700
Um, listen, we could talk
after the wedding if you want.

374
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,300
Yeah, oh, yeah, I have to go.

375
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,667
Um, you have a nice trip.

376
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,268
Ugh!

377
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,801
We finish this
and then we're done.

378
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,201
Unless there's anything else
you need for tomorrow.

379
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,467
I'm all good.

380
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,834
I've got my shoes, my dress,
my cheat sheet

381
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:26,433
with the names
of all my stepbrothers.

382
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,801
How was that, meeting
all of them?

383
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:32,500
Weird, but I mean,
I love Bullit,

384
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,168
but one's kind of enough,
you know?

385
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,567
You're telling me.

386
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,801
What are you talking about?

387
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,134
You're about to spawn off
the latest.

388
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:41,767
Well, maybe he won't be all that
Bullit-esque.

389
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,168
Don't count on it.

390
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,034
He's probably going
to come out with a cowboy hat
telling the doctor, "Bang."

391
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:48,234
Or a wife-beater.

392
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,067
Why would he be wearing
a wife-beater?

393
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:55,101
Oh, my God. Mom...

394
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:56,901
Okay, honey, just relax.

395
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,333
You have to be kidding me.

396
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,201
I mean, does the Bullit know?

397
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,534
Of course he knows.

398
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,234
What, you told him
that the baby is...

399
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,433
Frank's, yes.

400
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,067
And when were you going
to tell me?

401
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,734
Soon.

402
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,734
I'm sorry. This isn't easy.

403
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:17,201
Well, what happened
with you and Frank?

404
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:21,001
I got pregnant, and Frank
couldn't deal with it,

405
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,433
so I left him.

406
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,534
That's when the Bullit came
back, I told him everything,

407
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,901
and he still wanted to marry me.

408
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,367
That's the whole story.

409
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:32,433
Mom, do you love the Bullit?

410
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,333
Yes.

411
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:44,867
I can't believe
we're here.

412
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,700
Seriously, fellas,
this is crazy.

413
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,101
You always said
this was where you guys
were the happiest.

414
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:50,534
Every city needs
public defenders.

415
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,268
Plus, I think my little sister
deserves a shot at growing up normal.

416
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,600
Well, we can
at least talk to them.

417
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:56,700
Can't hurt.

418
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:06,268
Hello. Oh...
Hi.

419
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,333
I'm Sandy Cohen.

420
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,433
This is my wife,
Kirsten.

421
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,667
and we used to live here.

422
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,001
I'm Todd.

423
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,300
Patrick.

424
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,767
And, um, yeah, your son's
already told us
everything.

425
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,734
about the earthquake,
the hands in the cement,the baby,
but like we said...

426
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:18,934
You don't want to sell,
I get it,

427
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:22,634
but just being
here again,
I got to say
it still feels like home.

428
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,934
Um, is the bathroom
still in the same place?
Do you mind?

429
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,600
Why would I mind?

430
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,300
Thank you.

431
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,901
I love what you've done
with the decorating.

432
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,268
Is there any chance
we could see the kitchen?

433
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,268
Just to see if the Seth Cohen
growth chart
is still notched
in the wall?

434
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,101
It isn't. We thought
it was termites.

435
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh, I hit three feet.

436
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,967
I mean, it was
a pretty huge
accomplishment.

437
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:46,934
Sir, while we appreciate
your nostalgia,
we have things to do.

438
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,101
No, it's all right.

439
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,268
We'll be out of here
in just a sec.

440
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,467
Oh, God!

441
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:52,101
Sandy!
Or not.

442
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:53,268
Sandy!

443
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:55,867
I'm here.

444
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,500
Oh, my God.

445
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:00,234
Okay, this isn't the bathroom.

446
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,600
I'm sorry,
I didn't make it.

447
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,634
My water broke.

448
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,367
Seth, call an ambulance!

449
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:06,734
There's no time
for an ambulance.

450
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:08,901
Okay, this is so random,
but I'm actually a midwife.

451
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,334
--Sophie Rose Cohen.

452
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:20,334
Aw...

453
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:22,134
It's got a nice ring to it, huh?

454
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,334
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

455
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,000
She really will be
in two years

456
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,967
when she doesn't look
like a squished meatball.

457
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,301
You just
called your sister
a squished meatball.

458
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:31,700
You should have seen
what you looked like
when you were born.

459
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:32,800
Oh, he was beautiful, too.

460
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:34,334
Yeah, I was.

461
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:36,468
Yeah, you looked
like you went 12 rounds
with Joe Frasier.

462
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,101
All right,
move out of the way.

463
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,201
It's time for a feeding.

464
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,267
Oh, she's going to...

465
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,767
Yeah, we should go.

466
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:45,034
No, thank you, Kirsten,
I'm lactose intolerant.

467
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:47,667
Bullit, what are you
doing here?

468
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,967
Aren't you getting
married in a few hours?

469
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:50,568
Don't I know it.
Couldn't get any damn airspace.

470
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:53,334
All those dot commers up here
with their private jets.

471
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:55,700
The runway was busier
than a bull in springtime.

472
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:56,800
It's fine now.

473
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:59,167
Hey, thanks for everything.

474
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,733
Give Julie our best

475
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,234
and please explain
why we couldn't make it.
Oh, I will,

476
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:04,667
and she'll be thrilled.

477
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,401
And when she pops out
lucky number 13, bang,

478
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:08,767
I want you there.

479
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,301
(baby crying)

480
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:14,134
Sophie Rose Cohen.

481
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:23,334
Caitlin, what are you
doing here?

482
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,434
Just wondering
if you've got an invite
to the wedding,

483
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:28,568
'cause you didn't RSVP,
which is really rude,

484
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,900
considering my mom's pregnant
with your baby.

485
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:33,267
So she told you, huh?

486
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:34,733
How could you do that...

487
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
just walk away from her?

488
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,334
I mean, she loved you.

489
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:40,234
When she told me she was
pregnant, I did kind of panic,

490
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:41,667
and I know I let her down.

491
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,733
But when I went to see her
and tell her that,
she was having dinner
with Bullit.

492
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,167
For what it's worth,
I really do love her,
but she's made her choice.

493
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:51,401
I know better than to try
and change your mom's mind.

494
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:52,633
So you're just
quitting?

495
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,267
Whoa, wait a minute.
Isn't this what you wanted?

496
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,134
Bullit and a new family?

497
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:57,733
All I want is for my mom
to be happy.

498
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,867
and for my little brother
to have his dad around,

499
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,267
but not if he's going
to be a coward.

500
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:11,134
You know, I thought Atwoods
were good at fighting.

501
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,101
Hey.
Hey.

502
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,267
Is Mom sleeping?

503
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,034
Mother and daughter
are snoring soundly.

504
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:24,733
How you feeling?

505
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,834
Like I landed
in a time warp;

506
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,267
your mother, me,
a new baby
and this house.

507
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:35,434
It's almost
20 years later
and I feel like no time
has passed at all.

508
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,834
Well, you look like it, too.

509
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,501
You got that full head of hair.

510
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:40,900
If I look half as good as you
in 20 years,

511
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,468
I'll be a happy man.

512
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,767
Well, thanks, but I'd like to
see you being happy right now.

513
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,733
Seems the last couple
of months
you've landed
in a bit of a rut.

514
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,733
At least a La-Z-Boy.

515
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,834
Well, I sort of have,
but being up here

516
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,534
and seeing Ryan's new life
and meeting my new sister...

517
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,434
I get that change is happening
whether I want it to or not.

518
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:02,134
Yeah, nothing
lasts forever.

519
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:04,700
But you and Summer still have
each other.

520
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,600
You'll be heading off
to Providence together.

521
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,967
Yeah.

522
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,434
Except I'm not so sure
that us being together

523
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,667
is bringing out best
in either one of us right now.

524
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,767
But I'm afraid
to let her go, so...

525
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:25,800
Well, things have a way
of coming back around.

526
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,367
Look at us.

527
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,334
Hey.

528
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,468
Maybe I should go try to find Julie
and see if she needs any help.

529
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:49,134
Sure, Summer,
just abandon me, too.

530
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:51,900
Maybe I'll just strike up
a casual romance with one of the Bullits.

531
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,900
Okay, who do you
think's hotter,

532
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,401
El Paso or San Antonio?

533
00:21:55,468 --> 00:21:57,201
Ooh... hmm.

534
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:00,167
Yeah, I'm going to have
to think about that.

535
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:03,067
Hanoi has a certain charm.

536
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,733
Thanks for filling in
for Kirsten.

537
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,900
I hope she shows up soon.

538
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,600
You look so beautiful.

539
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,800
Thank you.

540
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,434
And you, it's nice to
see you looking so...

541
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,334
showered again.

542
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,600
Hmm, well, I figured
it was about time.

543
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,700
Yeah.

544
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,534
Is everything okay?

545
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,501
I guess.

546
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:32,700
I don't know, you're with
the same someone for so long...

547
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:35,034
I guess you start to get
a little comfortable.

548
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:36,867
I wouldn't know.

549
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:40,800
Do you think that Seth and I
are making a mistake?

550
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:42,633
Living together
right after

551
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,700
the earthquake, and then
getting an apartment together
next year in Providence?

552
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,067
Uh, well,

553
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,633
you know...

554
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,434
I got married so young

555
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:55,700
that I never had a chance
to find out who I was

556
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:58,101
or what I cared about.

557
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:02,234
I mean, I never
went to college
or learned any
real skills.

558
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:06,867
And now here I am
20 years later,
still knocked up
on my wedding day.

559
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:08,633
Julie.

560
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,967
Summer...

561
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:12,534
you're a great girl.

562
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,334
And the world
deserves to know you.

563
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:19,134
You deserve it, too.

564
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:21,667
Don't settle for comfortable.

565
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:25,468
I got you something.

566
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:45,967
I know she would have
wanted to be here today.

567
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:47,667
Thank you.

568
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:50,501
Thank you.

569
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,401
Crap, my makeup.

570
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:56,267
Hmm, my makeup.

571
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,367
It'll take hours to fix.

572
00:23:58,434 --> 00:23:59,934
Hours?

573
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,267
We don't got hours.

574
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,367
We're getting married now.

575
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:05,134
Now? Is Kirsten here?

576
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:08,134
Uh, about that...
she dropped child
up in San Fran.

577
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:11,101
But lucky for her,
there was a hell of a midwife
standing by.

578
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,568
Kirsten had her baby?

579
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,633
Yeah, and she said she was sorry
that she couldn't be here.

580
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,867
Now are you ready
to get hitched?

581
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:18,834
I can't get married
without Kiki.

582
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,267
She's my best friend.

583
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,468
I'm sorry, but I'm not doing it
without her.

584
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,468
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

585
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:37,034
One of you two wouldn't be
a wedding planner would you?

586
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:39,867
Actually...

587
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:46,201
Let me see
my flower girl.

588
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,301
Julie?

589
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:48,501
Are you a runaway bride?

590
00:24:48,568 --> 00:24:50,468
Kind of a runaway wedding.

591
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:55,367
Wait a minute, does that mean
that everybody came with you?

592
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:56,600
Uh-oh.

593
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,534
Can I talk to you?

594
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,900
Do you have a minute?

595
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,267
Okay, Ryan, what do you
want to talk about?

596
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:08,301
Well, I realized that
when I talked to you
yesterday on the phone,

597
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:09,867
I may have been
a little insensitive.

598
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:11,167
You? Never.

599
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:14,034
I also realize that
if the Cohen's do
move to Berkeley,

600
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:16,867
we... we may never see
each other again.

601
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:19,600
Hadn't really
thought about it.

602
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:23,301
And when we do
say good-bye,

603
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,167
I wanted it to be
as friends.

604
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,301
Friends.

605
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:28,600
Sure.

606
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,067
Ryan Atwood,
<i>mon ami,</i> sounds terif.

607
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:44,967
(buttons splattering)

608
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:46,434
I'll sew those
back on for you.
Yeah, okay.

609
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,201
Okay.

610
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,733
What is it with you people?

611
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,034
We're grandparents?

612
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:05,434
Wow, that's, uh,
that's amazing.

613
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:07,534
Congratulations
to Pancakes.

614
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
Yeah.

615
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,167
Don't you think
it's kind of weird
that we didn't even know
Pancakes was pregnant?

616
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:15,301
Well, we're not going to
win any parenting awards.

617
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:19,234
I mean, we must have
been pretty out of it
to not even notice or care.

618
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,733
I think we've been
in kind of a...

619
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,267
Rut lately? Mm.

620
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:30,501
Do you really think
that we can spend
the next four years
like this?

621
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:36,733
Well, look, I'm a pretty
skeptical guy.

622
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,167
I don't really believe
in signs, but...

623
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,468
this one's pretty
easy to read.

624
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:45,834
It's very easy to read.

625
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,834
Big letters.

626
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,700
GEORGE?

627
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,434
You got to go, Summer.

628
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,334
But what about us?

629
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:59,667
This is for us, okay?
It's for both of us.

630
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:11,534
"I, Julie Cooper, take you,
Gordon Bullit..."

631
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,501
I, Julie Cooper, take
you, Gordon Bullit...

632
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:17,401
(engine revving)

633
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,067
Julie!

634
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,900
Now, by the power vested in me,
by the state...

635
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:45,867
(cell phone rings)

636
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,534
Oh, come on, Squirt!

637
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:49,834
Frank?

638
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,101
Frank?
Frank?

639
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:52,834
Hello?

640
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,234
Kaitlin, hey,
is your mom around?

641
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:56,201
Yeah, she's kind of getting
married right now.

642
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:57,867
That's what I was afraid of.
Put me on speaker phone.

643
00:27:57,934 --> 00:28:00,733
It took you
long enough.

644
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,834
Julie!

645
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,234
Julie, can you hear me?

646
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:04,700
Frank, what are you doing?

647
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,733
I love you, Julie, and I want to
be there for you, and our son.

648
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:12,134
She's pregnant
with Frank's baby?

649
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:13,934
Who cares?
This is so romantic.

650
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,434
Hello?

651
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:20,267
Sorry, Frank, old buddy,
we're having a hard time
hearing you.

652
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,867
Let's get on with the wedding.

653
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,900
I'm sorry, can...
can I have a moment?

654
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,534
Oh, that woman is like
nailing Jell-O to the wall.

655
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:47,967
Mom?

656
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:49,767
Not now, Kaitlin.

657
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:51,568
Mom's trying to figure
out who to marry.

658
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:54,633
I know.

659
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,367
Which is why
whatever you decide,

660
00:28:57,434 --> 00:29:00,867
just make sure
it's what you want...

661
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:04,234
because this is forever.

662
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,434
So, um, Todd and I
were talking

663
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:27,067
and, um...
I mean, look,

664
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,301
you had a baby here,
you had a wedding...

665
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,667
Christened one of
our bedrooms...

666
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,267
Clearly you have
a connection.

667
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:35,401
This is your house,
we're just living in it.

668
00:29:35,468 --> 00:29:37,767
We'll have our lawyers
call you, but...

669
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:38,900
We can't fight fate.

670
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,267
We'll sell.

671
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,434
You mean it?

672
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:49,234
Thank you.

673
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
You in?

674
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:54,633
Yeah.

675
00:29:57,733 --> 00:29:59,967
The Cohens are moving
to Berkeley.

676
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,201
Sophie, you're home!

677
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,733
Hey, sweetie.

678
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,968
--We got to go,
we got a lot of work to do.

679
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,400
Our kitchen is going
to be so empty.

680
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:38,767
I know.

681
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:41,334
I was kind of getting
used to becoming a Cohen.

682
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,734
My Sandy imitation
was killer.

683
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,068
Mm-hmm.

684
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:46,434
Well, it's just
the two of us now.

685
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,901
Yeah.

686
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:50,934
It's pretty awesome that you
decided to stay single.

687
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:53,701
But do we have a plan?

688
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,701
Yeah, I was thinking
we could go get mani-pedis,

689
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,334
maybe a couple of Mystics.

690
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,834
I was talking about,
like, a real plan.

691
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:00,968
A life plan.

692
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:04,001
I know.

693
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:06,034
The truth is, I don't.

694
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:08,734
For the first time,
I am going to figure out

695
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,001
how to do this on my own.

696
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,467
You're not on your own.

697
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:13,200
I could work retail,

698
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,300
part-time at least.

699
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:17,634
We'll figure it out.

700
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:18,701
We're Coopers.

701
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:20,068
Mm-hmm.

702
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:26,068
Oh, hey, Summer
forgot her books.

703
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:33,400
"Undergraduate Catalog."

704
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:34,667
Huh.

705
00:31:51,634 --> 00:31:53,334
Aww.

706
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,500
All right, Roberts.

707
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:02,500
I'll see you.

708
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:03,667
See you, Atwood.

709
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:06,467
Thank you very much
for Flapjacks.

710
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:07,567
Oh...!

711
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,834
I promise I'll raise him right.

712
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,367
Well, don't forget
to clean his cage,

713
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:11,934
which should not be used
for cage fights.

714
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:14,500
Got it.
Oh, my gosh, I'm going
to miss you so much.

715
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,467
Oh...

716
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,367
Well, you can follow up with
my political efforts on my blog.

717
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:21,667
And you can follow
my personal efforts on mine.

718
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,300
Eww.

719
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,634
You're the best.

720
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:27,267
You're the only girlfriend
I ever had.

721
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:29,934
I'll miss you.
You, too.

722
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:31,334
All right.

723
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,200
We'll be in the car.

724
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:34,801
Bye.

725
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:43,100
I don't know, some
of these GEORGE guys,

726
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,901
they look so idealistic.

727
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,133
You got nothing to worry about.

728
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,267
Just remember,
this isn't good-bye.

729
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:54,500
You're my destiny, Cohen.

730
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:57,334
Go save the world,
Summer Roberts.

731
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:17,068
See you in '08 after
the New Hampshire primary.

732
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,934
Just go.

733
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,300
I'm going to go.

734
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:25,500
So you're going off to Berkeley,
I'm going off to Paris.

735
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,801
Who knows what's going
to happen, huh?

736
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:29,167
Yeah.

737
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,400
Well, I think
what's really important
is what's already happened,

738
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:34,367
which was this year--
thank you,

739
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:37,200
Taylor-- you, uh, you saved me.

740
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:41,901
Well, you may have
helped me iron out
a few issues of my own.

741
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:43,133
All right.

742
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,500
Come here.

743
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,634
All aboard!

744
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:54,934
Remind me why you're taking
the train to Paris.

745
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:57,034
Oh, actually, I'm taking
a train to New York,

746
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,534
and from there I'm
taking a boat to Paris.

747
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,300
It's the strangest thing,
but no airline
would have me.

748
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:02,434
Hmm.

749
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,100
Oh, you'd better get going.

750
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:07,034
Oh, yeah, but...

751
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,968
Ryan...
better do that.

752
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,034
Ryan.
Huh?

753
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,734
They're not going to
let you off the train.

754
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:14,934
Mm-hmm.

755
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:16,100
Uh-oh.

756
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,001
Where's the next station?

757
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:19,567
San Bernardino, I think.

758
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:20,667
It's an hour away.

759
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:22,100
Ooh, we can do a lot in an hour.

760
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:24,100
I did book a sleeper car.

761
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,068
That's the last of it.

762
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,200
Here we go.

763
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:54,634
Fly safe and we'll see you
at Parent's Day weekend.

764
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:56,934
All right.
Two months
and 14 days away.

765
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,601
I will be counting the days
as well.

766
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,133
Oh, I love you.

767
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,601
I love you, too.
Let's group-hug it.

768
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:12,267
Well, I guess
we'd better get going
if we're going to
beat the traffic.

769
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:13,634
You take care of yourself.

770
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:15,968
Okay.

771
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,767
You got the directions
in case we get separated?

772
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:20,901
Yeah, you know what?

773
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:22,701
I think I'm just going
to hang out.

774
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:25,334
As much as this house
meant to you...

775
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,734
Take your time.

776
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:28,834
I'll meet you at the rest stop
in Santa Barbara.

777
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:30,634
All right.
KIRSTEN: Time to go!

778
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:32,034
Yep.

779
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,467
I could give you a ride.

780
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:53,434
No, no, this is better.

781
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,233
My new life of loneliness
and isolation begins now.

782
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,467
Ah, you're going to be fine.
Yeah, I don't know
about you though.

783
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,300
I've been doing some checking
up on your new roommate.

784
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:02,867
His favorite book and
movie are <i>DaVinci Code.</i>

785
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:04,034
He's no me.

786
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,400
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

787
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:08,367
At least I leave you funnier
than when I found you.

788
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,001
Yeah, I'm a lot better off
than when you found me.

789
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,701
Me, too.

790
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,901
Should we hug?
(scoffs)

791
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:21,534
I know.
It's crazy.
Come on.
Give me a shake, dude.

792
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:25,634
All right.
All right.

793
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,034
Aw. feels good in here.

794
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,968
Oh, it felt really nice.

795
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:30,834
Felt really nice.
Yeah.

796
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:33,267
All right.
See you later.

797
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,300
Yeah.
All right.

798
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,567
(engine starts)

799
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:14,767
SETH:
<i>I don't know what to say,</i>

800
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:19,034
<i>except that you totally</i>
<i>had my back out there.</i>

801
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:51,100
Hey.

802
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:57,567
KIRSTEN:
<i>Ryan's going to stay</i>
<i>with us now.</i>

803
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,667
I'll unpack later.

804
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:28,701
(engine starts)

805
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:24,734
No nukes! No nukes!
No nukes!

806
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:27,200
Good job, you guys.
Louder! Come on!

807
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,601
SANDY:
<i>All right,</i>

808
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,834
what was... I think you can
pretty much imagine
what I'm going to talk about.

809
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:49,801
(all laughing)

810
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,434
That's right.

811
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,133
I hope you know what
I'm talking about.

812
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,334
All right!

813
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,934
Any volunteers?

814
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:01,100
Yes?

815
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,034
X=24.

816
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,734
(applause)

817
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Whoo!

818
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,434
Whoo!

819
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:07,100
Yeah, I'm just
leaving the site now.

820
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:08,367
Everything looks good.

821
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:10,500
We're on schedule to meet
our target date.

822
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:12,534
Thank you.

823
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:38,667
Hey, kid.

824
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:43,734
Need any help?
