1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,501
Oh, hey,

2
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,134
I thought you were
hanging Christmas lights.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Oh, I took a coffee break,
union rules.

4
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,534
Well, you better hurry up,
it's going to start
raining any minute,

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,768
and you know how Seth
loves his rooftop reindeer.

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,367
Yeah, don't worry,
it'll be up by dinner.

7
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:22,034
Oh, speaking of dinner,
are you going to bring a guest?

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,067
That's pretty subtle,
Kirsten.

9
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:25,701
I'm not saying
you'd bring Taylor,

10
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:27,768
I'm just letting you know
that she's welcome.
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,734
Well, I don't know.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,401
I don't know,
it's, uh, it's just...

13
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:34,234
Oh, you think that if you invite
her, she's your girlfriend.

14
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,034
Boy, so predictable.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,601
Hey, now, inviting a girl
over for Christmas Eve,

16
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:41,367
that's like making
some sort of announcement.

17
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:42,601
It's Chrismukkah.

18
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,034
We make our own rules.

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,668
Fine.

20
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:46,701
Set a place for her.

21
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll invite her today.
Great.

22
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:50,900
Okay.
Oh, my ham guy.

23
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:13,367
Can't believe we're spending
Christmas in the ghetto.

24
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,267
It's not the ghetto.

25
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:18,034
It's Riverside, and it's
where our family is from.

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,267
I thought we were
in denial about that.

27
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:22,567
Kaitlin, in case
you hadn't noticed,

28
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,534
we're a little short
on family these days.

29
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,334
I think we should
take all we can get.

30
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,401
TAYLOR:
* God rest ye merry gentlemen,
let nothing you dismay... *

31
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:31,534
Oh, God, now it's caroling.

32
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,734
Happy holidays.

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,833
Hello.

34
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,267
Is that a gift for me?

35
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:38,768
'Cause I forgot to get you one.

36
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,334
No, this is for Ryan.
I got him a George Foreman grill

37
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,434
because he likes lean meat,
obviously.

38
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,833
Lovely. So, Taylor, uh, Summer's
having dinner with the Cohens,

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,134
but you're welcome
to come with us to Riverside,

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
unless of course you're doing
something with your mother.

41
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:54,334
Oh, no, no.

42
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:56,100
She sent me a mass E-mail
last week.

43
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,100
She's spending Christmas
in Cabo.

44
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,434
She would've
invited me,

45
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,167
but she knows that I don't like
Mexican food.

46
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,833
But it's not a problem because
I'm having dinner over at Ryan's.

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,467
Oh, I didn't know you
were invited over there.

48
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:07,933
I'm not...
well, yet.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,034
But I'm sure he's
going to ask me.

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,434
Well, I mean,
I hope he does.

51
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:13,534
Well, he will.

52
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,833
So I better go over there
and give him his gift.

53
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,134
Last chance to come
to Riverside.

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,034
You want to watch my Aunt Cindy
do whippets underneath the mistletoe?

55
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,467
Uh... no, thanks.

56
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,434
But you guys have
a good time.

57
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,567
Bye.

58
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,234
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

59
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:38,000
I know, where's
the mistletoe, right?

60
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,334
But don't worry,
we can kiss anyway.

61
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:41,501
Uh, Taylor, I'm a
little busy right now.

62
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:45,601
Well, don't you want
your present?

63
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,267
Just leave it right there.
I'll open it later.

64
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:52,134
You know I just ran into Kirsten
in the kitchen,

65
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,100
and she was talking to some guy
with a huge ham.

66
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:58,367
Are you guys having dinner
or something?
Uh, yeah.

67
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:02,401
Poor Ryan.

68
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,768
All of his muscles are so developed,
except for the ones in his mouth.

69
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,434
You want to invite me
to Chrismukkah,

70
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:10,034
but you don't know how,
so I will save you the trouble.

71
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,668
I would love to come.

72
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,967
Taylor, look, I don't know
what's going on between us,

73
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,634
but it's only been a few weeks.

74
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:20,534
And you think if you invite me
to Chrismukkah,

75
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,833
then that makes me
your girlfriend.

76
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,734
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, but yeah.

77
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:29,301
Hurt my feelings?

78
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,367
Why would that hurt my feelings?

79
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:34,634
Just because I spent
time and money

80
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:36,134
getting you the perfect gift--

81
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,734
which, by the way, happens to be
the deluxe version

82
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
of the George Foreman grill--

83
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:44,100
and in return you give me
a hot, steaming pile
of rejection.

84
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,367
Well, you know,
I think that's just fine.

85
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,867
(sighs)
Because I'm used
to it, okay?

86
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,501
So here, here it is.

87
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:50,668
Grill away.

88
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:51,701
Taylor, I don't want this.

89
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,167
No, I took your gift--

90
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,634
the holiday-themed
rejection--

91
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,734
so you should take it.

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,933
No, you take it.
I bought it for you.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,100
You take it.
It's yours. I...

94
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,401
Taylor!

95
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:05,367
Whoa, it's going to pour.

96
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,734
Are you sure this
is a Virginia ham?

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,768
Taylor?

98
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,867
Taylor, are you...
are you hurt?

99
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,567
Only my heart, Ryan.

100
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:34,768
Only my heart.

101
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,234
Come on up,
I'll get you some ice.

102
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, you're
offering me ice?

103
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,634
Hmm, I guess I should
jump at that.

104
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,267
Here.

105
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:43,567
The receipt's inside.

106
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:46,034
I hope you grill
your face.

107
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:18,534
Oh, so, I was just
in the pool house...
What are you doing in there?

108
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,234
I told the supervisor that
this is off-limits to the staff.

109
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,334
What?

110
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,334
Where is your supervisor?

111
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:27,933
Uh, Kirsten, what are
you talking about?

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,267
Excuse me, do I know you?

113
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:39,100

00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,167
I said do I know you?

117
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,734
Uh, look, I don't know
what's going on, but...

118
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,633
I was up on the
roof with Taylor...

119
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,734
Is this one of your guys?

120
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,067
Nope, never seen him before.

121
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:13,234
Oh, great.So now I just have
strangers wandering around my house.

122
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:14,967
No, no, no.
Where's Seth?

123
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:16,900
Oh, you're a friend
of my son's.

124
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,500
He's at the comic
book store.

125
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:21,267
If you run into him,
will you tell him
that I need him home by 5:00?

126
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,900
Uh... I have a meeting.

127
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,067
Now shoo.

128
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,500
I don't want you wandering
around my house.

129
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,001
Hey, kid,I got the feeling
the dragon lady wanted
you out of here.

130
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:47,600
You see, this is why I feel
so strongly about this issue.

131
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,401
Take Daryl here.
Last week he was homeless.

132
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:54,301
But because of the money
we've raised, he has a future
to look forward to
in the new year.

133
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:56,034
Well, you're quite the
philanthropist.

134
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:57,067
Yes.

135
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,267
And I help people.

136
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,468
Julie.

137
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,201
I love it when they call
me by my first name.

138
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:03,401
What are you doing?
What is all this?

139
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:05,633
Take this, it's a voucher
for the mission.

140
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,134
Tell them I sent you.

141
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:08,134
You don't know me?

142
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:11,167
I know your pain.

143
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:14,834
See, people think that
Newport Beach is a cold city,
a place of privilege.

144
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,700
But even this poor street urchin
has found hope here.

145
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,734
Now you just run
along now, honey.

146
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:22,667
You heard the lady.

147
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,900
You guys, come on.

148
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,134
You guys, come on.
You guys, come on.

149
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,234
Would you...
would you give me back...

150
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,633
Would you give me back
my wallet?

151
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,234
(mockingly):
Would you... would you
give me back my wallet?

152
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:38,368
Seriously.

153
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,767
Seriously.
Seriously.

154
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,767
Hey, hey, give me that.

155
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:44,934
Why, is this
your boyfriend?

156
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,434
You guys should get a room.

157
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,301
Yeah. So you can
make love in it.

158
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,967
(scoffs)
I make love to ladies.

159
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:53,267
Hey, man, thanks.
Do I know you from Brown?

160
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,368
You go to Brown?

161
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,967
Yeah. Who are you?

162
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,234
You don't know me either?

163
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,800
I can't believe this.

164
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:00,834
Hey, dork,your girlfriend's
across the way.

165
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,967
Which one?

166
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,134
You should check her out.

167
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:06,468
She looks good.

168
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
How does Sandy Cohen
have such a loser for a kid?

169
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,468
Wait, Sandy Cohen?
You know where he is?

170
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,900
I think I heard he's
at a press conference over at the yacht club.

171
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,034
Press conference?

172
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:15,900
Press conference?

173
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:21,967
Oh, just... just
look at her.

174
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,967
Oh, I shouldn't be watching.

175
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,401
Why, bad luck
to see the bride?

176
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:38,834
Yeah, totally.

177
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,967
Oh, God.

178
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,034
You okay?

179
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,201
Oh!

180
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,667
MAN:
<i>So what are your plans</i>
<i>for the holidays?</i>

181
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,468
This holiday,I think my wife and I
are just going to take it easy.

182
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,834
Your wife?
I thought she
never rested.

183
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,734
True, she's
a very busy lady.

184
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,101
All right, Joe,
thanks very much.

185
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,334
Thanks for your
time, Mr. Mayor.

186
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,533
And thanks for
all your support.

187
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,633
As I always say,
I am mayor of the greatest
city on earth.

188
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,567
Vote Sandy Cohen!

189
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,600
You're the mayor?

190
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,201
Why, you want to call
for a recount?

191
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,101
Happy holidays.
Uh, Sandy, Sandy.

192
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,967
Something terrible is happening.

193
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:14,001
And if anyone can make it
make sense, it's you.

194
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,468
This guy bothering you,
Mr. Mayor?

195
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,633
Uh, no.

196
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,667
It's fine.
All right, kid,

197
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,867
slow down, tell me
what the problem is.

198
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:24,500
Okay. So, uh, I fell off
the roof this morning,

199
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,101
and ever since then
nobody recognizes me.

200
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,101
Even Kirsten threw me
out of the house.
You saw Kirsten?

201
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,734
And Seth doesn't know
who I am either.

202
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,267
And he's marrying Summer?

203
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,667
I see that you're
having some trouble
and I sympathize
with that.

204
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:40,967
But stalking me
and my family
is not the answer.

205
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:43,201
Come on, and don't make a fuss.

206
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,633
Oh, the poor kid.

207
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:55,533
What's the matter?

208
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,567
Can't find your boyfriend?

209
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:27,334
Kirsten.

210
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,468
What happened?

211
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,167
Taylor and Ryan,
they were hanging decorations,

212
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:33,267
and I guess the ladder fell.

213
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,700
What did the doctors say?

214
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,034
Well, they said apparently
there's no serious injury,

215
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:38,500
we just have to wait
for them to wake up.

216
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:51,267
Ryan?

217
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,934
Is that you?

218
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,134
Taylor.

219
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:55,667
You know me?
Oh, my God.

220
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,167
I found you.

221
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:04,801
We're in a parallel universe.

222
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,167
Exactly.
Okay.

223
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,500
And I'm so grateful
that if I have to be
in a parallel universe,

224
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,834
that you're here with me.

225
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,133
Oh, that's...
Of course
you probably wish

226
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,068
you were with someone you
actually wanted to date.

227
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,400
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?

228
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,601
Oh, even in a parallel
universe, she never stops.

229
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,734
But I mean, we could also
be asleep, right? Or dead?

230
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,068
Ow.
You're awake.

231
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,901
As for being dead,
I'm guessing if we were,

232
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:29,133
there would be some kind
of white light situation,

233
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,367
maybe a guy
with a beard.

234
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,200
Process of elimination,
parallel universe.

235
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,500
How do you know all this?

236
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,467
Oh, tenth grade I had
a little sci-fi phase.

237
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:37,400
Alt-universes are huge.
Clearly, you and I

238
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,200
have entered a world
where we don't exist.

239
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,534
But don't despair.
I know the way back
to the real world.

240
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,667
Yeah? Does it involve
me dating you?

241
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:46,867
Well, well, look who's
funny in alt-world.

242
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,334
I know.
No, Ryan,

243
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,267
we have been sent here
to fix something.

244
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,934
It's the only explanation.

245
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:55,100
Someone or some ones
we know are in trouble.

246
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,133
Summer?!

247
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,701
Hi!
Hi!

248
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,167
Kiss-kiss.

249
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:00,068
Oh, my God.

250
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,100
Let me see
the hardware.

251
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,801
What, you mean
this old thing?

252
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,567
(squeals):
Oh, my God!

253
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:05,767
Four carats.

254
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:06,867
Oh, my God, it's so pretty.

255
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,068
Can I get a...?

256
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,133
* Ice, ice... *

257
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,534
* Baby! *

258
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:12,400
(humming bass line
to "Ice, Ice, Baby")

259
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,534
* Ice, ice, baby *
Hey, babe.

260
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,567
Whoo!

261
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,767
Alt-Summer is
a mindless bimbo.

262
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,667
Get it started, Newport!

263
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:20,801
Whoo!

264
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,100
I'm so excited.

265
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,133
So where's the groom?

266
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,534
Oh, you know him,
he's parking.

267
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,734
He won't let any of
the valets touch his Hummer.

268
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:28,934
Right.
Because that's my job,
bitch.

269
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,434
Right!

270
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,367
Hey, Holly, looking ripped.

271
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:33,701
Hey, Chester.

272
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,834
What's up, Mrs. Me?
Mm-hmm, that's me.

273
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,534
Okay, wait a second. I thought
you said she was marrying Seth.

274
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,500
That's Che, or Chester,
I guess, in alt-reality.

275
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,133
What's he doing here?
I thought he goes to Brown.

276
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,400
Okay, what if three years ago
his family had planned to move here

277
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,667
but you did instead,
taking the last spot
at Harbor?

278
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:54,001
So without quality education for their child,
his family moves to Connecticut.

279
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,734
But in a world where
you don't exist,

280
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:58,467
the Harbor spot was open,
so his family moves here,

281
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:00,801
thereby allowing Che
to fulfill his alt-destiny

282
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,334
as a Newport bobble head.

283
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,667
Well, obviously this is what
we've been sent here to fix.

284
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:09,434
So, Summer, I saw the most rocked out
chairs at Bergdorf.
You have to come with me.

285
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,400
Ooh... baby.

286
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,734
Do you mind?

287
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,968
Um, no, I'll just
go get pumped.

288
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,068
But that's my job, bitch.

289
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:20,200
Oh, yeah, give it up.
Whoo!

290
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,767
Ooh...

291
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,133
(gasps):
Hey, bitch!

292
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,934
Okay, we need to get
started right away.

293
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,100
You go to Seth, find out
where it all went wrong.

294
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,133
I will follow Summer
and do some recon.

295
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,367
Uh, where do we meet?

296
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,500
It's alt-universe.

297
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,001
We'll just find
each other.

298
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:41,233
Their MRIs came back normal,

299
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,801
no brain damage,
no cause for alarm.

300
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,267
They'll wake up soon, I'm sure.

301
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:47,667
Is there anything
we can do to help?

302
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:48,867
Talk to them.

303
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:52,834
Make sure they're surrounded
by familiar voices,
music, even smells.

304
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,634
Anything that you think
might stimulate them.

305
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,834
Okay, thank you.

306
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:56,934
Thank you.

307
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,068
Well, somebody should
find Taylor's mom.

308
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,267
I guess I'll do that.

309
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:01,801
Ew, signing up for
the suicide mission.

310
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:04,434
Oh, my ham. I have to go home
and turn off the oven.

311
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,133
Seth and I will take
care of the ham.

312
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,867
In fact, she just said we should surround them
with familiar sounds and smells.

313
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:13,934
So I say we bring Chrismukkah
to the hospital.

314
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,400
KIRSTEN:
That's a great idea.

315
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:17,200
And I'll look after
Taylor and Ryan.

316
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:20,667
And you be careful
with my ham.

317
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,133
I'll be very careful.

318
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,233
We're still getting it checked
if it's real.

319
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:35,567
Uh, baby, this is business.
I've got to take this.

320
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:37,133
Okay.

321
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,701
Hey, baby.

322
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:43,500
Yeah.

323
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,467
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

324
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:46,667
I'll walk it.

325
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:51,601
You wearing that thong
I bought you?

326
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,834
Whoo-hoo.

327
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,467
Not for long.

328
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:56,701
All right, love you, too.
Bye.

329
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:04,634
Bye, baby.

330
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:22,367
Hello?

331
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:24,467
Hello?

332
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,200
Oh, it's you again.
Looking for Seth?

333
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,634
Uh, yeah, they told me at the
comic book store he came home.

334
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:29,801
Well, I haven't seen him yet.

335
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,068
You might want
to try him upstairs. Honey?

336
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,934
Could you bring
me my glass?

337
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:35,167
Here you go, sweetheart.

338
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,367
Oh, thank you.

339
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:38,233
Jimmy?

340
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,801
You know my husband?

341
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:42,233
I don't believe
we've actually met.

342
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:45,667
Oh, this is
a friend of Seth's.

343
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:48,034
Oh.
I know, it must be
a Christmas miracle.

344
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Well, you should come
to the party tonight.

345
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,934
All of Newport's
going to be there.

346
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:55,267
Well, they better be,
if they want to keep
doing business with
the Newport Group.

347
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,801
Seth!
JIMMY:
He's not home.

348
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,534
He's probably out
stalking Summer Roberts.

349
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,300
(Kirsten chuckles)
I'm going to go.

350
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,901
Well, you should stop by,
it starts around 7:00.

351
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,434
Interesting.

352
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,667
SANDY:
Oh, and "philanthropist"
means you help people.

353
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:21,500
Oh, well, you learn
something every day.

354
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,200
Listen, are you coming
home before the party?

355
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,734
You know how you sweat
through your shirts.

356
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,934
SANDY:
Can't we make some excuse?
Listen, honey,

357
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,834
as long as you're mayor
and she is head of
the Newport Group,

358
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,634
you're gonna have to
deal with each other.

359
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:34,601
Honestly, I don't know how
you were ever married
to that ice queen.

360
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:37,667
Well, we were different
people back then.

361
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,434
I'll be home
in a couple hours.

362
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,467
Bye.

363
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,400
Joinx!

364
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,801
(Chester barking)

365
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:23,968
(Julie squealing)

366
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,133
Double-O joinx.

367
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,500
Oh!

368
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,233
CHESTER (groans):
Oh, give it to me!

369
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,034
Oh! Daddy like!

370
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,233
Daddy like!

371
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,367
I'm a bad kitten!

372
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,200
Mima?

373
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,367
Hi.

374
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,767
No?

375
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,334
Yes, you don't know me.

376
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,167
Uh, I was just...

377
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,334
You come visit Missy Cooper?

378
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,367
Yes,

379
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,467
yes, that's
exactly what...

380
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,701
She come home 3:00.

381
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,334
Plane from Berkeley.

382
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,867
Triple-O joinx.

383
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,267
(laughing)

384
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,400
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, move over.

385
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,734
Taylor, why don't you
just sit over...?

386
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,034
Ryan, don't worry.

387
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,767
It doesn't mean we're
boyfriend and girlfriend.

388
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,801
I have huge news.
Yeah, well, me, too.

389
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,867
Sandy and Kirsten are divorced
and she and Jimmy are married.

390
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:35,801
Ew, yikes, that is huge.

391
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,233
I can beat it, though.

392
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,400
Sandy Cohen
is married to Julie.

393
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,734
What?
And she's having
an affair with Che.

394
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:43,467
Whoa.
Okay, all right,

395
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,867
so this means we need
to get Sandy and Kirsten
back together
and Seth...

396
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:48,534
Ryan, there's
something else.

397
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:49,734
Yeah, what else?
Um...

398
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,968
In this world, Marissa's alive.

399
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,034
I was in her room
and Mima said

400
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,068
her plane lands
at 3:00 from Berkeley.

401
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,767
Now it seems like everyone
is going to this party
at Kirsten's, so I think

402
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:08,534
that we can use
this opportunity
to reunite the Coopers
and the Cohens

403
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:10,434
with their
rightful partners.
Uh, Taylor,
can you let me out?

404
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,068
Why? Do you have to go
to the bathroom?
I haven't had to go.

405
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,100
It seems like it's not
an issue in an alt-world.

406
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,467
Taylor, seriously,
let me out.

407
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:18,934
Are you going to the airport?

408
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Ryan, she won't even know you.

409
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:24,167
It doesn't matter.

410
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,801
Even if Marissa is fine
in this world,

411
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,068
which, thank God she is,

412
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,834
we need to focus on
fixing what is broken.

413
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,867
Because that's
what's going to get us
back to the real world.

414
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,467
But if she's alive...

415
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:36,834
Then you don't want to go back?

416
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:43,267
Okay.

417
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,167
I get it.

418
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:47,434
You... you got to go.

419
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:56,968
Sorry.

420
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:09,100
I can't believe we have to drive
to Riverside in this.

421
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,534
Oh, no, honey,
I told you.

422
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:12,233
My family only drinks
wine coolers.

423
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,133
We're having a very
Britney Christmas, Mother.

424
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,001
Yes, watch out.
I might put you on my lap
while we drive
out there.

425
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:19,100
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

426
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,500
Ryan and Taylor
are in a coma,

427
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,634
but we're not
supposed to worry.

428
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:22,734
What are you talking about?

429
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,068
They fell off a ladder.

430
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,233
But the doctor says
they're fine.

431
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,667
We just have to wait
for them to wake up.

432
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:27,867
So it's a coma light?

433
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,267
Exactly. I have to find
Veronica Townsend.

434
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,434
Do you know where she is?

435
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,434
Taylor said she's
flying to Cabo tonight.

436
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,968
But she may have
already left.

437
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,634
I really don't
think that Veronica

438
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,534
is going to care if
Taylor's in a bogus coma.

439
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:39,334
Well, it doesn't matter.
Her daughter's in the hospital.

440
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,968
She needs to know.
Come on, I'll drive.

441
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:41,934
You don't have to.

442
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:43,233
Taylor is my
responsibility.

443
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,567
She's living in my house.
Come on.

444
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:45,734
So no Riverside?

445
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:46,834
Sweet.

446
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,334
I mean, I hate comas.

447
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,068
Let's go find Veronica.

448
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:58,901
Oh, Mrs. Cohen.

449
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:01,233
The EMT just came by.

450
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,734
He found this
in his ambulance.

451
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:04,400
Thought it might've fallen
out of your son's pocket.

452
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:06,834
Oh, thank you.

453
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,968
I've been talking to them
and reading to them
out loud.

454
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,434
I know the doctor
says not to worry...

455
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I know, it's hard.

456
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:14,801
But in these situations,

457
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,100
a lot depends
on the patients

458
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,867
healing themselves,
mentally and physically.

459
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:22,767
When they finish whatever
they need to finish,
they'll wake up.

460
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:25,567
Thanks.

461
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:01,300
Marissa?

462
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:04,634
Who are you?

463
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:07,167
Uh, I'm sorry.
I thought, uh...

464
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,434
What, you knew my sister?

465
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,968
I thought she was coming
home from Berkeley.

466
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:12,267
No, that's me.

467
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:14,034
The youngest in
my freshman class.

468
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,801
Sort of a prodigy.

469
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,867
Uh, what... what
did you mean "knew"?

470
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:22,968
She died three years ago.

471
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,267
What?

472
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:29,834
She OD'd in an alleyway
in Tijuana.

473
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:36,467
Well, that's really the way
I want to start
my Christmas vacation.

474
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:38,100
Wait, who are you again?

475
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,667
No one.

476
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,100
Oh, okay.
Well, Merry Christmas.

477
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,434
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:05,034
Ryan, you gave her
three more years.

479
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:06,901
She got to
fall in love.

480
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:07,967
She got to graduate.

481
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:09,433
And then she still died.

482
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,367
Which just means that you
weren't meant to save her.

483
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,834
So if there's
any part of you

484
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:14,967
that's still
blaming yourself

485
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:16,634
for what happened,
you have to let it go.

486
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,367
You've done so much
for everybody.

487
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,500
Yeah, like what?
Ryan, haven't you been
paying attention?

488
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,500
You saved the Cohens.

489
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,567
Without you, Seth is
the next unibomber,

490
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:26,600
Sandy is married
to Slutty McSlutterman,

491
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,300
and Kirsten probably
hasn't had an orgasm

492
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,834
in, like, a year.
Uh, all right,
all right.

493
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:31,734
And if you think that I'm just
gonna let you give up,

494
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,134
you're crazy.
Taylor, I said
all right.

495
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,500
Oh. Oh, good.

496
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,001
Okay.

497
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,433
Has anyone ever
said "no" to you?

498
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,134
Once.
And I pushed him off the roof.

499
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,333
Kidding.

500
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,634
Let's save the Cohens
and go home.

501
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,467
All right.
Okay.

502
00:23:48,534 --> 00:23:50,367
An alternate universe?

503
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,034
It's the only
obvious explanation.

504
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:54,433
"Obvious" might not be
the word I would use.

505
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,367
They both got knocked out
at the same time

506
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,500
and neither is waking up.
Like Dorothy in Oz.

507
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,667
And just like Dorothy
had to go see the wizard,

508
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,268
they've got some mission
to accomplish

509
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,667
before they can return.
Like what?

510
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,367
Uh, anything.

511
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,034
Could be like our world,
only messed up.

512
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:10,201
They've got to
reset the balance.

513
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:12,700
Or could be a world ruled by
giant vegetables,

514
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:15,667
and they've got to topple
the vegetable despot
before they can come back.

515
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:17,067
You had me till
vegetable despot.

516
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:18,168
It makes perfect sense.

517
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:22,867
Hello.

518
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:24,168
Sandy,

519
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:26,901
I think I know why Ryan
hasn't woken up.

520
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,901
Hi.

521
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:38,001
Okay, now before we can reunite everyone
with their rightful partners,

522
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,268
we need to
prep them first.

523
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,567
So I will take Kirsten
duty and you can...

524
00:24:41,634 --> 00:24:43,234
Ooh.

525
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,001
I already told you, I'm not
going to your stupid party.

526
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,734
Because Summer Roberts
is going to be here?

527
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,534
Since when are you
avoiding her?

528
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,234
Since she got engaged
to that burly ding-dong.

529
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,067
You have fun.

530
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:54,134
I'm on it.

531
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:01,700
Taylor, what
are you doing?

532
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,234
I told you not
to wear that suit.

533
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,867
Your ass looks like
the back of a truck.

534
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,034
Oh, my God.

535
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:07,700
In alt-world, I'm a boy.

536
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,101
Maybe I should try Pilates.

537
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:11,101
They say it elongates you.
Outside.

538
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,101
Go stand against the wall.
Go, come on.

539
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:16,234
And my mom is still a bitch.

540
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,268
Veronica.

541
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,333
Veronica.

542
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,867
Thank God,
we caught you.

543
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,600
Oh, Julie, please don't tell me
you're going to Cabo, too.

544
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:34,700
Veronica, you can't
go to Mexico.

545
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,268
Taylor is in the hospital.

546
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,101
Anorexia?

547
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,567
No, she fell off a ladder.

548
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:41,001
Oh.
The doctor says
she'll be fine,

549
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:42,001
but she's not waking up.

550
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,268
Maybe if she
heard your voice.

551
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,400
Summer has a car
outside...

552
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:45,500
I'll call from Cabo.

553
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:46,967
Veronica, listen.

554
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,734
I know you're not
the warm and fuzzy type.

555
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,400
But it is Christmas Eve

556
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,667
and it would mean so much
if you could be there.

557
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,101
And if you get on
that plane right now,

558
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:58,467
I'll tell security
you have a bomb.

559
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:03,400
Wow, very
Jack Bauer of you.

560
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:05,667
All right.

561
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:07,400
All right, come on,
put this on.

562
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,168
No, hate my life!

563
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,700
I hate my life...!

564
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:12,934
I hate my life!

565
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:14,433
Yeah, no wonder Summer
doesn't like you.

566
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,300
See?!
Even you think so.

567
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,234
And no offense,
but it's kind of weird,

568
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
you having such a vested
interest in my love life,

569
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:21,834
considering I just met you
this morning.

570
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:23,433
All right.

571
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,201
You want the truth?

572
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:25,600
Huh?

573
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,634
Huh?

574
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,268
I know the truth.

575
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,967
You know the truth?
Yeah.

576
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:33,467
I'm from an alternate universe
where your dad adopted me

577
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,300
and you and Summer are in love.

578
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:37,467
And unless I fix
things here,

579
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:39,567
which means
getting your parents

580
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,300
and you and Summer
together,

581
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:42,801
I can't go home.

582
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,467
I always knew this would happen.

583
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:50,433
Doesn't surprise me.

584
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,034
Put this on.
Okay.

585
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:54,600
Now, I'm going
to tell you exactly
what you need to know
to woo Summer.

586
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,168
Have you ever heard of
a show called <i>The Valley?</i>

587
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,134
Hey.

588
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,001
It's a great party, huh?
Yes.

589
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:08,168
I'm so glad that the mayor
let me off so that I could come.

590
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:09,367
You work for the mayor?

591
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:10,667
Mm-hmm.

592
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:13,001
How... well,
what's that like?

593
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:17,667
Honestly, it's amazing that
anything ever gets done.

594
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:20,101
What with the mayor moping
and crying all day

595
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:22,001
about how he's still in love
with his ex-wife.

596
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:24,500
But I probably shouldn't be
airing his dirty laundry.

597
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:27,867
I mean, she must be around here
somewhere, right?

598
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,534
Well, I better mingle.
Ta.

599
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:39,134
Good, you got
a jacket from Seth.
Yeah.

600
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:41,467
Did it go okay?
Great. He's going over
stalking points right now.

601
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:45,001
Well, I am doing some serious
Jedi mind tricks on Kirsten.

602
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,967
(Chester barking)

603
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,034
RYAN:
There's couple number two.

604
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:52,101
Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas.

605
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:54,134
Oh!
That's my man.

606
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:57,067
Okay, so what we need to do
is get Kirsten and Sandy

607
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,234
and Seth and Summer alone
together for ten minutes.

608
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Which means removing
the obstacles.

609
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:02,934
You take Julie,
I've got Chester.

610
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,600
Hey, wouldn't this
actually be fun,

611
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,400
you know, if you were actually
doing it with somebody

612
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,500
who you wanted to date?

613
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:08,667
Go.

614
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:09,867
Okay, I'll stop.

615
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Hi.

616
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,001
Good grub.

617
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,667
Yeah.
So, listen,

618
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,734
a red-haired lady wanted
me to give you a message.

619
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:27,734
She's in
the master bathroom

620
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:31,634
and she needs help
with something.

621
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,300
A little thong removification.

622
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,333
Charming.

623
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,333
Well, uh, she's waiting.

624
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,867
Hey, I have a good idea.

625
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:41,667
Hmm?

626
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:44,967
Why don't you come with?

627
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:48,600
Wow, really tempting.
Um, I'm going to pass.

628
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:53,600
Ew.

629
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:54,967
Good to see you again.

630
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,333
Thanks for coming.

631
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,567
Hi.

632
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:00,901
Hello.

633
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:01,901
Hi.

634
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:03,201
Do I know you?

635
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:06,700
There's some guy
who wants to meet you
in the master bathroom.

636
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:10,234
Something about
getting a thong on?

637
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,667
Oh.

638
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,001
That's charity talk.

639
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:18,700
"Thong" is an acronym for
The Homeless of Newport...

640
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:22,767
Go... or something.

641
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,001
Excuse me.

642
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,834
Just do me a favor,
and don't get caught.

643
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,300
Mr. Mayor.
Yes?

644
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:36,234
Hi, I was wondering,
do you have time for
a quick question?

645
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,667
I'm hoping it's about
the new hospital.

646
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,634
Because Dr. Henry Griffin
and I have some big plans.

647
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,467
Actually, it's about
relationships.

648
00:29:41,534 --> 00:29:43,333
You see, you and I are kind
of in the same position,

649
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,700
because I just broke
up with this guy,

650
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,634
and he refuses
to move on.

651
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,801
I'm not sure how
this applies to me.

652
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,168
Mr. Mayor, come on.

653
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,934
I mean, your ex-wife will
tell anyone who listens

654
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:52,734
about how much she's
still in love with you.

655
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:53,967
I work at
the Newport Group.

656
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:55,967
And it is amazing that
anything ever gets done.

657
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:57,201
Young lady, I don't know you.

658
00:29:57,268 --> 00:29:58,300
But I do know

659
00:29:58,367 --> 00:29:59,834
that this is not
an appropriate conversation.

660
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,268
So please excuse me.

661
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,268
Uh, mail truck.

662
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:07,901
What?

663
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,700
Uh, yeah, um...

664
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,001
from the old days at Berkeley,

665
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:13,734
when you guys
first fell in love.

666
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,300
She won't shut up
about it.

667
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,534
Mail truck, mail truck,
mail truck.

668
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,201
It's just crazy, huh?
Bye.

669
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,500
SUMMER:
<i>So, wait,</i>

670
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,567
you're saying that you ride
horses in the valley?

671
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:32,600
No, no, I like plastic horses
and the show <i>The Valley.</i>

672
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,734
Hey, I like that show, too,

673
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,667
and plastic horses.
What's yours' name?

674
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,867
Uh, Princess Sparkle.

675
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:41,067
Wait, no, no,
I mean Captain Oats.

676
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,500
I just said
"Princess Sparkle,"

677
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:43,834
'cause I think that's
a really cool name.

678
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:46,300
No way!

679
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,300
You are not going
to believe this.

680
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:51,867
How's it going?

681
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,600
Well, I read lips,

682
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,201
and in the past
two minutes, the words

683
00:30:55,268 --> 00:30:57,700
"mail truck"
have come up nine times.

684
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,801
We might actually
pull this off.
Mm-hmm.

685
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:01,433
VERONICA:
Lots of teenage boys get lipo.

686
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,600
It's no big deal.

687
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,767
And stop picking
at your man girdle.

688
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,234
But, Mom?
What?

689
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,500
You have
something to say?

690
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,567
No.

691
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,834
You know what?

692
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:15,067
I think it's time
I talk to her as an adult.

693
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:22,767
Okay, you can do this.

694
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,901
Do what? Eat?

695
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,067
Well,
that's apparent.

696
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,201
Shut up.

697
00:31:28,268 --> 00:31:30,268
Why do you have to be so mean?

698
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,101
Neither he nor I
are remotely fat.

699
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:35,567
We are smart and attractive,

700
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:37,834
and interesting
and people like us.

701
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:40,467
And we are not going to let you

702
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:42,467
make us feel bad
about ourselves anymore.

703
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,734
No?

704
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,600
Well, I imagine the mirror
does that for you.

705
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,934
You bitch!

706
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,168
Oh, my God.

707
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,433
You all right?

708
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,734
I just can't believe
I just said that.

709
00:31:57,801 --> 00:31:59,734
I mean, I've been
waiting for so long.

710
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,867
I can't believe
I finally did it.

711
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:03,168
I'm proud of you.

712
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:05,934
Thanks, Ryan, I...

713
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,567
Whoa.

714
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,667
What is it?
What's wrong?

715
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:11,234
I don't know,
I ju...

716
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,433
Do you hear something?

717
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,433
Almost like rain?

718
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,500
Stay here, I'll get you
a glass of water.

719
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,234
Okay.

720
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:23,300
JIMMY:
In my own house?

721
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:25,168
In my own bathroom?

722
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,600
I have to brush
my teeth in there.

723
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,834
So do I, but I don't
use a toothbrush.

724
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:30,567
(laughs):
Yeah, dawg.

725
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:33,268
Oh, Julie, you haven't
changed a bit.

726
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,168
Maybe you should learn to knock.
What's going on in here?

727
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,634
Well, Mr. Mayor,

728
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,467
let me just tell you what
I found your wife doing.

729
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:39,500
Jimmy, don't.

730
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:40,333
Whoo...

731
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,367
Well, suffice to say,

732
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:43,534
her thong was

733
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,700
in his mouth.

734
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,400
Shut up!

735
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,934
Baby, it was stuck. I was only
trying to help her out.

736
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,734
Oh, but that's what you said
with Holly.

737
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:55,234
How come all these women
around you

738
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,767
keep getting their thongs stuck?

739
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:58,201
I'm starting to get suspicious.

740
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:04,700
Geek, move it or lose it.

741
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:08,201
Then I will lose it,
whatever it... is.

742
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:09,268
Mm-hmm.

743
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,300
All right, well,
it's your funeral.

744
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,333
All right.

745
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,134
(whispers):
Oh, snap.

746
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:18,667
Thong emergency.

747
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:19,734
(growls)

748
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:23,268
That was, like, so brave.

749
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,700
Oh, Julie, how
could you do this?

750
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:26,767
Please, Sandy,

751
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,433
we both know
our marriage is a sham.

752
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,034
JULIE:
You only married me
so I could mastermind
your political career.

753
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:33,001
What are you doing with Miss
Queen of the North over here?

754
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:34,300
Don't you know?

755
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:38,567
He spends all day crying
about me at the office.

756
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:39,367
What are you
talking about?

757
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:41,234
Everybody knows, Sandy.

758
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,700
In the same way that everybody
knows how you go on and on

759
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:46,067
about the mail truck?

760
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:48,001
I never told anybody
about the mail truck.

761
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,034
Well, not according
to her.

762
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:53,101
Well, she's the girl that told
me you spend all day crying.

763
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,500
Uh-oh.

764
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,101
Sorry.

765
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:02,400
Apparently, people don't stock
clean glasses in the alt-world.

766
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,901
What's up?

767
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:07,367
Oh, it's the street urchin.

768
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,700
I knew not to trust him.

769
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,234
I think you two
better start talking.

770
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,934
Absolutely.
Taylor?

771
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,734
Oh, don't worry.
I know exactly what to say.

772
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:16,433
Okay, people,

773
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,667
I can explain everything.

774
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:18,400
(startled gasp)

775
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,300
Sorry.

776
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:21,400
What?

777
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,101
TAYLOR:
Just feel a little dizzy.

778
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:24,234
I...

779
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,801
Oh, no.

780
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,634
Ryan, I think I have to go.

781
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,901
What?
What do you mean?

782
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,901
It must be because I stood up
to my mom.

783
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,567
That's what I was here to do.

784
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:34,134
Ryan?
Yeah?

785
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:35,667
You have to get everyone
together.
No.

786
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:36,934
It's the only way back.

787
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:38,834
RYAN:
Taylor, no,
I can't.

788
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:40,067
Taylor...

789
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:41,500
What?
Huh?

790
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:42,734
Just hold on.

791
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:49,367
Taylor?

792
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:01,134
Taylor, honey?

793
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:04,268
You need to be with Sandy Cohen.

794
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,600
I'm going to get the doctor.

795
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:17,433
SANDY:
So?

796
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,433
Are you going to explain
yourself?

797
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:23,201
The truth is,

798
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:26,600
things the way they are now
are completely wrong.

799
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,600
SUMMER:
Who's this random guy
we're all listening to?

800
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:29,901
And why am I not drunk yet?

801
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:31,268
Okay, look, none of you know me.

802
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,433
But, uh, the truth is
that each of you saved my life

803
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,801
just by being who you are.

804
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,600
And right now none of you
are who you are.

805
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:42,101
Like Summer, for example.
What are you doing?

806
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:43,734
What?

807
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:46,034
I mean, Che, Chester, he's, he's
completely wrong for you.

808
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:47,101
You should be with Seth.

809
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,433
Kirsten, all right, you don't
want to run the Newport Group.

810
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,600
That place makes you miserable.

811
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,134
And you may like your
Chardonnay, but

812
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:58,234
I got news for you, it doesn't
like you back, and Sandy,

813
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,667
you don't want
to be mayor.

814
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,967
You're all about saving the
little guy, not holing up

815
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,367
in some mansion,
giving orders.

816
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,467
What you two are best at is
being married to each other.

817
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:14,700
There he is.

818
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:15,834
Get him out
of here.

819
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:18,700
Um, okay,
before I go,

820
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:22,268
Sandy, Kirsten, Seth and Summer,
promise me you'll be together.

821
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:26,700
KIRSTEN:
Hey, Veronica, good news.

822
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,667
Taylor's awake, and the doctor
said she's going to be fine.

823
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,534
I stay home from Cabo
and she's fine?

824
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,367
Hi, Mom.

825
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:34,867
And you're walking even?

826
00:36:34,934 --> 00:36:36,400
Geez.
Veronica, your daughter is okay.

827
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,034
You should be happy.

828
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:40,534
Oh, Julie, it's okay, I got it.
Mom, why don't you go to

829
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,934
the airport? I bet you could
catch the last flight to Cabo.

830
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,600
Well, I guess
I could still make it,

831
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,634
but I'll probably
have to fly coach.

832
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,801
Merry Christmas, Mom.

833
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,034
Yeah.

834
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:05,300
You okay?

835
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:06,867
Yeah.

836
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:10,500
I don't know why,
but I feel just fine.

837
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,001
Huh.

838
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:21,367
Julie?

839
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:24,001
Hmm?

840
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:26,201
You should see this.

841
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:28,667
I haven't read it.

842
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:31,001
Oh, my God.

843
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,934
You, uh, you seen my hat?

844
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,234
You threw
up in it.

845
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,500
Right.

846
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,734
Atwood, there's someone here

847
00:37:57,801 --> 00:37:59,067
to bail you out.

848
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,333
(weary sigh)

849
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,567
Thanks.

850
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:14,867
I don't know who you are,

851
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:18,067
but a lot of what you said
back at the house made sense.

852
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:21,534
So why do you care so much
about getting a bunch of
strangers back together?

853
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,201
Well, I guess I thought
it would get me back home, too.

854
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,101
But I was wrong.
Can I ask what happened?

855
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,433
How'd your family fall apart?

856
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,268
Hmm.

857
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,767
I think it all goes
back to when Marissa Cooper

858
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,101
died three years ago.

859
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:40,001
She was Jimmy and
Julie Cooper's daughter.

860
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,001
I knew Marissa.

861
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,400
Well, after she died,

862
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:45,067
it was like
everybody got stuck.

863
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,901
Didn't know how to say good-bye?

864
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:51,767
Maybe you're right.

865
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:52,867
What are you doing
for dinner?

866
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:56,433
How about you come
over to the house?

867
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,433
There's someplace
I gotta go. Thanks.

868
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,101
You're welcome.

869
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:04,034
Oh, I was just
calling you.

870
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:05,834
Julie, Summer
and Kaitlin
are with Taylor.

871
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:06,801
She's awake.
Oh.

872
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:07,834
What'd you find out?

873
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:09,433
This.

874
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,700
It's from Marissa.

875
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,867
She sent it to Ryan
the day she was leaving.

876
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,333
I guess it got lost
in the mail.

877
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,433
Oh, that's odd.

878
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,101
Well, it's Chrismukkah;
stranger things have happened.

879
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,300
What's it say?

880
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:22,168
Well, that she had
to leave Newport.

881
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,600
That it was the only way they
could get on with their lives.

882
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,967
She loved him,
but she had to say good-bye.

883
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,667
Is that food?

884
00:39:32,734 --> 00:39:36,001
Oh, thank God.

885
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:39,201
Between you and me,
Taylor in a coma

886
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:41,268
is kind of a nice break.

887
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,467
How you doing, Julie?

888
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:48,168
I'm okay. Thanks.

889
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:46,901
(sighs)

890
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,934
Ryan, are you awake?

891
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:53,700
(sighs)

892
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:55,268
Hi.

893
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,067
Hi.

894
00:41:58,134 --> 00:42:01,667
I just had the weirdest dream.

895
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:04,168
You were in it, I think.

896
00:42:04,234 --> 00:42:05,300
That's so funny.

897
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:06,934
I think you were in my dream,
too.

898
00:42:08,268 --> 00:42:10,001
I can't remember what it was,
though.

899
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:11,700
Huh. Me, either.

900
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:18,967
I'm really glad you're here.

901
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,101
Look, the rain stopped.

902
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,534
Hey!

903
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,333
Look who's back in the land
of the living.

904
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,300
Oh, Ryan, we were
so worried about you.

905
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:34,867
(Ryan sighs)

906
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:36,333
Everything is going to be okay.

907
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,700
Yeah, I know.

908
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:58,534
