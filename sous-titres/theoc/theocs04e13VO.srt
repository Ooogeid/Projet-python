1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
O.C

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,434
I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,067
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:05,733
That's what I said.
I want to see Ryan.

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,568
It's too soon.
I worked so hard...

6
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:08,833
Not for you, for me.

7
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,334
She is the girl for me.

8
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:11,800
You're going to ask her
to marry you?

9
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:13,634
Julie...
KAITLIN:
<i>Are you cheating on Bullit?</i>

10
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,601
No!
Will you marry me?

11
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:16,467
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,467
Really?

13
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:27,100
Nothing?

14
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:29,201
It may not sound
like a good idea.
It's not a good idea.

15
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:31,100
We're dating. We just
got back together, in fact,

16
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,034
and you're proposing that for
Valentine's Day we do nothing.

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,167
No, no.

18
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:36,568
We don't have
to spend the night apart.

19
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:37,568
We could just hang out.

20
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:38,568
Uh, see a movie.

21
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:39,934
Oh, God, stop.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,301
My head is spinning
from all of the romance.

23
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:45,201
Taylor,this holiday, us,
it's a recipe for disaster.

24
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:46,601
Why? 'Cause I'm needy?

25
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,234
'Cause I've on occasion
been known to stalk you?

26
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,267
There's me, too.

27
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:50,833
I'm distant
and unemotional.

28
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,833
And preoccupied.

29
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,100
Could we add that to the list?

30
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:57,000
'Cause it just seems
like lately your mind is
someplace else.

31
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,601
Taylor.

32
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:01,334
(sighs)
There's no hidden
meaning here.

33
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,034
I just feel if we don't
put too much pressure

34
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,568
on this holiday, we might
actually get through it.

35
00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:05,967
So I shouldn't worry?
No.

36
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,900
Not even when I find a suspicious address
by your bed?

37
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,501
I looked at it when you were
in the bathroom.

38
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:12,467
Sorry.
It's nothing.

39
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:15,833
It's an address.Not the address
of some other girl if that's what
you're thinking.

40
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,000
Look, um, I got
to get to work,

41
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:23,167
but I promise you there's
nothing to worry about, okay?

42
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:24,501
Okay.
All right.

43
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,501
So we're good?
Yeah, we're good.

44
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:27,833
All right.

45
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:49,367
Oh.

46
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:51,167
Taylor, right?

47
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:54,000
So it's you.

52
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:31,601
Ryan hasn't been
to see you at all?

53
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:35,034
Well, I left a message with him
when I,when I switched hotels.

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,200
I told him I was here
in case he wanted to see me,

55
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,867
but so far,no luck.

56
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:44,567
Taylor, don't mind me asking...
what are you doing here?

57
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:46,901
Well, I found this
address by Ryan's bed

58
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:49,634
and he's been kind of distant lately,
so I thought it may be a clue.

59
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:52,100
So I came here and then I...

60
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,767
I have emotional problems,
but I'm getting over it.

61
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:57,367
Well, I'm glad Ryan at least
kept my address,

62
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:59,068
since, you know,
he's not using it.

63
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,467
Well, clearly he wants
to reach out.

64
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:03,434
Maybe he's just afraid
or he doesn't really
know how to do it.

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,434
Because, you know, I'd love
to talk to him, you know?

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,100
Apologize again for that
cancer stunt.

67
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,001
But I'm scared if
I make the first move...

68
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:12,934
He's going to pull away.
Yes, you're absolutely right.

69
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,968
I've had a lot of experience
with that.

70
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,267
Wait a sec.

71
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:17,500
Idea coming in.

72
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,400
And here it is, okay.

73
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,133
What if I were to get involved?

74
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,701
I could help you guys
smooth things over,
broker the
peace talks...

75
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,167
You-you'd be willing to do that,
get in the line of fire?

76
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:31,701
It's just that there's something
kind of, kind of sad about Ryan.

77
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:35,701
Maybe if he was to mend
his relationship with you,
he could be a little happier.

78
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,133
Well, I am all for it.

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,834
Do you have a plan in mind?

80
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:41,100
Always.

81
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:54,400
Wow, is this a second breakfast
or an early lunch?
It's either one.

82
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,300
I was craving French toast,
do you want some?

83
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,100
No, thanks.

84
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,467
I'm having flashbacks to when
you were pregnant with Seth.

85
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:03,601
I know, and all I did was eat
peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches.

86
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:06,068
I made some of my finest
sandwiches in that year.

87
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,001
Mm-hmm. I haven't had
peanut butter and jelly since.

88
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,367
I can't believe
we're doing this again.

89
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,200
All the times we tried
to have another one
after Seth.

90
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,233
Well, we did have a second one,
it just came later in life.

91
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,634
Ah, the more the merrier.

92
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,200
Oh, I just lost my appetite.

93
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:25,233
I thought you were starving.

94
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,634
Cravings, up and down
like a roller coaster.

95
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,667
I'm going to get dressed.

96
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,500
Gordon, it's not
Valentine's Day yet.

97
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,400
I don't care, you're my wife,

98
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,434
and I'll give you roses
anytime I dang well please.

99
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,367
Right. Well, these
are certainly beautiful,
but um, I think
I need to remind you...

100
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:44,834
Oh, I know.

101
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:47,734
You haven't given me the green
light on that marriage proposal.

102
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:51,367
But I didn't make $900 million
by being a pessimist.

103
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,901
Did I mention that there
will be no pre-nup?

104
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,233
Well... That is
so generous.

105
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,667
But before we get on with
the rest of our lives...

106
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,667
Right, Valentine's Day,

107
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,500
and I made reservations at the
yacht club as per your request.

108
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,534
And I did take the liberty
of booking us,

109
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:10,267
that's you and me,
a suite at the Four Seasons.

110
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:14,233
I mean, here we are,
practically man and wife
and we still haven't
sealed the deal.

111
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,068
I guess I'm just old-fashioned
that way.

112
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,767
Well, if I do say so myself,
you're in for quite a treat.

113
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,034
Can we just not
talk about it?

114
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,834
Well, I can sum it up
in one word.

115
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:24,867
Don't.
Bang.

116
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,034
Yeah.
(both chuckle)

117
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,267
Oh, sorry, gorgeous.

118
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,767
I'm just a sucker
for that pun.

119
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,267
But seriously now.

120
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,001
I can't wait to take you
down to Chinatown.

121
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,634
Right.

122
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,100
Me, too.

123
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,767
Kaitlin, baby, hi.

124
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:40,934
Hi.

125
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,034
What's up, nerd?

126
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,901
Wow, who you calling
nerd, bird legs?

127
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,001
You, nerd.

128
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:47,734
Okay, squirt, you up
for some ping-pong?

129
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:48,801
You ready to get
your ass kicked?

130
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:49,701
In your dreams.

131
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,233
You two play ping-pong?

132
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Oh, yeah. We got a table
at the office and Peanut is
getting pretty good.

133
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,934
You think that's lame?

134
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:59,434
No, it's, it's...

135
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,233
It's like totally normal.

136
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:06,100
Mom, it's just ping-pong.

137
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,267
There's no reason to get
emotional about it.

138
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,434
Can I drive the Ferrari?

139
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,167
No.

140
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,500
Oh, what the hell?

141
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,467
Get her purring,
I'll be there in a second.

142
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,934
You're really good with her,
you know that?

143
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,200
Well, she's like her mom.

144
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:25,634
She's a special gal
and a real kick in the pants.

145
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,434
Bye, sweetie.

146
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,233
If the sea otters
disappear completely,

147
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,068
then the entire aquatic
ecosystem will be disrupted.

148
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,701
I know. We need the sea otters
to eat the sea urchins,

149
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:49,968
otherwise there'd be a sea
urchin population explosion,
causing some
catastrophe

150
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,034
involving the kelp forests.

151
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,667
I guess you're pretty sick
of me talking about otters.
Not at all.

152
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:57,300
If I have to share you, I'm glad
it can be with otters.

153
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,300
Well, did you know that
my Web site got over
8,000 hits yesterday?

154
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:04,334
And I'm going to have a video
conference with someone from
Greenpeace maybe next week.

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,934
Wow, I hope you can squeeze
me in for Valentine's Day.

156
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:08,233
Valentine's Day?

157
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,001
Yeah, it's in two days.

158
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:12,133
You forgot, didn't you?
No, of course not.

159
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
Here's a psychic, come on.

160
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,400
Do we have to?
Yes.

161
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,500
Rhode Island.
Not bad.

162
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,400
You'll go there
next year to study art.

163
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,968
You'll do well.

164
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,767
Huh. You're really
good, psychic lady. Do me.

165
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,867
Strong vibration from you, Miss.

166
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:37,334
Listen, you must
beware of falling objects.

167
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,934
Falling objects?

168
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:43,267
And you're going to
appear in the news
with Justin Timberlake.

169
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:46,968
Oh, good, okay, thank you
for your time.

170
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,300
Wait.
This is important.

171
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:53,934
I see the great love
of your life.
Me, too.

172
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,233
The name is
coming to me.
I see it.

173
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,667
Let me give you
a little help. Seth.

174
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:01,001
No.
Seth.

175
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:03,267
No.
It's George.

176
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,100
George?
George?

177
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:06,467
There's a lot of heat
surrounding this name.

178
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:08,400
You're leaving me for
a guy named George?
No.

179
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:13,267
She certainly is.
Your destiny
is with this George.

180
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,834
Okay, um, Seth why don't you
go get me some ice cream?

181
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,167
Okay. All right, listen,
psychic lady.

182
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,300
My boyfriend,
his name is Seth
and if anyone's my destiny,

183
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,968
it's him, so will you please
stop it
with all this
George stuff?

184
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:33,734
Sorry, Summer.

185
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,434
He did it.
No, you did it.

186
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,167
No, I didn't, you did.
You did.

187
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:40,233
What was that?
Destiny?

188
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,601
So this has nothing to do
with Valentine's Day?

189
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:46,834
No, why would you
think that?

190
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,534
Hmm, I don't know, you, me,
romantic dinner,

191
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,968
you have some sort
of surprise.

192
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:54,467
Hi, Ryan.
Hey.

193
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,500
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

194
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,767
Would you excuse us?
No problem.

195
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,267
Thanks.

196
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:03,968
At least it wasn't
a romantic surprise.

197
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,001
The note by my bed.

198
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,167
Yeah, I found it, I went
there and I found your dad.

199
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:12,400
And I don't know, I thought
maybe you were
trying to reconnect
with him.

200
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:15,500
Taylor, it's my business.
I know, I'm a meddler.

201
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,601
But don't worry, once
I lick my stalking addiction,that's next on the list.

202
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,334
But admit it, you can't tell me
you haven't been thinking about
him, right?

203
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:26,434
Ryan, come on,
it's just dinner.
Yeah, what are we going to talk about?

204
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,334
I've never met an awkward
silence that I couldn't fill.

205
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,267
Consider it your
Valentine's gift to me.
Oh, not that we're celebrating.

206
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,034
Yeah, I knew I was going
to pay for that.
Ryan, he's your dad.

207
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,133
Yeah, yeah, one dinner.

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,400
Okay.

209
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,734
RYAN:
Join us.

210
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,300
She gets her way, doesn't she?

211
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:54,001
The woman's a bulldozer.

212
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,500
So famous couples
through time?

213
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:11,367
Yeah, you know, Romeo and Juliet,
Fred and Wilma,
Sandy and Kirsten Cohen.

214
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:13,400
Do you think that's a good
idea for a collage?

215
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,167
Seth's going to love it.

216
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:17,300
And I'm very flattered that
Sandy and I made the cut.

217
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,567
Oh.
Whoa.

218
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:22,367
I have not looked at these
for a long time.

219
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:24,901
Gosh, check out
that permage.

220
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:26,601
<i>Top Gun</i> had just come out.

221
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,701
I wasn't thinking clearly.
I guess not.

222
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32,567
(gasps):
Is that you
and Jimmy Cooper?
Holy guac.

223
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:35,567
Yeah, that's us at
a sweatshirt party.

224
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:38,400
And here we are at the prom.

225
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:41,534
Oh,
Seth and I have
the same picture.

226
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,701
Did you ever think
that Jimmy was the one?

227
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,901
Well, we had planned
our lives together.

228
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:55,567
He was going to work
for my father
and I was going to throw
fabulous dinner parties.

229
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:01,400
We even had names for our kids.

230
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,167
Then you broke up.

231
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,334
We grew up.

232
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,100
I loved Jimmy a lot
when I was your age.

233
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:18,267
But I changed.
So will you.

234
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:21,434
When you met Sandy how did you
know that he was the one?

235
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,068
I'd never imagined myself
with someone like Sandy.

236
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:32,901
But it just felt right.

237
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,667
Summer...

238
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:41,133
If you're meant to be with
Seth, it'll happen.

239
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,100
You just have
to be patient.
I'm not very good at that.

240
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,100
No one is.

241
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:50,367
FRANK:
So, nothing? Really?

242
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:53,701
No. Frank, Ryan thinks
it would be better
for our relationship

243
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,801
if we didn't celebrate
Valentine's Day at all.

244
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,133
It's counterintuitive,
I know.

245
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,901
How's that plan
working out for you?

246
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,167
Not great.

247
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,801
So Frank, how about you?
Speaking of romance...

248
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,734
you're single,
you're ruggedly handsome.

249
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,167
Did you start up any romances
with ladies in Newport?

250
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,233
Well, no. You know, not really.

251
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,233
Oh, my God, Frank,
you're in love.

252
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,300
Love? I am not.

253
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:20,367
Yes, you are.
It's all over your face.
Your lips are quivering,

254
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:22,701
your cheeks are rosy.
Yeah, your cheeks
are kind of red.

255
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,001
BULLIT:
Well, what the hell?

256
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,001
Frank Atwood,
how are you, bud?
I'm good, how are you, Bullit?

257
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:28,667
Uh, confused, that's how.

258
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:31,667
I thought when you quit
the Bullit business
you were going to high tail
it up to Reno.

259
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,467
Yeah, well, I just
stayed a little longer.

260
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:35,500
I wanted to spend
some time with my son.

261
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,367
This is your son?

262
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:39,500
Yeah.
Well, well, that's great.

263
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,701
Oh... here comes
the little lady.

264
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:45,068
Every ten seconds
she's in the john
painting her face,
not that I'm complaining.

265
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,001
A number that hot,
I don't ask questions.

266
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:49,934
Hey, Taylor, Ryan.
Hi.

267
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,001
Frank.

268
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,567
Julie.

269
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:57,867
I thought you were leaving town.

270
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,400
I was... am.

271
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:00,467
Am!
(stammers)

272
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:01,567
I'll be gone soon enough.

273
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,934
BULLIT:
Oh, Frank is
third-wheeling
on a date
with his son.

274
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:07,634
Well, we should get
to our table. I am starving.
BULLIT:
Yeah, and this
one can eat.

275
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,834
And if you ask me, it goes
to all the right places.

276
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:13,734
Gordon, please.
Well, enjoy your dinner.

277
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:15,233
Good-bye, Frank.

278
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,734
BULLIT:
Uh, later.

279
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,534
So should we get that check?

280
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:28,001
Oh, my God, Frank.
Yeah.

281
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:31,300
What?
Are you in love
with Julie Cooper?

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,167
--r dad
and Julie Cooper.

283
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,401
It's just so...

284
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,000
Incestuous, inappropriate.

285
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,768
Well, look at you being
all hyper articulate.

286
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,833
No, I was going
to say it's romantic.

287
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,067
How is it romantic?

288
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:49,434
It's over, she's
with somebody else.

289
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:50,634
Who she doesn't really love.

290
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,900
Well, maybe she
shouldn't marry Bullit--
doesn't mean she should
be with my dad.

291
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,000
What if they're meant
for each other?

292
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,800
If we could at least help
them get together,
then they could
have a chance.

293
00:13:56,867 --> 00:14:00,501
Taylor, I remember
what he was like,
how he treated my mom and us.

294
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,100
Ryan. You have customers.

295
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,200
<i>Hola,</i> Luis.
Hey, Taylor.

296
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:06,867
I'll be right there.

297
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:10,000
I know Julie
isn't perfect,
but I also know my dad.

298
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,200
She deserves better.
Exactly.

299
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:45,067
Say, "Go Trojans."
BOTH:
Go Trojans!

300
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,634
Oh, so cute you guys are
going to college together.

301
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:51,200
Oh, Taryn, we wish you
were coming, too.

302
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,501
Aw, well, you know, my dad can't
just make a phone call
and get me into USC.

303
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,668
Oh, well,
<i>c'est la vie.</i>

304
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't listen to her.

305
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:04,167
Sometimes I feel like
I'm going to be listening
to her snide comments
for the rest of my life.

306
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:07,234
Next year at this time,
we're going to have
a whole new life.

307
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:08,567
Without my dad.

308
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:12,267
Without Taryn,
just us... always.

309
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:15,100
SANDY:
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

310
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:18,100
Reservation for tomorrow night
at 7:00, is that okay?

311
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,900
Great.
What are you looking at?

312
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,900
Oh, just baby pictures of Seth.

313
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,234
I was feeling very nostalgic.

314
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:27,334
Oh, who could blame you?
He was a cute kid.

315
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:30,534
I should get ready,
I have a work lunch.

316
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,534
Dude, it's a psychic.
I know.

317
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:01,067
And Summer says
she's not worried,
but I can tell she is,

318
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:04,967
which is why I dug
into the archives,
and came up with evidence
that we are, in fact,

319
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:07,167
destined to be together.

320
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,800
It's a piece of
loose-leaf, crumpled.

321
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:11,800
I dug it out of a trash can nine
years ago.

322
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:12,800
Okay, explain that.

323
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:15,833
This, my friend,
marks the first moment

324
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,601
that I fell in love
with Summer Roberts.

325
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:21,467
It was the spring... 1998.

326
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:24,401
Is this a long flashback?
Because my break is almost over.
Bear with me.

327
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:30,267
It was the spring, 1998.

328
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,800
Hey, Luke...

329
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:41,100
Good news.

330
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:45,534
Only 11 months and six days
until <i>The Matrix</i> comes out.

331
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,800
Eat it, nerd brain.

332
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,601
We're going to start today
with more readings of
your original poems.

333
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:59,167
Who are we up to?

334
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,967
Summer Roberts.
Summer.

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,567
"I wish I was a mermaid
"and was friends with
all the fish

336
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:24,000
"A shiny tail and seashells
that would be my wish."

337
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:30,367
And that is when I knew
Summer Roberts was the one.

338
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:35,567
Dude, the flashback
did not take that long.

339
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,867
Hi, Julie.
Or should I say Mrs. Bullit?

340
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,367
Julie's fine.
I'm making smoothies.
You want one?

341
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:44,768
Yeah, sure.

342
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,367
So I haven't really talked to
you since you got engaged.
Congrats all over the place.

343
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,034
Well, thank you, but I'm
not exactly engaged.

344
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,034
I'm just mulling over Bullit's
proposal for a while.

345
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,668
What's there to mull?
I mean, you're totally
in love with him, right?

346
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:58,734
You probably can't stop
daydreaming about your
future together.

347
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,967
And just think,
for the rest of your life,

348
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,833
you get to be in
a bed with Bullit.
Suddenly not in the mood.

349
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,200
Night after night, you and
Bullit making love
into the wee hours.

350
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,501
You, exploring his body as
it gets older, and older.

351
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,134
The skin slackening,
you still having to perform
your wifely duties.

352
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,601
Taylor, stop.

353
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:17,234
Admit it, Julie, you've got it
bad for Frank Atwood.

354
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:19,401
What?
I saw your face last night.

355
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:22,467
You, Julie Cooper, have
a case of the Franks.

356
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:27,034
Okay, I do... I did,

357
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,267
or one time or another

358
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:31,434
may have had a case
of the Franks,

359
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,634
but for reasons that are
both personal and complex,
I'm staying with Bullit.

360
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Julie, you're different now.

361
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:42,634
You are no longer the woman
who can marry for money.

362
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,634
You need more.
Taylor, I have a child.

363
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,567
I have no job.
I don't even own this house.

364
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:48,234
Besides, I don't think Ryan
would approve.

365
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,034
God knows I've put that kid
through enough.

366
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,768
Julie, Ryan's only
concern is for you.

367
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,668
He doesn't think his dad's
good enough for you.

368
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,067
Ryan Atwood is worried about me?

369
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:02,567
Yeah.
How about that.

370
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:08,768
NEWSCASTER:
Our answer, right after
this break.

371
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,301
(TiVo pausing)
Hey, what are you watching?

372
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,301
(sighs)
It's bad.

373
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,401
It's really bad.

374
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,434
Look.

375
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:20,800
Coming up next,
could this young woman
be the one to save
Newport sea otters?

376
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,234
Summer, you're a hero.

377
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:24,933
And guess who's bringing sexy
back to Newport?

378
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,634
That's right, Justin Timberlake
is coming to the Bait Shop.

379
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,134
Just how does such a small venue
get such big names?

380
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,867
(TiVo pausing)
Falling skateboards,
Justin Timberlake...

381
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,134
Everything the psychic
said is coming true.

382
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,434
You know, any second I'm just
going to get whisked away
by some dude named George.

383
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:42,701
Relax.
Now I know that psychic has
a lot of credibility.

384
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:45,933
She works at a kiosk,
and she doesn't appear
to charge for her services,

385
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,634
but I think I am a better judge
of whether you and I
are destined to be together,
than her. And I brought proof.

386
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:55,833
Happy early Valentine's Day,
Summer.

387
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,134
The mermaid poem.

388
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,367
That's how I knew,
even in fifth grade,
that you were the one.

389
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:09,800
That's pretty
awesome, huh?

390
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,567
Oh, my God.
I know.

391
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:13,134
I didn't write this.

392
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:19,401
What?
I remember that day.

393
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,634
Okay, Holly, watch this.

394
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,668
* Yo, I'll tell you
what I want *

395
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,900
* What I really,
really want. *
Oh, my God, Summer,

396
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,234
you are Scary Spice.

397
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,100
Ew, Taylor Dorkson alert.

398
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,701
Ew.

399
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:42,000
Hey, Summer, are you finished
with your poem?

400
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:45,034
What poem?
The original poem that
we're reading out loud.

401
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,200
We're going in alphabetical
order, and we're on "R."

402
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,601
I already finished mine,
even though I'm a "T."

403
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:53,833
I may spend my night
doing a polish.

404
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,134
Okay. We're going to start today
with more readings of your
original poems.

405
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,867
Who are
we up to?

406
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,601
Summer Roberts.

407
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:06,867
Summer.

408
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,434
Give me your poem.

409
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,301
Summer,
have you no ethics whatsoever?

410
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,034
Okay, you can come to my
birthday party.

411
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:19,267
Really?

412
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:22,401
Okay, here.

413
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,833
(paper rustling)
Summer, we're waiting.

414
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,534
(softly):
I wish I was a mermaid....

415
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:49,067
(sharply):
Speak up, Miss Roberts.

416
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:53,401
I wish I was a mermaid
and was friends
with all the fish.

417
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:57,167
A shiny tail and seashells,
that would be my wish.

418
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,567
Lovely.

419
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:04,134
But this mermaid poem is...

420
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,567
it's our roots,
it's our mythology.

421
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:09,401
What if our mythology is a sham?

422
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,234
Something that
we invented?

423
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:13,234
What if we are each other's
Jimmy Cooper?

424
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,501
What?
You know,
the one before the one.

425
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,501
The one that you think is right
before you meet
your Sandy Cohen?

426
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:21,867
Wait, are we saying that because
Taylor wrote the poem,
she's my Sandy Cohen?

427
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:25,534
Because as delicious a twist
as that would be,
it's not going to happen.
No.

428
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:27,601
What I'm saying is what if we're
not destined to be together?

429
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,467
That is your cue, Seth,
to say that I am wrong.

430
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:36,734
Mm-hmm.
I'm wrong, right?
Cue to say
I'm wrong, right?

431
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,634
I don't know anymore.

432
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,668
Julie,
we're about
to close up.

433
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,067
I just wanted to talk to you.

434
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:56,967
Look, I...
I know you told Taylor

435
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:59,668
that you were worried about me
being involved with your father.

436
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:02,634
Nah, that's okay, it's over,
so no need
to talk about it.

437
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:04,833
Right.
It <i>is</i> over between us.

438
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,301
Good, I'm glad.

439
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:10,668
But Ryan, I just wanted you
to know that...

440
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:14,334
I've been with my fair share
of bad guys,

441
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:18,501
and for the record,
your dad isn't one of them.

442
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:33,833
Hey.
Hi. So what's the plan?

443
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,334
The Frank and Julie plan?

444
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,367
Yep.
Yay, you're on board!

445
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:39,668
I talked to Julie.

446
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:42,100
So did I.
Lady has a case of the Franks.

447
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,234
But lucky for us it's
Valentine's Day tomorrow.

448
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:45,668
So she'll be going out
with Bullit, right?

449
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:46,933
We'll just get rid of Bullit

450
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,634
and then we will get Frank
and Julie together
for the most romantic night
ever.

451
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:52,668
So you come over after work,
and in the meantime,
I'll start making lists.

452
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:55,134
All right, I'll see you later.
Toodles.

453
00:23:58,768 --> 00:23:59,800
'Sup?

454
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,967
Kaitlin,
were you... eavesdropping?

455
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:06,067
Look, my mom loves
the Bullit, okay?

456
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:08,867
He's rich and he's funny
and it's a total
slam dunk.

457
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:10,933
Okay, sweetie, it's a little
more complicated than that.

458
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,367
Not to me.

459
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:14,267
Listen, Townsend, I'm playing
for Team Bullit, okay?

460
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:17,534
And my team,
we always win.

461
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:21,933
Well, Ryan and I are playing
for Team Frank, and our team always wins.

462
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,434
That's funny,
because you're going down.
Are you threatening us?

463
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:27,467
Totally. It's war, bitch.

464
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,667
--Hi, honey.

465
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:35,567
Whoa.

466
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:40,300
Pancakes?

467
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:42,868
When is this Valentine's Day
tradition going to die?

468
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,267
I'm sorry that I've been babying
you lately.

469
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:46,634
I'm just feeling
a little motherly.

470
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:49,634
That's okay, I'm feeling
a little sulky,
so we're a good match.

471
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:52,434
Summer's going through
something, isn't she?

472
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:55,567
She's wondering if I'm her Sandy
Cohen or her Jimmy Cooper.

473
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:58,834
Well, I hope
I didn't worry her.
So how about you?
Are you okay?

474
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,401
Well, Summer and I have
this history,
or at least I thought we did.

475
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,267
These things
that happened to us
when we were kids
that convinced me
we were meant to
be together.

476
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:08,467
Now if those things turn out
not to be true...

477
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:10,734
Seth, how long have you dated
Summer?

478
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:11,768
Uh, February...

479
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:13,768
like a million years.

480
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:18,601
And in that time,
how many things has Summer done
to convince you
that she's the girl for you?

481
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:24,900
A lot.
So I think
you should focus on that.

482
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:27,701
The real Summer,
and not the one
that you worshipped
in grade school.

483
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:29,900
You know what I think?
What?

484
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:32,100
I think that you found
your Sandy Cohen.

485
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,200
Aw, aw, me, too.

486
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:40,367
Mm, Mom,

487
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:43,134
why'd you and Jimmy Cooper
break up, anyways?

488
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,634
It doesn't matter.

489
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,033
Sorry I'm late.

490
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,033
Your dad's working me
to the bone.
Not even paying you.

491
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,267
That's an internship
for you.

492
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:12,067
He'll make it up to me
after college
when I sign my life away
to the Newport Group.

493
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:13,868
Jimmy, we need to talk.

494
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:21,701
I don't know
if I can do this anymore.

495
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:22,667
Do what?

496
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:25,134
Us.

497
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,667
I need to end this.

498
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:29,033
What are you talking about?

499
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,467
We have a plan.
Go to college.
Come back here,
pick up where we left off.

500
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:35,367
Jimmy, on paper,
all of that makes sense.

501
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:37,534
But in my heart
it just doesn't feel right.

502
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:41,167
I don't understand.

503
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:45,467
You don't just wake up
one morning
and decide to change
your entire life.

504
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,801
Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together.

505
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:55,134
It's already been figured out.

506
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,933
I know what
I want to do.

507
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,401
Kirsten, what's going on?

508
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,167
I got into Berkeley.

509
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:15,933
And you're going?

510
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,868
SUMMER: <i>Don't you see we are</i>
<i>supposed to control</i>
<i>our own destiny?</i>

511
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,868
Mm-hmm.

512
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,567
Or else what's the point of life
if it's just something
that happens to you?

513
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:54,434
Summer?
Hmm?

514
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,033
You have a visitor.

515
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:00,734
(whispers):
George.

516
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:03,300
Hi.

517
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:06,900
I'm Paul, I'm here for GEORGE.
George?

518
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:11,367
Yes, The Global Environmental
Organization
Regarding Greenhouse Emissions.

519
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:13,334
We've been reading your blog
about the sea otters.

520
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,933
I was in the area
and I'm here to offer you a job.

521
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,634
We'd like you
to come work for us.

522
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:25,234
Oh... GEORGE.

523
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,267
It doesn't matter who it is.

524
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,768
All that you need to know is
that the game has changed.

525
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,501
If you want
to marry my mom,
you're going
to have to step your game up.

526
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,567
Well, old Bullit knows how
to romance a lady.
I've been married five times.

527
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,300
Check this out.

528
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:43,467
Emerald earrings
for your mom,
matches her eyes.

529
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:45,667
Just toss these,
all right?
I want something better.

530
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:47,701
I want out-of-the-box thinking.

531
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,634
Hot air balloon ride.
Hot air balloon.

532
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:52,534
A blimp?

533
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:55,367
Oh, heck, squirt, all I care
about is that your mom is happy

534
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,534
and if I'm not
the man for that...

535
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:00,634
No, Bullit, buck up.
You want to marry
my mom, right?
Of course.

536
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:01,534
And you want to be my stepdad.

537
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:04,834
And play ping-pong with you
till I'm old and gray.
Hell, yeah. Let's go.

538
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,033
Then we need
to make a plan.

539
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,167
I want nothing less
than the most spectacular
Valentine's date ever.

540
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,033
Is one of those planes yours?

541
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,267
Two of 'em.

542
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:23,033
TAYLOR:
<i>Okay, they're gonna</i>
<i>play the money card,</i>
but we can play
the emotion card.

543
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,501
Am I right, Ryan?
Yeah, you're right.

544
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:27,033
Okay, Frank, tell me what it is
that you love about Julie.

545
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,768
Well, uh...

546
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:34,401
She's, uh...

547
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:37,167
I forgot what
we're dealing with here.

548
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,267
Atwoods on Valentine's Day.

549
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:40,834
I told you.
Look, I really

550
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,334
appreciate this, but you guys
don't have to do this for me.

551
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:46,067
It's not your job.
We want to.

552
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:50,467
Mm, text from Kaitlin.

553
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:52,300
"Y'all are going down.
Team Bullit."

554
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,933
Frank, if we're going to win,
you need
to give me something here.

555
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,768
Okay, Julie's amazing.

556
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,801
All right? She's...
she's pretty.

557
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,434
She totally gets me?

558
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,200
Come on.
Dig deeper here!
Look inside.

559
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,967
What is it that connects you
to her?

560
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:13,200
We're just...

561
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:15,467
from the same world.

562
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:30,701
You barely touched your chicken.
I guess I wasn't in
the mood for it.

563
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:34,567
Well, you're feeling nauseous
and tired.
So I can't expect you
to be dancing on the tables.

564
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:41,900
If something else
is bothering you, tell me.

565
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,667
I hate keeping secrets from you.

566
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:46,734
I didn't know you were.
There's one thing.

567
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:50,567
Something that I,
I never told you

568
00:30:50,634 --> 00:30:52,967
Is this about Jimmy Cooper?

569
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,933
Can we get the check and talk
about this at home?

570
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:01,367
Thank you.

571
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:06,534
Mom, hold up.
There's been a change
in schedule.

572
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:09,267
Kaitlin, what's up?
We have way
cooler plans.

573
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,401
And your ride should be here
any second.
What is this?

574
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,234
What is this shirt?

575
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,501
Nothing, I'm just getting
in the spirit of things.

576
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:18,967
Last-minute ambush.
Should have seen this coming.

577
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,667
How'd you find us?
Taylor activated the
GPS on your phone.

578
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:25,033
Can I talk to you?
Damn GPS. I should
have thought of that.

579
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
What are you guys, the KGB?
What's going on?
I'll explain.

580
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,334
Mom, whatever he says,
do not listen to him.

581
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:32,567
Look, I know you
have plans tonight,
but I was hoping
you'd cancel them.

582
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:35,067
Oh, you found out about
my case of the Franks.

583
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:37,367
He's waiting for you.
He knows it's a long shot,

584
00:31:37,434 --> 00:31:39,067
but I said I'd try
to get you to meet him.

585
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:41,401
I'll drive if you want.

586
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,567
Mom, come on, your ride's here.

587
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:48,234
Tell your dad that
in another life I'd be there.

588
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,501
I'm sorry.

589
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:01,701
Mm, told you, Atwood.
My team always wins.

590
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:06,834
I guess so.
Wait. What?
What the hell?

591
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:16,501
Driver, could you turn
the AC on, please?

592
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,100
(gruff voice):
Yeah, sure, Ms. Cooper.

593
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,200
--I cannot believe this.
Yeah, that's war, bitch.

594
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,434
(voice breaking):
God, Ryan,
how could
you be so mean?

595
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:34,100
I'm only 15.

596
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,534
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

597
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:37,967
I don't know what I was
thinking.

598
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:40,267
Me, either.

599
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,868
You're going down.
Kaitlin...
I'm following your decoy limo.

600
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,267
Then I'll follow you!

601
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:55,900
JULIE:
Did Bullit buy me
a hot dog stand?

602
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:58,567
Uh, driver, I don't think
this is right.

603
00:32:58,634 --> 00:33:01,200
You're here.

604
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:03,434
Taylor?


605
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:19,200
I don't know what to say.

606
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:23,501
What is all this?
Go, say it, like
we practiced. Go.

607
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,701
Okay.

608
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:30,334
Uh, this is sort of a testament
to where we came from.

609
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:35,567
But I really want tonight
to be about where
we could go.

610
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:43,967
It's just a promise ring.

611
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,167
I know it's not fancy.

612
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,933
I wish I could offer you more,
but this is all I have.

613
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,834
And that is
that I love you,

614
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,567
the real you.

615
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,234
Frank, I...

616
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,167
KAITLIN:
Mom,
the Bullit's waiting.

617
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:08,933
Frank, I'm sorry.

618
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:14,367
I have one daughter left

619
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:17,300
and she loves Bullit,

620
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:20,033
even if I don't.

621
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:25,601
I'm sorry, Frank.

622
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,868
And then after we had
Seth and we were trying
for a second and
nothing was happening,

623
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:48,701
I thought it was some
kind of karmic payback.

624
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:50,501
Well, now you know it
doesn't work like that.

625
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,200
Why didn't you ever say
anything?

626
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:53,868
Part of it was timing.

627
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:55,234
It had only been
a month.

628
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,834
But then the best thing in
the world happened to me.

629
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:14,834
Mondale and Ferraro.

630
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,868
Mondale and Ferraro,
path to equality.

631
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,701
No, thanks.
What are you,
a Republican?

632
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:24,334
Oh, I'm sorry, did you catch it
from your parents?

633
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:28,434
I hear it's hereditary.
I guess I did.

634
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:34,900
Well, if you don't want
a pamphlet, here,
have a pin, on me.

635
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,534
I might wear it, but only
because it's stylish.

636
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,467
You know, if you're
not a pamphlet reader,
I could take you to coffee...

637
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:54,467
...tell you all
about why Mondale and
Ferraro are gonna lose.

638
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:57,467
If you're so sure they're
gonna lose, why bother?

639
00:35:57,534 --> 00:36:01,267
I don't know, it feels right.

640
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:04,401
So... coffee?

641
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,601
KIRSTEN:
<i>I guess I had fate on my mind</i>

642
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:14,267
when I got you this gift.

643
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,868
Where on Earth
did you find this?

644
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:19,467
I turned the house
upside down.

645
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:22,933
If it hadn't been for Walter
Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro,
there never would have
been a Seth Cohen.

646
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,701
There wouldn't be a Ryan.

647
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,033
And whoever this is
going to be...

648
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,267
All because of
that one day.

649
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,334
My lucky day.

650
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,567
My lucky day.

651
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,000
Okay, I admit it--
I put way too much stock
into that poem.

652
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:48,967
I'm not the girl that
you thought I was.
You're not.

653
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:51,434
You, Summer, are better.

654
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:55,300
See, back then you were
just this fantasy.

655
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:58,000
You were this little girl,
who, when I would see,

656
00:36:58,067 --> 00:37:02,300
you would either ignore me,
or make an obscene gesture
and keep on walking.

657
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,933
Yeah, I kind
of remember that, sorry.
But now look at you.

658
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,933
You fight for sea otters.
You've befriended
Taylor Townsend.

659
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,768
You're an incredible mom
to that bunny.
I guess I have changed.

660
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,501
You've evolved.

661
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,933
And over the last 950 days we've
been dating...

662
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,601
and, yes, I've counted,
and yes, I counted
the Zach era,

663
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,033
because, really,
who were we kidding?

664
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,267
...I've watched you grow
into this incredible woman.

665
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,467
And that is who I love.

666
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:31,401
Thanks, Cohen.

667
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:37,801
What's wrong?

668
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,667
I met GEORGE.
I'll kill him.

669
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:44,033
This guy came by from
GEORGE to recruit me.

670
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,501
He heard about my work with
the sea otters and invited me

671
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:49,834
to travel across the country
and talk to college kids
about voting next November.

672
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,067
What about Brown?

673
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:54,701
I'd have to defer a year,
live on a bus.

674
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:56,801
Sounds like a great gig.

675
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,234
I don't know that
we could see each other.

676
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:07,200
So you have to choose
between me and GEORGE.

677
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,434
That's the thing--
I don't know
that I have to.

678
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:12,768
I do believe that you are my
destiny, I do, Seth.

679
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,900
But I just don't know that
you're my only destiny.

680
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:21,434
Here.
Happy Valentine's Day.

681
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,200
Mm-hmm.

682
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,834
I picked couples through time.

683
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,667
Oh, and where
are we?

684
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:36,067
I was hoping that someday we
could go in the middle.

685
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:52,634
So can I tell you what
Bullit's surprise is?

686
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:55,367
I can't hold it
any longer.

687
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,601
Sure.

688
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:03,267
His plane is sitting on
the tarmac
gassed up and ready
to take you anywhere
in the world.

689
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:06,768
Mom, you're going to be spending
Valentine's Day
anywhere in the world
that you want to go.

690
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:09,701
I mean, that's
pretty amazing.

691
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:12,401
Yeah.

692
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:20,267
Yeah, it really is.


693
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:22,933
No.
Mom...

694
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,567
Squirt, where the
heck's your mom?

695
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:02,434
I know I asked you
to be my stepdad.

696
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,900
Do you mind being
my friend instead?

697
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:09,801
So Julie's had enough
of the old Bullit, eh?

698
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:15,067
We can still play ping-pong
together.

699
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:25,100
Come on.

700
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,334
You know, I let you win.

701
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:28,933
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

702
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,100
In your dreams.

703
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,834
You ever see that
movie <i>Casablanca?</i>
No.

704
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,267
It goes like this:

705
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:37,701
Peanut, I think this
is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

706
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,900
Come on, luck be a lady,
luck be a lady.

707
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,167
Oh!

708
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:44,933
I can't believe this,
I didn't win.
Shocking.

709
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,801
Well, if it's any
consolation, though,
this soft serv is outstanding.

710
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:49,167
Would anyone like seconds?

711
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:51,134
Yeah, I would.
Yeah, me, too.

712
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,067
Thank you.

713
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
Sorry things didn't work out
with you and Julie.

714
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:04,100
Hey...

715
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:06,634
I'm sitting here sharing
ice cream with my kid.

716
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:09,100
It's been a long time
since I've done that.

717
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:23,601
Tell me that's her.

718
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,067
That's her.

719
00:41:29,134 --> 00:41:32,300
I'm suddenly nervous.
You're going to be great.

720
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:46,267
I'm having the strangest
craving for a corn dog.

721
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:49,567
There may be one left.

722
00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:53,300
Seat?

723
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,601
How about that?

724
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:05,300
Fourth quarter, Team Frank
comes through in the clutch.

725
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:08,234
Oh, yeah.
True love on
Valentine's Day.

726
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,967
What more could
you ask for?
Yeah...

727
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,334
Hey, uh, so, you know,
we reserved the limo
for another two hours.

728
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:17,900
What do you say we drive
down the beach?

729
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:20,434
Uh, that sounds
suspiciously like
a Valentine's Day date to me.

730
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:23,167
I don't know, that
might make us break up.

731
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:24,601
What if I said...

732
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:31,000
...I had newfound faith?

733
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:32,534
I would say I agree.

734
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:35,200
I have newfound faith.

735
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:36,467
I agree.
Okay.

736
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:48,501
Onward, Jeeves. Yes, yes, yes,
to the beach.

737
