1
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,276
Gotta be somewhere.

2
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:57,992
You wanna keep goin'?

3
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,395
Officer Smith, ma'am.

4
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:08,800
We're looking for a man
went after a woman last night

5
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,107
at Esplanda apartments,
the ones right behind you.

6
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,243
- Heard anything unusual?
- No, sorry.

7
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:16,164
Oh my God, that's terrible.
Is the woman alright?

8
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:18,374
- The woman, is she alright?
- Yeah.

9
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:19,708
Yeah, she good.

10
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,983
Excuse me, my brother,
Omar little, came here last night.

11
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:30,139
He fell out the damn window.

12
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:32,992
- We don't have anyone by that name.
- He was kinda,

13
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:35,140
ya know, high.
Probably messed up his name.

14
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:37,260
Real dark,
got himself a scar.

15
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:39,779
Legs should
be busted up real bad.

16
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,500
No one with that type
of injury came in last night.

17
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:51,490
Not a goddamn thing.

18
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,076
Been in every trashcan, dumpster,
vacant for three blocks 'round.

19
00:01:55,236 --> 00:01:57,714
- Nothin'.
- We even checked down the sewers.

20
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:03,966
Marlo wanna meet.

21
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,712
So what you want us to do?

22
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,234
Which one?

23
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:31,529
Don't seem possible.

24
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:33,073
It don't.

25
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:35,318
That some Spiderman shit there.

26
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,121
We missed our shot.

27
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:43,244
Now he gonna be at us.

28
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:39,056
Usually, my staff tries to keep
sharp objects out of my hands.

29
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,710
You know, it all started with
Charles Center and Tommy d'Alesandro

30
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,672
and it continued with
William Donald Schaefer and harborplace.

31
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:57,257
And following that, there were
Mayors Schmoke and o'Malley

32
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,801
with inner harbor east.

33
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:02,167
Today it is my administration's turn
to lay claim to the middle branch

34
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:06,175
of the patapsco and hat will soon
become known as New Westport,

35
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:10,923
revitalizing another waterfront area
of our great city. Thank you.

36
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:14,957
Say g'bye to locust point south.

37
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:19,404
Fuck you, Krawczyk.

38
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,449
Fuck you,

39
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:22,992
greedhead motherfucker.

40
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,434
Fuck you for tearing down
the port of Baltimore

41
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:28,340
and selling it to some yuppie
assholes from Washington.

42
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,028
- C'mon buddy.
- This is bullshit.

43
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:31,364
Who the hell's that?

44
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,002
Oh that's nobody, Mr. Mayor.

45
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:34,559
It's nobody at all.

46
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:18,232
Ya happy now, bitch?

47
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:20,203
I am content, yes.

48
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:23,183
- You called the reporter, huh?
- No, actually.

49
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:26,199
That asshole's making up his own shit.

50
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:29,410
Brass called a press
conference for this afternoon.

51
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:32,655
They're gonna be shoveling
so much money at my bullshit

52
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:34,174
it'll make your head spin.

53
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:37,361
- What's with all the casework?
- Bodies from the vacants.

54
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,162
Some still missing lab work.

55
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:43,067
And some of them have
been worked pretty good.

56
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,652
You know what, Jimmy?

57
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:47,295
I'm gonna go back to the beginning
and work every one of them again.

58
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,804
Back to square one.

59
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:52,100
You know why?
Because I'm a murder police.

60
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,398
I work murders.

61
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:56,300
I don't fuck with no make-believe,
I don't jerk shit around.

62
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,232
I catch a murder and I work it.

63
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:01,234
Working this shit
like I'm supposed to.

64
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:04,487
Well, lemme know
if you need anything, alright?

65
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:08,157
Cars, some O.T., some lab work...
Anything you need.

66
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,409
Because in...
three or four hours

67
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,094
the money's gonna flow on my case.

68
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:13,342
Whatever you need.{\, Bunk,}

69
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:16,532
I'm probably gonna have more of it
than even Lester could use.

70
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:25,258
To be that close to a serial killer.

71
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:26,709
It must be weird.

72
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,337
Kinda. Yeah.

73
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,308
Wonderful story, Scott.

74
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:32,598
Yeah, well, it kinda wrote itself.

75
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,010
It's a lucky thing to have the guy
call me like he did...

76
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,541
It comes from you pounding the pavement.
{\, right?}That's more than luck.

77
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,398
That's putting yourself in the place
where the story comes to you.

78
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,608
- What do you have for tomorrow?
- For tomorrow?

79
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:46,053
This is not the kind of thing
we let go of after a day or two.

80
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:47,453
I...

81
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,575
{\you know, }I was thinking that if I spent
a night with the homeless, you know.

82
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:53,077
Did what they did. Saw what they saw.
That kind of thing.

83
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:56,304
I mean, if it's an overnight thing,
I couldn't get it for tomorrow, but

84
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:58,409
- the next day, sure...
- That's great.

85
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:00,132
That could be the perfect follow.

86
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:01,573
I'll speak to Gus.

87
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:05,465
Also, {\Scott, }we've been taking calls from{\ some}
{\of the }national networks and cable outlets.

88
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,512
- They're{\looking for} want you to go on-camera.
- Me?

89
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,346
- On television?
- I'd avoid the locals,

90
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,828
but if you can do the nationalstuff
in a responsible maner.

91
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:15,691
Sure, yeah. I mean I'm just not all
that comfortable having myself in the...

92
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:17,782
- center of the story like this.
- Of course not.

93
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,134
But there is a way of handling
this responsibly, I think.

94
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,149
Just remember
you're an ambassador for the paper.

95
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,141
Star time.

96
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:29,832
Yeah.

97
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:31,767
How 'bout that?

98
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:34,035
- Homelessness.
- Our coverage should reflect

99
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:36,941
the Dickensian aspect of the homeless.

100
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,471
The human element.

101
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:40,934
Scott will lead it off,
spending a night on the streets

102
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:42,674
and writing from that perspective.

103
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,907
He's the lead on your education project.
We need to get him back on the...

104
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:49,638
I don't see the...
The school project as yielding

105
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,138
the same kind of impact
as our attention to homelessness can.

106
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,868
These murders,
the phone call to our reporter.

107
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,234
It really opens up the
issue, don't you think?

108
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:00,363
- Yeah, but...
- From now til the end of the year,

109
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:02,920
let's focus not only
on covering the murders,

110
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,362
but on the...
The nature of homelessness itself.

111
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:09,201
The Dickensian aspect of it. Yeah.

112
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:16,942
I've reached a point, detective Sydnor,

113
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:20,842
where I no longer have
the time or patience left

114
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:25,140
to address myself to the needs
of the system within which we work.

115
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:28,179
- I'm tired.
- You're gonna quit?

116
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,840
Not yet. Not just yet.

117
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,921
So what are you talking about?

118
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,536
When they took us
off Marlo this last time,

119
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,300
when they said they couldn't pay
for further investigation...

120
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:41,227
I regarded that decision
as illegitimate.

121
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,816
- Illegitimate?
- And so...

122
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,367
I'm responding in kind.

123
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:48,046
I'm going to press a case
against Marlo Stanfield

124
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:50,194
without regard to the usual rules.

125
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:06,419
I'm running an illegal wiretap
on Marlo Stanfield's cellphone.

126
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,797
- Fuck, Lester.
- If you have a problem with this,

127
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:11,637
I understand completely

128
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:15,553
and urge you to get as far
fucking away from me as you can.

129
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,755
You remember
this one here?

130
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:44,251
Backed away from jackin' the boy up

131
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:47,543
outta respect for that goofy
motherfucker pryzbylewski.

132
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,504
Wonder what the young man might
tell me a year later, though...

133
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,630
Bunk.

134
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:53,591
What the fuck is this?

135
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,344
Vernon here did a search warrant
on his dead guy's appliance store,

136
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,513
pulled all of that
out of the desk drawer.

137
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:02,892
Grand jury shit?
Transcripts, sealed indictments...

138
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:05,728
- Who's your murder?
- Eastside dealer{\ by the name of}, Joe Stewart.

139
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,084
Caught one in the back
of his head the other night.

140
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,524
Somebody finally
touched prop Joe, huh?

141
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:13,924
You remember when narcotics
indicted Charlie Burman last year?

142
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:17,468
Motherfucker ran a couple days
before the raids, still on the wing.

143
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:20,493
The sealed indictments are all in there.
Every one of 'em.

144
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,289
Who don't we trust at the courthouse?

145
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:28,167
- <i>They put cheese on them fries?</i>
- <i>They can. Chili too.</i>

146
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:30,487
<i>Alright then.
You want a drink with that?</i>

147
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,660
- <i>Strawberry lemonade.</i>
- <i>Alright, I'm on it.</i>

148
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,925
They're back on cellphones.
After more than a year?

149
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:36,292
That they are.

150
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,836
Tell me they're
talking in code, Lester.

151
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:40,985
I wanna go to jail
for snatchin' something better

152
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,959
than Marlo Stanfield's
fucking lunch order.

153
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,632
There's no code that I can tell.
I've got a half dozen calls,

154
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:49,664
all routine. No drug talk,
no numbers, no times...

155
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:51,711
Nothing but what they seem.

156
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,761
So he ain't doing
business with the phone then.

157
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,028
So take this mess down.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

158
00:12:56,188 --> 00:12:57,965
I also have five calls,

159
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,740
thirty to forty seconds duration,

160
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,868
each one picked up
on the first ring, each one

161
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:05,567
with nothing whatsoever
said between parties.

162
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,903
You see? When they talk,

163
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:09,208
it's bullshit.

164
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:12,294
But there are calls
where no one says a thing.

165
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:15,261
Thirty seconds, without conversation.

166
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:21,804
Is he...

167
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,779
We talked it through,

168
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,555
- he knows the risks.
- I'm in.

169
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:28,728
If it makes the fucking case,
I'm in all the way.

170
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,137
So, what's up now?
They talking dirt?

171
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:35,109
- No.
- Lester. Fuck.

172
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:37,403
Marlo's not gonna
talk dirt on the phone,

173
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,864
but there's something to this.
I just haven't figured it out.

174
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,628
We could use some more manpower.

175
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:46,036
We need a couple of surveillance teams
to get on these guys

176
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:47,944
to see how they using the phones.

177
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:49,723
You see the newspaper today?

178
00:13:50,072 --> 00:13:51,131
Headline like that,

179
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,824
the bosses are gonna start
throwing money at the homeless murders.

180
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:59,216
When they do, I'll peel off a couple
detectives, throw them your way.

181
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:06,935
The homeless murders?

182
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:09,344
How does that case
tangle in with this?

183
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,187
Hard to explain.

184
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:18,641
Remember what the D.N.C. folks
told me two years ago?

185
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:20,774
What I needed to do to
take the statehouse?

186
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:23,368
Build something downtown
and stick your name on it,

187
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:26,541
get the crime to go down,
and stay away from schools.

188
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,174
And keep my boyish good looks.

189
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,107
One out of four ain't bad.

190
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,115
Jesus.

191
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:35,207
Did we have to schedule this
the same day as new Westport?

192
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,968
My good news isn't even going to make
the front of the local section.

193
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,107
The ribbon-cutting
was scheduled two weeks ago.

194
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,502
This homeless thing
no one saw coming.

195
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:51,873
First of all, I'm surprised
to see so much media here.

196
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:55,439
A press event held earlier today
to announce the revitalization

197
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,010
of yet another part of our city
was not so well attended.

198
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,275
It would appear that media
attention is always focusing

199
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:02,287
on the negatives
when it comes to Baltimore,

200
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:04,698
but you guys aren't around
when we're making real progress.

201
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,240
Nevertheless, I'm glad
to see so many of you here.

202
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,567
Some of you representing
not just our local media,

203
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,998
but national attention to this problem.
Thank you for caring enough

204
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:16,973
about our most vulnerable citizens
to address yourselves to this tragedy.

205
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:18,418
Our homeless citizens,

206
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:21,423
those who have fallen
through the cracks of our society,

207
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,243
those who command
the least of our attentions and efforts,

208
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:28,507
they seemingly have little
to endear themselves to politicians.

209
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,808
They don't vote, by and large.
They don't contribute to campaigns.

210
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,708
They offer little to a city's tax base,

211
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:36,597
and to the extent that our government
is made aware of their existence,

212
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:39,984
it responds by trying to mitigate
the damage done by their presence.

213
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:43,341
We open a food bank here,
a shelter there.

214
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,467
We try to move them away
from downtown,

215
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:47,280
away from our communal areas,

216
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,504
away from our schools,
away from our homes.

217
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,942
If you were to judge our
society by the manner in which

218
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:55,791
we treat those lost on our streets,
we would have cause to be shamed.

219
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:58,627
Well, I am, God forgive me,
a politician.

220
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:01,171
But I am also someone who ran

221
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:04,526
for public office because I believe that
there is a different way of governing.

222
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:06,281
And I believe that in the end

223
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,534
we will be judged
not by the efforts we make on behalf

224
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:11,267
of those who vote for us, or those
who contribute to our campaigns,

225
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:13,334
or those who provide for our tax base.

226
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:15,696
I believe that we will be
judged by what we provide

227
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:18,355
to the weakest and most vulnerable.
That is the test.

228
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,067
That is my test.

229
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,938
Somebody is killing
homeless men in this city.

230
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,940
They are taking the lives
of fellow citizens

231
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,000
who do not have the means
or the strength

232
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,734
to properly protect themselves.

233
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:32,100
They will be stopped.

234
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,634
We will do everything
in our power to stop them.

235
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,434
You have my word on this.

236
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:41,045
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

237
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,228
What got into you?

238
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,200
- What?
- I want to assure the public

239
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,678
that we are doing everything possible
in our power to apprehend this subject.

240
00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:51,846
Homicide detectives
are working around the clock.

241
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:53,766
District officers are in contact

242
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:56,367
with the agencies that work
with the homeless.

243
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:59,240
I cannot go into specifics
of the investigation,

244
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:02,436
but with that caveat,
I will take questions.

245
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,698
Commissioner,
is there any connection

246
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,739
1between these murders and those
in the vacant homes last year?

247
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,250
No connection.

248
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,244
Commissioner. Are you asking the F.B.I.
To join in the investigation?

249
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:19,467
I think deputy Commissioner Daniels
is in a position to elaborate on that.

250
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:29,613
We'll take whatever help is offered.

251
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,605
Certainly, our detectives
will work closely

252
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:33,931
with the behavioral analysis
unit at Quantico...

253
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:36,774
{\Deputy, }Even with all the resources
at your disposal,

254
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:39,645
isn't it extremely difficult
to catch a serial killer?

255
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:43,708
Our ability to secure genetic material
and the growing D.N.A. Data bank

256
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:46,151
are assets unavailable to us
even a few years ago.

257
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:48,234
And our ability
to effectively use resources

258
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:51,281
has been increased with the aid
of sophisticated computer software.

259
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,201
And, of course,
we have some of the best

260
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,452
criminal investigators
in the nation working 24/7.

261
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:58,266
As the mayor made very clear
a moment ago,

262
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,978
this is now a priority
for the department.

263
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,916
Has a note been found
at any of the scenes?

264
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:07,416
I'm not at liberty to go into any
details of the investigation{\ at this time}.

265
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:17,930
You want me to hang?

266
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,009
He told you who I am, right?

267
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:41,121
Son, the thing about murder

268
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,001
is it never goes off the books.

269
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:47,254
I mean, we work on 'em for weeks,
months, years.

270
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:49,459
We keep on with it
until finally

271
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:52,301
someone decides
they've had enough,

272
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,616
until we get the right word

273
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,541
from the right person.

274
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,667
And you know what happens then?

275
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:09,483
When a case does go down...

276
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,485
All those people
who kept quiet about it,

277
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,197
who lied about it,

278
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,743
all of them who thought
it wasn't coming back on 'em,

279
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:21,934
they end up catchin' a charge.
And they get time behind that.

280
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:24,402
Time, huh?

281
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,943
You gonna give me time?

282
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:38,676
If you know something
about that boy Lex getting shot,

283
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:41,202
now is your last chance
to speak to that.

284
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:44,269
You gave a statement last year...

285
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,640
Why don't you promise
to get me outta here?

286
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:50,616
That's what y'all doing?
Lie to dumbass niggers?

287
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:59,989
Yo, y'all need to get this police
out my face before I bank his ass.

288
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,352
You're a natural, kiddo.
You had them eating out of your hand.

289
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:17,461
Shit, I was just following
the mayor's lead.

290
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,487
He wants a full-court press, right?

291
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:25,534
We can add a detective or two.

292
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:29,107
And you can ask patrol to concentrate
where vagrants congregate.

293
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:32,276
But other than that, deputy,
the cupboard is bare.

294
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:34,202
- But Carcetti said...
- Make no mistake.

295
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:36,107
He wants us to solve the murders.

296
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,196
He just doesn't want it to cost.

297
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:40,474
Don't look so shocked.

298
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,812
You're runnin' with the big dogs now.

299
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:47,416
Isn't it enough that we're up
on the killer's cellphone?

300
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:50,010
I would think that you could track him
on the G.P.S. chip alone...

301
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,416
He's using a burner

302
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:54,474
and we suspect he's taking out
the battery between calls.

303
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:57,175
And there's nothing to stop him
from changing phones,

304
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,167
calling the reporter from a new number.

305
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:01,567
So you want to tap
the reporter's phone as well.

306
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,309
It stands to reason that we should
monitor this thing from both ends.

307
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,395
- It's what we would normally do.
- Nothing about this is normal.

308
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:11,773
A Baltimore Sun reporter's
phone is problematic.

309
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:15,194
We need to strike a bance
between your needs as investigators

310
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:17,940
and the first amendment rights
of the Sun and its sources.

311
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,491
The first amendment does not
guarantee privacy, your honor.

312
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:23,522
- Legal precedent clearly indicates...
- Look,

313
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,829
- I'm not saying that we can't, but...
- But what?

314
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:31,040
Until we get the sense

315
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,368
that your suspect
is changing phones,

316
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm not inclined to look with favor

317
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,660
on tapping the Baltimore
Sun's telecommunications.

318
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,255
We're afraid to piss them off.

319
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:45,349
Never pick a fight with anyone
who buys ink by the barrel-full.

320
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,374
Christ.

321
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:48,853
Very well, judge.

322
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,557
How many enemies do you need?

323
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:04,248
Deputy.

324
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:24,554
- Where did you get all this?
- Darling, you do not want to know.

325
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:31,962
What's up with you?

326
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,167
Got all twenty-two
out of the drawer, huh?

327
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:37,734
- Workin' the whole mess at once.
- I'm trying to see 'em fresh.

328
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:40,696
Twenty-five.

329
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:43,240
My triple.
It comes back to Marlo and his people.

330
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:44,575
For sure?

331
00:22:44,987 --> 00:22:46,788
A good informant tells me so.

332
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,958
Says one of my vics was talking bad

333
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,039
about Mr. Stanfield,
who took it personal.

334
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,000
Killed him, his girl, his muscle.

335
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:56,015
Left the little kids alive,
so I guess he ain't all bad.

336
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,088
People out there
so scared of this motherfucker.

337
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:00,952
I can't get close
to an eyewitness on any of it.

338
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,234
Where you at with
the rest of these cases?

339
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:08,141
We don't even have lab work
on fourteen of these bodies?

340
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:09,705
A year later{\ and}, I'm still walking

341
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:12,519
in{\ written} requests into Landsman, watching him
just file them away in his drawer.

342
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,734
McNulty would've called
a news reporter on that shit.

343
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,137
I am not him.

344
00:23:17,092 --> 00:23:18,525
What would the Bunk do?

345
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,302
Take no for a fucking answer?

346
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:25,213
We had cutbacks,

347
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:28,827
you know that.
We lost three of four trace examiners.

348
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:30,634
Lost half our clerical.

349
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:34,291
The freezer went bad, we lost 4 months
of blood samples. Did you know that?

350
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:38,074
Four months of evidence and they still
haven't replaced my damn icebox.

351
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:40,130
My heart pumps purple piss for you.

352
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,901
Now, I got the worst mass
murder in b-more history

353
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:45,344
and you can't get the tracework
back to me inside of a year?

354
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:46,619
C'mon, Ron...

355
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,264
Look...

356
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:53,018
You can't go to the press.
I mean, heads will roll

357
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,741
if this gets out.
It isn't anyone's fault.

358
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,014
In fact, it's a little bit on you,

359
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,119
- in a way.
- The fuck you say?

360
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,108
After Annette took retirement,

361
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:05,697
the casework got backed up
worse than ever, right?

362
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,283
We put in to fill
the lab assistant slot,

363
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:11,007
but with all these cutbacks,
the best they could give us was a temp.

364
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:14,098
- A temp?
- Yeah. No medical. No pension.

365
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:17,223
A temp hire
to get us over for a while.

366
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,523
Come on, I'll show you mething...

367
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,267
She was assigned to sort and file
the individual trace elements...

368
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:26,416
Hair, fiber mostly...

369
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:31,223
You know, from each
of the fourteen scenes.

370
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:35,727
- So what's the problem?
- In the initial paperwork,

371
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:38,480
you guys wrote out all
twenty-two c.c. numbers, right?

372
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,941
- Right.
- But in the supplemental requests,

373
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:43,601
you put all the incidents
under the initial C.C.

374
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:45,612
and then you wrote, "et Al,"

375
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,234
- remember?
- So?

376
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:49,533
She didn't know what "et Al" meant.

377
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:52,767
And she sorted everything under
the single complaint number.

378
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:54,541
- You don't fuckin' mean...
- Yeah.

379
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,916
We have no idea which one of your scenes
any of this shit came from.

380
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,744
We don't have a clue.

381
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:07,384
Actually,

382
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:10,709
except for this...
she's been a pretty good employee.

383
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:24,747
- Surveillance teams.
- Two each on twelveour shifts.

384
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:27,834
I need them to set up on certain
locations common to our cases.

385
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:31,568
C'mon, Jay. You heard the mayor.
This case is a red ball.

386
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:34,237
That it is.
You can have Greggs, if you want.

387
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,716
The last time I offered her up,
you kicked her back to her own casework.

388
00:25:37,876 --> 00:25:40,659
Other than a second detective,
you are on your own.

389
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,840
- So it's all bullshit.
- I dunno.

390
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,976
I thought the mayor
gave a very nice speech.

391
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:48,300
I, for one, was moved.

392
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,719
Much like the bull
to which you just referred.

393
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:04,140
- Tell you one thing...
- What's that?

394
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,507
Motherfucker whose got the connect,
he the one that did Joe.

395
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:08,934
Oh, no doubt.

396
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:27,172
Y'all know the co-op took some hits.

397
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:29,102
Joe. Hungry man.

398
00:26:30,126 --> 00:26:32,177
Good people, especially Joe.

399
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:34,554
Their passin' was for real,
cold blooded.

400
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,725
I ow what you thinkin',
so I'ma put it out there...

401
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,185
I'm responsible.

402
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,233
A week or so back, I made a move
on Omar, with Joe's approval.

403
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:48,319
The faggot ain't had heart enough
to come at me,

404
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,897
so he come at those close to me.

405
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:52,032
Now I'm doublin' the bounty...

406
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:55,211
Hundred large
for a whiff of that dicksuck.

407
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,869
Two hundred fifty
for his head.

408
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:00,664
- What about the connect?
- I got that covered.

409
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:02,935
And in light of that fact,

410
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:05,781
I'm a take it upon  myself
to conduct this meet.

411
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:10,315
Slim, I want you take over
hungry man's slice of the cake.

412
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:12,637
Meanin' no disrespect,

413
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:15,136
but I ain't cut out to be no C.E.O.

414
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,932
- Cheese, then.
- No problem, man. Got you covered.

415
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,933
Until we settle up with Omar,

416
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:27,494
I think it's best
we suspend these meets.

417
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:30,193
In fact, I ain't really one
for meets no how.

418
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,174
Anybody got a problem from here on out,

419
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:33,905
bring it to me, or sit on that shit.

420
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:37,218
Those of you on the westside
who need to re-up,

421
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:40,742
holla' at my man Monk.
He gonna handle supply over there.

422
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:42,739
On the eastside, cheese.

423
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,251
One more thing.
Price of the brick going up.

424
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:48,601
Thirty more.

425
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,199
Alright. Enough of this shit.

426
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:09,399
What?

427
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,545
Next year for the schools.

428
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,737
From now until december,
we're all about the plight

429
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:15,947
of the homeless.
The great whiting has spoken.

430
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:17,824
I appealed to Klebanow half hour ago

431
00:28:17,984 --> 00:28:20,383
but he gave me the thumbs down.
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:27,723
Check it out, people. Our metro desk
has some national profile.

433
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:31,254
<i>We're being careful to cooperate
with the investigators</i>

434
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:33,823
<i>in every way.
My newspaper has no desire</i>

435
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:35,884
<i>to get between the police
and the suspect.</i>

436
00:28:36,044 --> 00:28:38,470
<i>But still, wouldn't you agree
it's an incredible moment</i>

437
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,825
<i>for any journalist</i>

438
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:43,907
<i>to come face to face with that type
of pure evil like the son of Sam.</i>

439
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:47,145
<i>That makes you
the Jimmy Breslin of Baltimore.</i>

440
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,607
<i>Well, no,
I wouldn't say that. I mean...</i>

441
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,754
<i>But knowing you have been in contact</i>

442
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:53,040
<i>with a killer,</i>

443
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,708
<i>are you at all concerned about
continuing to report from the street?</i>

444
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,140
<i>No, not at all.</i>

445
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,868
<i>I mean, this is what we do.
As a reporter, you expect to be</i>

446
00:29:02,028 --> 00:29:04,245
<i>in harm's way at some points.
It's what we do.</i>

447
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:05,664
<i>Agreed.
It's what we do.</i>

448
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,833
<i>But very rarely does a reporter end up</i>

449
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:10,674
<i>being in the middle of a story--</i>

450
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,003
<i>An ongoing story--</i>

451
00:29:12,598 --> 00:29:15,341
<i>About a murderer
who is still at large</i>

452
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:18,343
<i>and posing a severe
and deadly risk to the...</i>

453
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:21,741
You shoulda heard Phelan this morning.

454
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:25,601
Too scared to tap the newspaper phones
they might shit on him for it.

455
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:28,441
Fuckin' hack judge.

456
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,121
What would you want with more wires?
We got all we need.

457
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:34,124
I don't want another wire.
It's the principle of the thing...

458
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:36,576
It just pissed me off
listening to him.

459
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:38,530
Oh yeah,

460
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:40,467
no surveillance cars.

461
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:44,074
They won't go
beyond me and Greggs.

462
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:48,194
You and Sydnor will have to work
it as best you can for right now.

463
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,583
Assholes.

464
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,378
They need another body, don't they?

465
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,007
I'll call our man in the southern.

466
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,994
I can take it from here.
Y'all can bounce.

467
00:30:12,154 --> 00:30:13,370
Alright, boss.

468
00:30:22,626 --> 00:30:25,952
What up, Rick?
Just like ol' times for me and you, huh?

469
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,100
Whatever you
want it's yours, alright?

470
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,650
Tonight,
I'm just gonna take yo' jump...

471
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:35,274
- And leave you with a little something.
- What's that?

472
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:36,991
My word in your ear.

473
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,574
I'm callin' Marlo a straight bitch.

474
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:43,261
I'm sayin' it don't take much
to shoot down a blind man.

475
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,840
And as for him steppin' to me,

476
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,407
you tell that dude
he ain't got the heart.

477
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:49,475
Alright.

478
00:30:49,635 --> 00:30:52,184
You tell that man
I'm in the street, waiting.

479
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,873
And just like a little bitch,
he ain't nowhere to be found.

480
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:57,724
I'll tell him.
I will.

481
00:30:59,308 --> 00:31:01,669
Pick up your keys
and go on inside, yo.

482
00:31:09,788 --> 00:31:11,664
You kill Joe?
Hungry?

483
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:16,676
Didn't think so.

484
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,023
What now?

485
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:32,070
There's more than one way
to skin a case.

486
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,448
Already ran them for priors, right?

487
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,182
Priors, yeah.

488
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:50,495
But I'm gonna run every name you guys
developed through the entire database.

489
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:53,973
Not just for priors, but for anything
at all in the miles system.

490
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,973
Court appearances,
parole, probation,

491
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,641
gun permits,
D.O.C., open bails.

492
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,070
- You're playing longshots, huh?
- Darlin',

493
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:04,634
I'm playin'  the hand I've been dealt.

494
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:06,517
An H-file?

495
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,775
- Who caught the case?
- Worden. Other shift.

496
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:18,022
Stepfather.
Beaten to death.

497
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:22,793
They interviewed the mother,
but no one else in the household.

498
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,441
Doesn't exactly fit
with the others, does it?

499
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:28,241
A straight up ass-whoopin' in an alley

500
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:30,926
- doesn't seem like Marlo staield.
- No it doesn't.

501
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:32,745
But you're gonna work it anyway.

502
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:37,623
In the pentecostal church
where I was given religion,

503
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,576
it would have been said that the spirit

504
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:41,796
- was on you yesterday.
- It got good to me.

505
00:32:41,956 --> 00:32:43,762
- Let praises be.
- {\I don't know. }It just pissed me off

506
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,910
that on top of everything
else I gotta deal with,

507
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,967
some nutjob starts
killing homeless guys.

508
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,932
{\I mean, }Fuck already,
how many shitbowls are there?

509
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:51,400
He's right{\ though}. You were great.

510
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,308
That passion
was just the thing.

511
00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:58,087
- You think...
- We step out on this issue,

512
00:32:58,247 --> 00:32:59,957
it could provide
some national presence.

513
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:04,207
Didn't the Governor scrap the emergency
medical and housing program last year?

514
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:05,590
What was it, Temha?

515
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,239
He did, replaced it with T-dap,
which cuts funding to anyone

516
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,868
- {\who doesn't qualify} not qualifying for federal support.
- It's worse{\ than that}, actually:

517
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:13,351
he froze eligibility
by disallowing new applications,

518
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:15,407
which put all kinda folks
out on the street.

519
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:18,041
So we slam the Republican
for sticking it to the poor.

520
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:19,033
It plays.

521
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:21,608
Nationally, you're ting up
the cause of the forgotten...

522
00:33:21,768 --> 00:33:24,005
And no one is ever in favor
of homelessness...

523
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:27,592
Statewide, you're going up against
the fella who tore up the safety net.

524
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:29,979
Homelessness.

525
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:35,170
I'll be damned.

526
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,060
- Base to twenty-three-oh-six.
- <i>Go ahead, Lester.</i>

527
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:49,441
You see anybody using a cellphone?

528
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:50,701
<i>Wait one.</i>

529
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,206
<i>Negative.</i>

530
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,495
Hold on.

531
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,167
Somebody's here.

532
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,206
Lester...

533
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,407
Can't get used to how empty
this place feels nowadays.

534
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,910
True, but you'd be surprised
what you can get done

535
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,940
when no one's looking
over your shoulder.

536
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:17,981
You'll need to serve these.
Running out of time.

537
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,277
I'll get right on it.

538
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:21,907
There's a couple of loose ends
I think we should cover as well.

539
00:34:22,235 --> 00:34:24,033
- Now?
- If not now, when?

540
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:26,150
The trial date is coming up on us fast.

541
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,866
Right.
But it's uh...

542
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:31,798
Is it something I said?

543
00:34:33,188 --> 00:34:34,208
No, it's...

544
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,870
Sydnor is bringing in a C.I.

545
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:40,414
- And if you're here...
- Oh, shit.

546
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:42,590
I'm sorry.

547
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:47,296
- I'll leave you my list, okay?
- No problem.

548
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:48,873
We'll get right on it.

549
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:51,551
I'm sorry, Lester,
if I was intruding.

550
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,610
You couldn't know.

551
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:02,194
So why you here?

552
00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:04,934
If this about Michael
an' what he into,

553
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:07,025
y'all should know
he don't live here no more.

554
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,314
Actually, I'm following
up on your man's case.

555
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:13,467
You spoke to detective Worden
when it happened.

556
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,709
He was your boyfriend, right?

557
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,414
When he weren't in jail...

558
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:24,139
Father to my youngest.

559
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,671
But you know how he died.

560
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:30,305
Beaten bad.

561
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:32,875
Crime of passion, as we say.

562
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:37,805
Didn't seem like he was home long enough
to get somebody that riled at him.

563
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,951
Unless, of course, it was over you.

564
00:35:41,111 --> 00:35:43,227
What, you sayin'
I know somethin' about that?

565
00:35:43,387 --> 00:35:45,474
Let's put our cards on the table.

566
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:47,582
I been in this game
longer than a little bit,

567
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:50,537
and there's one thing I know from jump.
You get a murder like this,

568
00:35:50,697 --> 00:35:52,620
there's bound to be a woman
at the center of it.

569
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:54,443
I don't know nothin'.

570
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,843
You know my gut tells me that you do.

571
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:01,126
And I'll tell you what...

572
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:03,602
We're gonna take a ride downtown,

573
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,079
let you talk to the grand jury.
You're not straight with them,

574
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,234
they'll slap you
with a material witness warrant.

575
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:11,630
And you sit over at woman's
detention for a couple of weeks.

576
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:14,258
It's amazing what it does
for the grieving process.

577
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:17,441
- Get your things.
- I ain't goin' no damn where.

578
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,152
It's me or the wagon.

579
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:23,654
Detective, I swear, I ain't in this.

580
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:26,880
It ain't me you wanna talk to.

581
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:30,510
It's the boy, he know.

582
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:32,819
He runnin' with them who did it.

583
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:34,779
You{\ just} tryin' to put me
off the scent here.

584
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:36,386
{\No, }You gotta believe me.

585
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,747
He told me Devar wasn't comin' home,
'fore we even knowed he was dead.

586
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:48,513
You said he's runnin' with them?

587
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,014
- Runnin' with who?
- Chris, Snoop, all them gangsters.

588
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:52,964
Who else doin'
all the killin' around here?

589
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,566
Let me see your camera.

590
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,734
Add a minute-six to your times.

591
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,007
Got it.

592
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,787
Here it is. Look at this.

593
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:15,486
Single ring.
Connection. Silence.

594
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:17,242
What do you have?

595
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,100
I took these three.
They're just hangin' around.

596
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:29,236
What time did Monk leave?

597
00:37:30,506 --> 00:37:33,023
One twenty-four.
Two minutes later.

598
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:41,807
It's not what Marlo's sayin',

599
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:44,265
it's what he's sendin'.
Look at Monk.

600
00:37:44,425 --> 00:37:46,743
- Yeah. Text message.
- Text?

601
00:37:47,094 --> 00:37:48,558
Need I remind you, detective,

602
00:37:48,718 --> 00:37:51,314
these young men are products
of Baltimore city schools.

603
00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:54,411
Besides, look how far away
he's holding his phone.

604
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:56,319
Too far away to be reading a text.

605
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:58,888
Naw, son. Pictures.

606
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:02,827
Pictures...

607
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,286
What the fuck you lookin' at?

608
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,429
You know what they do, right?
They tease you.

609
00:38:44,427 --> 00:38:47,772
They let you get close and...
just when you're about to pull the case,

610
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:50,441
they rip the fuckin' rug
out from under you.

611
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:55,042
I'm not lying. We got
a fuckin' serial killer on the loose.

612
00:38:58,309 --> 00:38:59,785
You didn't know that?

613
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,989
It's in the goddamn paper.

614
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:10,970
What support do I get?
One fuckin' detective.

615
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:15,112
They wanna play their
simple-ass games, fine.

616
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:17,805
But I gotta do what I gotta do.
'scuse me.

617
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:23,776
Yeah, Oscar.

618
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,112
Beautiful.

619
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:29,567
Absolutely. Where?

620
00:39:29,885 --> 00:39:30,838
On my way.

621
00:39:59,756 --> 00:40:02,737
Man, you can't
let it get to you like this.

622
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:08,474
Why don't we go buy up a bunch of toys
and take 'em to your kids?

623
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:09,952
You ain't hearin' me.

624
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:12,304
How can I go near my people
with Omar on us?

625
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:13,998
How he gonna find out about them?

626
00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:16,250
How we find out
about the blind man?

627
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:50,973
- Omar, yo, Omar!
- Hey yo, Omar!

628
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:52,462
Get.

629
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,302
You too, shorty.

630
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:09,174
Omar!
It's Omar!

631
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,221
Money a little late today.

632
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:27,761
That buckshot in your leg should help
you some you explain' yourself to Marlo.

633
00:41:28,262 --> 00:41:29,448
As for them other two

634
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:32,108
they gonna wish
that I'd peppered them a bit.

635
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:39,107
Now you make sure
you tell old Marlo I burned the money.

636
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:40,949
'cause it ain't about that paper.

637
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:43,921
It's about me hurtin' his people,
messin' with his world.

638
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:48,467
Tell that boy he ain't man enough
to come down to the street with Omar.

639
00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:50,594
You tell him that!

640
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,541
My Sergeant and two side
partners got here before me.

641
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:05,126
Then the shift commander showed.
Now the duty officer is on his way.

642
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:07,391
- For a D.O.A.?
- Yeah, well,

643
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,734
you and Lester
started some shit here, son.

644
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:13,621
Now a D.O.A. call
brings everyone in a heartbeat.

645
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:03,909
God bless.

646
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:15,741
Pictures?

647
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,646
Photographs on cellphones.

648
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:22,257
Now that means new P.C.
to capture the photos,

649
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:24,544
and new equipment that could do it.

650
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:30,087
How do I write that into
my bullshit homeless killer's M.O.?

651
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:33,204
When we started this,

652
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:35,405
you said all we needed were some bugs,

653
00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:37,417
a camera or two,
and in a couple of weeks,

654
00:43:37,577 --> 00:43:39,526
we'd have them.
That's what you said.

655
00:43:40,732 --> 00:43:42,772
So I cranked up my
bullshit to pay for that,

656
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:45,174
but no, then you
needed a wiretap.

657
00:43:45,505 --> 00:43:47,437
So I went along with that,
I got you the wiretap.

658
00:43:47,597 --> 00:43:49,605
Then you ask for surveillance teams,

659
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:51,971
but before I can get to that,
you came to me with this.

660
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:53,968
I mean, what the fuck?

661
00:43:57,056 --> 00:43:58,684
I gotta tell you, Lester,

662
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:02,315
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but I can see why Daniels cringed

663
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:04,186
every time
you opened your fucking mouth.

664
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:05,896
You're a supervisor's nightmare.

665
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,315
I'm just following the thread.

666
00:44:22,934 --> 00:44:26,542
Okay, say we get you the intercept on
your pictures, will that give us Marlo?

667
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:28,571
It'll be coded, probably,

668
00:44:29,688 --> 00:44:31,171
but I'm sure we can break it.

669
00:44:31,331 --> 00:44:33,076
That'll tell us
how they do business,

670
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:36,135
and usually, that's enough.
Or not.

671
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:40,151
But the truth is,
I'm running Sydnor ragged

672
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,686
just staying on a couple of mopes
and monitoring calls.

673
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,168
Now, when we're up on their code,
we're going to need more manpower

674
00:44:46,328 --> 00:44:48,474
to run down a stash or a re-up.
We can't do it all.

675
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:51,240
I can't juke this thing
any more than I have.

676
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,415
Last night, half the police department

677
00:44:53,575 --> 00:44:56,562
turned up at Oscar's crime scene
before I could get there.

678
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:00,534
We can't make another murder.

679
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:12,639
Thanks for the milk.

680
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:15,026
What's a donut without milk?

681
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:21,573
So you were talking about
your second tour...

682
00:45:22,158 --> 00:45:23,981
The bad one, yeah.

683
00:45:25,194 --> 00:45:27,728
Second tour fucked me up good.
But they don't wanna hear it.

684
00:45:28,056 --> 00:45:29,293
Who doesn't?

685
00:45:29,953 --> 00:45:32,483
Mostly, it's command
and the Senior E.M.S.

686
00:45:32,868 --> 00:45:35,489
Put it down that marines
don't get P.T.S.D.

687
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,820
But they do.

688
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:39,500
Can you tell me what happened?

689
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:45,954
Terry, can you talk about it?

690
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:50,053
We had a month left on the tour,

691
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:53,127
working an s-and-a mission
outside Fallujah.

692
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:55,067
I was assistant team leader.

693
00:45:56,082 --> 00:45:58,467
Our m-niner, niner, eights
were retritted with up-armor kits.

694
00:45:58,968 --> 00:46:00,513
M-niner-niner-eight?

695
00:46:01,045 --> 00:46:02,151
A humvee,

696
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,409
sorry.
They're big on nomenclature.

697
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:10,979
Anyway we finished our sweep,
headed back in, right? It was all good.

698
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,381
Then, bam...

699
00:46:13,442 --> 00:46:16,026
Our lead vehicle was hit
with an elevated I.E.D.

700
00:46:16,413 --> 00:46:19,000
The blast tore
the m-fifty gunner in half.

701
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,948
Flipped the humvee
like a matchbox car.

702
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:22,953
Driver lost both his hands.

703
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,644
Blood shooting out all over.
He's fuckin' laughin',

704
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:28,603
saying over and over,
"Look, ma, no hands."

705
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,548
It's the laughing I can't shake.

706
00:46:39,116 --> 00:46:40,093
Weird.

707
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:43,385
'cause he's okay, you know?
I mean, he's better than me.

708
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:46,970
Got himself
a couple of prosthetic mitts,

709
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,670
eighty thousand apiece.

710
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:00,520
What happened next?

711
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:02,575
Nothing really.

712
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:05,033
We pushed out,
secured the perimeter.

713
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:08,613
Corpsman did what he could,
an' we waited for the cas-evac.

714
00:47:58,124 --> 00:48:00,240
Look, I'm not looking
to shit on another guy's copy,

715
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,257
I just wanted you to know
this was out there.

716
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:04,304
I'm at a community meeting
in Bel Air-Edison

717
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,968
to hear about school zoning and
this woman talked my ear off about this.

718
00:48:08,128 --> 00:48:10,224
She said the kids never saw a dime.

719
00:48:12,603 --> 00:48:14,947
I mean, I'm hoping
this is all bullshit.

720
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,273
- Hey{\, Scott}. How's it coming?
- Pretty good.

721
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:20,813
- You seen the art?
- Yeah,{\ yeah. Good stuff,} good stuff. Listen,

722
00:48:20,973 --> 00:48:23,718
we got a complaint about a story
you wrote a couple weeks ago.

723
00:48:23,878 --> 00:48:26,313
The one about the woman who died
from an allery{\allergic reaction} to seafood,

724
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:27,547
- Remember?
- And?{\What about it?}

725
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:29,669
Neighborhood lady
knows the dead woman's sister

726
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:31,824
says our story made a lot of money
for those kids,

727
00:48:31,984 --> 00:48:33,972
- a scholarship fund we wrote up.
- Yeah? So...

728
00:48:34,132 --> 00:48:37,668
She says the sister has a history
of fraud, convictions on it.

729
00:48:38,412 --> 00:48:41,968
She says all the money went to Atlantic
city casinos and kids never saw a dime.

730
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,007
- Christ, who the fuck...
- I know.

731
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,010
It's probably some old biddy
talkin' about stuff she don't know,

732
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,680
but maybe you should go
back and check with the family,

733
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,026
see if we don't get took on this, huh?

734
00:48:57,395 --> 00:48:59,652
No, no. Not now.
After you file.

735
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,650
Just make a couple calls, huh?

736
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:11,868
- This is kidnapping.
- Actually, I'm not sure.

737
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,497
I asked him if he wanted and talk

738
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:18,693
- and he walked to my car.
- You give him the hundred?

739
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:21,178
Stuffed it in his jacket.

740
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:25,138
He's fine, Lester.
He's great.

741
00:49:26,368 --> 00:49:29,203
- Think he'll find his way back home?
- Eventually.

742
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,392
By then, we'll be done with Marlo,
we'll have shut this thing down.

743
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,948
And as far as
what happened to this guy...

744
00:49:35,737 --> 00:49:37,895
They'll write it off
as some fraternity prank.

745
00:49:39,297 --> 00:49:41,901
- Does he know we're cops?
- No.

746
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,735
And even if he figures it out,
who's gonna believe him? He's nuts.

747
00:49:44,895 --> 00:49:47,613
- How do you know he's nuts?
- First of all, just look at him.

748
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:49,541
He's fucking bouncing off the walls.

749
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:51,366
Second of all...
I got his scrip.

750
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:54,661
I called the university E.R.
It's an anti-psychotic.

751
00:49:55,219 --> 00:49:56,152
So...

752
00:49:57,476 --> 00:49:58,561
I took his I.D.,

753
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:01,431
I'll scratch his name off the scrip

754
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:03,503
and leave him with this...

755
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:07,140
I got that one from the first
homeless death Oscar gave us.

756
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:10,093
The one that was too rigored.
Donald somebody or other.

757
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:12,679
It had him in a Cleveland,
Ohio shelter.

758
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:16,808
McNulty, you are deserving
of serious psychological study.

759
00:50:17,257 --> 00:50:19,634
You need P.C.
to intercept cellphone photos.

760
00:50:19,794 --> 00:50:21,188
Well here it is, right here.

761
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:23,441
We send photos of this guy

762
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:25,776
all ribboned up
from a dry cellphone

763
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:29,415
to that goofy reporter, along with
a message bitching about his stories.

764
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:31,432
"I ain't no pervert," or whatever.

765
00:50:31,592 --> 00:50:34,276
Now, the killer says,
you ain't gonna find no more bodies.

766
00:50:34,436 --> 00:50:35,827
Only photos of the victims...

767
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,016
Before they disappear.

768
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:44,044
Look at this poor sucker.

769
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:46,248
I don't believe we're gonna do this.

770
00:50:46,408 --> 00:50:49,829
He disappears, the city goes batshit.
You get your photo intercepts,

771
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:52,276
and by the time we need
to run down one of Marlo's re-ups,

772
00:50:52,436 --> 00:50:54,065
you got all the
manpower you need.

773
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:55,472
And Marlo falls.

774
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:56,807
Fall hard.

775
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:22,407
Don't fucking tell me
you mislabeled ts too.

776
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,836
I want comparisons
between known suspects

777
00:51:26,777 --> 00:51:28,296
and the D.N.A. from this scene.

778
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:31,800
By the looks of it, we got a whole
lot of D.N.A. outta this mess.

779
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:35,011
- Now, motherfucker. Right now.
- Top of my list.

780
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:39,181
As soon as we work through all the trace
from the homeless killings.

781
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,476
That's the priority, Bunk.

782
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:45,230
The homeless killings.

783
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,645
Everything is backed up
behind that, sorry.

784
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:51,282
Your boy McNulty has
everyone's attention right now.

785
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:08,904
So it's Larry, huh?

786
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,341
Okay, Larry.
You're with good people here.

787
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:15,069
It's all gonna be great.

788
00:52:18,183 --> 00:52:21,460
You're gonna like this place.
It's warm, they got nice beds.

789
00:52:23,801 --> 00:52:27,367
And best of all, I gave you cash money
just for walking in the door.

790
00:52:32,598 --> 00:52:34,000
Come on, Larry.

791
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:38,351
It's goin' to be fine.
I promise.

792
00:52:48,254 --> 00:52:50,754
You feel up for trying Clay yourself?

793
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:54,914
I mean, it's been a while since
you tried a criminal case personally.

794
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:56,840
It sends a statement, I think.

795
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,096
We should start with our witness list.
See if we can pare that down any,

796
00:53:00,256 --> 00:53:03,044
out of respect for the distracted nature
of a Baltimore jury.

797
00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:03,999
First,

798
00:53:05,117 --> 00:53:07,062
there's something else
I need to bring up.

799
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,719
- Old grand jury stuff?
- Sealed indictments.

800
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:17,405
Sealed transcripts.

801
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:18,775
Dozens of them.

802
00:53:19,253 --> 00:53:21,451
Pulled from the desk
of a shot-to-death drug dealer

803
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:23,051
in east Baltimore.

804
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,664
The deputy ops brought me those.

805
00:53:26,128 --> 00:53:27,603
We have a leak.

806
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:51,716
And he showed up,

807
00:53:52,236 --> 00:53:54,317
outside where I work.
He was confused.

808
00:53:54,716 --> 00:53:56,886
Lost I think. So I brought him here.

809
00:53:57,423 --> 00:53:59,447
Donald, where you from?

810
00:54:04,368 --> 00:54:06,190
Tell the lady, Donald.

811
00:54:09,988 --> 00:54:10,876
Baltimore.

812
00:54:11,843 --> 00:54:14,296
But he told me
he came from Cleveland.

813
00:54:17,402 --> 00:54:19,503
Do you have identification?

814
00:54:41,357 --> 00:54:42,963
This does say cleveland.

815
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,293
Donald, why don't we
get you something to eat?

816
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,522
It's okay. Come on.

817
00:54:57,645 --> 00:54:58,874
We're good to go?

818
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:00,336
It's great, Gus.

819
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,408
It sings.

820
00:55:03,488 --> 00:55:04,595
Hey, Scottie boy.

821
00:55:05,488 --> 00:55:06,992
Hey. Great piece.

822
00:55:07,152 --> 00:55:09,101
I mean this one really feels
like the real deal.

823
00:55:09,261 --> 00:55:10,839
- It's great work.
- Thanks.

824
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,873
What I like most about it
is that you didn't overwrite it.

825
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,413
No extra color.
No puffy adjectives. Just...

826
00:55:16,931 --> 00:55:18,485
tight, declarative sentences.

827
00:55:18,645 --> 00:55:20,737
You really let this ex-marine
just tell his story.

828
00:55:20,897 --> 00:55:23,573
- Thanks, Gus.
- Hey, Mr. Slot man,

829
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:25,005
read it and weep.

830
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:27,153
And I mean that literally.

831
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,631
Oh, hey, Scott.
Did you get a chance to...

832
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:33,036
- drop a couple calls on that complaint?
- It's bullshit.

833
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:34,959
I talked to people
in the neighborhood.

834
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,973
Sister's good people, but
there's another woman,

835
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:39,529
up there, unrelated,

836
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:42,894
keeps getting arrested
for kiting checks and stuff, and she...

837
00:55:43,054 --> 00:55:45,780
uses the sister's name
every time she gets locked up.

838
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,667
She's done it like
three or four times{\ now}.

839
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:49,334
- No shit.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

840
00:55:49,634 --> 00:55:51,434
But sister's clean.
Everyone says so.

841
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,373
Okay.

842
00:56:32,182 --> 00:56:33,935
Is there anything else
I can do for him?

843
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:36,651
No, we've got it.
But thanks for bringing him in.

844
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:39,103
Most people, they just ignore them.

845
00:56:48,598 --> 00:56:50,785
I just want to get all of
your paperwork taken care of...
