1
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,254
Now they're on line.

2
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,464
This is masked as Marlo's cell number?

3
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:25,260
How the fuck, how?

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,072
Spoofed to imitate a call stream

5
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:29,498
like it's a phone company switch.

6
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:31,783
We can put any digits in we want.

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,019
Meanwhile,

8
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,038
phone company paperwork on the case

9
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:38,001
has the cell we gave to Sydnor.
It's fairly basic shit.

10
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:46,984
Now, stick
to the script.

11
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,285
We don't want any tell-tales.

12
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:51,498
Even with the voice modulator,

13
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:53,344
you're exposed here.

14
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:55,925
<i>Seven-baker-fourteen.</i>

15
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,288
<i>Bga, go ahead fourteen.</i>

16
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:02,359
<i>Fourteen. I got a vehicle
blocking an entrance.</i>

17
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:04,527
<i>Four hundred pressman.</i>

18
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:12,118
What the--

19
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:14,778
Oh, shit.

20
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,365
- Templeton.
- Hey, you--

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,317
Where do you get off,
you sick little twist? Sexual?

22
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,881
I'm not sexual with them.
I'm not abusive with them.

23
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,113
How dare you write that in your paper
without knowing nothing about me--

24
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:32,697
- What?
- Biting's not sex, it's biting.

25
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:34,639
I'm not sick like that.

26
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,673
Hang on--
Hang on, hang on.

27
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Maybe I should come bite you.</i>

28
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,132
Would you like that, Scotty?

29
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:43,291
I bet you would like that.
Am I right?

30
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:46,797
<i>You write about me like I'm sick.
You're the sick one, you know that?</i>

31
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,324
<i>Is that why you like me, Scotty?</i>

32
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,615
Is that why?

33
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:52,220
Fuck me--

34
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,364
Yeah, this is holley,
Baltimore homicide.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,351
I need a trap-and-trace on case
oh-eight, h-one-fourteen.

36
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:01,459
Cell phone is in use right now.

37
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:05,064
<i>I could come bite you;
you tell me how sexual it is.</i>

38
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:08,264
Okay, hang on.
Who, where are you--

39
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,051
Here's what's happening now.

40
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,343
<i>You humiliate me like that?</i>

41
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:13,888
You mortify me like that

42
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,891
in front of my father?
My father's father?

43
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:19,102
<i>Listen to me,
smack daddy, crack daddy,</i>

44
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:20,645
<i>little baby whack daddy,</i>

45
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,870
Here's what's happening.

46
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,252
You ain't never
going to find them anymore.

47
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,506
You ait never
gonna see them no more.

48
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,236
I'm sending you something right now.
You take a good look at this guy,

49
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,367
<i>because you ain't never
going to see him no more.</i>

50
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,655
Hey, okay.

51
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,530
Don't hang up.
Can we--

52
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:39,685
Oh, shit.

53
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,790
- Did you get Mcnulty?
- Just his voicemail.

54
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,031
Oh, Christ.

55
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:45,723
That was--
That was him.

56
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:49,266
Again!

57
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:51,885
Nice bawlmer accent.

58
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:53,604
It's my heritage.

59
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:57,357
<i>Has traced the phone in question
to pier five on pratt street.</i>

60
00:02:57,517 --> 00:03:00,531
<i>All units respond to that twenty
and detain anyone present</i>

61
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,990
<i>pending the arrival
of a duty officer.</i>

62
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,532
<i>One-baker-ten, copy that.
I'm rolling.</i>

63
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,275
<i>One-ker-thirteen,
I'm almost there.</i>

64
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,693
<i>Kga to all units.
Be advised that we're looking</i>

65
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:13,347
<i>for a ten-thirty individual
on a cell phone.</i>

66
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,160
Anyone on a phone?

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,038
Not that I saw. Just some people
moving through, but it could be anybody.

68
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,667
- Let's just fan out and take names.
- Go down this road.

69
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,190
Get their names over there.

70
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,834
- Get everybody up in this area now.
- Stop.

71
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,764
What the hell is this?

72
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,109
- Let go of me.
- Get on the ground now.

73
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:34,951
Get your hands up!
Step out!

74
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:39,130
Get everody over there
and get their cell phones.

75
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:42,203
I need everyone to take out
your cell phones

76
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,197
and place them on the table
in front of you.

77
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,522
He didn't do anything.

78
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:47,319
What are you doing?

79
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,057
Sarge, we got him.

80
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:09,767
- Bullshit.
- I got him on tape.

81
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:12,466
- The goof actually called.
- Yeah, yeah, it was sweet--

82
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:15,301
Hey, what'd I miss?

83
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,524
He went off on a tangent.
Said he wanted to bite me.

84
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:23,884
- What?
- Bite you how?

85
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:25,979
{\Scott, }Are you saying that he threatened to--

86
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,939
Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

87
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,286
Holy Christ.

88
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,890
- So are we partners or what?
- No, Clay.

89
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,277
I don't pick so much as a single juror

90
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:25,968
without a full amount
of my fee being paid.

91
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:29,612
If you want Billy Murphy on your case,
you got to pay to put him there.

92
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,813
I got a taste for you right up front.

93
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,969
A good, five-figure taste.

94
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,890
But you asking for me to pay
a winner's fee right up front,

95
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,575
and you know what?
I ain't a winner yet.

96
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:42,541
Right now, with the sword
hanging over my head,

97
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,373
I don't have the kind of
financial support at my disposal

98
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,705
that I would ordinarily be able
to rely upon, you feel?

99
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,764
So the money boys are laying off{\, huh}?

100
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:54,053
Oh, they thinkin' short
when they should be thinkin' long.

101
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,658
Shameful shit.

102
00:06:56,597 --> 00:07:00,047
25,000, 25,000 more
when you seat a jury.

103
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,524
I don't work that way.

104
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:04,460
I know you don't, partner,
I know you don't.

105
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,455
And normally, I wouldn't dream
of asking you to suit up

106
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:09,724
for game day with my tab, as it is.

107
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,112
200,000

108
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:13,342
when I get you out
from under this mess.

109
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,262
And Clay,
don't fuck me.

110
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:19,124
Don't even think about fucking me
out of a single part of that fee.

111
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,758
Oh, Billy, you talk
as if you don't know me.

112
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,281
I'm disappointed.

113
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,799
I am.

114
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,724
My brother, let's be fair.

115
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,763
I'm providing you
with the opportunity

116
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:31,391
to go head to head
with the state's attorney

117
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,990
in a case that's gonna be
front page news.

118
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:35,806
For all that profile?

119
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:38,713
Sheet, partner,
you should be payin' me a fee.

120
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,090
Seriously, dawg, for 20,000

121
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,139
cash to my campaign committee,

122
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:46,857
I'll get myself indicted federal,
let you go to trial on that.

123
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:50,183
Beat the feds like a stepchild,
an' really make a name for yourself.

124
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:52,352
Fuck you?

125
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:54,698
Naw, son,
I'm gonna make you.

126
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,491
Motherfuckers gonna be wipin' they ass
with Johnnie Cochran's memory,

127
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:01,768
and carryin' your business card
in every damn pocket before we done.

128
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:03,062
No.

129
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:06,404
I already got more rep
than any lawyer would ever nee

130
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,079
why don't you save that silver-tongued
bullshit for the jury?

131
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,643
Right.

132
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,140
No, nothing since.

133
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:18,890
Alright.

134
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,384
Me, Barlow and Kincaid
been sittin' here

135
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:27,424
like the fucking maytag repairmen,
growing piles.

136
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:30,524
- Nothing, not a call. Then, bang.
- No luck at the harbor.

137
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:33,950
We were tracking the G.P.S. then
it just goes dead. Area of pier five.

138
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:36,524
- Where's Mcnulty right now?
- He's over at the newspaper.

139
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,689
Let's hear that motherfucker again.

140
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,112
<i>Hey, you-- </i>

141
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:44,529
<i>Where do you get off,
you sick little twist?</i>

142
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,907
Sounds like some gearhead
from dundalk.

143
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:55,981
And emotionally,
how was he?

144
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:58,980
- He sounded pissed.
- At you, personally?

145
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:02,229
Like I told you,
he said I humiliated him

146
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,622
by writing that the biting was sexual.

147
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:06,926
At the end, he offered
to come here and bite me.

148
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:11,170
I didn't really respond to that.

149
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:15,768
- Did he sound like the same guy?
- What do you mean?

150
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:18,365
Did it sound like the same voice
you heard on the first call?

151
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:21,524
Right. Yeah.
No, actually.

152
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,417
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

153
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,154
It was the same,
but this time I noticed

154
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:27,918
he had a real thick bawlmer accent.

155
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:29,168
Real thick.

156
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,454
You didn't notice
that theirst time, huh?

157
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:32,994
I guess I did, but I forgot.

158
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,870
- Did I screw up in any way?
- No. Not at all.

159
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:40,909
Listen, we reserve the right
to make this decision,

160
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:42,229
but that said,

161
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,090
would running these photos
in any way impair the investigation?

162
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,359
I don't think so.

163
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,529
Fact is, we need as many eyes as we can
looking for this homeless guy.

164
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:52,096
- You don't know where is guy is, huh?
- He could be--

165
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:54,307
Could already be a victim, sure.

166
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:55,783
Jesus.

167
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:01,904
That's Charles and Conway.
I wonder if he's a regular out there.

168
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:03,751
He had to have used
a different phone{\though}.

169
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,035
Had to be{\have been} a cell phone
if he sent you these.

170
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:07,474
That's true. But...

171
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,031
again, you can't print

172
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,083
anything about where
he's calling from.

173
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:14,006
We're trying to get up
on that cell phone.

174
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,684
What should I do if he calls again?

175
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:17,602
Keep him on the line
as long as you can.

176
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:20,124
Don't spook him.
Guy likes to rant. Let him do his thing.

177
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:23,002
You okay?

178
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,857
- Me?
- Yeah, I guess.

179
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,382
I wouldn't worry;
he's just using you. He needs you.

180
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,721
I kind of resent that, actually.

181
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,145
I dunno. It's workin' out pretty well
for both of you, right?

182
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:39,492
Gentlemen--
Thanks for these.

183
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:48,391
Callin' Vincent on his cell all morning,
he still ain't answer.

184
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:49,990
Ain't got time for this.

185
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,567
Re-up time will come due,
we still ain't picked up the mannitol.

186
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:58,521
What the fuck?

187
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:02,991
Yo, Vincent.

188
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:04,849
Where you at?

189
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:06,814
Manny?

190
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:11,512
Shit.

191
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,858
- Omar.
- Why you still alive then?

192
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,945
He say tell Marlo
he out in the streets, waitin'.

193
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,527
Say this whole damn city gonna know
Marlo ain't man enough

194
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:34,991
to come down in the streets.

195
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:36,742
- He get the stash?
- Yo, Cherry.

196
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,851
He blew Manny up
as soon as he got inside.

197
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,580
He was gonna do me, too.
How the fuck he get inside?

198
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,583
Manny open up
to go on the food run,

199
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,215
an' this dicksucker
was right there.

200
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,559
He knew we was the stash.

201
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,024
Ain't need to be told shit.

202
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:52,415
He just knew.

203
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,491
Four key of raw; flushed.

204
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,208
Hey, yo, Cherry.
You gonna untie me, right?

205
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,354
C'mon, nigga,
untie me--

206
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,230
Seriously, Steven.

207
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,890
If you can't afford it,
that's fine, I understand.

208
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,803
And if you think this clown is gonna
hold me off and keep the statehouse,

209
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:17,867
{\then }I know you have to hedge your bets given
how much you're waiting on fm Annapolis.

210
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:20,493
{\But }If you're gonna choose a side
on this thing, please, do it early.

211
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,497
- That's all I'm saying.
- <i>I hear ya, Tom</i>.

212
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:25,844
<i>You know what, I'm going to write out
a check today, and send it out the door.</i>

213
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:28,830
That's great, Steven;
really, I do appreciate it.

214
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:30,419
Can you...

215
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:33,119
Can I ask you to consider--

216
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,336
<i>I'll double down on that
for my wife, too.</i>

217
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:37,077
For your wife, too.

218
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,200
That's just great, really.

219
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,624
Yeah. Thanks
for going the extra mile on this.

220
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:45,768
<i>No problem, Tom.</i>

221
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,350
Photographs?

222
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:53,930
He messaged digital photos
of the possible victim

223
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,754
to the <i>Sun</i> reporter.

224
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,705
I've canvassed this guy's
regular corner,

225
00:12:57,865 --> 00:12:59,790
and he has indeed
been missing a couple days.

226
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,601
We got these photos from the newspaper,

227
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,749
but we want to be able
to intercept {\any }future images--

228
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,422
Hence the amended order.

229
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,703
Correct.

230
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:10,890
Can we catch photos
with our city equipment?

231
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,890
Actually, no. We're still bumping around
in the 20th century.

232
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,064
But Howard County has the right software
on a couple of their computers.

233
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:18,426
You need two?

234
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:23,848
Yeah, in case one computer goes down,
we got the other one as back-up.

235
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:26,845
We don't wanna Miss our shot
at this nut.

236
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:29,865
Well, good hunting.

237
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:33,715
Thank you, judge.

238
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,195
Oh, Ronnie.

239
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,687
You briefed your boss?

240
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,291
And he's calling the Mayor, right?

241
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:46,120
And Rawls too, I imagine.

242
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,666
Pretty little fella

243
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:51,364
gets himself elected
on a law and order ticket.

244
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:52,878
Crime doesn't go down much,

245
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:53,885
and then,

246
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,711
a couple weeks before he starts
gearing up to announce for governor,

247
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,611
some wingnut starts killing people,

248
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,163
taking photographs,
sending 'em to the newspaper.

249
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:04,599
You know something? You may wanna check
the Governor's alibi.

250
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,386
You know?

251
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:14,690
Thanks.

252
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:22,364
You couldn't make thirty?

253
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:23,797
Twenty?

254
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:26,786
Ninety-two.

255
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,524
I'm gonna tell you something.
There are a lot of people

256
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:32,842
who want Tommy Carcetti
to be their fuckin' Governor.

257
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:35,122
And I can't imagine
what they're thinking.

258
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:38,691
Ninety-two, Norman, in a single morning.
It is a new record.

259
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:40,497
The motherfucker
killing homeless guys?

260
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:42,742
He grabbed one{\ off the street},
wrapped a ribbon on his wrist,

261
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:45,721
sent a photo to the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>,
saying we won't find the body.

262
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:46,790
He--what?

263
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,151
The newspaper's
gonna run the photos.

264
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,268
Bill Rawls.

265
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,597
I need him on the line now.

266
00:14:57,484 --> 00:14:59,187
* you rascal you

267
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,615
* I'll be glad when you're dead,
you rascal you *

268
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:11,475
Look at ya,
ya baby-bumpin' motherfucker.

269
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,077
Look at you.

270
00:15:15,943 --> 00:15:16,835
Let's go.

271
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:20,764
Deputy wants as much of my squad
as I can wrangle upstairs right now.

272
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:24,026
We're going large Richard
on Mcnulty's serial killer.

273
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,923
I'm working my cases.

274
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,331
Bunk,
command performance.

275
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,624
The deputy wants bodies.
The Mayor's spewing over this thing.

276
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,084
I'm not going.

277
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,864
What?
You don't see those on my sleeve?

278
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:43,190
- Plain as fuckin' day, Bunk.
- I'm doing police work here.

279
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,087
In fact, I have a fresh angle
on last year's Major case,

280
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:48,983
on which I'm the sole
remaining investigator.

281
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,244
So fuck your stripes
and fuck Mcnulty,

282
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,032
and fuck your big-dick red ball.

283
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,151
If you can't work with that,
then just write me the fuck up,

284
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,378
and ship my ass to a trial board.

285
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:11,834
So, for starters, Alma stays with the
investigation, and detectives downtown.

286
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,917
You don't go home
without checking for updates

287
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,885
before the e-dot
and double-dot editions.

288
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:17,441
So the case file is Mcnulty,

289
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,852
with the rest of his squad
as immediate support.

290
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,434
Lieutenant d'Addario's shift
will man the wiretap.

291
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:25,325
In addition to Alma and Scott,
Olesker will have a column coming.

292
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,239
Fletcher, I want you
on homeless react,

293
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,064
also interviews with advocates
and experts talking up the problem.

294
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:31,683
Melody, you get on the phone

295
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:34,455
with the whitecoats
at Clifton T. Perkins or wherever,

296
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:37,642
and work up a sidebar on what it means
when a whackjob kills somebody and wants

297
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:39,165
to talk to reporters about it.

298
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:40,989
Greg, I've been scanning the casework,

299
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,053
and I note that while there have been
numerous field interviews and canvasses;

300
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,008
we haven't done much
with background work

301
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:48,674
on victims and families.
If you could take charge of that--

302
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,011
Colonel Tomlin,

303
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,466
we're going to need tactical
to provide surveillance cars

304
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:54,600
and undercover decoys
where the homeless gather.

305
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:57,128
We need to be in the street, proactive.

306
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:59,690
This case is as much
about preventing another

307
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,935
abduction or murder
as it is about making an arrest--

308
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,196
Thing is, we can't work
this one with the phone.

309
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,590
We need to be in the street,
at eye level--

310
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,243
We need to keep the media
as part of the equation.

311
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,090
This reporter that's been contacted--
He's in the middle of it.

312
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,983
That may be a way
to solve this thing.

313
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,941
You're in the middle this{\ now}, so while
we're still going to present this

314
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:19,617
as a first-person piece
on your latest contact with the killer,

315
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:21,990
Alma's still going to interview
you for the mainbar.

316
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,500
{\Now, }Mcnulty's preliminary checks
with shelter workers,

317
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,259
and a canvass of Conway and Charles,

318
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,317
indicates that our victim
is indeed missing,

319
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,784
but when we get a full I.D.,

320
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:32,684
we need toun every connection
to make sure this isn't a hoax.

321
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,376
Chief, we're going to need
to pull bodies from district ops

322
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,519
to give homicide
their own surveillance arm.

323
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:40,629
And having had some experience
in the politics of staffing,

324
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,562
I leave it to Mcnulty
to pick the people.

325
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,147
For once, people, I am assured

326
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:48,162
that the resources we need
to work this story will be there for us.

327
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:51,517
So let's surround this mess
and report the hell out of it.

328
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:54,149
This one's got legs.

329
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,457
I am now told,
by the Mayor directly,

330
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,447
that there will be
no overtime restrictions,

331
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:00,868
no staffing limits on this case.

332
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,963
So put this case down.

333
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:07,158
Police work.
Whaddaya know?

334
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:14,090
Good day.
Six g-packs so far.

335
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:16,624
New package be
droppin' them fiends.

336
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:17,678
Yeah.

337
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,668
Probably need one more re-up.

338
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,491
Career day on the corner, hanh?

339
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:25,015
Step off, nigga.

340
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:30,857
Hey, Mike, check this out.

341
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:32,691
"Certified hydrotherapist,

342
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,959
"experience with geri-atric patients,

343
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,612
- Sinai hospital outpatient clinic."
- Jerry who?

344
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:41,573
Whatever, how about this--
"dental front desk,

345
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,108
high quality dental office
seeks front desk."

346
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:47,805
- What do they mean, like furniture?
- Like a secretary, I guess.

347
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,772
Man, you ain't even
ever been to no dentist.

348
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:51,780
"Huhvac maintenance
supervisor."

349
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:54,624
What the fuck is a huhvac?

350
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,424
"H-V-A-C."
Maybe they spelled it bad.

351
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:59,215
"Systems manager
in a deadline driven environment."

352
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,592
Man, ain't nothing there.

353
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:02,751
And even if there was,
you ain't sixteen,

354
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:05,097
and y'all got to pick up Bug
after three--

355
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:06,851
Hang on--

356
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:11,124
"Exotic dancer, downtown
financial district lunch time hours--

357
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:14,273
Must be flexible in body and mind."

358
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:16,984
Now we talking--

359
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:23,724
Make it rain on 'em.

360
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,191
Make it rain.

361
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:26,827
- Hold up.
- Time out.

362
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:32,851
Fuck did I do?

363
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,691
If we don't know,
then you do.

364
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:36,431
This is bullshit.

365
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:44,479
Yo, don't forget about Bug.

366
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:47,359
As this is an ongoing investigation,

367
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,392
I'm going to ask
that you direct questions

368
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:51,702
to the police officials
best equipped to answer.

369
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:54,907
These new developments in the case
of the homeless slayings in our city

370
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:58,307
are troubling and tragic
and unacceptable.

371
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:02,563
We are now doing everything possible
to locate and identify the individual

372
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:06,250
depicted in the photographs
sent to the "Baltimore Sun" today.

373
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,588
We are endeavoring to protect
other homeless citizens,

374
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:12,998
and we are pursuing the suspect
with every means at our disposal.

375
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:15,619
I have made clear
to my police commanders

376
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,669
that they have my full confidence

377
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:20,717
and the authority to employ
whatever resources they require.

378
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:22,923
And let mee unequivocal--

379
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:25,886
this man will be brought to justice.
Thank you.

380
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,763
Mr. Mayor--
Mr. Mayor--

381
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:49,758
Voice and digital photos.

382
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:52,329
He calls again,
you'll capture either one.

383
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,490
I can do those background checks myself,

384
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,539
- there's no need to--
- You heard the deputy.

385
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,380
He specifically assigned Greggs.

386
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,624
- Greggs has an open triple.
- And this squad has your serial killer,

387
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:06,705
- and the case is shit-hot.
- I don't need--

388
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,321
You are the point man
on the motherfucker who's now missing.

389
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:11,932
You don't have time to be working
backgrounds on the older cases.

390
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,560
It goes to greggs;
end of fucking story.

391
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,155
Now...

392
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:19,273
What else do you need?

393
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:24,117
I'm gonna need those surveillance teams
{\as this thing sprawls},

394
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:26,115
but for right now,
let me pull his{\this guy's} I.D.

395
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,017
as fast as I can,
figure what he's about.

396
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:29,854
{\And }After that, I'll have more to spin off.

397
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:33,758
- Voice analysis of the call?
- Shit, I don't believe in that shit.

398
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,851
Next thing I know, you'll want me to go
to {\fucking }Quantico with this fucking thing.

399
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:38,624
As a matter of fact--

400
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:43,922
You don't believe in behavioral
forensics, Dr. Moreland?

401
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:46,884
I don't believe in much
of anything at this point.

402
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,761
{\Well, }It doesn't fucking matter
what any of us believe at this point.

403
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,762
You turned on the fuckin' tap, Jimmy.

404
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:56,270
They're finally paying
for police work again.

405
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,108
Proud of yourselves?

406
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:09,281
We're close to Marlo.
A week or two at most.

407
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:12,075
How does it feel
getting Greggs pulled off her triple?

408
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,829
How does it feel knowing that you got
surveillance teams out there,

409
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:18,832
and district units, and tactical--
All of 'em chasin' bullshit.

410
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:22,294
We're gonna use the surveillance teams,{\ actually.}
They're gonna help us bring in the case.

411
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:25,133
I don't even want to know whose picture
you got running in the paper,

412
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:27,591
or where that motherfucker
actually happens to be.

413
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:34,097
Names and addresses;
whater you got.

414
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:38,361
Don't kill yourself.

415
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:39,476
Shit.

416
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:41,550
Don't worry, son.

417
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,641
I got you covered on all this.

418
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,730
Listen, one other thing.

419
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:54,368
I'm getting' my kid for an overnight.
Where do I get kid's furniture?

420
00:22:55,103 --> 00:22:55,994
Ikea.

421
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:58,538
See y'all.

422
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:00,840
Shame on y'all.

423
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:02,667
I mean it.

424
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:09,504
- <i>Trace lab.</i>
- It's Moreland.

425
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,204
<i>You just called.</i>

426
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:14,378
I know,
and I'm callin' again.

427
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:17,824
I need the tracework on oh-six-h-

428
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:19,890
two-seven-one,
and I need it now.

429
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,724
<i>I know, he hasn't been
around to it yet.</i>

430
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:26,570
Well, tell him I called,
and tell him I'm gonna keep calling

431
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,077
until he feels
my fucking pain, a-ight?

432
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:35,742
Gift-wrapped.

433
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:40,991
Number one.

434
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:53,427
Fuck.

435
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:56,758
How the fuck do they expect me
to get this shit done on my own?

436
00:23:57,317 --> 00:23:59,764
Broke ass department
ain't even payin'--

437
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:01,601
You okay?

438
00:24:04,117 --> 00:24:06,524
It's fucked up.
It's all fucked up, okay?

439
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:09,790
I could make a red go to black
'cept for these cheap motherfuckers--

440
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,383
Whaddaya got?

441
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:16,724
Good snitch put the finger on an eyeball
wit been duckin' me.

442
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:20,484
He lays up at this one girl's place
at Athol avenue, right?

443
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:22,957
Comes in late,
but he leaves early.

444
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:24,658
- So?
- So I don't mind

445
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:27,045
sittin' on the place all night long
an' not get paid.

446
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:30,429
But it's a garden apartment.
Parking lots on both sides,

447
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:33,079
and if he decides to park on the street
and walk across the grass,

448
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,279
he still has the fucking patio doors.

449
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:37,429
Two more men do it?

450
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:40,049
Yeah, and two more cars, yeah.

451
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,884
I got more bodies
than I can use on my serial{\ thing}.

452
00:24:43,044 --> 00:24:45,451
Lemme make a call,
hook you up with two tac guys.

453
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:47,717
You tell 'em you're sitting
on a twenty{\that} I gave you.

454
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:49,583
I'll write up the hours under my file.

455
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:51,004
And you can do that?

456
00:24:51,527 --> 00:24:52,944
Go with God.

457
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,195
Can you make out
who that is?

458
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:11,101
Yeah.

459
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:13,717
Look at you.

460
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,550
Not even blinking.

461
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,472
Not that I blame you

462
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:23,183
after what this heinous
motherfucker did to you.

463
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:32,240
Still, this right here
is vicious.

464
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,946
Whoever did this had a real time;
now you know what I'm saying?

465
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:38,952
Now,

466
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:44,292
I know it wasn't you
because with all due respect,

467
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:48,333
you don't have the physicality
to do this kind of damage.

468
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:50,571
I mean, whoever did this

469
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:54,384
had to be a full-grown
and powerful individual--

470
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:57,719
A fearsome individual--

471
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:00,275
You see what I'm sayin'?

472
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:05,058
You the murder police.
How the fuck would I know?

473
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,129
- Is this spot good for a stand-up?
- Let's go with a wide shot on this.

474
00:26:30,182 --> 00:26:32,784
...say they are hopeful
thathe renewed attention

475
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:36,057
to their son's death a few years ago
will lead police to--

476
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:37,823
Kinda formula, I know.

477
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:40,990
Anecdotal lede,
nut graf, best quote--

478
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,624
It works as a sidebar, but for tomorrow,
let's stretch it some, huh?

479
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:48,024
Really spend some time with
some of these people, you know?

480
00:26:48,184 --> 00:26:51,689
What I mean is, sometimes,
the weakest stuff in a story

481
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,055
is the shit with
quotation marks around it.

482
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:57,127
You got a guy telling how rough it is
on the street{\, it really} doesn't have much pull.

483
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,263
But if you can describe him
as he really is,

484
00:27:00,423 --> 00:27:02,240
tell his story in moments.

485
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:04,516
Look, tomorrow,
get back in the shelters,

486
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:07,078
and the soup kitchens,
and just be with folk.

487
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:09,025
I don't even care
if you file copy on it.

488
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:11,510
{\I mean, }if something presents itself as a story,
great, but if not,

489
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,668
just spend the day being with people.

490
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,918
I'm not interested in what
can be quoted or counted on this one.

491
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:18,651
I'm interested in what feels true.

492
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:20,620
I'm in, thirty inches,

493
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:23,377
with room
for Price's stuff from the hall.

494
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:25,391
- Scott?
- Five minutes.

495
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:28,475
- We're coming up on first edition.
- Three minutes.

496
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:32,190
We had him in that,
what do you call it,

497
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,923
- rehabilitation--
- Four times.

498
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,025
We're not rich people.

499
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,277
Henry's on disability.

500
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:43,545
We get him out,
he makes all kinds of promises,

501
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,390
but, well, you know--

502
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:49,224
I'm sorry.

503
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:50,707
The last time,

504
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:54,709
we decided
we wouldn't be there for him.

505
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:59,674
We knew he'd probably die out there;

506
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,174
if the drugs get him,

507
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:02,879
we knew that.

508
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,476
But this thing in the newspaper,
this sex stuff.

509
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,510
The biting or whatever.

510
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:14,343
Nobody deserves that.

511
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:19,311
You see what I have
a problem with, right?

512
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:22,517
The first-person is one thing. I know
he needs to put himself in the story--

513
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:23,884
It's essential.

514
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:26,584
But this business about him
being out there day and night

515
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:28,109
with the homeless--

516
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:30,085
this stuff about sharing their--

517
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:32,842
Quote, darkest corners
with them, unquote--

518
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,375
He's writing more as an essayist.

519
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:40,590
We've got a column
from olesker, front metro.

520
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:44,357
I mean, it's pretty powerful
without being purple.

521
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,684
But this stuff that Scott's written,

522
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:50,037
it makes it sound like he's been
living with the homeless for weeks.

523
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:52,291
He spends one night
under the J.F.X.,

524
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,003
another half day quoting people
in a homeless shelter.

525
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:56,688
It ain't exactly studs terkel.

526
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:58,891
You don't think the piece
should run as it is?

527
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:03,159
We have him interviewed about the call
from the killer in Alma's mainbar.

528
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,617
We have his quotes.
But the rest of this stuff,

529
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,294
he's acting like
he's taking his life in his hands,

530
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:10,624
he walks another highway at night?

531
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,190
This is our fucking city.
This ain't Beirut.

532
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:15,206
I respect your concerns.

533
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:19,961
I'll take the piece and move it
as my own edit. How's that?

534
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:28,591
Okay.

535
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,318
<i>And while they declined
to talk on camera,</i>

536
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:37,095
<i>the parents of Jonathan Boland
say they are hopeful</i>

537
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:40,156
<i>that the renewed attention
to their son's death a few yes ago</i>

538
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:41,900
<i>will lead police to his killer.</i>

539
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:44,316
<i>For Channel Six News,
I'm Patricia--</i>

540
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:48,798
Media's going crazy.

541
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:50,909
City hall, too.

542
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:54,579
But for once, we're getting
what we need to do the job.

543
00:29:54,987 --> 00:29:57,337
- How does it feel?
- Forbidden.

544
00:29:58,061 --> 00:29:59,407
I feel like at any moment,

545
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:02,224
they're gonna find out how much
we're spending and shut us down.

546
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,651
You don't have all this
in your head yet?

547
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,599
I just want to go over it all again.

548
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,272
We finish voir dire by lunch,

549
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,324
and then,
it's opening arguments.

550
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:13,782
For Mr. Bond.
It's on him.

551
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:15,357
He needs
a strong second.

552
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:18,723
He needs me to know
this case inside and out.

553
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,582
How much longer, Lester?

554
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,792
If Marlo has a code,
we can break the code.

555
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:31,413
That's a given.

556
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:33,224
How long?

557
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:35,662
Depends on the code,
doesn't it?

558
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:42,322
Quicker we bring this in
and shut it down,

559
00:30:42,482 --> 00:30:43,993
the safer we'll all be.

560
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:46,396
I mean, Landsman wants me
to go to fucking Quantico,

561
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,174
let the F.B.I. do a profile.

562
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,017
Might learn something
about yourself.

563
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:52,532
It's not funny, Lester.

564
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:55,183
This shit's bigger than
I ever thought it would be.

565
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:56,941
The whole fuckin' city--

566
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:00,687
Yeah, Jay.

567
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:07,791
I don't need an academy class

568
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,621
to help with a canvass
near this guy's corners.

569
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:14,953
I don't need any additional canvassing.

570
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:17,720
What? You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.

571
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,151
Because I already know the name
of the missing smokehound.

572
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,707
Yeah, his name, his D.O.B.

573
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:24,537
and his last known address
at a city shelter.

574
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,785
Lawrence Butler,
3/10/1951,

575
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,931
400 West street,
south Baltimore men's shelter.

576
00:31:31,108 --> 00:31:32,791
How did you get all of that?

577
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:34,181
How?

578
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:36,598
Police work.

579
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,850
When I have more leads, Sergeant,

580
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,684
I'll be able to use the extra manpower
you give me and run this shit down.

581
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:43,974
But until then,
will you back off, Jay?

582
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,022
Yeah,
just back the fuck off.

583
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:51,357
Trouble with making this thing
into a red ball?

584
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:53,672
People started treating it
like a fucking red ball.

585
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:54,969
Jesus!

586
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,536
Get me out of this, Lester.
As fast as you can.

587
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:01,432
Senator--

588
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:06,945
Senator, there have been rumors
of a last minute plea offer.

589
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:08,922
How can I plead
to what I didn't do?

590
00:32:12,325 --> 00:32:15,147
- What're you reading there, Senator?
- This here?

591
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,838
"Prometheus bound,"
an ancient play,

592
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:19,495
one of the oldest we have,

593
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:22,364
about a simple man who was
horrifically punished

594
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,688
by the powers that be

595
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:27,190
for the terrible crime of trying
to bring light to the common people.

596
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:32,362
In the words of Aeschylus,
"no good deed goes unpunished."

597
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:36,115
I cannot tell you how much
consolation I find in these slim pages.

598
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,201
- One more question--
- Ladies and gentlemen,

599
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:42,247
I do believe I have my day in court
and I will see you inside.

600
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:52,041
City Hall wants an update.

601
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:54,482
What do we know
about our missing mope?

602
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:02,100
What else?

603
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,955
Sending a tape of the call
down to Quantico,

604
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:07,390
along with the case file.
They'll review, then meet with us.

605
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,390
You gotta hit every downtown shelter
or mission there is--

606
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:13,319
- You want bodies for that?
- I'm taking Christeson.

607
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:15,457
The rookie?

608
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:17,958
Yeah, he'll ask the extra question.
He's hungry. He's--

609
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:20,542
I need more bodies,
I'll let you know.

610
00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:29,479
Heard what you did with Christeson,
letting him go on his own case,

611
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:31,983
while you carry him
and two surveillance teams.

612
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:33,757
Your shit is right, Jimmy.

613
00:33:34,064 --> 00:33:35,084
Thanks.

614
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,182
So I got another one for ya.

615
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,173
You remember the rape-murder I had?
Bolton hill job?

616
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:43,613
Brother-in-law of my rapist--
Last year wouldn't talk to me,

617
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:46,269
but now, his wife just got collared,

618
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,339
and if she gets locked up,
his kids go to family services,

619
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:50,857
so he's desperate to deal.

620
00:33:51,117 --> 00:33:53,943
The problem is,
he's in the new york system--

621
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:56,258
Elmira, Newburgh,
one of those places.

622
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:59,115
Anyway, I get a road car
and expenses, I can put it down.

623
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:08,067
He strangled a 20-year-old,
stuffed her under her bed.

624
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,544
Okay, give my C.C. to motor pool.

625
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:13,791
I'll bury the expenses
and the O.T. in my file.

626
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,048
Thanks, brother.

627
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:23,610
Ain't you the lil' king of diamonds.

628
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:30,301
Homicide.

629
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:34,374
Naw, he's on the street right now.
Call back in a couple hours.

630
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:37,630
On second thought,

631
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,711
gonna have Norris with me
on that canvass today, boss.

632
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:48,247
And with every single transaction
you've described, detective,

633
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,824
the money was routed through
the Senator's personal account

634
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,710
and then withdrawn as cash--

635
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,088
- Yes, sir.
- Often

636
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,835
in the same amounts?

637
00:34:57,186 --> 00:34:58,575
Often the exact amounts,

638
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:00,835
sometimes slightly smaller amounts,
but always

639
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:03,012
within a day of the initial deposit.

640
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,198
Thank you, detective Freamon.

641
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:07,273
Your Honor, no further questions.

642
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,560
Cross examination, Mr. Murphy.

643
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,901
No questions, Your Honor.

644
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:36,087
You got a number?

645
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,438
- What?
- Number on a slip.

646
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,284
If you get one, I might could find you
a seat. It's mac an' cheese today.

647
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,095
I'm a newspaper reporter.

648
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,148
So you got what to eat then.

649
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:50,601
Came down here just to hang out,
and get with some homeless people.

650
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,681
How come whenever y'all be wanting
homeless, y'all come to soup kitchens?

651
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,966
- You don't serve homeless?
- Serve everybody.

652
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:57,550
Homeless, poor folks,

653
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,736
workin' people tryin' to make it
to a paycheck.

654
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,690
Shit, half the neighborhood
be up here week before check day.

655
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,667
You're not--

656
00:36:07,058 --> 00:36:08,056
Homeless?

657
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:11,953
No, I'm down in my sister's basement,
over at Edmondson village.

658
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,785
What you need the homeless to say?

659
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:17,959
Talk about the killings.

660
00:36:18,514 --> 00:36:20,624
The thing going on
with the serial killer.

661
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:23,957
But mostly, I'm just lookin' for a story
about what it's like for them.

662
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:25,408
What life is like.

663
00:36:26,377 --> 00:36:27,549
Hard times out here.

664
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,482
I can't imagine.

665
00:36:30,261 --> 00:36:32,435
You gonna write a story
about what life's like, huh?

666
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:36,914
Bubbles, man.

667
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,701
Michael fletcher.

668
00:36:39,243 --> 00:36:42,657
Sticking for the moment
with the west Baltimore hoops charity,

669
00:36:42,982 --> 00:36:45,191
what were your basic
responsibilities there?

670
00:36:45,351 --> 00:36:46,891
I can't rightly say.

671
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:51,245
Yet, you drew $40,000 a year
as the executive direcr.

672
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:54,624
Nah. All that money
went straight back to Senator Davis.

673
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:57,504
None for you?

674
00:36:57,664 --> 00:36:59,892
I got paid through the district office
for drivin' him.

675
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,566
That money I kept. Whenever
I would go out to snatch some money

676
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:04,263
- for the senator--
- Objection.

677
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,884
- Sometimes kick me back a few.
- Move to strike all of that.

678
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:09,514
Sustained.
Disregard that last comment.

679
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,516
This case is limited to the charges

680
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:15,554
stemming from the operation
of Senator Davis' non-profit charities.

681
00:37:15,793 --> 00:37:17,522
Other matters are not relevant.

682
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,610
Here it is.

683
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,541
What the hell is that--

684
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:38,618
A meet at five-fifty?

685
00:37:39,617 --> 00:37:41,319
I'm gonna go get up on Monk.

686
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:47,590
You have a criminal history;
do you not, Mr. Price?

687
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,690
Yeah, I did some years.

688
00:37:49,953 --> 00:37:52,890
And when you last
got out of prison six years ago,

689
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:56,519
was Senator Davis aware
of your criminal record?

690
00:37:56,951 --> 00:37:58,103
Yes, sir.

691
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:00,318
And yet, he gave you a job,

692
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:03,151
but today, is this how you repay him?

693
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:06,028
The testimony you gave

694
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:09,073
about returning the money you earned
at the senator's charities,

695
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:12,034
you say you repaid it
to the senator in cash,

696
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:14,328
- correct?
- Every time.

697
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,156
So there's no proof

698
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:19,667
that the senator ever
received that money, isn't that correct?

699
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:21,965
- I guess not.
- You guess not.

700
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:23,379
I guess not.

701
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,676
Mr. Price, you acknowledged earlier
that in exchange

702
00:38:28,936 --> 00:38:30,240
for your testimony,

703
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,057
you received immunity
from prosecution

704
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:36,000
for any charges related to this case.

705
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,186
Is it fair to say

706
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:40,749
that testifying against senator Davis

707
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:45,151
ensures that you will not
yourself go to jail?

708
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:47,422
- Got-damn right.
- Mr. Price.

709
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:49,151
I'm sorr--
Oh shit, sorry--

710
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:52,191
Okay, my b, judge.
Sorry.

711
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,517
Do you expect this jury

712
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,557
to take the word
of a twice-convicted felon

713
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:01,871
over the word of a duly elected member
of the Maryland state Senate?

714
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:05,147
What can I say?
Y'all can play it like you feel

715
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:06,861
an' leave me be.

716
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,226
I don't get it. He hasn't moved
off this spot for an hour and a half.

717
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:40,074
<i>Alright, well,
come on back then, alright?</i>

718
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:44,217
Guy's been hitting the bus shelters
every third or fourth night.

719
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:47,777
We got two wounded and one dead
going back to that piece since December.

720
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:51,968
All I'm asking is for hours
to stake this asshole out.

721
00:39:52,228 --> 00:39:54,136
Guy's like clockwork.

722
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,803
Spot me an' garvey,

723
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,927
three nights
and the case is fuckin' down.

724
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:02,509
- I can give you two nights.
- If he hits on the third?

725
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,443
- One night.
- Okay, okay.

726
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:05,702
Two nights.

727
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:09,878
You need to put my C.C. number on
the OT slips and you give those to Jay--

728
00:40:10,038 --> 00:40:12,010
It's cool.
I know the drill.

729
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,103
- You do?
- You're doing good here, boss--

730
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:18,038
What did you just call me?

731
00:40:21,164 --> 00:40:23,575
- What the hell is that?
- Office reports.

732
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:26,118
Families of your victims,
debriefed in full.

733
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:28,254
And believe me,
it ruined my week.

734
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,215
- Rough, huh?
- I'm sittin' there explaining

735
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:33,511
to the salt of the fuckin' earth
why their eldest,

736
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:36,595
who is living on the street because
nothing they did could fix his problems,

737
00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:38,584
but God knows they tried--

738
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:41,392
Why he met his end
being bit on and fucked with

739
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:44,603
by some sick motherfucker
who used him for jerk-off purposes.

740
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:49,066
How the shit about the bite marks
get in the papers in the first place?

741
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,741
Gotta run.
I got shit to assemble.

742
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,068
You didn't tell me that part of it,
did you, motherfucker?

743
00:40:56,228 --> 00:40:57,283
Who's up next?

744
00:40:57,443 --> 00:40:59,618
I got one at the corner
of Calhoun and Mosher.

745
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:17,398
Jesus--

746
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:20,133
That poor guy.

747
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:22,099
Wanna take him home with you?

748
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,734
Shit.
Take me.

749
00:41:25,668 --> 00:41:28,098
- What?
- I'm just having fun with you, man.

750
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:33,542
Thanks for bringing me here, man,
showing me around.

751
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:39,704
Nah.

752
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:43,494
- Not about that.
- Sure?

753
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:47,314
Just--
Write it like it feels.

754
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:03,806
Fuck.

755
00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:06,492
Shit!

756
00:42:34,223 --> 00:42:36,726
Rodney, you can't press
a regular for his whole tab.

757
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:38,267
It just isn't done.

758
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:41,743
I used to run a bar.
I know how these things work, remember?

759
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:43,345
Gus Haynes, in the flesh.

760
00:42:43,505 --> 00:42:45,159
Well, more of it maybe.

761
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,663
How the hell you been?
Where you been hidin'? In vice still?

762
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:49,976
Vice? Shit,
that does take me back.

763
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:52,690
I did eight years in homicide, brother.
Now it's the western.

764
00:42:53,765 --> 00:42:55,904
Speaking of hiding out,
when you stop comin' round?

765
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:57,317
Last I saw you was--

766
00:42:57,477 --> 00:43:00,865
I'm not running the districts anymore.
I'm an editor now, so--

767
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:03,117
Then you can afford to buy a round.

768
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:06,176
Hey, dennis.

769
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,690
Let me pull your coat.

770
00:43:10,392 --> 00:43:13,526
Long time, Gus. Don't tell me
you knew I'd be here tonight.

771
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:15,784
It's a cop bar, you know,
so, if it's not you,

772
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:18,251
it's some other face
from back in the day.

773
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,754
Theoretical question.

774
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,347
Oh, theoretical.

775
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:23,791
In that case, a double, Rodney,
Gus is buyin'.

776
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:25,290
Two, Rodney.

777
00:43:26,057 --> 00:43:26,806
So...

778
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:38,626
What?

779
00:43:40,843 --> 00:43:42,948
I seen you at the stash house, yo.

780
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,457
Ain't you used to be
with them Barksdale boys?

781
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:50,158
What they call you, yo?

782
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:51,345
Savino.

783
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,287
That's right. Savino.

784
00:43:58,351 --> 00:43:59,991
You ain't never moved no dope.

785
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:02,051
You was always muscle as I recall.

786
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:05,481
Now you musclin' for Marlo, huh?

787
00:44:06,222 --> 00:44:07,502
I wasn't there.

788
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:10,930
When they did the old man
like that, I wasn't there.

789
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:13,803
Chris an' Snoop,
they on that.

790
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:16,075
Oh, I know who was there.

791
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:17,918
So you innocent, huh?

792
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:22,891
Let me ask you somethin' though.
Bein' that you muscle for Marlo,

793
00:44:23,513 --> 00:44:26,030
what you was gonna do
if you was there, huh?

794
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,284
Riddle me that.

795
00:44:31,303 --> 00:44:32,280
Yeah.

796
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,559
You know what, yo?

797
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:49,924
<i>Ready?</i>

798
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,347
<i>Yeah.</i>

799
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:53,061
<i>A-ight.</i>

800
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,666
- We got to talk.
- <i>I'll come over to you.</i>

801
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:09,377
Does that seem possible?

802
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:12,258
To go through the court system
with a false I.D.?

803
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:14,978
Maybe the first time,
if she's got no priors,

804
00:45:15,138 --> 00:45:18,043
no prints on file,
but after that?

805
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:21,423
B.P.I. sheets have
fingerprint characteristics

806
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,424
that are like an F.B.I. bar code.

807
00:45:23,684 --> 00:45:25,301
And it's paired with a photo.

808
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,891
A name's one thing.
But unless these women are twin sisters

809
00:45:29,051 --> 00:45:31,461
and one's been carrying
the other one's hand around in her purse

810
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:32,923
for the last twelve years--

811
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:35,185
Somebody's yanking your chain.

812
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:39,611
It's definitely a code.

813
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:42,192
Definitely not having
much to do with time.

814
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:44,920
We're at a point where
I'm going to need more bodies,

815
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,091
surveillance cars,
man hours.

816
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:50,868
We're gonna have to stay on these guys
until those clocks start to make sense.

817
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,951
Well, good news is they giving me
more manpower than I can waste.

818
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:55,258
Bad news?

819
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:57,658
It's all around the office
that I'm giving out hours

820
00:45:57,818 --> 00:45:59,960
and money to people
to work other cases.

821
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:03,191
I can't help it, Lester.
It's the kind of person I am.

822
00:46:03,351 --> 00:46:05,657
- I give and give and give--
- If you're not careful,

823
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:07,885
you're gonna get shit on you,
on us.

824
00:46:08,151 --> 00:46:09,795
Who's gonna complain?

825
00:46:09,955 --> 00:46:12,377
Guys are working cases
and getting paid--

826
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,938
So what exactly do you need?

827
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:17,991
Seven men.

828
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,980
No, eight.
And cars.

829
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,717
Oh shit, they offered me
men from the districts,

830
00:46:23,877 --> 00:46:25,903
and a surveillance supervisor
to run the detail.

831
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:28,113
Anyone in the districts we trust?

832
00:46:29,968 --> 00:46:31,241
Lemme think on that.

833
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,690
<i>I don't know how the fuck
did you of all people do this shit, huh?</i>

834
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,389
- <i>How?
</i>- You got the right allen wrench?

835
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,784
<i>God damn directions.</i>

836
00:46:42,944 --> 00:46:44,967
What kind of scotch you using?

837
00:46:53,943 --> 00:46:54,984
Fuck!

838
00:46:57,588 --> 00:46:58,757
Piece of shit!

839
00:46:59,376 --> 00:47:01,490
Yo, so you talked to Chris, right?

840
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:02,905
What he say?

841
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,647
He didn't say shit.

842
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,141
He knows I ain't say
a fuckin' word to no police.

843
00:47:07,384 --> 00:47:09,998
And you heard what little Dermell
said to the juvenile master?

844
00:47:10,649 --> 00:47:13,083
Lady ax him like,
"yo, you got a record?"

845
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:14,789
He's like "yeah, bitch,

846
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:17,423
My record's so long
I'm about to put out an album."

847
00:47:21,228 --> 00:47:23,419
Don't touch that dial, young'un.

848
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:31,760
This a Stanfield corner, huh?

849
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:37,251
You know who I am?

850
00:47:45,177 --> 00:47:46,966
You make sure you tell the boss man

851
00:47:47,126 --> 00:47:49,891
that you know who it is
dropped Savino last night.

852
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:51,180
Ya feel me?

853
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,784
You tell that man
I'm a drop all his muscle

854
00:47:55,554 --> 00:47:58,961
until he get the heart to come
down to the street and dance.

855
00:48:01,441 --> 00:48:03,394
You gonna remone that, sweetpea?

856
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:20,552
That's Omar?
Damn.

857
00:48:20,813 --> 00:48:22,158
Savino dead, yo?

858
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,939
Shit, man,

859
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:29,617
if he'da made me
from Monk's apartment the other night,

860
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:32,395
I might be laid out my own self.

861
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,460
Gimpy as a motherfucker.

862
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:41,024
I don't know, senator. I want
to believe you. I mean, I'm your lawyer.

863
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:45,247
But there's all this up on the board
that Mr. Bond has on display--

864
00:48:45,778 --> 00:48:48,086
$11,000 to west side hoops,

865
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:50,678
next day, $11,000 drawn,

866
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,885
then $11,000 deposited in your personal

867
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:57,725
banking account--
You bet it all went into my account.

868
00:48:57,981 --> 00:48:59,848
It made it easier for me to do my job.

869
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:02,726
And at the end of the day?
Not one penny stayed with me.

870
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:06,323
I need you to do better than that,
Senator. Where are your records?

871
00:49:06,597 --> 00:49:08,232
- Records?
- Yes, records.

872
00:49:08,603 --> 00:49:11,450
For example, this check for $11,000

873
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:15,048
- dated january 22nd--
- That was last winter, right?

874
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:17,241
So,

875
00:49:17,742 --> 00:49:20,024
some went to pay everyone's B.G.E.,

876
00:49:20,184 --> 00:49:22,857
'cause half my district
was gonna have the heat turned off,

877
00:49:23,136 --> 00:49:26,667
and then, some went for puff jackets
for them that got children in need.

878
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,544
Let me tell you something, man.

879
00:49:29,453 --> 00:49:32,095
My neck of the woods,
it's a jungle out there.

880
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,362
Everybody living hand to mouth,

881
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:37,124
improvising, hustlin',

882
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:39,179
make do with as little
as you can imagine.

883
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:42,013
Hell, that, that tv show,
what's that,

884
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:43,570
"Survivor"?

885
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:47,479
Man, they want some good contestants,
they need to come around westside.

886
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:51,149
Folks I know?
Oh, we'd do great on that show.

887
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:54,490
Practice every damn day of our lives.

888
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:56,850
Hell, and "Fear factor"?
Oh, sheee--

889
00:49:57,523 --> 00:49:59,173
Don't even get me started.

890
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,290
Forgive me, but I still don't understand
how that justifies--

891
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,031
Let me tell you something, brother--

892
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:06,984
I don't know how they do it
out in Roland park--

893
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,899
Maybe prosecutor Obonda
can enlighten me on that.

894
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:13,338
But my world is strictly
cash and carry,

895
00:50:13,617 --> 00:50:15,570
and I am Clay Davis.

896
00:50:16,117 --> 00:50:18,885
My people need something,
they know where to find me.

897
00:50:20,328 --> 00:50:23,191
Let me tell you, brother,
I step out the door,

898
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:25,690
hit the corner of Mosher
and Pennsylvania,

899
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:27,784
you better believe
my pockets are bulging.

900
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:29,771
But by the time
I get to Robert street--

901
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:34,406
Objection!
Objection, Your Honor.

902
00:50:36,991 --> 00:50:39,290
Senator! Senator, take a seat,

903
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:42,430
and refrain from off-hand
references to Mr. Bond.

904
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:44,174
My apologies, Your Honor.

905
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,122
But these charities were set up for

906
00:50:47,282 --> 00:50:49,991
basketball leagues
in city rec centers, weren't they?

907
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:51,441
Yeah, but you give me

908
00:50:51,678 --> 00:50:55,207
20,000 or a basketball
and an air pump,

909
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:57,917
I am pullin' goodly on that
for whatever,

910
00:50:58,077 --> 00:50:59,509
whoever comes at me.

911
00:51:00,112 --> 00:51:03,649
"Senator Clay,
I gots to bury my mother,

912
00:51:04,466 --> 00:51:05,919
"bail out my son,

913
00:51:06,384 --> 00:51:09,150
"buy a new shirt for a job interview,

914
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,957
pay my child's asthma doctor."

915
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:15,490
Takes me half an hour
to go a hundred yards,

916
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:20,739
and excuse me if I didn't ask that
old Arthur-itised woman for a receipt,

917
00:51:21,198 --> 00:51:23,690
or that young mother
needed the similac

918
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,657
to sign a damned piece a paper

919
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:27,984
so I don't have to be up here
in this box right now

920
00:51:28,144 --> 00:51:31,017
explainin' to folks who never
been in our neck of the woods

921
00:51:31,177 --> 00:51:32,709
how things truly are.

922
00:51:34,086 --> 00:51:35,996
And if a jury of my peers,

923
00:51:36,284 --> 00:51:40,847
you all deem it right and true
for me to walk out of here

924
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,995
an upright and justified man?

925
00:51:44,147 --> 00:51:45,948
Oh, I ain't gonna lie to you.

926
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:49,051
I'm a gonna do
the same damn thing tomorrow,

927
00:51:49,327 --> 00:51:51,318
and the day after that
and the day after that,

928
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:54,483
until they got me laid out
at march's funeral home,

929
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:56,159
and truck me off to mt. Auburn.

930
00:52:02,248 --> 00:52:03,378
Silence.

931
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:05,318
Silence in this courtroom.

932
00:52:05,478 --> 00:52:06,937
What about trailers?

933
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:10,348
Like fema. We set up trailers to act
as temp housing for some of the--

934
00:52:10,508 --> 00:52:12,263
Some of the shelter popution.

935
00:52:12,523 --> 00:52:14,517
You know, put 'em down
in war memorial plaza.

936
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:16,791
Do you know how much
fema pays per trailer?

937
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:18,522
A dozen trailers for the homeless.

938
00:52:18,682 --> 00:52:21,191
We've got three to four thousand
on the streets, at least.

939
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:25,295
It's symbolic. You know, we're doing
what we can with a civic disaster--

940
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,471
- Like new orleans--
- Abandoned by the state,

941
00:52:27,631 --> 00:52:29,195
ignored by the federal government.

942
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,477
It's bad enough you want to
keep the city shelters open 24/7.

943
00:52:33,035 --> 00:52:36,158
That puts the health department
a couple hundred thousand in the red.

944
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,341
You add that to the overage
we're gonna see

945
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:41,418
for letting the police {\department }run wild
with overtime and investigative costs--

946
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:43,583
There's no choice anymore.

947
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,884
This thing has a lock
on everyone's attention.

948
00:52:46,044 --> 00:52:49,161
When another victim disappears,
we're gonna be even more on the spot.

949
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:52,415
I'm just telling you,
if this goes on more than a month,

950
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:53,977
with what we'll be spending,

951
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:56,185
you're looking at cutbacks
throughout the agencies;

952
00:52:56,345 --> 00:52:58,757
maybe even teacher layoffs
come the end of the fiscal.

953
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:01,788
- Teacher layoffs...
- By a gubernatorial candidate...

954
00:53:01,948 --> 00:53:03,284
In an election year.

955
00:53:04,024 --> 00:53:05,000
Lovely.

956
00:53:14,184 --> 00:53:15,817
Hold up, hold up.

957
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:20,854
I just want to say that--

958
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:24,124
despite all the false
accusations made against me,

959
00:53:24,437 --> 00:53:27,282
the people who I continue
to serve have spoken.

960
00:53:28,398 --> 00:53:30,502
What the fuck just happened?

961
00:53:30,662 --> 00:53:33,516
...as long as I can
to serve the people.

962
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,125
Whatever it was,
they don't teach it in law school.

963
00:53:40,299 --> 00:53:43,538
45 inches of Clay Davis
playing not just the race card,

964
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:45,957
but the whole deck, coming at ya.

965
00:53:46,712 --> 00:53:47,969
Got it.
Thank ye.

966
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:51,891
Someday you're going to have
to explain all this to me, gus.

967
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:55,100
After watching that verdict come in,
I feel very white.

968
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:59,986
Start with some James Brown records
and work up from there.

969
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:07,791
It's embarrassing, ain't it?

970
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:10,742
I can't believe nobody
had sense enough to tone this down.

971
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:14,117
The hype is bad enough. But what gets me
is that I can't trust the guy.

972
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:16,921
I send him back out onto the street
to own his mistake,

973
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:20,056
he comes back with some bullshit
about stolen identities.

974
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:22,787
I don't give a fuck he gets took.
Everybody gets took now and then.

975
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:24,158
I know I did.

976
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:25,991
It's about not owning up to it.

977
00:54:26,198 --> 00:54:28,718
Gus, this thing with
the woman and the crab cake?

978
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:31,972
You think the first time you catch him
is the first time he does it?

979
00:54:32,232 --> 00:54:34,721
Lotta guys'll try to duck a correction.

980
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,919
But the thing with this is,
he was standing on an outright lie.

981
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,747
And if he'll lie about a correction--

982
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:42,732
Then will he lie to make a story
better than it ought to be?

983
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:47,186
I keep thinking about that kid in the
wheelchair out in front of Oriole park.

984
00:54:47,346 --> 00:54:49,320
The one that only had a nickname.

985
00:54:50,863 --> 00:54:53,592
A black kid from the westside,
crazy for baseball?

986
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,229
Basketball, yeah.

987
00:54:56,744 --> 00:54:58,024
Football--sure

988
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:02,522
I don't wanna call
another reporter a liar.

989
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:03,998
I really don't.

990
00:55:24,617 --> 00:55:25,901
What's the matter, baby?

991
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,281
You can't sleep?

992
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:17,876
Let's see--

993
00:56:18,715 --> 00:56:20,820
Let's say good night to everybody.

994
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,242
Good night, moon.

995
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:32,516
- You say it.
- Good night, moon.

996
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:33,897
There you go.

997
00:56:34,439 --> 00:56:35,850
Good night, stars.

998
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:41,306
good night, po-pos.

999
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:45,689
Good night, fiends.

1000
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:50,010
Good night, hoppers.

1001
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:53,293
Good night, hustlers.

1002
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,464
Good night, scammers.

1003
00:56:59,777 --> 00:57:01,817
Good night to everybody.

1004
00:57:04,098 --> 00:57:07,070
Good night to one and all.

1005
00:57:17,313 --> 00:57:19,041
