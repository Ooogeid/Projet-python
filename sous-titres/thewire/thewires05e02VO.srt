1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,515
You know how that go, right?

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,671
Gave myself all these little rules
about what I wouldn't do.

3
00:00:07,386 --> 00:00:10,310
Like, I told myself I'd do
a lot of shit to get high,

4
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:13,458
but I swore I wouldn't
never trick.

5
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:16,761
So after I'm trickin'...

6
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:19,174
I thought,
"well, this ain't so bad.

7
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:21,940
"I'll do this for a while 'cept
I'll make some more rules for myself.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,154
"like I'm gonna use condoms,

9
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:26,079
"and I'm never gonna go

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,481
with more than one guy
at the same time," and,

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:34,639
let's just say there are certain things
I told myself I wouldn't never do.

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,800
You know what my disease
did to my rules, right?

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,088
Whatever it is you tell yourself
you won't do to get high,

14
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,543
you're pretty much making a list

15
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:51,513
of everything you will do as soon as
your inner addict tells you to.

16
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,012
I mean,
that bitch wants to kill me.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,118
She does.

18
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:03,718
Even on my way here today,
she was telling me not to come.

19
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:08,094
She was tellin' me that I was all right
on the street, that it was all good.

20
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:15,944
I'm about done.

21
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:19,934
I want to thank you all
for letting me share.

22
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:21,000
Amen.

23
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:28,341
Thanks for sharing, Dee-Dee.

24
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,967
Always lift us.

25
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:37,926
We got finished a little early.
Anybody else feel like sharing?

26
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:43,286
How 'bout you, Bubs?
Haven't heard from you in a while.

27
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:44,661
Bubbles.

28
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,242
Get up there!

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,653
Come on, bubs.

30
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:54,294
All right, bubbles.

31
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:00,424
Hi, y'all.

32
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,635
- You know who I am.
- Hey, bubs.

33
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:06,725
- Bubs. Bubbles.
- What's up, Bubbles?

34
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:08,848
I'm a grateful addict.

35
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:14,107
Been clean 15
months thursday.

36
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:20,045
This is the
longest I been off.

37
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:24,465
I...

38
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:29,100
Hey, yo! Let's go!

39
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:33,019
I used to get so high, you know.

40
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:35,075
I mean,
I used to love to be high.

41
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:38,253
Y'all see me out there
on Monroe and Fayette

42
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,332
doin' the dope-fiend lean, right?

43
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:41,922
Be like this here.

44
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:47,268
I come out of it,
get a little more upright.

45
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,373
Come to realize people
treatin' me like a lamp post,

46
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:52,720
hangin' fliers on me an' shit.

47
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,943
Come winter, little kids hangin'
Christmas balls on me like a damn tree.

48
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:00,372
Summertime,
they'd walk me over that garden,

49
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:02,655
where the nine-oh-nine used to be.
Make me...

50
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,232
Make me a scarecrow.

51
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,641
Yeah.
I used to love to get high.

52
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:23,744
Got to the point...

53
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,846
You know, I'm not in the right place
to talk about this right now.

54
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:35,234
Keep comin' back, Bubs.

55
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:41,561
Thanks, bubs.

56
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:43,308
Thanks for sharing.

57
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:47,410
Is there anybodylse
with  a burning desire to share?

58
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:50,995
Marvin?

59
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,749
It's quiet up in here.

60
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,838
You got the,
Bank of America accounts?

61
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:55,508
That pile there.

62
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:04,436
So he claims to be raising money

63
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:07,787
for some basketball program
or day-care center...

64
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:10,699
And the money comes in,
and the money goes out.

65
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,168
But no hoops, no day care.

66
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,700
Ok, so say we get Clay Davis,

67
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,924
- and say he flips...
- Then he takes us up the ladder.

68
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,969
To who? I mean, if Clay
is stealing from his own nonprofits...

69
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,937
That's an easy case for us to  make
with all the paperwork we got here.

70
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:29,374
That's a straight-up theft,
maybe a tax charge or two,

71
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:33,107
but there's money
that all this paperwork only hints at,

72
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,107
money that doesn't show up
on a campaign finance report.

73
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:39,537
My guess is that Clay Davis
knows about that, too.

74
00:06:39,697 --> 00:06:40,903
I don't know, man.

75
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,447
I like street work more.

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,627
You'd rather sit in a surveillance van
days on end

77
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:48,578
waiting to catch Tater
handing Pee Wee a vial?

78
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:51,267
This, detective,
is what you're telling me?

79
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,082
A case like this here,

80
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:55,877
where you show who gets paid

81
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:58,720
behind all the tragedy
and the fraud,

82
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:01,299
where you show how the money

83
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:05,361
routes itself,
how we're all, all of us vested,

84
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,016
all of us complicit?

85
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,702
Career case, huh?

86
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:15,197
Baby, I could die happy.

87
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:17,854
Still, man,

88
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,049
I wonder what Marlo
is up to right fucking now.

89
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:26,489
Celebrating.

90
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:29,322
Yeah, but they still taking pictures?

91
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,267
No.
I ain't feel nothing in a while

92
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:35,208
we took care that thing
over the eastside. They ain't on me.

93
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:37,361
Snoop, she been rolling around all week.

94
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,004
Nothing, no cars, no vans,
no helicopters.

95
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:42,434
Monk-- he checked after the re-up,
no problem.

96
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:44,034
We wore 'em down.

97
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:45,343
What about cameras?

98
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:48,638
Nothing since the camera
we took out the wall back at the place.

99
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:51,341
My overnight man, he been watchin',
he ain't seen nothing either.

100
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:54,185
'sides, I think we good as long as
we move it around like this.

101
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:56,279
Back to bidness, I say.

102
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:58,836
She ain't had no work in a few months.

103
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,240
She somewhat eager.

104
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,792
Goddamn right.

105
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:04,826
Too much fuckin'
talkin' around here lately, man.

106
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,115
Niggas need to shut the fuck up.
For real.

107
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,658
A-ight, first thing.

108
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,607
We go hard at webster Franklin's crew.

109
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,455
Gave 'em the chance
to get on our tit, passed.

110
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,641
Now we bang on his corners
a couple of times 'til he fold.

111
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,793
- Now you talkin'.
- Yeah.

112
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:22,168
Next, we step to June bug
for talkin' that shit.

113
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,558
He was a dead man
when he opened his mouth.

114
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:26,819
He just walkin' around
not knowing it.

115
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,088
You know, an' I
want that dicksucker.

116
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,994
Took my money
and the whole world know.

117
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:35,207
Naw. He got to fall.

118
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,013
Omar rolled out
in retirement and shit.

119
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:39,847
I'm hearin' somewheresSouth.

120
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:41,858
Bring his ass back
out of retirement.

121
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,233
- A-ight.
- Yeah, a-ight.

122
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,140
We can step that shit up,

123
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,571
but he's goin' to be comin'
at us like we comin' at him.

124
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,667
I mean, Joe and them,
they said let that be.

125
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:53,773
No crown ain't worth much

126
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:56,957
if the nigga wearin' it
always gettin' his shit took,

127
00:08:57,347 --> 00:08:59,137
and Joe ought to know that.

128
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:01,232
Let him come. Yeah.

129
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:05,419
What up with that
thing down at Jessup?

130
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,680
Yeah, yeah. You on the list.

131
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,863
Go on down there anytime you want.

132
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:12,847
No problem.
That's the dude right there.

133
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,915
A-right.

134
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,583
Time for y'all
to earn your pay, niggas.

135
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,691
Funny how you started out.

136
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:40,541
- What you mean?
- Dope-fiend lean and all.

137
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,270
Why didn't you keep going?

138
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:49,337
You know, you hear a lot
of funny shit in these rooms,

139
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:53,959
people makin' fun of their mistakes,
makin' people laugh,

140
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,318
but in between all the jokes,

141
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,336
there's a lot of truth to be spoke.

142
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:02,953
Like that girl today.

143
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:05,034
She damn near bled out, didn't she?

144
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,200
You know, for a second there,

145
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,940
I thought you might actually stand up
and talk about Sherrod.

146
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,967
"a searching and
fearless moral inventory."

147
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,065
- That's the step.
- Don't tell me about that.

148
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:19,300
I live with that
every fuckin' day, man.

149
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,140
You got to let it out to let it go.

150
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,920
I'm your sponsor, and I'm telling you,
you got to get it out of your head,

151
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,997
- outside yourself.
- I never missed a meeting.

152
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:31,693
I'm not talking about the meetings.
I'm talking about where you go after.

153
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:34,124
I'm talking about what you do,

154
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,658
what you think,
what you feel.

155
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:38,901
I don't feel nothing.

156
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:41,477
That was never your problem.

157
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,872
Not even as a low-bottom
dope fiend, that

158
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:45,217
was never the problem.

159
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:48,442
It would be a fuckin' shame
to make it the problem now.

160
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,325
So Carcetti threw us a bone, huh?

161
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,242
Took the cap off
secondary employment.

162
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:59,874
Yeah. Even I may have
to go out and find honest work.

163
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,887
There's no money to be made
in this policing shit.

164
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:04,574
They made that clear enough.

165
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:06,877
What are you
qualified to do?

166
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,506
Aside from that, I mean.

167
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,800
You know I got an in
on the eight-to-four gig over

168
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,259
at Friedman's jewelry,

169
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,915
you know, off of Reisterstown.

170
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,179
Yeah, 20 an hour.

171
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,756
Stand around
with some shiny shit and get paid.

172
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,312
Work murders and starve.
Fuck kind of shit is that?

173
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:26,598
Anything from
overnight or this morning?

174
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:28,300
Yeah, midnight shift caught one.

175
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:30,052
Solved?

176
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:33,404
Open.
Bar cutting from Curtis bay.

177
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,430
Fahlteich's over at the morgue now.

178
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:36,933
Slow night.

179
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,293
Oh, I'm sure things
will be picking up

180
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,579
now we're no longer
sitting on Marlo Stanfield.

181
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,040
It wasn't my call to suspend
the investigation, Jimmy.

182
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,030
That decision came
from your shop.

183
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,441
Yeah, but nobody from the S.A.'s
office objected, did they?

184
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:54,501
Just like nobody objected
when Chris and Snoop got their gun

185
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,423
charges postponed
a couple of times.

186
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,306
A postponement or two is pro forma
on Calvert Street. You know that.

187
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:03,558
"Pro forma" from the Latin,

188
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:05,955
meaning the lawyers
jacking each other off.

189
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:07,472
Rules are the rules, Jimmy.

190
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,273
There are no fucking rules.

191
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,388
Fucking game's rigged.

192
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:15,095
Gentlemen.

193
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,385
Why the fuck chew
on ronnie's arm, huh?

194
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:25,206
She ain't the problem.

195
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:28,542
Tired of being jerked around.

196
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:32,143
I think I'm gonna get me
a secondary job

197
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:34,307
at that high-end cigar shop
on Baltimore street.

198
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,925
- As what?
- Homicide.

199
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,468
The Indian out front?

200
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:39,929
I'd like to scalp your ass,motherfucker.

201
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,308
Got it.

202
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,843
Who's up?

203
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:47,557
There you go,

204
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,314
givin' a fuck when it ain't your turn
to give a fuck.

205
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:53,901
He's a pissy
little bitch today.

206
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,283
I'm worried for the boy.

207
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:26,208
Some good news for a change
as the test scores

208
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:28,704
for third-graders going up
a good 15 points.

209
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,041
- That's what I get for 54 million?
- You can run on that.

210
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,376
15 points is a nice,
solid number.

211
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,981
Whatever bump in the test scores I get,
I got to run on it.

212
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,557
I sure as hell can't campaign
on the crime rate at this point.

213
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,218
Burrell already told us
we don't have a double-digit decline.

214
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,800
A small drop, most likely.

215
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,667
Until we take back
the statehouse,

216
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,856
this city will starve.
I get to Annapolis,

217
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:51,902
and whoever I leave behind as mayor,
Bond, Campbell, or who knows...

218
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,861
- They gonna have a better time of it.
- It's not gonna be Nerese

219
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:57,358
if she's goin' like she has.
<i>Sun</i> papers made her look bad.

220
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,793
Yeah.
She tells me this real estate flip

221
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:01,946
was a holdover
from the last administration.

222
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:05,157
True as far as it goes,
but she got herself paid as well.

223
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,237
She looked bad enough
that it'll cost you votes,

224
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:09,157
people who don't want
to make you governor

225
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,249
if that means
Nerese finishes your term as Mayor.

226
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,650
She makes you vulnerable.

227
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,209
What, can I ask,
makes the governor vulnerable?

228
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:18,128
He looked like a petulant little bitch
with that diatribe on olesker.

229
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:19,607
He looked paranoid, too.

230
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,400
What about his
failure on slots?

231
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,613
With a democratic assembly,
everyone expects a G.O.P.

232
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:25,151
Governor will take his lumps.

233
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:28,620
Besides, voters are split
on legalizing slots.

234
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,146
It has to hit him directly.

235
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:37,447
Well, I'll see what's on the mind
of the P.G. County boys tonight.

236
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,407
I got dinner with Stenny Miller,
and Maloney

237
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,326
down in upper Marlboro,
which reminds me...

238
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:42,807
You're late to meet jen.

239
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,607
Doesn't this seem a little thin to you,

240
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,834
running for governor
2 years into a 4-year term?

241
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,419
Everything's thin.

242
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,464
The whole world shines shit
and calls it gold.

243
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:10,433
So Somerville, he keeps going back
to ask Tommy the elder follow-ups?

244
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,919
One question after another

245
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,546
his editor wants him to ask him.

246
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,780
Somerville,
knocking on big Tommy's door,

247
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,393
blaming the city desk,

248
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:22,106
saying, "I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr.Mayor, but my desk wants to know."

249
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,774
- Shit, I see it coming.
- So 3 or 4 times, right?

250
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:27,201
"my desk is wondering--
I'm sorry to bother you,

251
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:31,176
Mr. Mayor, but my desk wants to know."
So finally,

252
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:32,606
Tommy d'Alesandro,

253
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:35,559
he puts his ear down to his desk
like this, and he says...

254
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,792
"my desk tells your desk
to go fuck itself."

255
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:41,920
That really happen?

256
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,756
Too good a story to check out.

257
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,307
What's my favorite G.A. reporter
have today for his favorite editor?

258
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:50,407
Heartbreaker from eastside.

259
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:53,001
Salt-of-the-earth single mother of 4

260
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,607
dies from allergic reaction
to blue crabs.

261
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:59,104
Ate them all her life but goes
face down in a lump backfin

262
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:01,148
pronounced an hour later at Hopkins,

263
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:03,769
and sister is starting
a scholarship fund for the kids.

264
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,263
Interviewed the whole family.

265
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:06,908
- Photos, the works.
-Attaboy.

266
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,864
Round it out with some,
some medical stuff

267
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,556
on seafood toxicity, huh?

268
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:12,494
Growing incidence,
all that good shit.

269
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:13,997
All right, cool.

270
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:19,767
You ever notice how mother
of 4 is always catching hell?

271
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,700
Murder, hit-and-run,
burn up in row house fire,

272
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,799
- swindled by bigamists.
- Tough gig, mother of 4.

273
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,239
Innocent bystander is worse.
He's always getting the short end.

274
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,454
Not a lot of them around anymore.

275
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,774
Not a lot of innocence either,
you ask me.

276
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,873
You know who there's less of?
Statuesque blondes.

277
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:41,074
You don't read about statuesque blondes
in the newspapers anymore.

278
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,274
Buxom ones, neither.
They're like a lost race.

279
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:47,202
What do you got next?

280
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,477
School project meeting.

281
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,072
Mr. Whiting builds his Pulitzer.

282
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,506
Now I've seen everything.

283
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:24,507
Why not call a cab at least?

284
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,200
If I thought these motherfuckers
would reimburse me, I would have.

285
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:29,457
So homicide can't
shop cars neither.

286
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,367
We're down to two working units.

287
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,907
One was at the morgue with Fahlteich,
the other was on fresh call.

288
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,158
Jesus.
What a joke.

289
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:43,876
67-year-old female, mother of 4,
grandmother to many,

290
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,602
lived alone.

291
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:48,501
Not seen in two days,
so the neighbor called.

292
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,940
No forced entry.

293
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:53,140
- You the first officer?
- Had to kick in the back door.

294
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:55,940
- You call for crime lab?
- We're on the list.

295
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:57,760
Today's list?

296
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,400
Fucking crime  lab, too, huh?

297
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,351
They've cut
everything to the bone.

298
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,518
Been here maybe
a couple of days.

299
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,741
If it was warmer, she'd have bloated.

300
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:14,018
Yeah, it's probably natural.

301
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:16,076
I just didn't like the way

302
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:18,774
she  looked laying there
with the pillow and all.

303
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:21,175
I bet she died in her sleep.

304
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:24,307
You ever wake up
with a pillow over your face?

305
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,909
There's mornings with a hangover
I hold the pillow over my face

306
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:30,132
just to keep the light out
and the pain down.

307
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,801
Me, I just throw up once or twice
and go to work.

308
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:36,799
Western district way.

309
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:07,980
The word I'm thinking
about is "dickensian."

310
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,589
We want to depict the
dickensian lives of city children

311
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:17,232
and then show clearly and concisely
where the school system has failed them.

312
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:20,540
Not to defend the school system, but
a lot of things have failed those kids.

313
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:22,934
They're marginalized
long before they walk into class.

314
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,907
You wanna look
at who these kids really are,

315
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,273
you gotta look at parenting,
or lack of it, in the city.

316
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:29,982
The drug culture,
the economics of these neighborhoods.

317
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,201
Yet the schools are
something that we can address.

318
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,273
Sure, we can beat up
on city schools.

319
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,774
Lord knows they deserve to be
beat on every once in a while,

320
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:39,533
but then we're just as irrelevant
to these kids as the schools are.

321
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,988
It's like you're up
on a corner of a roof

322
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:45,247
you're showing some people
how a couple of shingles came loose,

323
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,930
and meanwhile, a hurricane wrecked
the rest of the damn house.

324
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,202
you don't need a lot of context to
examine what goes on in one classroom.

325
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,334
- Really?
- I think you need a lot of context

326
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,416
- to seriously examine anything.
- No.

327
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,767
I think Scott is on the right track.

328
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:02,014
We need to limit the scope,
not get bogged down in details.

329
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,787
To do what? To dress the problem

330
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:06,158
or to win a prize?
I mean, what are we doing here?

331
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,301
Look, Gus,
I know the problems.

332
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:11,231
My wife volunteers at a city school,

333
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,929
but what I want to look at
is the tangible,

334
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,070
where the problem and solution
can be measured clearly.

335
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,707
There's more impediments to learning
than a lack of materials

336
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:21,491
or a dysfunctional bureaucracy.

337
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,549
But who's goingto read that?

338
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:26,288
What is this series about in a sentence?

339
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:27,831
What's the budget line?

340
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:31,807
Johnny can't write 'cause
Johnny have never a fucking pencil.

341
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:35,462
Augustus, I'm not as simple-minded
as you might think.

342
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,842
Now what do you want,
an educational project

343
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:39,606
or a litany of excuses?

344
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,566
I don't want some amorphous series
detailing society's ills.

345
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:47,309
If you leave everything in,
soon you've got nothin

346
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:51,338
I think the schools
are ripe for exploration,

347
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:54,858
and I think Scott might be the man
to lead the charge.

348
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,381
You ain't doin' nothin'
but aggravatin' me now.

349
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,534
Get up in this house before
I beat the black off your ass.

350
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:19,072
Get up in here, fool. Come on.

351
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:21,194
Treena.

352
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:24,192
Treena. Wait for me.
I'm gonna come back out.

353
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:26,900
- Stay right here. Don't move.
- Girl.

354
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,896
Wooton, you dump in the numbers
from the port story yet?

355
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:50,757
- Oh, shit. I forgot. You want--
- Give them to me. I'll put them in.

356
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,145
Overall, cargo is down by 12 points,

357
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:56,272
but roll-on, rll-off gained
6.4% last year.

358
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,155
A-ight. Drop 12, ro-ro's up 6.4.

359
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:01,019
- Thanks, got it.
- Boss man on your 6.

360
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,162
- Whiting?
- Worse. Klebanow.

361
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:05,100
Augustus.

362
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:09,217
Who's the lead for opening day tomorrow?
Not the game story but the color piece.

363
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,393
Luxenberg wanted to go with Mcguire.

364
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:14,271
I think Scott would do an excellent job
with the color piece.

365
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,433
You know, I'd really like
to find some chaw-chewing old-timer

366
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,432
who'd die rather than
miss the o's opener,

367
00:23:19,592 --> 00:23:21,653
someone who says, "baseball," you know?

368
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:23,238
You're the boss.

369
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:25,741
Scott, put your special touch on it

370
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,467
like you did
with your preakness piece last year.

371
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:30,773
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

372
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:16,949
Fuck.

373
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:20,557
What's wrong?

374
00:24:20,904 --> 00:24:22,832
Sorry.
Go back to sleep, baby.

375
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,178
- <i>Metro desk.</i>
- Hey, Spry, it's me.

376
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:30,485
Is the night man
still on the copy desk?

377
00:24:30,645 --> 00:24:32,204
<i>Sure is.
You need to make a change?</i>

378
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:35,396
Yeah, I think I just want
to check on the port story.

379
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,717
I think I might have
transposed some numbers.

380
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,785
Andy, can I get port back?

381
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:41,166
Yeah, sure.

382
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:43,592
We got time on the final.
Go ahead.

383
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,864
Yeah. Somewhere down
in the a-matter,

384
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,388
a graph about the cargo trends
with percentages.

385
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:50,005
<i>Ro-ro, cargo.</i>

386
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:52,387
- Read that back to me.
- <i>Cargo down 12%,</i>

387
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:53,979
<i>ro-ro up 6.4.</i>

388
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,422
12-point decrease
and a 6.4 bump on the ro-ro?

389
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,059
<i>Yep, that's it.</i>

390
00:24:59,424 --> 00:25:00,334
Shit.

391
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:03,534
I woke up in a sweat 'cause I thought I
fucked that up. You sure?

392
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:08,194
Tonight, you had the usual deadline
nightmare to no actual purpose.

393
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:11,435
I guess you're better at
this than you thought.

394
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:12,786
Yeah, I guess.

395
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,549
Thanks, Jay.

396
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:17,279
<i>Anytime. Good night.</i>

397
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:20,926
<i>The husband's thinking, "gosh." I mean,
the police show up at his door and say,</i>

398
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,024
"the lady you married from the Uraine,

399
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:27,154
<i>"A she's dead;
b, she's got a 2005 gold Mrcedes."</i>

400
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:40,814
How long 'til my old lady?

401
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:44,046
It's gonna be a while.

402
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,709
- Got my hands full.
- I'm across the street for breakfast.

403
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:48,742
At this point,
there's only one way to rule.

404
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:52,002
Come on. Bullshit.
This is not a murder. He overdosed.

405
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:54,059
Look, we found his gear
on the bathroom floor,

406
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,184
and his girlfriend, who called 911,
said  the two of them were firing.

407
00:25:57,344 --> 00:25:59,779
I don't have the tox results yet
but even if they find heroin,

408
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:01,624
right now,
it'd be a secondary cause.

409
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:03,945
I've got petechials,
bruising around the neck.

410
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:06,317
My preliminary is homicide
by mechanical asphyxia.

411
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:08,950
Ok, fine. I'll fucking bring
the paramedic in here,

412
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,878
and he'll fucking explain
it to you himself.

413
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,954
That's right.
I'm going to go back to dundalk,

414
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,063
drag his ass in here
so you can hear it from him

415
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:17,454
'cause I ain't taking this as a murder.

416
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:20,558
Hey, Jimmy.

417
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:22,334
Nancy. How's tricks?

418
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,264
Heard you were working murders again.

419
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:26,884
How's life in the county?

420
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:28,258
Worse every year.

421
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:30,675
You guys can't keep all the
dirt on your side of the line.

422
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:32,251
What's Kevin so hot about?

423
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,790
New cutter's dug her heels in,
says it's a murder.

424
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:38,850
It's not, but I can see why
she'd think strangulation.

425
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:42,113
Guy's got a fractured hyoid,
petechia in both eyes,

426
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:43,984
but it's a freak thing.

427
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,057
If we weren't there to see it,
I wouldn't have believed it myself.

428
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:48,891
It's all post-mortem.

429
00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:51,363
He fires up a speedball,
then blacks out,

430
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:53,342
falls between toilet and bathtub,

431
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:55,968
manages to get himself
wedged back pretty good.

432
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,902
I couldn't make this shit up.

433
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:00,644
Medics come, pronounce him
right then and there,

434
00:27:00,804 --> 00:27:03,992
but get this-they can't pry the guy
out without grabbing hold

435
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:05,507
of his neck for leverage.

436
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:09,192
We watched them do it.
This dundalk medic and the morgue guy

437
00:27:09,352 --> 00:27:11,473
just grab his neck and start yanking.

438
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:14,850
Finally they get him out, he comes
down here looking like a strangle job.

439
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:17,260
They can't tell that it's post-mort?

440
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,932
On a fresh body, no one can.

441
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,360
Grab a guy too hard,
and you can cause petechia,

442
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,312
break a hyoid,
even leave bruising,

443
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:26,757
- all after death.
- Fuck me.

444
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,627
So Infante's about to lose his mind

445
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,944
if he can't talk this thing
out of becoming a murder.

446
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:35,413
Either that or
charge the paramedic.

447
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:38,701
Hey. You goin'
across the street for breakfast?

448
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:41,358
- Buy me some scrapple, sailor?
- Come on.

449
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:46,968
Number two.

450
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:30,416
Surprise.

451
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,423
My man Sergei
thought we should talk first.

452
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:39,688
- Talk about what?
- That's on you, youngun.

453
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,081
Whatever business
you tryin' to do through the Russians,

454
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:43,647
you got to go through me first.

455
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,925
'cause up in this bitch here,

456
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:52,084
I'm what you might consider
an authority figure.

457
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:55,903
You know everybody got to
get my help or ask my advice,

458
00:28:56,063 --> 00:28:57,572
like, on all kinds of shit.

459
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:01,239
Sergei step to me the other day
sayin' this nigga Marlo,

460
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,292
who he don't even know,

461
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,978
just be sending him cash money
to get on his visiting list.

462
00:29:07,432 --> 00:29:09,244
So then he ask me if  I knew Marlo.

463
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:11,850
I tell him,
"hell, yeah, I know Marlo real well."

464
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:13,481
You know?

465
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:15,928
Over westside,
everybody know everybody, right?

466
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:20,155
Let me help you find your tongue.

467
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:23,506
You tryin' to get to the Russian
so you can get a line to his people.

468
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:26,017
You tryin' to get
to the Greek motherfuckers

469
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:27,637
because if you can

470
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:31,559
you want to cut Proposition Joe
and all them other east side bitches

471
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:33,212
out the connect.

472
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,092
I mean, you a natural
businessman, right?

473
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:38,530
But this is the thing, though,
and I mean,

474
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,151
I'm with you on all that
as far as it goes, you know?

475
00:29:41,421 --> 00:29:43,937
Westside definitely need
to stick together, you know what I mean?

476
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:46,934
And all the fuss about you
comin' at me--

477
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:52,085
I say let bygones be bygones,
but fuck all them eastside bitches.

478
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:55,224
That's just the way
I feel about it.

479
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:59,592
I got nothin' but love in my heart
for westside niggas, nothin' but love.

480
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,440
'course, I mean, you know,

481
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,167
I got to have my taste, too.

482
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:07,183
Figured that.

483
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,990
So send my sister a hundred large,

484
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,259
and the next time
you come down to Jessup,

485
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,526
it won't be my grill talkin' at you.
My word on that.

486
00:30:17,944 --> 00:30:19,154
A hundred large, huh?

487
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,880
So what's up, man, what's up
with you otherwise, you know?

488
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,810
Ah, the game is the game.

489
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:28,832
Always.

490
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:31,886
They do not.

491
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,769
- I'm looking for you, Jimmy.
- Hey, what's up?

492
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:38,791
You know Nancy Porter
from the county?

493
00:30:39,164 --> 00:30:41,166
- Lester Freamon.
- Good to meet you.

494
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:43,717
Well, thanks for breakfast.

495
00:30:44,152 --> 00:30:45,777
I'll see you downstairs.

496
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:50,091
I spent last night sitting
on that same Mcculloh street lot.

497
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:52,232
- They went back there?
- Twice.

498
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,773
Once in the early evening
and once again after three.

499
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:57,781
They're getting sloppy,

500
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,206
especially now they think
we've backed away.

501
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:06,914
You know, a few good bugs,
a couple of small surveillance cameras,

502
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,965
some man hours, 2 weeks,

503
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:10,509
3 the most.

504
00:31:10,942 --> 00:31:13,041
That's all this
fucking case needs.

505
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,673
Daniels can't give us that.
He made that pretty fucking clear.

506
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,065
Then we go elsewhere.

507
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:25,091
<i>In right field,
number 21, Nick Markakis.</i>

508
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:28,802
Going to the game?
Long-time O's fan?

509
00:31:28,962 --> 00:31:31,120
I could care less about
opening day at this point.

510
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,391
Between Bud Selig and Barry Bonds,
they've ruined baseball for me.

511
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:36,622
- You have a minute to talk?
- Late to meet somebody.

512
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:38,898
How can you commit to a sport
where the commissioner

513
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:41,617
justifies a labor lockout
and cancels the world series?

514
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:43,424
Ho you  been an O's fan?

515
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:48,250
Actually, I grew up with the cubs,
but my son, he kind of likes them so...

516
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,970
And then on steroids,

517
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,538
which has destroyed
what's left of baseball's credibility,

518
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:54,011
he's nowhere to be found.

519
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:55,850
So, you an Orioles fan?

520
00:31:56,817 --> 00:32:00,051
Are you excited at least
that it's opening day, that's kind of...

521
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:02,085
Fuck, baseball!

522
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:06,177
Peanuts! Get your peanuts!

523
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,423
51, 52,

524
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:18,777
53.

525
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:27,118
Hey, Bubs, how you doin'? Have a seat
all the way around the other side.

526
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,241
Obliged.

527
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:51,383
Stop crying.
Don't grab stuff off my plate.

528
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:53,230
Mommy's going to whip you.

529
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:56,000
Do you need some help here?

530
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,219
Because we don't do that here.

531
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:01,691
In our house, there's no hitting anyone,
especially children.

532
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,288
Do you understand me?

533
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:23,349
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic's a nitmare.

534
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:41,207
Think you're funny, huh?
Think I still don't have--

535
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:51,436
All right,
I get the point, fuck holes.

536
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:02,350
Fuck you both, already.

537
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:05,090
A couple more years of this,
you'll be ready for a radio car.

538
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,584
Why can't you come out
to my office and do this like grownups?

539
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,638
They still make you sign in
at the front desk out Woodlawn?

540
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:13,182
Who'd you knuckleheads
piss on this time?

541
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,557
We're still working the edges
of something the bosses shut down.

542
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,394
- What are we talking about?
- The bodies in the vacants.

543
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:22,857
They shut that down?
Jesus Christ.

544
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,180
- What, 22 murders doesn't rate?
- Not anymore.

545
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:29,190
You were on it more than a year?
Where were you?

546
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:30,980
Too close to quit.

547
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:33,672
You know Marlo Stanfield,

548
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:36,994
Chris Partlow, Snoop Pearson?

549
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:38,884
Those names ring out.

550
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:41,837
We got nothing back from any lab work,

551
00:34:42,227 --> 00:34:46,408
there's no witnesses, nothing to make
a murder prosecution, so we settled in,

552
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,192
sat on them for about a year.

553
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:50,123
- You got a pattern?
- A good one.

554
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:53,413
2 or 3 weeks with some good
F.B.I. cameras and wires,

555
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:54,986
maybe a half-dozen agents--

556
00:34:55,146 --> 00:34:57,383
Like we told you boys
when the case broke,

557
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,624
we aren't much
into ghetto drug shit anymore.

558
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:01,888
Most of our guys are counterterror
and political stuff.

559
00:35:02,048 --> 00:35:03,735
We already did all the long legwork.

560
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,265
2 or 3 weeks, and you guys come
out of this with a big headline.

561
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:08,085
You federal fucks like headlines.

562
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,522
l'll run it up the flagpole.

563
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,284
- I'm gonna drive away now.
- All right.

564
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:16,599
If it's ok with
you suckholes.

565
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:26,987
I got good stuff.

566
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:30,125
Hang on. Come here.
Tell me so I can put it on the budget.

567
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:33,658
I got a kid in a wheelchair outside
the stadium, wanting to go to the game

568
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:36,284
but unable because he didn't have
the money for a scalped ticket.

569
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:38,101
- Sounds pretty good.
- You got art?

570
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,596
I tried, but photo said
they were too booked with the game.

571
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:42,191
This is your main color piece.

572
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,658
You got to have a picture of the kid
if he's your lede.

573
00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:46,538
- Can we send them out now?
- I guess.

574
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:48,417
He probably rolled out,
but you can try.

575
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:49,503
Shit.

576
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,391
- How old is this fella?
- 13.

577
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:53,492
What's with his parents?
Why wasn't he in school?

578
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,016
In this city?
He just cut.

579
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:57,145
- What about his parents?
- Both dead. No shit.

580
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:59,034
He lives with his aunt
in west Baltimore.

581
00:35:59,194 --> 00:36:00,636
How' he get in the wheelchair?

582
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:03,191
Something about a stray gunshot.
It was all pretty vague.

583
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:04,776
You got a date when it happened?

584
00:36:04,936 --> 00:36:06,729
He was a little hinky
with telling me much.

585
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:08,917
Fact is, he would only
let me go with his nickname.

586
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:11,491
Look. I got to start writing
if you want it for the e-dot.

587
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:15,224
Why don't you work in metro write
so I can read over your shoulder.

588
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:18,033
What he go by, the nickname?

589
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:19,184
E.J.

590
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,284
E.J.

591
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,241
Hey, jane, come here a minute.

592
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:27,851
Check clips for the last 3 years.

593
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:31,157
See if we got anything on a kid
in the city wounded by a stray bullet.

594
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,624
He'd be 13 now.

595
00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:34,821
Nickname of E.J.
Could be his initials.

596
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:37,455
- Who is he to us?
- The lede of our opening day piece.

597
00:36:37,615 --> 00:36:39,505
If we find him,
I'd love to get art on the kid.

598
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,224
Don't hold your breath.

599
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:50,079
It's a hell of
a case, really.

600
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,457
And God knows
they can use the help.

601
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,029
- Sorry I'm late.
- Anything up?

602
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:15,205
- Just the usual.
- You all right?

603
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,309
We do this right,
it is like a spiral.

604
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:23,124
We start on the outside of the circle,
and we work our way around the edges,

605
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,690
pick up everything we can

606
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,988
before we get to Clay
and the people he keeps close.

607
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:28,985
You think Clay knows
the indictment's coming?

608
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:32,651
Clay Davis has been waiting for
the other shoe to drop his whole life.

609
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:36,457
He knows.

610
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:38,823
And it's your people up in my shit.

611
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:41,920
Not no feds, not no state
people from Annapolis.

612
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:43,910
It's motherfuckers
from my own city.

613
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,558
My hands are tied here, Clayton.

614
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:47,852
It's a new Mayor,
a new state's attorney.

615
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:51,224
I'm out there doing the Lord's work
for you, Erv. You know it.

616
00:37:51,496 --> 00:37:53,757
Who got that pay raise
through the council--

617
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:56,150
just enough for you
to get that new patio

618
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,738
but not enough for that guy
from Pittsburgh to take your place?

619
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,368
I wish I could.

620
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,014
You know I wish I could,

621
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:04,454
but with Carcetti in,
people are watching.

622
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:05,851
I got eyes on me now.

623
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:07,524
You the commissioner still, right?

624
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,517
Yeah,
but it ain't like it was.

625
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:11,250
If you don't control it, who does?

626
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:13,544
On this, I got to reach around Daniels,

627
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:15,557
and he's Carcetti's boy.

628
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:20,477
This is a grand jury
instigation for God's sake.

629
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:24,263
We could both be charged
with obstruction of justice.

630
00:38:24,423 --> 00:38:27,492
Goddamn it, Erv. I been there for you,
carried water for you,

631
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:28,851
and you do me like this?

632
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,424
Clay, I can't.

633
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:31,979
Nobody could.

634
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:35,424
You think I'm goin' down, don't you?

635
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,751
You think I'm done.

636
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:42,357
All y'all ungrateful bitches
thinkin' you can throw me out the boat.

637
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:43,883
- Clay.
- A-ight!

638
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:46,617
I'm gonna remember this moment, Erv.

639
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,054
I'm gonna hold onto this moment.

640
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:02,180
Clay crying to you?

641
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,630
Like I can put
brakes on this mess.

642
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:05,983
Is that--

643
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,065
Yeah. Straight from p-and-r.

644
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:11,644
And that's with the numbers
bent as far as we dare.

645
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:14,390
With city hall asking for clean stats,

646
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,942
- there's only so much we can do.
- The hell are we gonna tell the Mayor?

647
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:25,372
I sat there for half an hour
with him and his deputy.

648
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,018
He knows what he's saying no to.

649
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:29,579
- Well, then how the fuck--
- It's personal, Jimmy.

650
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,032
Somebody at City Hall
really pissed off the U.S. Attorney.

651
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:34,417
- You're kidding me.
- No, and I got an earful.

652
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:37,955
You tell Lester that I'm still trying
to figure out what the problem is,

653
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:41,465
but for right now, you forget
about shopping this case anywhere.

654
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:46,095
D.E.A., A.T.F., customs--
you guys are shut out across the bord.

655
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,372
Fish and fucking wildlife
couldn't help you.

656
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:50,844
Sorry, brother.

657
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,078
The kid is
nowhere to be found.

658
00:39:56,238 --> 00:39:59,024
I sent photo down there
to try and dig him up. Nothing.

659
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:00,417
Probably left.

660
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:02,202
So we got a poor black kid

661
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,891
in a wheelchair with no ticket.

662
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:06,490
He rolls himself from
somewhere in west Baltimore to--

663
00:40:06,897 --> 00:40:10,327
To "the shadow of the mighty brick-faced
coliseum known as oriole park,"

664
00:40:10,695 --> 00:40:14,157
listening to "the cheers from the crowd,
which told the whole tale."

665
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:18,287
We're gonna give good play
to a 13-year-old known only as E.J.,

666
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:20,658
who declines to give his name
because he skipped school,

667
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,679
he's got no parents,
he lives with his aunt.

668
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,343
I'm not saying that this kid isn't
everything you say he is, but damn,

669
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,524
as an editor, I need a little more
to go on if I'm gonna fly this thing.

670
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,253
I resent the implication.

671
00:40:31,474 --> 00:40:33,874
I'm not implying anything.
I'm on your side.

672
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,171
But the standard for
us has to be--

673
00:40:37,232 --> 00:40:39,854
Just finished your story.
Good read.

674
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:41,673
I'm putting it out front.

675
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,215
I think you've really captured
the disparity

676
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:46,733
of the two worlds in this city
in a highly readable narrative.

677
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:48,139
I wouldn't change a word.

678
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:51,160
Thanks, but I'm not sure
everyone shares your enthusiasm.

679
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,967
Aren't you just a little bit concerned

680
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:55,112
that we don't even
have a last name for this kid?

681
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:57,034
I thought we held ourselves up to a--

682
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:59,342
It's not an ideal situation, no,

683
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,837
but the boy's reluctance
to give his last name

684
00:41:01,997 --> 00:41:05,049
clearly stems from his fear
of being  discovered as a truant.

685
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:08,974
- You have a problem with it?
- A little bit, kind of, yeah.

686
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:12,614
- I'm just saying that--
- I think we're on terra firma here.

687
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:17,397
Gotcha.

688
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:19,974
The man made the call.
You're good to go.

689
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:21,559
Thanks, Scott.

690
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,916
The nigga Webster's shop right there.

691
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:33,141
So look, I'm gonna roll up,
and y'all gonna pop out and pop off.

692
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:34,965
Drop who you can.

693
00:41:36,546 --> 00:41:38,707
Let's go all west coast with this.

694
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:42,840
Say what?

695
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,100
Drive-by.

696
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:45,879
That's how they do.

697
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,104
Drop a motherfucker
and not slow down.

698
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:49,822
Like <i>Boys 'n' the Hood</i>.

699
00:41:50,585 --> 00:41:52,116
Shit was tight, remember?

700
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:11,163
Man, I ain't even hit
near one of them.

701
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:12,753
This nigga's wound.

702
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:21,383
Fuck them west coast niggas

703
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,695
'cause in B-more,
we aim to hit a nigga, you heard.

704
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:33,922
Guy leaves two dozen bodies
scattered all over the city,

705
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:35,533
no one gives a fuck.

706
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:38,440
It's because who he dropped.

707
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,560
True that.

708
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,174
You can go a long way in this country
killing black folk.

709
00:42:43,907 --> 00:42:45,374
Young males especially.

710
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:47,651
Misdemeanor homicides.

711
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:50,539
- If Marlo was killing white women.
- White children.

712
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:52,043
Tourists.

713
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:57,953
One white ex-cheerleader
tourist missing in Aruba.

714
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:01,208
Trouble is,
this ain't Aruba, bitch.

715
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:06,585
You think that if 300 white people
were killed in this city every year,

716
00:43:06,745 --> 00:43:09,573
they wouldn't send the 82nd airborne?

717
00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:11,634
Negro, please.

718
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:14,145
There's got to be someway
to make them turn on the faucet.

719
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:16,568
Come on, Jimmy.
You're the smartest boy in the room.

720
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,100
You come up with something
in this broke-ass city.

721
00:43:30,537 --> 00:43:32,638
Isn't he married or some shit now?

722
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:41,163
Did you edit this opening day piece?

723
00:43:42,824 --> 00:43:45,152
Whiting himself blessed it as written

724
00:43:45,476 --> 00:43:47,374
before I could take a meat ax to it.

725
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:49,905
Did it bother you that we don't have
the boy's full name?

726
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:52,145
Yes, Rebecca, it did.

727
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:55,961
Don't give me that "huh."

728
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,897
Whiting wasn't buying
any problem I had.

729
00:43:58,134 --> 00:43:59,585
No art of the kid?

730
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:03,647
None.

731
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:12,067
How long we been here?

732
00:44:14,714 --> 00:44:15,990
More than a hour.

733
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:18,198
Why you think
we sitting here?

734
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,534
See who home and who not,

735
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,437
who on the block,

736
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:27,459
- police and whatnot.
- That's right.

737
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,380
You don't ever want to be
the last man to a party. You feel me?

738
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:36,443
That's why I show up to a job
an hour before.

739
00:44:37,014 --> 00:44:38,162
Sometimes two.

740
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,392
I don't want nobody settin' up on me
while I'm settin' up on them.

741
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:46,355
'Cause there ain't no good thing

742
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:49,273
about motherfuckin' surprises
in this line of work.

743
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:53,441
Why we doin' June Bug anyway?

744
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,267
Heard he called
Marlo a dicksuck.

745
00:44:56,714 --> 00:44:58,230
Talkin' shit like that.

746
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:01,869
You heard.
You ain't sure?

747
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:03,970
People say he said it.

748
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,708
Don't matter if he said it or not.
People think he said it.

749
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,252
Can't let that shit go.

750
00:45:10,593 --> 00:45:11,567
Why not?

751
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:15,646
I mean,
Marlo ain't suck no dick, right?

752
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:20,853
So if Marlo knows he ain't suck dick,

753
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:23,569
then what the fuck he care
what June Bug say?

754
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:25,353
What anybody say?

755
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:29,433
Why this boy got to get dead,
just for talking shit?

756
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:32,191
'cause he got a big
motherfuckin' mouth, that's why,

757
00:45:32,351 --> 00:45:35,274
and you need to stop runnin'
your own mouth, young 'un.

758
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,128
There it is.

759
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:43,974
And all the muscle he got.

760
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:45,573
See it?

761
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:47,262
You ready?

762
00:45:48,784 --> 00:45:50,357
Now you handle that thing.

763
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,016
You give me a sign,

764
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:54,487
meet me out front.
Michael, you go 'round the alley.

765
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:57,506
Body come bustin' out the back,
you drop that shit.

766
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,157
Oh, shitfuck.

767
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:35,341
Bunk's usually the one throwing up.

768
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:37,487
You took aspirin?

769
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:38,939
6.

770
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:42,107
How was that brunette?

771
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:46,395
Must have been a decent ride
'cause he never went home.

772
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,986
Same shirt as yesterday, Jimmy.

773
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:56,105
You catchin' hell from Beadie?

774
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:58,735
No.

775
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:01,215
- Just asking.
- Gentlemen.

776
00:47:02,144 --> 00:47:03,860
D.O.A. Central and Baltimore.

777
00:47:04,466 --> 00:47:06,009
I took a call two days ago.

778
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,121
The old lady? That wasn't a call.
That came back natural.

779
00:47:09,814 --> 00:47:11,637
Look. I'm hungover, Jay.

780
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:17,187
Both of you. You're up.

781
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:43,399
Mommy. Mommy!

782
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:13,377
'Sup, Boris?

783
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:15,760
You know who I am?

784
00:48:16,214 --> 00:48:19,483
I'm that rich uncle been putting
all that money in your canteen account.

785
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,852
In my country, I was
in jail 4 years.

786
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,995
In my country,
this is not prison.

787
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:35,277
This is nothing.

788
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:38,370
I don't need money.

789
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:41,390
I don't need fucking canteen.

790
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:45,297
I don't need you.

791
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:52,258
- Gangbanger.
- A-ight. I feel that.

792
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,476
I feel that, but Avon over there,

793
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,690
he thinks you might be able
to help get a message to the Greeks,

794
00:49:00,335 --> 00:49:01,418
to Vondas.

795
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:10,324
I mean, seeing as
you don't need my money,

796
00:49:12,664 --> 00:49:14,605
Vondas might be happy to have it.

797
00:49:17,616 --> 00:49:19,631
If he don't want see me, he won't,

798
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,403
but if he do,

799
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,258
it's you that made it happen.

800
00:49:55,757 --> 00:49:57,457
Sonny Mays is running late.

801
00:49:58,064 --> 00:49:59,840
Can you fill in as speaker?

802
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,207
It's time to share, Bubs.

803
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:06,698
Nah, I don't think so.
I'm not feeling so great today.

804
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:09,308
Look, as your sponsor,
I'm telling you,

805
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,928
you got to step up for something.

806
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:13,408
I don't care what.

807
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:15,611
I don't care
if it's in these rooms or not,

808
00:50:16,155 --> 00:50:18,607
but there ain't no laying
in the cut on this shit.

809
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:20,437
You got to step up somewhere.

810
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:35,711
Detective, can I get a word?

811
00:50:36,057 --> 00:50:38,045
Anything?
Anything on the suspects?

812
00:50:39,648 --> 00:50:41,359
Maybe on your way out then.

813
00:50:49,477 --> 00:50:50,898
Backdoor was open.

814
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:54,041
Can't tell if he ran through
and out the rear.

815
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:57,884
They. Unless the shooter
put a bullet in her head

816
00:50:58,044 --> 00:50:59,760
for good measure
after the shotgun.

817
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,241
Also, two of our street
cameras were disabled.

818
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:04,047
- Wires ripped.
- Fuck.

819
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:05,640
That's a whole lot of thinking

820
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,610
for any motherfucker
to do something like this.

821
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:23,116
How the fuck?

822
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:27,859
How?

823
00:51:28,914 --> 00:51:30,841
He must have been
in that closet the whole time.

824
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,274
no one heard shit.

825
00:51:32,678 --> 00:51:34,389
Call D.S.S.
Now.

826
00:51:35,936 --> 00:51:37,106
Any media out back?

827
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:39,766
Bring a cage car around.

828
00:51:57,962 --> 00:51:59,782
Hey.
How you doing?

829
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:02,907
look, I don't know
what I can do to help.

830
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:04,500
I'm just tryin' to find my way.

831
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:07,509
seein' how crowded it is,
maybe I can help you hand out tickets.

832
00:52:09,017 --> 00:52:12,071
That's fine, Bubs. Really,
but wouldn't you rather serve?

833
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:14,800
Serve lunch.

834
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:18,072
- You mean give the food to people?
- Isn't that the best part?

835
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,661
- Nah, I can't. No.
- All right. Come on.

836
00:52:23,221 --> 00:52:25,603
We can always use
an extra set of hands.

837
00:52:30,157 --> 00:52:31,327
He fell out.

838
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,357
Last bottle of smoke
probably did him in.

839
00:52:34,517 --> 00:52:36,681
Another drunk found him,
pulled me off post.

840
00:52:36,841 --> 00:52:38,302
Ten-seven when I arrived.

841
00:52:39,379 --> 00:52:40,778
You call for a crime lab?

842
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:42,587
The wait's 2 to 3 hours.
