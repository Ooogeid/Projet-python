00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,300
??

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,200
Yo, Denise.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,100
-Hey.
-Hey.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,600
I got tickets to the M.I.A.
show next Thursday at the Hippodrome.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,100
It's going to be sick.

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,000
My wife hates that kind of music,
so I thought maybe you and I...

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,700
Listen, Charlie,
I think I'm going to take off.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,300
It looks like it's going 
to get pretty bad out there.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,500
Well...

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,200
what do you say I walk you out?

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,000
Why not?

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,500
Wow, that storm came in fast.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,200
Come on.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,600
Let me take you to your car.

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,200
Oh, my gosh.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,600
Careful here,
careful, careful.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,200
-Oh, get your keys.
-Okay.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,400
Got my keys-- okay.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,600
Okay.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
There you go.

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Thank you, Charlie.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,500
No problem-- 

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,800
-you have a good night, Denise.
-You, too.

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,700
All right, bye-bye.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,700
Charlie!

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Oh, my God!

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Charlie, are you okay?

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,000
I think so.

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,500
??

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,400
Agent Lee.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
You made it here before us.I'm impressed.

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Well, I am your recon guy.

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,100
What brings us
to Massachusetts, Felix?

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,100
You're not going to believe
what we got here, Doc.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Lightning did this.

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,100
Both of them?

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,000
Well,it's unusual, but it happens.

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
It is a bit more than unusual.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,700
All of them...

42
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,400
killed by lightning?

43
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,600
Yep.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,100
That...that isn't possible,is it?

45
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,400
Well, statistically speaking,

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,300
the chances of getting struck by 
lightning in Massachusetts are 28,000 to one.

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,500
Since 1974,there have been
37 deaths by lightning in this state.

48
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,800
30 of those deaths happened 
last night between 6:38 and 6:49.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,400
30 deaths by lightning
in a ten-minute thunderstorm?

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,700
And if that isn't enough bad news,

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,200
local weather reports call for another 
storm to hit within the next 48 hours.

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,000
Better find out what's causing this
before we run out of morgues.

56
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,600
Mr. Han,what can you tell 
us about the bodies of the victims?

57
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,600
Besides the sheer number of them,
nothing more than what you'd expect.

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Surface burns, blistering,
cardiac arrest,then death.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
What a way to go.

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Well, death by lightning
is electrocution,and electrocution's...

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,200
just a very hot heart attack.

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Did you contact the National Weather Service, 

63
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,900
find out if there was anything unusual
about this particular storm?

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah.The number of lightning strikes was actually
just about average for New England this time of year.

65
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,100
Well, if there's nothing unusual about the storm,

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,100
there must be something unusual about the victims.

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
All 30 of them?

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,500
 No, I said 30 people died.

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,800
At least 15 more came into Springfield 
General yesterday after surviving a strike.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,500
 45 lightning victims.

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,400
Dr. Hood, you ever come
across anything like this?

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,500
No, I have not.

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Mr. Han,what makes one person 
survive a lightning strike

74
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,500
and another person get killed,
like Denise Hall?

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,800
Any number of factors.

76
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,600
Uh, strength of the strike,

77
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,800
fat-to-muscle ratio and
 cardiological health of the victim,

78
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,200
what they're standing on,

79
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,200
what kind of shoes they're wearing.

80
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,200
We should compare those factors
between the victims and the survivors,

81
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,500
see what kind of differences we find.

82
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,700
Let's get a full workup on 
everyone who survived a strike.

83
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,400
Okay, Hood.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,800
I know you're not supposed to be out in 
the open during a thunderstorm,Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,800
but other than that...

86
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,200
?? When you were a kid,you ever rub your
hand on a carpet and make static electricity?

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,700
Yeah, I used to try and shock my 
dad whenever he was around.

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,900
Charming.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, um, lightning works
pretty much the same way.

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,700
Negatively-charged air rubs against 
positively-charged air and creates an electrical spark.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,900
Which then becomes lightning?

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
And like any other electricity,

93
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,700
all it's looking for is the path of least resistance
between where the current starts and where it ends.

94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,700
And the path of least
resistance would be...?

95
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
Tall metal structures.

96
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,000
I mean, that's why so many, um,towers 
and tall buildings have lightning rods, 

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,700
'cause they get struck all the time.

98
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,700
But if you're short
and not made of metal...

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Chances are,lightning won't hit you.

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,100
Then, why would our victims be the path
of least resistance?

101
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,400
Well, that's what we got
to find out.

102
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
WILCOX LABORATORIES

103
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,500
??

104
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,400
Come in.

105
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,300
Liz; Thomas.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,700
Sit.

107
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,800
We'd hoped it wouldn't come to this,

108
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,800
but, uh... well,you've read the papers.

109
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
There's just no money out there anymore.

110
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
So, uh...

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,700
we're making cuts.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,800
And, uh,thanks to a generous Department of Defense 
grant from the War Fighter Enhancement program,

113
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,500
 we can keep moving with the, uh,handheld 
X-ray device the gadget boys are working on, 

114
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
but, uh,everything else could
 end up on the chopping block.

115
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,300
So, what you're saying is that
 military applications get priority,

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,100
while alternative energy
gets put on the back burner again.

117
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,800
Liz, he's just trying to keep the lights on.

118
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,300
Yes, and I'm just trying to revolutionize
 the way people exist on this planet.

119
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,300
No one doubts your passion, Liz.

120
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,000
But the fact remains that we have 
two microbattery projects here at Wilcox

121
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,500
and only enough funding for one.

122
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,600
And we all know that as it stands,
Dr. Lowenthal's project is making better progress.

123
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,200
But I realize that good science takes time,

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,100
so, Liz,you have until the end
of the quarter to catch up.

125
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,200
And, uh, at that point,whoever's 
battery is further along gets to stay,

126
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,700
and the other project will have to go.

127
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,300
I won a Eureka Grant.

128
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm a Rhodes Scholar.

129
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
And I've published more papers than
everyone else in my department combined.

130
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,800
I know that.

131
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,800
Liz, this is nothing personal, but...

132
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,000
But you're willing to cut 
me loose if I don't produce.

133
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,400
Fine.

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I'll have my battery up and running,

135
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,300
and outperforming Thomas' within the month.

136
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,400
You can count on it.

137
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,200
Nothing personal.

138
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Your husband's really lucky to have survived
such a massive jolt of electricity, Mrs. Wease.

139
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
They did everything they could
for him at the hospital.

140
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,800
Now, it's just a matter
of resting up till he's himself again.

141
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,100
Right, Charlie?

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, it's going to take
 him a good while to recover.

143
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,100
Do you know if he can hear us?

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,500
They said he should be able to.

145
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,100
But he doesn't act like it.

146
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,300
Charlie?

147
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,100
Baby, can you hear me?

148
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,300
Can you tell me,was he 
wearing headphones when he was struck?

149
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,200
Uh, yeah.

150
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,700
-He was... wearing this.
-Hmm.

151
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,600
The hospital gave it back to 
me with his clothes; I don't know why.

152
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
People wear MP3 players all the time now.

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,500
Do you think it makes
them more susceptible to getting hit?

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't know if, um,

155
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,100
such a small conductor
would really make much difference.

156
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,600
But it's worth checking if the other
 victims were wearing headphones, yeah.

157
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,700
I'll have Agent Lee work up a list of anything
 conductive the victims might've been wearing.

158
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,400
Okay.

159
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,900
Medical devices,
jewelry, electronics...

160
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,500
Yeah, good thinking.

161
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,300
So Mrs. Wease,you okay?

162
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I probably don't know half
the songs that were on this thing.

163
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,200
I don't know what he was reading
or what shows he was watching.

164
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,700
We used to fight and then make up,

165
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,200
 but we,we stopped like it didn't matter.

166
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,000
Like we'd grown indifferent to each other.

167
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,000
I didn't even speak to him yesterday.

168
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,500
I'm so sorry.

169
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
Well, sometimes, um...

170
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
when you nearly lose someone,

171
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,800
it's like you get a chance to
 press the reset button,you know?

172
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,700
If you're lucky,you get to 
realize, uh,it's all still there.

173
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,500
You just needed to recognize it, you know?

174
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,300
Hey.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,800
Thomas.

176
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Did you come down here to gloat?

177
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,400
Of course not.

178
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,400
Some of us are going to go over
to Denise Hall's memorial.

179
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Nothing big.Just a little
 get-together for the employees.

180
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
-A get-together?
-Yeah.

181
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,400
You know, a chance to pay 
our respects,share some memories.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,100
I thought you might want to come.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
I never met the woman.

184
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,800
And apparently,I have too much work to do.

185
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,900
Oh, come on, Liz.

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
-I'm sorry about Coleman...
-Don't be, Tom.

187
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,600
I'm a scientist.
I understand logic.

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,600
They don't have enough money for both of 
us, so,let the best research win.

189
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,500
You know, for an organic chemist with
 post-doc work in molecular engineering,

190
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,200
you're surprisingly sentimental.

191
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,900
Sample number 317.

192
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,300
Another dud.

193
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,600
This case has got me thinking back.

194
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,900
I know kids are scared
of lightning,but not me.

195
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
Why does that not surprise me?

196
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,500
My dad was a field agent in Phoenix,

197
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,800
and I used to climb up on top
of the roof of our house

198
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,800
and watch the lightning
storms across the desert.

199
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
I never saw lightning as a bad thing..

200
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,800
until now.

201
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,200
Did I tell you I nearly drowned once?

202
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Hood, still don't know
if you have a middle name.

203
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,900
I don't.

204
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,900
It was, um... It was
when I was in high school.

205
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,900
I was doing a term paper.

206
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,000
It seemed very important at the time,

207
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,000
and, uh,well, I was having a lot
of trouble with it,

208
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,800
so, uh, to clear my head,
I went out for a swim.

209
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:28,200
Guess I was so, uh,caught up with what 
I was thinking,what I was going to write,

210
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,800
you know, that, uh,when I looked up,
I was in the middle of nowhere,

211
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,900
and the beach was way,way out there.

212
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,100
And you drowned?

213
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,400
I just remember,I looked around at 
the sea and how enormous it seemed,

214
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,800
and there I was,this little... speck.

215
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,400
And, um,it was pretty scary,

216
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,200
but I realized maybe my 
term paper wasn't so important after all.

217
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,500
Getting back on the beach
and saving my life was.

218
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,500
Nothing beats the power of nature
for putting our self-importance in check.

219
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,600
We've got to find out
what's causing this.

220
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,700
This new girl's wicked hot.??

221
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
??

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
See what I mean?

223
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Hey, sweetheart,you got a little time for me?

224
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,600
For another 20 bucks,
I can go topless.

225
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,100
I'd love to, but I don't
have any more cash.

226
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,300
That's okay.You might not see them,
but you can still feel them.

227
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,300
Baby, you're electric.

228
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,700
HARPER'S ISLAND A MYSTERY EVENT 
APRIL 9 JULY 2

229
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,300
Dr. Hood.Felix.??

230
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,700
-Hey.Thanks.
-Yeah.

231
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Meet Richard Burke--
"Dickie" to his friends.

232
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,100
There was no storm last night.

233
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,800
Where would the lightning have come from?

234
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
-Was he was in the car when he died?
-Yup.

235
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,500
Well, it couldn't have been lightning then.

236
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,500
I mean, aside from a little gas mileage,

237
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
it's essentially,it's a Faraday cage anyway.

238
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,800
A what?

239
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,600
A Faraday cage--

240
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,400
it's a metal box, and 
the current can flow around it,

241
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,600
but inside,the electrical field remains zero,

242
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,300
and you can take a 
direct hit,you'll be fine.

243
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,200
Check this out, Doc.

244
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, the current came through
the ignition, huh?

245
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,400
Yeah; battery's
completely drained.

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,200
So it discharged into him
when he turned the key.

247
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,900
But a car battery only has,
what, 12 volts of electricity?

248
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,300
That's not enough
to kill someone.

249
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,600
No, especially notif you ??what a 
poor conductor of electricity the human body is.

250
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,000
I checked and rechecked all the data
on the 45 lightning strike victims.

251
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,900
Any patterns?

252
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,400
No similarities in age, race, 
gender, height,or personal effects.

253
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,700
No apparent difference
between who lived and died.

254
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,200
It's all over the map.

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
I need to talk with the coroner.

256
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,500
??

257
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,300
??

258
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,100
No, Dr. Hood,I'm sorry to say all our tests 
continue to reveal nothing out of the ordinary...

259
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,300
??Dr. Hood, can you hear me?

260
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,400
Lot of static on the line.

261
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,800
Okay. Will you hold on for a second?

262
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,100
Um, one thing we haven't tried yet.

263
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,900
Are you in the autopsy room now?

264
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes.

265
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,100
You, uh, with one of the victims?

266
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,800
Yes.

267
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,800
Do me a favor.Will you
 get closer to the body, please?

268
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,200
Don't worry.
I'll stay on the line.

269
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,700
All right.

270
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,400
Now what?

271
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,500
Closer.

272
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,700
-Like this?
-Yeah, just like that.

273
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,500
Thank you, Mr. Han.

274
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Can you cut me a slice
of the skin, please?

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,100
We'll be over in a minute.

276
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,900
In what authorities believe
to be a freak accident,

277
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
the battery in Richard Burke's
20-year-old truck discharged

278
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,600
when he turned the key,
killing him instantly.

279
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,900
With Burke's death marking the 31st electrocution
 in the Springfield area in less than two days,

280
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,200
state police are scrambling to find a link between
 Tuesday's lightning victims and this new case.

281
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,200
As of right now, however,the
 two incidents appear to be unrelated,

282
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,700
and law enforcement is not instructing residents to 
take any special precautions for the storm system

283
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,600
due to hit the Pioneer Valley later this week.

284
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,300
Ow!

285
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,300
Damn it!

286
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Charlie, I've got breakfast for you.

287
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,200
And coffee.

288
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh, my God!

289
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,200
That's the section of
epidermis from Denise Hall.

290
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,100
Electrocuted by lightning.

291
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
This is the section of 
epidermis from Dickie Burke,

292
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,900
 electrocuted by a car 
battery on a cloudless night.

293
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,900
We got to test these samples
for resistance to electricity--

294
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,500
if it's low,then that would explain
why these victims seem to be attracting electricity.

1
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,800
well, we're just a county morgue.

2
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,700
We don't have the kind of
equipment to do that here.

3
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
It's okay. You got a flashlight?

4
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,900
Thank you.

5
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,500
Got a piece of paper i could use?

6
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm sure you know that, uh,

7
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Skin is about as conductive to
electricity as a piece of paper.

8
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Which is...

9
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,000
not very.

10
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,600
Something about our victims was messing

11
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,300
With the electromagnetic
field on our cell phones.

12
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,900
Let's take a look.

13
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,100
Now, this...

14
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This skin is conducting electricity the same
way as wire or a piece of metal would.

15
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,100
I'd be willing to bet that the other
victims would be the same.

16
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,300
The question is "why?"

17
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
So there's metal in the skin?

18
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, if your skin had
a very high metal content,

19
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,300
You'd be pulling currents toward you 24/7.

20
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,800
That doesn't sound very safe.

21
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
No, it's not.

22
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,300
Okay, but how do you get a
bunch of metal in the skin?

23
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,400
The only way to answer that question is
to look much closer at this sample.

24
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,100
Liz?

25
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,700
Hey, i know you've been
working around the clock.

26
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
I brought you some chocolate.

27
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,000
with this electron microscope,

28
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,700
We should be able to
get a much closer look

29
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,600
At the skin sample than with
an everyday light microscope.

30
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,000
How much closer?

31
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,600
Oh, a thousand or two
times, give or take.

32
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
- wow.
- what is it?

33
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,900
Well, it's some kind of nanofilament.

34
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,000
- Oh...
- um, sorry.

35
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,800
No, it's um...

36
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,800
Essentially, uh, nanofilaments

37
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,900
Are just very fine metal wires.

38
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,300
They look like they're embedded
symbiotically in denise hall's flesh.

39
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,700
That's not all.

40
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,900
Look.

41
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200
- It's growing.
- Hood?

42
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,700
Are you saying these wires are alive?

43
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,400
It's alive, all right.

44
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,000
so what is it exactly?

45
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,300
A virus.

46
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,100
Engineered, by the look of it,

47
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,200
But a virus, nonetheless.

48
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,300
I'm guessing you can't cure it with
two aspirin and a bowl of chicken soup.

49
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,200
No, i'd say not. I mean...

50
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,400
By the look of it, his thing
builds wires in your skin.

51
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Look what it's doing here.

52
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,200
See, it pulling metal from surrounding tissue
and turns it into material for its wires.

53
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,500
I'm telling you, if you could harness this
virus and make it lay down micro-Wires on command,

54
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,900
The market would be limitless.

55
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,800
Medical devices, security sensors,
Micro-Batteries...

56
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,700
You could use this technology to make
 an airplane that hardly uses any fuel.

57
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,200
You could make a car with a battery
the size of a baby's thumbnail.

58
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,000
I mean, this virus is
a scientific revolution.

59
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,900
But is it going to spread?

60
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,500
Because if it is, we have an epidemic
of electrocutions on our hands.

61
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,000
Well, it's not in the mucous membranes,
So it's not going to be airborne like a cold,

62
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,600
But i'd say it could be
passed skin-To-Skin, yeah.

63
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,400
So it'll take a lot longer to spread
than an airborne virus would?

64
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,100
I suppose that's something.

65
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,800
Well, on the other hand, a lot of
viruses are very difficult to kill.

66
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,700
want some more cheery news?

67
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,700
The storm that's rolling in--

68
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,200
National weather service says
it's going to be a big one.

69
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,500
Rachel young.

70
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,700
Okay, felix. How long have we got?

71
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,400
Five, maybe six hours.

72
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
It's charlie wease.

73
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,700
They just brought him in upstairs.
He's in critical condition.

74
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
I'm jacob hood. I work for the fbi.

75
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
I'm dr. Heisey with the emergency room.

76
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,700
Meaning i have to treat this man, now.

77
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,900
Doctor, charlie wease
and anyone else who survived

78
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
A lightning strike
in the past two days

79
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,300
Has got a virus that's sapping
the metal content from their bodies.

80
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,800
That's why his hair's turning white.

81
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,300
It's an extreme copper deficiency.

82
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,300
You need to infuse Mr. Wease
and all the other patients

83
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,600
immediately with copper, zinc...

84
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,000
How about i examine the patient
myself, dr. Hood? Thank you.

85
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,500
Okay, but do it quickly before
his system shuts down entirely.

86
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,900
Please, anyone dealing
with lightning victims,

87
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,200
Don't touch their skin directly;
it is contagious.

88
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,900
- Hood?
- Yeah?

89
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,000
Felix did some digging--

90
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There's three companies in the area
working with nanotechnology.

91
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,300
Okay, so we need to take
blood samples from employees

92
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,500
From all of them, test for the virus.

93
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
But we don't want a panic on our hands.

94
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,300
Employees freaking out,
leaving before they get tested.

95
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,000
No.

96
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,300
I'll have the megahut create a backstop,

97
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
Get you some lab techs from the bureau.

98
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,900
- Okay.
- Give the ceos just as much info as they need.

99
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,300
And use corporate
drug testing as your cover.

100
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,500
Hmm, okay.

101
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,300
Uh, doc, this thing is contagious?

102
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,200
That's right.

103
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
So use rubber gloves.

104
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Rubber gloves?!

105
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,000
Use a whole rubber suit
if i can find one.

106
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,000
Might be difficult.

107
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,100
we will be collecting blood and
hair samples from all employees.

108
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,000
These samples will then be tested
for evidence of substance abuse.

109
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,200
You got a problem with that?

110
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,200
Yeah. Moving on.

111
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,100
These tests are mandatory
for your continued employment

112
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,000
Here at wilcox labs.

113
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,900
If everyone cooperates,

114
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,700
We will move quickly.

115
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,500
Thank you, people.

116
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,600
Ow!

117
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,500
???

118
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,900
The doctor said if i read to you,
you might come out of this sooner.

119
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,300
But i don't know what
you'd want to read any more.

120
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,700
Remember when we read to each
other on sunday afternoons?

121
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
That was nice, wasn't it?

122
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
We should do that
again, charlie.

123
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,200
Help! I need some help in here!

124
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Help!

125
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,000
Damn it.

126
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,000
excuse me, doctor?

127
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,300
Why is that man not on life support?

128
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,000
Every time we hook him up, the machines
blow out-- We can't afford to lose anymore.

129
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,300
Can he survive without it?

130
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,500
Not for long. You were right about
the metal deficiencies, though.

131
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,100
His body was out of almost
every metal in the human body,

132
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,300
- Except calcium.
- So you infused him, right?

133
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,200
We infused him with a metal
solution, just like you suggested,

134
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,000
But it didn't seem to do anything for his
deficiencies or any of the other victims.

135
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
They just keep getting worse.

136
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,300
All the metals just seem to
be getting drained out of them.

137
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,000
We have to find his wife right away.

138
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,200
I'll alert hospital security.

139
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,100
Hey, doctor, your hospital got a burns unit?

140
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,500
Best outside of boston.

141
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,900
Your security, do they carry metal detectors?

142
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,700
I think so.

143
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,000
What are you getting at?

144
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,400
Okay, well, we found a network of
microscopic wires in the victim's skin.

145
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,600
I think that's what's making
charlie wease sick.

146
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,900
What i want you to do,

147
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,800
Is i want you to find those wires
using the metal detectors.

148
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,500
I want you to remove them by exfoliating
away the epidermis down to the dermal layer;

149
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,800
his wife's, too. Where she is,
you need to find her. 

150
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,400
This thing travels Skin-To-Skin,
so she probably has it.

151
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,900
It may even be her skin
that shorted the life support.

152
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,100
You want me to give my
patients second-Degree burns,

153
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Nearly destroy their skin, and leave
them with a long and painful recovery?

154
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,800
???

155
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,200
Rebecca wease is being treated as we speak.

156
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,200
And felix has 28 positives
for the metal virus.

157
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,800
Yeah, i'm pretty sure
this is ground zero.

158
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,500
Well, uh, i've had to
make some cuts recently,

159
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,700
But, uh, our highest profile
project is an x-Ray gun

160
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,200
That helps our troops
see through walls in combat.

161
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,000
what about the hot wheels?

162
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,400
oh, that's to remind me of
my favorite project of all.

163
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,700
Do you know how a, um,
pull-Back motor works?

164
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,400
You pull it back two inches, and it
can power itself across a room.

165
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,800
It's genius, but, uh...

166
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,000
If you tried tfit that
mechanism in a full-Size car,

167
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
The gear train would have
to stretch a block.

168
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,100
- It would never work.
- You know what would work?

169
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,300
A teeny-Weeny, little battery.

170
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,700
But, uh, something so small,

171
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,400
You could only make it with a
nanotech virus. Am i right?

172
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,400
Someday, a battery small enough

173
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,600
To fit inside this toy will be
able to power an 18-Wheeler,

174
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,600
With no smog, no petrochemicals and no noise.

175
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
It's amazing.

176
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,300
If i'm lucky enough, it'll be my
company that figures out how to do it.

177
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,400
My virus.

178
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
If the economy doesn't put
us out of business first.

179
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,000
well, i'm sorry to tell you, but you
may be out of business before then.

180
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,200
Your nanotech virus s killing people.

181
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
That's impossible.

182
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,200
Our virus doesn't use a human host.

183
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,000
Wait a minute.

184
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,900
Is that what your people with the
needles downstairs are all about?

185
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,800
I told my employees they
were being drug-Tested.

186
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,700
Half my physicists probably think they're
going to be fired tomorrow morning.

187
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,900
We took measures to avoid a panic.

188
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,800
i'm sorry, mr. Coleman,
But the tests are coming back positive...

189
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,700
For antibodies from your virus.

190
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,100
See, what's happening is people are dying,

191
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Because nanofilaments in their skin
are turning them into human conductors.

192
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,900
There's a new
storm coming,

193
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,200
And that could mean
new victims.

194
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,500
So what can you tell us?

195
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,700
Um, it's a long shot,

196
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,700
But i can only think of one person

197
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,000
Who would sabotage her
own work just to spite me.

198
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,900
Is that everyone?

199
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,700
Uh, everyone except for, um...

200
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,500
Dr. Elizabeth hansen.

201
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,000
Lab 18-B.

202
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,700
Thank you.

203
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,200
- Agent lee?
- Yes.

204
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
I've got a really weird result here.

205
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,000
You have the sample to back this up?

206
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,700
Thank you.

207
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,700
Liz?

208
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,300
My god, are you all right?

209
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,300
I think so. I got a shock
from the microwave.

210
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,600
liz, the fbi thinks you sabotaged the project.

211
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
They say that, uh,

212
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,400
The virus escaped, and now it's hurting people,

213
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,000
Maybe even you.

214
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,100
dr. Hood?

215
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Hey, doc, none of our tech guys
know exactly what this is,

216
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
But i think you should
have a look at it.

217
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,400
Can we use your lab?

218
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,100
do you have an image of the
virus you're working with?

219
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Something from the very
beginning of the project?

220
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,000
yes.

221
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,500
That's the original virus.

222
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,900
well...

223
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:29,000
...this is the virus taken from 28 of
your colleagues that tested positive.

224
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
And...

225
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,800
This...

226
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,800
Is the virus taken from one of your
colleagues that tested negative.

227
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
- oh, my god.
- What is it?

228
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,400
It's mutating.

229
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,300
Going through three stages,
from benign to deadly.

230
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
Virus mutate naturally.

231
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,500
That's why last year's flu vaccine
will be worthless by next winter.

232
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,400
So these two viruses are
mutations of your base virus?

233
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,100
yes, but it shouldn't have mutated
into a human virus so quickly.

234
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,400
So how did virus a
become viruses b and c?

235
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Radiation.

236
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,400
you'd need a few hits,

237
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,800
But it's the only thing that would
explain the rapid cellular change.

238
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,300
and whoever exposed the base virus to radiation

239
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,200
Got infected with
an early mutation of it,

240
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,000
And that's probably what protected them
when the strain turned deadly.

241
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,100
- It's like a vaccine.
- Yeah.

242
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:25,100
So whoever this version of the
virus came from is our patient zero.

243
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,000
That's right.

244
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,900
thomas lowenthal.

245
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
I don't believe it.

246
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,300
You said you make
x-Ray guns here, right?

247
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,700
They have to produce some kind
of radiation, don't they?

248
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,900
hansen and lowenthal both have labs
at the basement level of this building.

249
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,100
If the mutated virus originated down here,

250
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,700
How did it get all the way to
charlie wease or 30 other people?

251
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,500
You know what?

252
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,400
When i was setting up the blood tests,

253
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,300
The hr rep told me that employees had
a mandatory retreat about three weeks ago.

254
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Hansen, lowenthal and charlie wease were
there, along with 50 other people.

255
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,600
Two days of trust falls and
rope courses would be enough

256
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
To spread the virus
to anyone in the company.

257
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,100
but not all the victims had
contact with wilcox employees.

258
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,400
What about dickie burke?

259
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
The guy from the strip club, right?

260
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,100
The clam digger is the closest
strip club to wilcox labs.

261
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,400
You know guys that work here
hit that place all the time.

262
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,600
- Yeah.
- Felix?

263
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,900
Call the club, shut it down.

264
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,000
And call the cdc.

265
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,900
???

266
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,700
But don't call it an epidemic.

267
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,600
God knows how many people have
been infected with this thing.

268
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,400
Let's hope they don't want
to go out in this storm.

269
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,700
<i>...with sections</i>Of both
the turnpike and the i-91

270
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,200
Reporting intermittent flooding
as a result of heavy rainfall.

271
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,900
As the storm intensifies,

272
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,000
Concerns over fatal lightning
strikes in the area continue,

273
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,900
And law enforcement officers are advising
hampden county residents to remain inside

274
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,200
For the duration of the storm,
if at all possible.

275
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,500
We would like to remind
our viewers that lightning

276
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,100
Can travel into the home
via telephone wires,

277
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,600
Electrical outlets...

278
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,400
Hey, what's going on?

279
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,900
County's turning off nonessential power.

280
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,200
Just came in through the radio.

281
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,900
Folks are supposed to go
home and stay there.

282
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,900
They say why?

283
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,800
Something to do with the
weather, the lightning.

284
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,400
Listen, first charlie and denise,
then those drug tests, now this.

285
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,200
It's like the end of days.

286
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,700
Let's get going.

287
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,800
Fbi! Stop!

288
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,200
stop! Dr. Lowenthal!

289
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,900
Rachel!

290
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,800
Watch, stay back!

291
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,000
Thanks.

292
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,200
Don't mention it.

293
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,500
I've got your back.

294
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,000
guys? we should get in.

295
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,600
Thought he didn't have the virus.

296
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,500
He didn't.

297
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,500
He had bad luck.

298
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,100
Agent young, dr. Hood.

299
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,400
Hi, dr. Hansen.

300
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,400
How are the other patients?

301
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,100
Well, the treatment's working.

302
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,300
The virus appears to only colonize
the outer layers of the skin,

303
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,700
And the county's authorized
mandatory testing and vaccinations

304
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,200
That should stop it from spreading.

305
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,600
How's thomas?

306
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,300
Dr. Lowenthal didn't make it.

307
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,900
We found the prototype
x-Ray gun on him.

308
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,200
And the intermediate virus was
still present in his lab work.

309
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,000
He was sabotaging you,
dr. Hansen.

310
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,900
Are they having a memorial
for him at the lab?

311
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Monday.

312
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,900
I'd like to go to that.

313
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,100
Pay my respects.

314
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,700
Share some memories.

315
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Really?

316
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,900
I know i don't, um...

317
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,900
Seem like the most personable
employee at wilcox.

318
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,300
In fact, i can be kind of a bitch.

319
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,600
Ah, i'm sure you're not that bad.

320
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I am.

321
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,100
But the microbattery project is
my passion in this life and...

322
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,300
...even though dr. Lowenthal
was a two-Faced bastard,

323
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,800
???

324
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,000
He provided me with excellent competition.

325
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,600
Agent lee.

326
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,800
Agent young, dr. Hood.
???

327
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,000
we all tested negative
for the virus.

328
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,700
Nice work
on this case, felix.

329
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,500
And i'm glad to hear
your skin isn't infested

330
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,900
- with a deadly nanofilament.
- Thank you.

331
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,900
Kind of creepy
to think about, isn't it?

332
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,000
Little metal wires,
alive, in your skin.

333
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,500
I'd be careful there,
if i were you.

334
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,400
You never know if those little metal
wires are hanging out on your jacket,

335
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
your shirt, your tie...

336
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,200
What is that hanging from your
hair, by the way, rachel?

337
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,400
Wise ass.

338
00:40:51,700 --> 00:41:02,400
