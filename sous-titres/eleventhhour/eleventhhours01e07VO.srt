1
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,160
Come on,Sacha.

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,200
Come on.

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
Come on.

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,530
That was almost twice
as fast as the last time.

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,260
That little guy is gonna
save a lot of lives.

6
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,230
Here's your reward,dude.

7
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,760
Get to chill with your buddies.

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,260
Get in there.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,260
Dr. Miller,

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,760
has he been getting the
required amount of sleep?

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,360
Mm..hmm.

12
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,430
This is nice work,Bruce.

13
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,060
You've exceeded our most
optimistic projections.

14
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,900
- By a large margin. 
- Well,how fast

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,260
- can you be ready for clinical trials? 
- To collate

16
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,430
and quantify the data,we're
talking months now,not years.

17
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,500
Now,if this thing
ramps up as it should,

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,760
Belton Pharmaceuticals is gonna
let you write your own ticket.

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,060
Everything okay?

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,160
Yeah,just a question down at the lab.

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
I better go.

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,930
Don't want to fall behind schedule.

23
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,630
Sacha,what have you done?

24
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,700
Where did he say to meet him?

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Right here.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,460
Dr. Hood,

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
Special Agent Young,I'm Henry Brooks.

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,660
I appreciate you taking
the time to see me.

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,560
- Colonel Brooks,isn't it? 
- That's right.

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,500
With the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

31
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,660
DARPA,the folks who really
invented the Internet.

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,300
Tell me,Dr. Hood,what do you know

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,830
about the Warfighter
Enhancement Program?

34
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,860
Well,I gather there's

35
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,430
a great emphasis on miniaturizing

36
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,130
some of the 80-plus pounds

37
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,300
of gear carried

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,860
by the average soldier,

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,630
enhancing the strength and
flexibility of battle armor.

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,800
That's only part of it.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,360
We're also working on how to improve

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,400
raw human physical
and mental performance

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,900
in battlefield situations.

44
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,430
Hardware,software.

45
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,930
Now wetware,too?

46
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,730
Working on the soldiers themselves.

47
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,030
Could be,um,controversial.

48
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,860
Well,we think we mostly do

49
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,030
a good job in balancing

50
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,900
the scientific ethics with the need

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,030
to find new ways to protect
our troops in wartime.

52
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,400
Mostly.

53
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
Not always?

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,230
We've had an incident in
one of our primate studies.

55
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,830
The contractor is a biotech start-up

56
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,200
called Belton Pharmaceuticals.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,900
The head researcher

58
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,130
is a neuroscientist
named Bruce Nesic.

59
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,960
The results were off the charts...

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,700
until this.

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,430
The chimp attack left traces
of hair and blood everywhere,

62
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,760
including on the victim.

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,200
Now,local animal control

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,060
authorities want him destroyed,

65
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,830
but we have millions
of dollars invested

66
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,260
in this particular
animal,and we need somebody

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,100
on the ground in Nevada... yesterday.

68
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,700
I don't get it,Colonel.

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,130
Why not use your own people?

70
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,260
I don't have that
kind of infrastructure.

71
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,360
Besides,anybody I could send

72
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,830
is already too close
to this research.

73
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,000
Their objectivity
could be compromised.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,230
It's very simple,Dr. Hood.

75
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,100
Finding out what happened in Nevada

76
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,660
is essential for
the national security

77
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,700
of the United States.

78
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,600
Okay,I'll look into it.

79
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,860
Thank you.

80
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,200
Hood,watch this.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,600
The guy's got as much
security as the President.

82
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,600
Hey,where are you going?

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,730
That man's agency was responsible

84
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,130
for the world's first breakthroughs

85
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,200
in artificial intelligence,

86
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,300
GPS,unmanned aircraft,

87
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,860
other things you've never heard of

88
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,600
but you'll be using every
day in ten years' time.

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,160
Odds are,the science
that that man makes happen

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,230
will have more impact on the
future than the President.

91
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
How is the veterinarian doing?

92
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,130
Dr. Miller is still unconscious.

93
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,760
She's stable,but just barely.

94
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,200
There were no signs of a break-in,

95
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,630
so that means Sacha would have had

96
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,930
to open his own cage and
all of the others,too?

97
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,500
Well,like us,chimps
are very ingenious,

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,760
even devious.

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,460
Back when I was doing my grad work,

100
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,100
I heard of a young male who
picked his handler's pocket,

101
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,200
hid the key for hours,

102
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,060
and then freed himself.

103
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,600
This is Sacha.

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Looks docile enough now.

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,030
Too docile.

106
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,900
He's been sedated.

107
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,930
Well,yes,we thought it
best,given what has happened.

108
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,430
What exactly is the nature

109
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,730
of the research you're
doing with Sacha?

110
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,760
he's been given a drug cocktail

111
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,460
of neurotransmitters
and endocrine compounds

112
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,560
to enhance the mind/body performance

113
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,530
by speeding up the chemical
reactions in the brain.

114
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,260
It is our hope that
by using this regimen,

115
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,860
along with others like
it,that we can improve

116
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,730
the fighting abilities
of the soldiers.

117
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,560
That's where Enhanced
Warfighter funding comes in.

118
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,630
You are right.

119
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,830
Now,we know that
Russia and the Chinese

120
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,830
have similar active programs,

121
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,560
but we believe that we can leapfrog

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,260
what they're doing by years.

123
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,160
Any theories on what
provoked the attack?

124
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,230
Well,at first I thought
maybe Sacha had contracted

125
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,430
an infection of some sort,so
I began running a series

126
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,800
of tests,the results of which
we'll know in a few days.

127
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
But to be frank,Dr. Hood,

128
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,700
I think it was sabotage.

129
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,930
Really?

130
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,260
Why?

131
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,400
Some of the surveillance files

132
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
from the time of the
occurrence are missing.

133
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,660
Who was the last person to
have access to the files?

134
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,130
Rudy Callistro.

135
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,900
He's a veterinary technician.

136
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,230
He was Sacha's hands-on keeper.

137
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,330
Now,when all this happened,

138
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,560
everyone who works here in
the lab was greatly affected,

139
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,030
but Rudy just disappeared.

140
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,230
It adds up.

141
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,700
Deep background checks
on the personnel here

142
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,900
turned up blog comments hit
me on animal rights Web sites.

143
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,000
I had him flagged for
priority questioning.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,930
We'll need to see everything
else you have on him.

145
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,500
And I'd like to see
your lab records,please.

146
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,960
Uh,going how far back?

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,360
Um,start of the project.

148
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,230
You realize that's
been about five years?

149
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,130
I mean,it's going
to take quite a while

150
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,360
just to print out the stuff.

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,100
No need to kill any trees.

152
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,330
I'm all about the bandwidth.

153
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,430
Come on,man... over here!

154
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,000
Put it up,put it up,put it up.

155
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,800
Good shot,good shot.

156
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,830
Watch out,watch out.

157
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,560
Pass it out,pass it out.

158
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,630
Sorry,man,you okay?

159
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,660
Yo,Pierce,relax,man.

160
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,000
Nobody's trying to
foul you on purpose.

161
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,800
Hey,Kevin.

162
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,960
Dr. Nesic.

163
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,030
I came looking for
you the other night,

164
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,230
but you weren't in your bunk.

165
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,130
I was probably out taking
a walk,trying to relax.

166
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,760
What's up,Doc?

167
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,460
It is time for your next treatment.

168
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,430
Can I just shower first?

169
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,360
Of course,I can wait.

170
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,330
Hey.

171
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,500
- Hi. 
- I just got a hit

172
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,730
on a property held in the name
of Rudy Callistro's sister.

173
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,400
Get this. She was arrested

174
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,930
for throwing red paint

175
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,900
at a celebrity's fur
coat at a fashion show.

176
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,700
- So,runs in the family. 
- Property's less than an hour

177
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,130
from here... we should check it out.

178
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,460
Maybe that's where he's holed up.

179
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,560
What I don't understand...

180
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,900
why he would harm the chimps

181
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,860
if he loves animals so much?

182
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,030
Well,I say it's all
about the missing video.

183
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,930
Maybe that was his idea alone

184
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,000
admistering some kind

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,330
of drug or... or goading the chimp.

186
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,860
I mean,can't you
just see this footage

187
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,900
all over the Internet
in the next few days?

188
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,860
It would be a huge
public relations victory

189
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,360
for the animal rights movement.

190
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,600
Sometimes,Rachel,

191
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,630
you have a very dark
view of human nature.

192
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,260
You know,some cultures,even
ones that eat meat,

193
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,400
treat their animals with
much more respect than we do.

194
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,600
In Japan,there's Wagyu cattle.

195
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,300
Feed them beer,sake,massage
them every day.

196
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Forget the cattle.

197
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,960
I need someone to do that for me.

198
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,330
Mmm.

199
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,200
We're in the right place.

200
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,330
All of these species are...

201
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,800
commonly used in animal testing.

202
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,800
- Rudy Callistro? 
- Who wants to know?

203
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,130
We're from the FBI... we need
to talk to you about Sacha.

204
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,300
Whoa.

205
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,230
Get back here!

206
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,030
Hey!

207
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,500
If I have to shoot you

208
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,300
to get you to stop,I'm
gonna be really pissed.

209
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,460
Ow. What the hell did
you throw at me,anyway?

210
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,760
Ground beef heart... it's cheap,

211
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
and if the animals don't eat it,

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
it goes to waste.

213
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,660
That's just great.

214
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,760
Give me your other hand.

215
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,230
I don't know,Doc.

216
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,400
Last time,I couldn't
sleep for a week afterward.

217
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,230
A common side effect.

218
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,360
It will diminish over time.

219
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,330
That's not all.

220
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,700
I'm tense all the time.

221
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,230
I get these headaches,

222
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,560
and the meds you give me
aren't really helping,either.

223
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,030
If it's all the same to you,

224
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,260
I'd rather just skip this treatment.

225
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,500
I understand,

226
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,100
but we're at a crucial
stage of the sequence.

227
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,660
In fact,

228
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,060
this may be the last one.

229
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,330
I really just want to go home.

230
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,330
I thought the whole point of this

231
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,630
posttraumatic stress disorder therapy

232
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,060
was to make it easier
for me to spend time

233
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,560
with my family
in-between deployments.

234
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,300
This is... it's just
taking me away from them.

235
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,560
Kevin,you know the stats.

236
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,230
The whole point of all the treatments

237
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,060
is to reduce conflict
on the home front.

238
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,630
Tell me that doesn't interest you.

239
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,130
Yeah,but I didn't sign up
to be a damn guinea pig.

240
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
Why did you

241
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,700
volunteer for this study?

242
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,230
- For my wife. 
- Then,why do you

243
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,500
want to quit at this point in
the game when we're so close?

244
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,400
Okay,Doc.

245
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,260
I'll take my medicine like a big boy.

246
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,400
So you went to work for Belton

247
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,460
in order to sabotage the lab?

248
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,000
No.

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,830
I was only there to
gather information.

250
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,700
Laying the groundwork for
a new Equal Rights Amendment

251
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,800
that includes all species.

252
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
The way science is
treating animals...

253
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,260
it... it's criminal.

254
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Sometimes.

255
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,960
But you're diabetic,

256
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,460
right?

257
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,930
How'd you know that?

258
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,760
Your fingertips.

259
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,700
From,uh,testing for
blood sugar with a,

260
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,230
what,portable glucose meter?

261
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,260
The discovery of
insulin,which makes it possible

262
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,930
for diabetics like yourself

263
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,600
to live with the
disease,was made possible

264
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
by animal testing.

265
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,660
Without the sacrifice of
those animals,you'd be dead.

266
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,130
Rudy,

267
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,130
what do you think
happened at the lab?

268
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,960
It's obvious,isn't it?

269
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,330
Nesic is the Dr. Frankenstein
of the animal kingdom.

270
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,100
He takes peaceful primates
and turns them into killers.

271
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,400
- Why did you run? 
- 'Cause when it

272
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,430
all went to hell,I knew
that Nicicould find some way

273
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,930
to blame me for what happened.

274
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,460
Did you steal the surveillance video?

275
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,830
- No. No. 
- Download any files?

276
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,400
I never accessed the system
and I never took anything.

277
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,930
Okay.

278
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,830
Let's say we buy your story.

279
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,260
Is there anything you can remember

280
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,800
that might help us to figure
out what's going on with Sacha?

281
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,830
Yeah.

282
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,630
I did notice something.

283
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,800
You know chimps exhibit handedness

284
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,360
just like people do,right?

285
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,130
For picking up items
like seeds or raisins.

286
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,160
Some prefer the
left-hand,and some the right.

287
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,130
Well,Sacha was a righty.

288
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,700
But in the last few days,he switched.

289
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,000
He went totally ambidextrous
for,for feeding himself,

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,530
and he even began to
favor his left hand.

291
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,230
Three...

292
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,900
two... one.

293
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,700
Did your screening for
pathogens turn up anything?

294
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,030
Not yet.

295
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,600
Did you also test for T. gondii?

296
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,700
Toxoplasmosis?

297
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,730
No.

298
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,400
Toxoplasmosis?

299
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,600
Yeah,it's a parasite

300
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,260
that infects the mind of its hosts

301
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,560
and can alter behavior
and things like handedness.

302
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,360
But there are no felines
or rodents at this facility.

303
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,530
And they're your most common
carries of toxoplasmosis.

304
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,800
Well,it could have come in contact

305
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,830
with any number of species
during transshipment.

306
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,860
You may be right.

307
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,760
That could help
explain Sacha's actions.

308
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,600
We'll test for it.

309
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,000
Whoa.

310
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,660
Sacha's gone.

311
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,200
Let's go,lock them down.

312
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,600
All right,

313
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
come on,now.

314
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
All right,put that up,put that up.

315
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
Oh,yeah,yeah.

316
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,960
All right,come on,come on.

317
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,630
You all right,man?

318
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,430
No,I'm out.

319
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,630
Hey,Kev,Nick's hurt.

320
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,260
Come on.

321
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,960
Hey,Kev,

322
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,260
get your stuff on,man.

323
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,130
Hey,Kevin,let's play some ball,man.

324
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,100
Come on.

325
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,260
You'll never get away with this...

326
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Kevin?

327
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,330
Daddy!

328
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,030
Hey,hey,buddy.

329
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,760
What are you doing here?

330
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,660
Honey,I thought you only
came home on weekends?

331
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,230
Why aren't you at the base?

332
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,100
What's wrong,Kevin?

333
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,460
- Are you okay? 
- I got

334
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,160
a killer headache,babe. We
got an aspirin or something?

335
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,200
Stronger the better.

336
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,230
Are you hung over?

337
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,500
No.

338
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,300
Just my head hurts,that's all.

339
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,600
Jackson,honey,you just
keep watching TV,okay?

340
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,630
Mommy and Daddy

341
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,530
need to have a talk.

342
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,830
I haven't been drinking.

343
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,660
- I just had to see you. 
- Kevin,

344
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,000
the therapy you're
getting is supposed

345
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,530
to help you be with
us. You need to get

346
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,160
- back before they think you're AWOL. 
- Just wanted

347
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,830
to see my wife and kid.

348
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,700
And my head hurts.

349
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,930
From those treatments.

350
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,830
The ones that are
supposed to be helping me.

351
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,500
Damn it!

352
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,960
Kevin,your hand.

353
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,830
It's fine. Did you
see what I just did?

354
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,660
Yeah,you punched a
hole in the cabinet...

355
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,700
Not that. I...

356
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,000
I just,I... I threw a left.

357
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,230
I should have thrown a right.

358
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,900
I'm a righty.

359
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,730
You shouldn't have
thrown a punch at all.

360
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,560
It's these stupid treatments.

361
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,060
Abby,

362
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,260
It's just... I know.

364
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,900
I'm sorry,too.

365
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,300
I can't pretend to
know what it was like

366
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,800
to be in combat.

367
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
I don't know what you saw out there.

368
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,800
But I'm glad to have you here.

369
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
At home.

370
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,060
Thanks. We'll be in touch.

371
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Animal Control has
every available officer

372
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,100
doing a grid search for Sacha.

373
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,430
Let's hope they turn something up.

374
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,460
Does the data check out?

375
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,500
I've only really seen
the tip of the iceberg.

376
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
It's going to take a
while to sift through.

377
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,560
You know,the Bureau is
not without its resources.

378
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,160
We have a entire department devoted

379
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,560
to data analysis.

380
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,600
As talented the,uh,

381
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,460
government's programmers
may be,Rachel,

382
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,130
not many criminals are found
by running linear regression

383
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,430
on their credit card
purchases and porn downloads.

384
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,230
Analysis softwares

385
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,030
are written to spot common
denominators of falsehood.

386
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,200
If you're looking for anything

387
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,930
specific,you can't really

388
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,700
use generic data sifting code.

389
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,800
I get it.

390
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,700
Instead of relying
on electronic intel

391
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,760
you need to put your
own eyes on the target.

392
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Do your own legwork. Exactly.

393
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,600
Only in this case

394
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,730
I get do it sitting on my ass.

395
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,430
Check left,I'll check right.

396
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,430
Gary,you go down the embankment,

397
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,430
check the drainage pipe.

398
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,400
Remember the missing
chimp can hide high or low.

399
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,160
Copy that.

400
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Special Agent Young,FBI.

401
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,630
What've we got?

402
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,630
Single victim,took a bad beating.

403
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,860
His tranquilizer gun's been fired,

404
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,830
so he probably put
up some kind of fight.

405
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,360
We've got compound
fracture to the ulna,

406
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,860
defensive wound,most likely.

407
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,360
Got broken collarbones.

408
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,830
Both elbows hyperextended.

409
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,830
- Extensive facial contusions. 
- Okay.

410
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,630
Same injuries as the
chimps at the lab,

411
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,630
and Dr. Miller,the veterinarian.

412
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,630
You think Sacha could be responsible?

413
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,400
Well,it's possible.

414
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,760
Fully-grown chimpanzees are

415
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
up to five times stronger
than a human being.

416
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,060
Hood.

417
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,700
Over here.

418
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,130
The Animal Control
Officer's tranq dart

419
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,300
did hit Sacha.

420
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,630
But the chimp must have attacked

421
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,460
before the drugs could take effect.

422
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,230
It looks like the officer
inflicted Sacha's fatal injury

423
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,900
- while defending himself. 
- Where's Sacha?

424
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,260
Well,Dr. Nesic,I believe

425
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,230
Animal Control and
County Coroner are having

426
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,060
an interesting jurisdictional
debate about the body.

427
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,900
Seeing as how a chimp shares

428
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,360
98% DNA with a human.

429
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,530
Who should get the corpse?

430
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,030
I'll take Sacha

431
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,500
back to the lab with me.

432
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,200
He's the property of
Belton Pharmaceuticals.

433
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,930
And we have not
completed our research.

434
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,930
I'm sorry,Dr. Nesic.

435
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,160
This is a criminal matter now.

436
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,830
It's out of your hands.

437
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,230
Faster! Faster!

438
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,200
Faster,Mommy!

439
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,160
More! More!

440
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,930
Contents of the bowel
was very interesting.

441
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,060
I was afraid you'd say that.

442
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,100
Sacha's large bowel was empty.

443
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,760
Just what you'd expect
after a sudden death.

444
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,430
His bowel should have
evacuated immediately

445
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,660
upon dying.

446
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,430
But there was no signs

447
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,830
of defecation where
the body was found.

448
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,260
Anything in his system

449
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,330
would have left at least
a trace where he died.

450
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,200
More likely a big trace.

451
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,830
Which means Sacha was
killed somewhere else.

452
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,130
His body

453
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,000
must have been planted
there after his death.

454
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,430
Also means Sacha
couldn't have attacked

455
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,730
The Animal Control Officer.

456
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,330
Then who did?

457
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,500
Dr. Hood,we're about

458
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,560
to cut into his skull.

459
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,860
Just one moment.

460
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,760
I have to see what
was inside his skull.

461
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Kevin,baby,you've been
in there a long time.

462
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,330
Are you coming to bed?

463
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,130
Congratulations,Hood,

464
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,130
you've got me staring
at monkey brains.

465
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,330
Well,they're worth staring at.

466
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,000
Well,no paramecia...

467
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,060
rules out toxoplasmosis.

468
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,830
Most of the brain
structures look normal.

469
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,500
See the,uh,amygdala here.

470
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,330
It's pretty much

471
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,230
the same in chimps
as it is in humans.

472
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,560
It's the center of the fear response.

473
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,600
The fight-or-flight
reflex.

474
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,830
When the senses tell it of a threat,

475
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,830
it responds by sending alarm signals

476
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,460
to the,uh,other organs...

477
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,800
the pituitary,adrenal glands...

478
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,130
they flood the system with adrenaline

479
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,230
so you either run away or
you fight your attacker.

480
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,030
Or an enemy soldier.

481
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,960
That's not all.

482
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,660
The amygdala helps
regulate handedness.

483
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,160
All of Sacha's new behaviors...

484
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,560
his aggressive reactions,

485
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,560
his change from right
to left handedness...

486
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,500
all would tend to indicate
changes of that part

487
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,360
- of the brain. 
- So Nesic was

488
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,760
messing with the amygdala?

489
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
Yeah,somehow,Nesic

490
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,260
managed to make Sacha's two amygdalae

491
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,730
twice their normal size.

492
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,530
Which speeds up reactions.

493
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,200
It's like when you sneeze.

494
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,030
When you sneeze every
muscle in your body

495
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,560
involuntarily convulses.

496
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
By giving the amygdala

497
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,260
the size and heft to take over

498
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,600
the entire system,I mean
dealing with total force,

499
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,660
you're kind of turning the urge to...

500
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,700
to violence into the
equivalent of a sneeze.

501
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,760
Something you can't control.

502
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,430
The result? The subjects...

503
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,200
the-the chimps would respond
to any perceived threat,

504
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,230
no matter how small,with
overwhelming force.

505
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,560
That's one hell of an
unintended consequence.

506
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm not so sure it's unintended.

507
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Come on.

508
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,730
All right. Bring it up. Bring it up.

509
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,100
Hey,check it out.

510
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,460
Gentlemen!

511
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,060
Anyone know of the
whereabouts of Kevin Pierce?

512
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,230
It is very important
that I speak with him.

513
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,130
Nobody?

514
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,460
For a three-day leave
at the Hard Rock Casino,

515
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,030
all expenses paid?

516
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,130
If he has gone AWOL,

517
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,100
you could save him a lot of trouble.

518
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,800
You would be helping him.

519
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,360
We're not stupid,Doc.

520
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,400
Sergeant Pierce does need help.

521
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,900
And whatever you've
been doing to him,

522
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,230
it ain't working.

523
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,260
That's right. Mm-hmm.

524
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,460
So you here to play?

525
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,930
Or just hog the ball?

526
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:05,930
I know that you think that
you are watching his back,

527
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,330
but you are screwing him.

528
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,030
You are screwing yourselves.

529
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,300
Nesic's data is perfect.

530
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Too perfect.

531
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,900
What do you mean?

532
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,900
Let me show you.

533
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,830
Hood?

534
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,960
Minibar... expensive.

535
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,830
Oh,don't worry,Rachel.

536
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,000
Live a little.

537
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,300
Now this... is what data looks like.

538
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,100
It's a group of far-flung points

539
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,800
on a graph.

540
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,830
Can I use your phone charger,please?

541
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,100
Thank you.

542
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,130
If we were to draw
a curve on this data,

543
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,160
it would look something like this.

544
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,230
See,the phone charger represents

545
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,560
a line that encompasses
a general rule.

546
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,030
We call that an average
of all the data points.

547
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,700
But Nesic's data

548
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,360
doesn't look like that.

549
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,860
Nesic's data never leaves the curve.

550
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,160
That... is statistically impossible.

551
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,830
You're saying he fit
the data to the curve,

552
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,400
rigged it to say what
he wants it to say.

553
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,930
Well,he's definitely
hiding something.

554
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,660
The question is what?

555
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,800
We need to get back in his lab,now.

556
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
This is Special Agent Young.

557
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,900
I need the Megahut to send
Entry and Exit people for T-3s.

558
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,730
- I'll give you the
address.  - T-3s?

559
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,860
I absolutely love,that for once,

560
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,600
you have no idea what
I'm talking about.

561
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,100
The Entry and Exit specialist
should be here any minute.

562
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,660
So,Hood,I've been
meaning to ask you...

563
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,700
How exactly did you get this gig?

564
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,000
1986 World Series.

565
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,660
Excuse me?

566
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,230
Mets versus Red Sox.

567
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,860
I'm a Mets fan.

568
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:11,200
And,uh,one of my classmates
at Princeton was this,uh,

569
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,500
annoyingly button-down
history major from Boston.

570
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,200
So he had tickets for the games,

571
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,660
but he had no way of getting there.

572
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,160
I had a 1979 VW Passat

573
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,030
that I'd modified to
run on vegetable oil.

574
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,260
So,we,um,inevitably,declared
a truce,and,um,

575
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,400
we ended up driving up to,uh,Fenway.

576
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,600
We watched game five.

577
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,730
Then we drove down to the city,

578
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,860
and we saw game six at Shea Stadium.

579
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,800
By the time we got home to Princeton,

580
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,400
he and I were pretty much friends.

581
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,660
He went on to become an
officer in the Marines,

582
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,100
and earn his law degree.

583
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,500
And become director of the FBI.

584
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,300
That's exactly right.

585
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,460
One day,he gives me a
call,asking for a favor,

586
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,360
and before I know it,I'm
spending most of my time

587
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,760
- with people like you,
- Hey!

588
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,960
in places like this...

589
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,230
Don't worry. You ever get
into trouble with the Bureau,

590
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,560
I got plenty of dirt on the director

591
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,760
you can use to get out of it.

592
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,960
Here we go.

593
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,960
Agent Reed,sorry
for the short notice.

594
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,600
No problem.

595
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,060
- Thanks. 
- Any time.

596
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,200
Rachel,tell me this is legal.

597
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,930
Please,we've got the
FBI and DARPA behind us.

598
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,700
I'm pretty sure we can get

599
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,660
the breaking-and-entering
charges thrown out.

600
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,930
- Six? 
- So?

601
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,530
There are only six primate cages.

602
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,500
Nesic had extensive histories
on seven experimental subjects.

603
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,030
What are you looking for,exactly?

604
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,660
Well,we've seen how
numbers can be manipulated.

605
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,900
I'm looking for
hard,scientific evidence.

606
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,160
He must keep the blood and
tissues samples somewhere.

607
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,500
Hood,I think I've got it.

608
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,900
The samples are in here.

609
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,660
Rachel...

610
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,800
subject seven's blood chemistry is...

611
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,530
all wrong.

612
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,230
He's got type AB...

613
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,460
and only one primate has type AB.

614
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,160
Subject seven is a human being.

615
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,300
Hey.

616
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,700
There you are.

617
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,930
Hi,Abby.

618
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,200
Dr. Nesic?

619
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,500
Is something wrong with Kevin?

620
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,630
I don't know.

621
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,800
I was hoping you could tell me.

622
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,360
Oh,God.

623
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,200
Kevin may be having
extended combat flashbacks.

624
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,860
I've seen it before

625
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,460
with soldiers suffering from PTSD.

626
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,730
I told him he should
go back to the base.

627
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,630
You've seen him then?

628
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,560
Is he here? I need
to get a hold of him.

629
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,330
No,Kevin's not here.

630
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,260
But I can tell him to
call you when I see him.

631
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,700
Good-bye.

632
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,900
I apologize.

633
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,100
This wasn't on my radar.

634
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,230
It turns out the company
Nesic's working for

635
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,530
is running another
defense-related study

636
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,260
20 minutes up the
road from your location

637
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,900
at Nellis Air Force Base.

638
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,330
They're testing therapies
on a sequestered group

639
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,400
of return combat troops
who suffer from PTSD.

640
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,000
Any indication which one
might be subject seven?

641
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,860
One of them,a Sergeant Kevin Pierce,

642
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,430
left the facility without permission

643
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,060
after exhibiting strange behavior.

644
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,560
It sounds like our guy.

645
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,360
Dr. Hood,Agent Young,

646
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,000
if you need anything
else,you just ask.

647
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,800
We will. Thank you,sir.

648
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,060
Thank you.

649
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
We need to get to this
air force base,now.

650
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,100
I think it was Pierce that attacked

651
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,230
the animal control officer.

652
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,560
He probably approached
him in what seemed

653
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,500
like a threatening manner.

654
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,160
Pierce would've responded
autonomically,as if programmed,

655
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,200
his nervous system taking over

656
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,230
to deal with any perceived threat.

657
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,600
So maybe Nesic staged Sacha's escape

658
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,230
to hamper our investigation.

659
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,360
When the animal control officer was
attacked,Nesic saw an opportunity

660
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,560
to end the scrutiny.

661
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,360
He killed Sacha and planted the body

662
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,100
and then went

663
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,660
off the grid.

664
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,660
That's true

665
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,730
and appears out there
is a danger to himself

666
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,500
and anyone who crosses his path.

667
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,760
Nesic's out there,too.

668
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,830
I'm gonna order a 24-hour guard
for our injured veterinarian.

669
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,230
She's the only witness we've got.

670
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,260
We come from all different units,

671
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,300
different areas around the country,

672
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,330
but we all got the same story.

673
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,500
When I came back from over there,

674
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,430
it was like,like the world
was moving in slow motion,

675
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,200
and I was still in combat speed.

676
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,100
So when they offered
this study,I jumped on it.

677
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,760
You know,anything to
help me fit back in.

678
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,930
- Has it helped? 
- Maybe.

679
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,330
We mostly just sit
around watching videos,

680
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,100
filling out psych tests.

681
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,000
But your friend,Pierce,got
special treatment.

682
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,060
Yeah,they hit him hard,man.

683
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,460
I mean,drugs,

684
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,930
endurance tests.

685
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,330
I mean,he was hurting.

686
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,930
Always seeking for painkillers.

687
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,160
He even started shifting the hand

688
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,860
he dribbled with playing ball.

689
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,000
You know,he went from right to left.

690
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,330
It was weird.

691
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,530
This is very
important,Private Vasquez.

692
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,430
Sergeant Pierce is not in trouble,

693
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,860
but we need to find
him for his own good.

694
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,960
That's the same thing Nesic said
when he came looking for him.

695
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,000
Nesic was here? When?

696
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,300
Last night.

697
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,200
Looking for Kev,same as you.

698
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,730
We didn't tell him,jack,though.

699
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,800
What makes you think
we're gonna tell you?

700
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,100
Before being assigned to Dr. Hood,

701
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,660
I spent six months

702
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,200
as an FBI component
of Task Force Eagle

703
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,160
in Kabul,Afghanistan.

704
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,230
I worked with guys like you,everyday,

705
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,900
doing sensitive site exploitations,

706
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,800
looking for intel and what
the bad guys might be up to.

707
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,930
I'm not one of
them,and neither is he.

708
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,400
I believe that you've all been
victims of a scientific fraud.

709
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,530
Dr. Nesic has already
aborted one failed experiment,

710
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,530
and I believe he's trying to
do the same with Kevin Pierce,

711
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,500
and any one of you could be next.

712
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,800
That's why I think
you should tell me.

713
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,000
There's a park near here.

714
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,730
You know,a couple times
when things got rough,

715
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:57,900
he'd go there,decompress,chill out.

716
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,130
Thank you.

717
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,230
Yo,Joey,we've got your stuff.

718
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,930
Hell,man,that ain't Joey.

719
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,330
Look at what we got here.

720
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,500
This is a place of business homes.

721
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,000
We don't need any
suspicious looking characters

722
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,530
bringing the cops around.

723
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,330
Did you hear a word he just said?

724
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,800
You need to leave,buddy.

725
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,230
My phone died.

726
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,930
Do either one of you guys have
a spare cell phone battery?

727
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,460
Are you kidding me?

728
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,660
Hello? Hello?

729
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,200
Hey... hey,baby,it's me.

730
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,960
I didn't recognize the number.

731
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,130
It scared me.

732
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,300
I had to borrow a phone.

733
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,660
I just called to tell you that...

734
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,960
it's almost over.

735
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,560
What? What's almost over?

736
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,960
What's happening?

737
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,760
Where are you? Why did you leave?

738
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,500
I had to leave,babe.

739
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,300
I didn't want you to get hurt.

740
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,360
Who's going to hurt us?

741
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,830
I am.

742
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,660
What?

743
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,360
Nothing.

744
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,030
Kevin,Dr. Nesic stopped by today.

745
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,800
He wants to talk to you.

746
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah,I got something
to say to him,too.

747
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,460
You're not in some
kind of trouble,are you?

748
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,130
When are you coming home?

749
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,800
I can't come home yet,babe.

750
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,830
Not until I stop it.

751
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,330
Stop what?

752
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,630
The war?

753
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,630
You're home now,Kevin.

754
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,960
I know where I am.

755
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,230
I'm not crazy.

756
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,860
It's okay,Jackson.

757
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,060
Come to Mommy.

758
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,230
Hey...

759
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,100
is he still awake? Put him on,okay?

760
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,930
Daddy.

761
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,000
Hey,Dad.

762
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,230
Hey,buddy.

763
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,000
You remember when I
used to sing you to sleep

764
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,660
when you were little?

765
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,000
Huh?

766
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,700
I'd sing,Twinkle,twinkle,little star

767
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,030
How I wonder what you are

768
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,700
Up above the earth so far

769
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,930
Like a rocket powered car.

770
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,900
Good night,pal.

771
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,730
Now remember,if we find Pierce,

772
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,160
we need to approach him
in a nonthreatening manner.

773
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,060
Try not to... you know.

774
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,960
Hood.

775
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,830
A nine millimeter casing.

776
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,260
Oh,God.

777
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,600
They're alive.

778
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,530
Barely.

779
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,700
This is Special Agent Young.

780
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,300
I need an ambulance
at Desert View Park,

781
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,800
415 Ryder Street.

782
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,330
Hey,Hood,blood and tire tracks.

783
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,160
I think Pierce took their car.

784
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,360
He could be anywhere.

785
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,160
Not anywhere.

786
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,430
He was hurt.

787
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,700
Private Vasquez said

788
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,660
he was seeking painkillers.

789
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,130
He'll be looking for a pharmacy.

790
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,530
Freeze!

791
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,800
Put your hands up!

792
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,130
Hands where I can see them!

793
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,430
Unit five-David,requesting backup.

794
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,700
Subject in sight.

795
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,200
Turn around!

796
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,960
- Pierce,stop! Hood... 
- Don't.

797
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
The slightest move could set him off.

798
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,160
Let me do my job.

799
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,300
Rachel...

800
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,230
Put the gun down. Trust me.

801
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,360
Listen to me,Kevin.

802
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,800
We're not here to hurt you.

803
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,260
We know what they've
been doing to you.

804
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,560
We're going to make it stop.

805
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,760
Who the hell are you?

806
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,660
My name's Jacob Hood.

807
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,930
I'm a scientist.

808
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,130
Oh,like Nesic?

809
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,360
No,not like Nesic.
Nothing like Nesic.

810
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,700
Sergeant,Can I ask you a question?

811
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,260
I want you to answer very carefully.

812
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,200
What do you want to happen here?

813
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,000
How do you want this to play out?

814
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,100
I need...

815
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,560
... to make it stop.

816
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,300
I have to keep them from
doing this to anybody else.

817
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,630
Well,in order for that to happen,

818
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,560
you've got to focus.

819
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,630
First you have to let these men go.

820
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,200
If you kill them,it's all over.

821
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,060
There won't be anything
I can do for you.

822
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,160
I think I understand what's
going on in your head.

823
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,060
Every nerve must be screaming
for you to go into action.

824
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,530
The urge must be uncontrollable,

825
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,830
but you're gonna have to

826
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,230
damp it down somehow.

827
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,660
Use the part of your
thoughts you can control

828
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,060
and think it through.

829
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,360
Think about where you are.

830
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,160
Think about what your options are.

831
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,860
Make a choice.

832
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,160
FBI. This man is now
in federal custody.

833
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,330
Stand down.

834
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,260
I repeat,stand down.

835
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,700
It's okay.

836
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,860
It's over.

837
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,060
No.

838
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,600
It's not.

839
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,130
Not until you see this.

840
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,000
Hello?

841
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,130
Kevin?

842
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,900
Sergeant Pierce isn't
coming,Dr. Nesic.

843
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,000
But he was,um...

844
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,600
kind enough to let me
have the missing video.

845
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,130
What are you doing here?

846
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,930
When he broke in,he just
wanted to destroy the lab

847
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,400
and free the chimps,but
they attacked him.

848
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,860
So he fought back.

849
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,360
Dr. Miller was working
late,em,heard the commotion.

850
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,600
What are you doing?! Stop!

851
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,630
Well,you know results.

852
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,130
Congratulations.

853
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,300
You found a way of
turning off the conscience.

854
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,360
Soldiers with no moral
or ethical compunction

855
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,000
about killing,

856
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,760
able to act,react...

857
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,060
lightning efficiency.

858
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,400
Say that without the...

859
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,830
smug,self-righteous sneer,

860
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,360
and it sounds like a
heroic advance to me.

861
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,060
An advance?

862
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,430
Really?

863
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,000
Don't think you've given
much thought to the long-term

864
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
implications of this?

865
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,000
You think someone like Pierce

866
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,500
will ever be able to
reintegrated into society?

867
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,830
Do you even care

868
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,900
that you may have destroyed
a young man's life?

869
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,060
I'm trying to save his life.

870
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,730
Save all of their lives.

871
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,730
Do I have to remind you...

872
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,600
every day soldiers die in the field.

873
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,160
My work will help them to survive.

874
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,430
Oh,he'll survive.

875
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,860
No thanks to you.

876
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,900
He's in federal custody.

877
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,400
Dr. Nesic.

878
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,460
You can tell the caliber of a man

879
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,230
by the way he faces
up to his mistakes.

880
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,560
The bad ones always
make it worse by trying

881
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,060
to cover up their tracks,

882
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,960
and it's the cover up
that brings them down.

883
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,200
Get him out of here.

884
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,860
Hands behind your back.

885
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,560
I love you.

886
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,230
I love you,too.

887
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,600
Love you.

888
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,930
Thanks for talking me down.

889
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,600
I just gave you a
little encouragement.

890
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,300
You talked yourself down.

891
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,200
Nice work,Dr. Hood.

892
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,260
Nesic is going to jail

893
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,230
and Sergeant Pierce is going
to get the therapy he needs

894
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,830
to undo what was done to him.

895
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,430
Whatever it takes.

896
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,500
But the program's
going to go on,isn't it?

897
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,960
Of course.

898
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,800
If it didn't,it would
mean I wasn't doing my job.

899
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,030
Super-soldiers are coming.

900
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,630
Nesic just bent the rules too far,

901
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,060
even for us.

902
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,430
You know,some people refer to DARPA

903
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,300
as a hundred geniuses
connected by a travel agent.

904
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,960
Truth is,we're always on
the lookout for number 101.

905
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,430
Oh.

906
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,330
Thank you,Colonel,but,uh,I got a job.

907
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,400
Anyway,I prefer to tackle problems

908
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,530
created by the world at large

909
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,960
rather than problems
created by my employers.

910
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,000
Well,suit yourself.

911
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,660
But if you change your mind,don't
hesitate to get in touch.

912
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,830
Let's leave it this way

913
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,360
Next time you get
yourself in trouble...

914
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,660
you have my number.
