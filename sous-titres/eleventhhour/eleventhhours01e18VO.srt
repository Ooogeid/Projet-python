<i>Ray Wynne Residence
FBI Deputy Director
ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA</i>

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Forgive me, Dr. Hood.
It's my fault we're late.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,900
I was just looking to see
if I had my speech here.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm sure you'll do fine.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,300
How much of an introduction
to you want?

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,400
The longer you keep talking,
the less I have to say.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,100
Well, we can work it
out in the limo.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
???

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,100
Thanks for the heads up.
I'll let the deputy director know.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
???

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,100
Ray, where's the presentation tonight?

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,700
Is it the Chamber of Commerce
or the NLEC?

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
???

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,700
- Is my bow tie straight?
- Yeah.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,100
???,Because yours is...

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,600
- Clip-on.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,100
Ray, honey, I'm
having a problem here.

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,400
Hi.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Rachel, you okay out there?

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,700
Just some neighbor
reporting a prowler.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,100
- I'm coming back in.
- Well, hurry up.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,200
I'm fresh out of small talk...

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hood?

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
- Mom, Dad?
- ???

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,100
Get back to your room.

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,800
Who's this?!

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm Jacob Hood.
Who are you?

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,700
- Stay back!
- Okay.

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,800
Nobody touch me!

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
No one's going to touch you.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,700
???

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
??? Just tell us what you want.

35
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,900
I want my baby back!

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,700
???

37
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,500
He's taken my baby!

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
- Who did?
- Him!

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Her name's Sofia Lyons.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
- She was an agent?
- Not an agent.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
She's a lab tech
with the science division.

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,200
But she's been under the care of
the statemental health system
for the past six weeks.

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,300
- So why'd she come after you?
- She had a breakdown.

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,700
Her boyfriend dumped her
when she was pregnant.

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,500
Then she lost the baby.
Ray was her boss.

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Please, all he ever did was
want to make sure that she was okay.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,300
What's your problem with, uh,
Deputy Director Wynne?

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,600
It's simple.
He stole my baby.

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,900
But then she got this idea

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,800
that the FBI had stolen her baby
and Ray was the father.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,100
??? I can only be sympathetic
up to a point.

52
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
And obviously tonight
was past the point.

53
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,500
Look, Ray is clever.

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
He's going to tell you lies about me,
but everything I've told you is true.

55
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,300
She wrote these ridiculous letters

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
- accusing him...
- Sweetheart.

57
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,900
...saying he was having her
turned into a zombie.

58
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,500
You know what I think now?
Better a zombie...

59
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,200
- than a threat to my family.
???

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
Honey, I'm...???

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,100
Reach inside my pocket.

62
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,900
They've been trying to reprogram me,
but I ripped it out of my arm
this morning.

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,500
Surgical implant?

64
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,700
They're drugging me
against my will.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,100
I'm fighting to stay sane,
but I'm losing the battle.

66
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,700
Dr. Hood, please help me
find my baby.

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,600
Sofia, I can't help you.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
You're just going to have
to complete this course

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,700
and try to make yourself better.

70
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,500
But there's nothing
wrong with me, damn it!

71
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,600
It's okay.

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
- I'm a scientist, Dr. Hood,
just like you.
- ???

73
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,900
I'll beat the drugs, I'll get out,
and when I do...

74
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,400
???

75
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to make things right.

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,200
All by myself. Do you hear me?

77
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,300
Dr. Hood, remember me.

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,100
She told the cops that
Assistant Director Wynne

79
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,800
was her secret lover and that
he stole their baby.

80
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,400
Yeah, she told me
the same thing.

81
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,200
I don't know-- erotomania?

82
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,300
It can happen.
An unstable person can fixate

83
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,400
on a high-status individual,
convince themselves

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,500
there's some kind of relationship
when there isn't.

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,100
I know that look.

86
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,600
You're on Planet Hood.
What's up?

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
This.

88
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,900
She tore it out of her own flesh
with her bare hands.

89
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,600
She's desperate, Rachel.

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
She's very smart,

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
and she believes
every word she's saying.

92
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,400
It makes her dangerous.

93
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,500
Very dangerous.

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
Attention, residents,

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,800
???

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,100
Sofia Lyons has been in custody
and under observation for a week now.

100
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,100
I don't see any threat.

101
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,600
Well, that's true. Things definitely
aren't adding up as they should.

102
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,300
That thing Sofia dug up
out of her own flesh,

103
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,100
I had it tested. It was definitely
a drug delivery device.

104
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,300
It's a biodegradable
polymer implant

105
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,800
that releases regular
doses of Olanzapine.

106
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,600
It's a very powerful
antipsychotic drug.

107
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,100
It was developed to,
uh...

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,500
keep noncompliant
patients on their meds.

109
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
But there's a lot of
controversy over its use.

110
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,700
So she's been a part
of a clinical trial.

111
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, to be part of a clinical trial
you need to give informed consent.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,900
To give informed consent,
you need to already be stable.

113
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,300
Which she clearly isn't.

114
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,600
???

115
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,200
Do you think there's
any credibility to her story?

116
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,300
Ms. Lyons?

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dr. Hood.

118
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,000
Glad to see you
looking so well.

119
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Yeah, after the last time
you saw me...

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,400
I'm embarrassed about that.

121
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,400
And Agent Young,
what can I say?

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,500
How's your arm?

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,700
Is that where you, uh... pulled
the implant out?

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,700
It's healing nicely--
like the rest of me.

125
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,500
You worried a lot of
people last week, Sofia.

126
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,200
Look, do me a favor,

127
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,300
whatever I may have said or done
that night,just forget all about it.

128
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,700
I wasn't myself.

129
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,600
Listen...

130
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,100
if there's something you wanted to
tell me,you can tell me now.

131
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
No.

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
There's nothing.

133
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,200
Deputy Director Wynne is
a decent, honest man.

134
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,000
Look, all of my troubles were caused
by this no-good boyfriend
who had just left me.

135
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,700
Disappeared without a trace.

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,900
Agent Wynne and I never had an affair
and that baby I held,

137
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,100
well, it never existed--

138
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,100
except in my head.

139
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,300
Okay.

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
- That's it?
- That's it.

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm looking forward
to going home.

142
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,900
Now, I've got to wash the chlorine
out of my hair.Can you guys excuse me?

143
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,500
So, uh, you don't need my help?

144
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,300
That was a mistake.

145
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I don't need anyone
anymore.

146
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
See her back?

147
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,000
That's a new implant.
Somewhere she can't reach it.

148
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,400
Do me a favor? See if
there's a hairbrush in her bag?

149
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,100
Where's the problem?
She seems fine.

150
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Can you?

151
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,700
- No.
- How about her room?

152
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
- A hairbrush?
- Just some stray hairs.

153
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,000
It's not the strangest thing
you've ever asked me for.

154
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,300
Attention, residents, bingo will begin
in the therapy center in five minutes.

155
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,600
- You need these?
- Ah, thank you.

156
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Seem to give you a lot
of freedom around here.

157
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,600
Yeah. That's what you get for
saying yes to another implant.

158
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
Really?

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
Well, it seems to be working.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Does it?

161
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,400
Lucky me.

162
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,100
Sofia's been my patient
for the past six weeks.

163
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,400
- Doctor...?
- Hood.

164
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,400
But she's here voluntarily.

165
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,700
That's only because the Wynne family
agreed not to press charges
if she ???

166
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,500
If she tries to check out,
she goes to jail.

167
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,900
Look, she's doing great.
You can see the results.

168
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,400
Are you not worried by
the nature of her delusions?

169
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,700
I've got no interest
in her delusions,

170
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,500
only in the chemical
imbalance that causes them.

171
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,800
While we're on that subject,
how are the implant trials going?

172
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,500
Some patients find it difficult to
comply with their medications.

173
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
A slow-releasing implant

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,200
could mean a decent life
for a lot of unhappy people.

175
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,900
When the technology is
finally judged safe.

176
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,400
I hear that with the animal trials,

177
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,800
the monkeys try to tear
the implants out.

178
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,100
Is that true?

179
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,100
Because they itch.

180
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,800
I don't think the monkeys have
a problem with the science.

181
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Does Sofia Lyons have a problem
with the treatment you're giving her?

182
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,400
You mean the treatment
that's working?

183
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,300
Well,

184
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,800
look, Dr. Hood,
she's getting what she needs.

185
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Antipsychotic drugs
can be very successful

186
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,100
treating delusions
and hallucinations,

187
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
but there are a lot
of side effects, we know.

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,600
Um, is miosis one of them?

189
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,000
If you mean constricted pupils,
you are right.

190
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,800
But she was screwing her eyes
up against the sun.

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Yeah, that's because her
pupils were wide open.

192
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,500
Thank you for the consult.
Both of you.

193
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I'll be sure
to look into it.

194
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,800
- Did you get it?
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,300
Good girl.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,900
Liquid Chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry analysis, right?

197
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,600
That's right, all those words,
in that order.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
So what's the hair
gonna tell us?

199
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,500
Well, a length of hair is
basically a record

200
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,200
of its owner's drug use
through the growth period.

201
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,800
The follicle takes up whatever
trace chemicals

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,500
are in the bloodstream
and locks them in the keratin.

203
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,200
And no amount of soap,
shampoo

204
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
or swimming pool chlorine
is ever gonna wash it out.

205
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,600
Wow, so you can chop up a hair
and get a day-to-day picture

206
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
of whatever she's been on?

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,300
Not that precise,
but pretty close.

208
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,800
Is everything all right?

209
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
Everything's fine.

210
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
What did Dr. Hood say to you?

211
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,500
Sofia, please don't worry
about Dr. Hood.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,100
Just concentrate
on getting better.

213
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,900
- What's the verdict?
- Interesting.

214
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,900
??? From the changes
in thickness along this hair,

215
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,600
I wouldn't say it came from
a woman who'd lost a baby.

216
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
More like she carried it
to full term.

217
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
- Oh, wow.
- What?

218
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Felix, call the
treatment center.

219
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,500
I don't think we can
let Sofia Lyons leave.

220
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,100
- What do you got, Hood?
- See this line?

221
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,300
That's her antipsychotic medication.

222
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,900
Now, here, it's up,
because she's taking it.

223
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,100
Then it goes down because
she's skipping it.

224
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,500
Then it goes up,
stays steady for a while.

225
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,600
The first implant.

226
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Now, look what happens right
after the second implant.

227
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,300
What are those other
lines coming in?

228
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,500
That one,
methamphetamine.

229
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,400
Also known as crank,
ice or crystal meth.

230
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,500
That's right. This green line
at the bottom is DXM.

231
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,900
It's an active ingredient
in cough medicines.

232
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,900
- Cough medicine?
- Yeah, it accelerates the meth.

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
??? Those are street drugs.

234
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
They put her on meds,
she skips them.

235
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,600
They give her an implant,
she rips it out.

236
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,500
They implant another
where she can't reach it,

237
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,200
and she gets hold
of this chemical brew

238
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
of street drugs
to cancel it out.

239
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,700
??? Why do that?
Just to stay insane?

240
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,100
??? No one who's deluded
believes they are, Rachel.

241
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
She thinks she's clinging
to reality.

242
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,200
Sofia! Sofia!
No, no, no!

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
Sofia! Hey!
No, no, no!

244
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,700
Looks like crystal meth
and dextroamphetamine.

245
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,100
Did you supply her
with these, Louella?

246
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,100
Definitely not.

247
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,900
Okay, Louella,

248
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
where is she?
Where's Sofia?

249
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,800
If I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

250
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,100
She said some
very powerful man

251
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,200
had screwed up her life
just to protect himself.

252
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,900
I can relate to that.

253
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Louella, if you think that
by shielding her

254
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,600
you're helping her,
you're very much mistaken.

255
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
If she acts
on her delusions,

256
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
she's gonna get herself
in some very bad trouble.

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,100
You say they're delusions.

258
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
I say that
all that stuff about her

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,300
being dumped
by a no-good boyfriend

260
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,200
is their cover story, not hers.

261
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,900
Did she tell you her plans?

262
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,000
Tell them, Louella,

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,700
or I'll take away your
one-hour-a-day Internet access.

264
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,500
Do you really think
I care about that?

265
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,800
This is my friend
we're talking about here.

266
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,500
Listen,

267
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,200
all I can tell you is

268
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,900
we want to help her,
not hurt her.

269
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,100
She said they were trying to
take away her gift of fury,

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200
but that she needed it
to get her baby back.

271
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,600
How is she gonna do that?

272
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,700
Spin a web,
catch the big man.

273
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,200
Then do whatever
it takes

274
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
to make him give it up.

275
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,300
Sofia?

276
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,000
Sofia Lyons?

277
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Back up.

278
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Smells of bleach
and battery acid.

279
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,700
???

280
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,800
A little kitchen chemistry
going on here.

281
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
Must have been here
a couple of hours.

282
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,100
And I thought I was a bad cook.

283
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
Well, I don't think
you'd have tried this recipe.

284
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,800
Extract the chlorate
from the bleach, add sugar,

285
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,600
powdered aluminum.

286
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,700
She's an FBI chemist, Rachel.
She knows exactly what she's doing.

287
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,900
I think she made a fire
bomb with an acid fuse.

288
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Should burn about
1,000 degrees Celsius.

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,800
We got to get the Wynne family
out of their house and
into protection.

290
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,500
I'll get Felix on it.

291
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,800
<i>J. Edgar Hoover Building
WASHINGTON, D.C.</i>

292
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,200
Susan, get out
of the house.

293
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,400
Pack a bag, take the
kids up to the lake.

294
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,900
I'll be up there
as soon as I can.

295
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
- Sir, you sure that you want to...?
- Agent Lee, don't worry about it.

296
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,700
It's not some isolated
cabin in the wilderness.

297
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,600
It's a weekend home
in a gated community.

298
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,700
We'll upgrade regular
security with our people.

299
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,100
Felix is on his way
with Ray Wynne.

300
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
You know, you should let
me drive once in a while.

301
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,200
I'm just thinking of you.

302
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,700
I let you drive once.

303
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,500
Never again.

304
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
No, I'm just
saying, you know,

305
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,200
give you a break.

306
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,100
Hood, we're not having
this conversation.

307
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,300
Forget it.

308
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,600
All right,
I think this is it.

309
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
This? This is a
weekend house?

310
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,100
What is it?

311
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,700
I was looking into
Sofia's ex-boyfriend.

312
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
What?

313
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,000
???

314
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,000
- Agent Young,
- Call 911.

315
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
- What happened?
- We got here,

316
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,500
we went inside.
There was gas.

317
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
She burst in and told us
to get out.

318
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,300
Who did? Sofia?
Yes!

319
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,400
How long ago?
Just now. We just made it.

320
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,900
- Which way did she go?
- That way.
-??? You stay here.

321
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
- How did she know we were here?
- ???

322
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,600
Rachel?

323
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,400
- ???
- Dad!
- ???

324
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
- Just stay here, okay?
- ???

325
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,300
???

326
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,300
- Dr. Hood, where you going?
- Stay with the family.

327
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,800
- I've got to find Rachel.
- ???

328
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,000
I wanted you to be Ray.

330
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,500
Rachel.

331
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,800
Rachel!

332
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,400
- Any sign?
- No, I thought I heard someone cry out.

333
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,400
I should have pressed those charges.
She'd be locked away by now.

334
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,400
Why didn't you, Ray?

335
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,200
I mean, she held a gun
against your wife's head. Why?

336
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,100
- It's called sympathy.
- Really?

337
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,900
So it wasn't to avoid having the
official story tested in court?

338
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
What the hell are
you talking about?

339
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,700
Sofia Lyons never miscarried.
She had the child.

340
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,300
And this mysterious
ex-boyfriend

341
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,500
who everything's been blamed on,
turns out the only place

342
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,000
he actually exists
is in Sofia's FBI file.

343
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,900
So what are you saying?

344
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm saying only someone inside
the FBI could have created him,
not some lab tech like Sofia.

345
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,900
I mean, someone with very
high levels of clearance.

346
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
You the baby's father?

347
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,100
I'm just her boss.

348
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,400
With a weekend home she happens
to know her way around?

349
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,900
You see, I thought the problem
was with her treatment.

350
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,900
But her treatment was fine.
I mean, well, it would have been,

351
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,300
if there'd actually been
something wrong with her.

352
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,100
But she wasn't
trashing her brain

353
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
with these drugs
to hold onto her delusions.

354
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,700
She was fighting the treatment
to hold onto reality.

355
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,700
I'm resisting the urge to give you
a smack in the mouth right now.

356
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,200
Why don't you give it a try?

357
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
No.

358
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,600
And only because I know I can do
a whole lot better than that.

359
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,200
You better watch yourself.

360
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,700
Rachel.

361
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,700
She's passed out in the back.
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

362
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Sofia?

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,300
What have you done to her?

364
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,100
Look, the only person
I have a problem with is Ray.

365
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,800
Okay? Don't trust
anything he tells you.

366
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,600
She okay?
You hurt her?

367
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
It was an accident, okay?
I'm sorry.

368
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
You could've killed
the whole family.

369
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
But I didn't, did I, now, okay?

370
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,900
They-they weren't even
supposed to be there!

371
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
The house is where
Ray and I used to meet.

372
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,400
- We made the baby there.
- Okay, tell me where you are.
- No.

373
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,000
Look, I looked into your story.
I believe you.

374
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,900
I don't care
whether you believe me, okay?

375
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,400
Now that I have Agent Young,
you have to do what I say.

376
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,000
Let me talk to her.

377
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,900
Go to my apartment,
switch on my computer.

378
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I'll call you from there.

1
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,400


2
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,700
No. Sofia,

3
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,000
I want to help you,
but you have to let her go.

4
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,900
- Let her go.
- No one's gonna help me.

5
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,300
I've learned my lesson now.

6
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,100
There's no one I can trust.

7
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,600
Sofia?
Sofia!

8
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,500
Sofia!

9
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,700
Help!

10
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,000
Can anybody hear me?!

11
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,500
???

12
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,500
There's some low-rent, high-volume
bachelor party out there, so...

13
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
sing along if you want to.

14
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Got you some painkillers.

15
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,700
And this.

16
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,600
It's a Wi-Fi phone.

17
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,700
Takes weeks to trace a call,
'cause it goes over the Internet

18
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,400
instead of the phone lines.

19
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
You're going
to jail, Sofia.

20
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,700
You know that, don't you?

21
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,800
We tried to help you,
but you blew it.

22
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,300
- I can get you a pillow for your leg.
- Careful...

23
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,800
???

24
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,600
Careful!

25
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,800
- shouldn't we...
- Don't touch it!

26
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,400
If I want to bleed to death,

27
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,100
I'll let you know.

28
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,800
OK.
Fine.

29
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,500
Sir? I found a weapon.

30
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,900
I believe it's Agent Young's.

31
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,600
- Any sign of her?
- No, sir.

32
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
There was a crossbow and traces
of blood close by.

33
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,000
I put down a marker and left
everything as it was.

34
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,600
What about her phone?

35
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,100
No answer.

36
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,700
Secure the scene.
I want dogs in those woods
and a bird in the sky.

37
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
Let's find our agent. Go.

38
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,500
I keep a crossbow here
for hunting.

39
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,100
So, the Director's here.

40
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,500
- Ray.
- Frank.

41
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,200
Sorry this keeps hitting you
so close to home,

42
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,300
but Susan and the kids are safe,
and that's what counts.

43
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,600
Yes, thank God.

44
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,900
I'm assigning an around-the-clock-
protection detail for them

45
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,700
until this woman is caught, okay?

46
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,800
Thank you, Frank.

47
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,600
Listen, this is not easy
for me to say,

48
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,300
but I haven't got a choice.
I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.

49
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,300
Your man's a problem.

50
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,700
- Who are we talking about?
- Jacob Hood.

51
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
He provoked this situation.

52
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,200
He's endangered Agent Young.

53
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,000
I know Jacob better
than that.

54
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,500
Well, you think you do, Frank.

55
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,500
See if you see it the same way
when he gets one of our agents killed.

56
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,800
Agent Lee, where is Jacob?

57
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,500
Appears as though he caught a
ride out with State Police, sir.

58
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,400
Sorry my apartment's such
a mess, Dr. Hood.

59
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,000
Let me speak to Rachel.

60
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,400
Not yet.

61
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
I want to know she's okay.

62
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,400
Well, that'll be your reward
for listening to me.

63
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,400
Okay, go on.

64
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,700
Is anyone there with you?
Is... is Ray Wynne there?

65
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,300
No.

66
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,900
You know, I don't care
what he told you, we were lovers.

67
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,200
I didn't plan to get pregnant.

68
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,700
Ray wanted me to have
an abortion, but I said no.

69
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,900
Then he talked me into giving
the baby up for adoption.

70
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,300
That whole story about the
boyfriend deserting me,

71
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,100
that was for Ray's protection.

72
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,700
But after the birth...

73
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,000
I changed my mind.

74
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,900
I couldn't give my son up.
Ray wasn't happy.

75
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,700
But he said he'd work something
out, you know?

76
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,300
I don't know what happened then.

77
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,200
He might have drugged me.

78
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,800
I woke up in my house...

79
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,100
with no baby...

80
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,500
and 36 hours of my life missing.

81
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,800
Like it was an ordinary day
and none of it had ever happened.

82
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,000
What do you want from me?

83
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,000
Ray thinks this is
all about him, but it isn't.

84
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,800
I just want my baby back.

85
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay, why don't you meet up with me
and we'll sort this thing out?

86
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,900
Oh,No. You find out
where my baby is.

87
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
I give you Agent Young
and then I disappear

88
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,200
and no one ever hears
from me again.

89
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,500
And if that doesn't happen, I...

90
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,100
someone's gonna die.

91
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,100
Still hurts?

92
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,500
It's getting worse.

93
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,700
- Are you sure you don't want me to...?
- No! No.

94
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,400
Um, well, more of these?

95
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,100
Here.

96
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,800
Yeah, you're probably right.

97
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,000
Sometimes I wonder if I ever
play a little fast and loose

98
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
with the old brain chemistry.

99
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,200
But when Dr. Hood
gets my baby back,

100
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,700
it'll be a whole new start for me.

101
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,900
You may be expecting too much
of him.

102
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,000
Don't you think he will?

103
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,200
Dr. Hood is a genius...

104
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,700
and he's a genuinely good man,

105
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
but practical he isn't.

106
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
You should let me make
a few calls.

107
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,900
Nice try, Agent Young.

108
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,900
Did you really have
Ray Wynne's baby?

109
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,300
A son.

110
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,400
Seven pounds,
nine ounces.

111
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,700
I even gave him a name.

112
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,800
What'd you name him?

113
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,100
I don't want to tell you...

114
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,300
because then I'd have to change it
when I find a new place
to settle down.

115
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,500
Sofia...

116
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,100
you honestly think
that's gonna happen?

117
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,800
I hope so...

118
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,800
For your sake.

119
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,700
What's this?

120
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,900
Agent Young's cell phone.

121
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Found on the roadside with Sofia
Lyons' fingerprints all over it.

122
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,300
???was to Jacob Hood... 

123
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
right after
Agent Young went missing.

124
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,500
- What's your point, Ray?
- Hood didn't report it.

125
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,300
Instead he took off after them.
Why would he do that

126
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,900
- unless he had to hide something?
- Ray, take it easy, okay?

127
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,400
Wouldn't you go
after your own partner?

128
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,100
He's complicit, Frank.
Maybe even directly responsible.

129
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,900
No, that, that's not possible.

130
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,000
Frank I know that
you and Hood are friends,

131
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,700
but you have
to face the facts.

132
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,200
This Lyons girl,
she's on the road to recovery.

133
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,900
She's doing fine.

134
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Hood goes to visit her
at the treatment center.

135
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,300
Within one hour
she has walked out.

136
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,300
She steals a car,
she blows up my home,

137
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,100
she injures maybe even murders...
an agent.

138
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,900
And Hood, he gets in direct
contact with an on-the-run suspect.

139
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,300
And then what does he do?
He disappears. Falls off the grid.

140
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,700
Now if you have some innocent
explanation for this,

141
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,000
I would really like to hear it,

142
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
because my family is in danger.

143
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,400
Who is this?

144
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,200
It's me, Felix.

145
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,900
Dr. Hood, where are you?

146
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm on a pay phone outside
Sofia Lyons' place.

147
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,900
I don't want to be traced.

148
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,700
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

149
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,300
No kidding, Felix.
I wouldn't involve you if

150
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,100
I could avoid it,
but I think I found a way

151
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,400
to track down the kid
that Ray Wynne stole.

152
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,200
- Ray Wynne what?
- I need to get out to Bethesda,

153
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,500
where the National Institute
keeps its health records.

154
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,000
Listen up, people.

155
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,300
I've just spoken
with the Director himself.

156
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,700
Dr. Jacob Hood is now a person
of interest in the wounding

157
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,300
and suspected kidnap
of Special Agent Rachel Young.

158
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,600
Now I know most of you know

159
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,700
that Jacob Hood has worked here
as a civilian employee for
the past three years.

160
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,700
He is, however,
not a sworn agent.

161
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,100
He's not one of us.

162
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,600
Unlike Rachel Young,
who most definitely is.

163
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,800
So let's get out there.
Do whatever it takes to get her back.

164
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,300
And make sure the man whose life
she risked hers to protect--

165
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,100
and who betrayed her--
pays for it.

166
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,600
Let's go.

167
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,600
Hey.

168
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,800
Nobody followed me.
Don't worry, I checked.

169
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,300
Felix, Rachel's hurt.

170
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,100
Sofia got her,
but she will do a trade

171
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,000
if I can find out what's
happened to her child.

172
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,400
Dr. Hood,
you can't do this.

173
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,900
Let me bring you in.

174
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,600
The whole Bureau's out there
looking for Agent Young.

175
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,300
And for me. Come on.
You heard Ray Wynne.

176
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,900
Everyone thinks I'm the bad guy.

177
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,900
If that's the best you can do,
you can go back now,

178
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,400
forget I ever called you. Seriously,
I won't hold it against you.

179
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,400
- All right.
- Thank you.

180
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,700
- Why are we here?
- Something I found.

181
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,600
Maya Wynne's Myspace page?

182
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,400
Yeah, complete with photos
of her dad Ray and the entire family.

183
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,000
Now look at the
whites of their eyes.

184
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,500
Maya's, pure white.

185
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,700
But the males?

186
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,800
Look kinda yellow.

187
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,900
That's right. Now...

188
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,600
there's a harmless condition,
it's called Gilbert's Syndrome.

189
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,300
Affects five percent
of the population,

190
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,500
and normally,
there's no side effects.

191
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,600
However, it can manifest
in a jaundice

192
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
that's brought on by, uh,
stress or puberty.

193
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
- What does that do for us?
- Well, it's mostly males

194
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,500
and there's a 50% chance
of it being passed on,

195
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,200
which means there's
a pretty even chance

196
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,800
that it could be in Sofia's child.

197
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Whoa. If there really is a child,

198
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,000
you can't be serious about
giving it back to her right now.

199
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,300
- The woman's unstable.
- That may be true,

200
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,400
but she really didn't
ask for this, Felix.

201
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,600
Was it ringing?

202
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,200
If Dr. Hood calls and I don't hear it,
don't just lie there.

203
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,900
Shout something!

204
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,600
Have you ever consulted an NIH
informationist before, Agent Lee?

205
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,300
No, it's first time...

206
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,000
- Karen.
- Ka... 

207
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,700
That's my
mother's name.

208
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,500
Wow.

209
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,100
Yeah, I'm running a study
on the syndrome for the Bureau.

210
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,900
All right, well,
Gilbert's Syndrome is listed

211
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,300
in the Office of Rare Diseases.

212
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Let's see if
there's anything there.

213
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,900
Sorry to put you
through the trouble.

214
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,800
They're supposed to notify me
if they change their address, but...

215
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
No,it's no trouble.

216
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah, I'm not getting any hits.
Are you sure about the spelling?

217
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
Um...

218
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Their son's six months old.

219
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,100
Can you try
searching by age?

220
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,200
Yeah. Only one. And this boy is
not with his birth family.

221
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,900
Can I see that?

222
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,900
He's in foster care,
pending adoption.

223
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,700
You know what? You're probably right.
This is just a waste of time.

224
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,600
Sorry. Thank you.

225
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,400
He's settled with a couple
in Carroll County, Maryland.

226
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,900
How could Ray Wynne go out and
fix up an adoption, just like that?

227
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The state has a Safe
Haven law for newborns.

228
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,400
He could've dropped the
kid off at any hospital,

229
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
no questions asked,
but after 60 days,

230
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,300
the kid's legally abandoned
and the parent loses all rights.

231
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,100
But he's the boy's father.

232
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
It's a cold world, Doc.

233
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,300
We found the boy.

234
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Now what?

235
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Now...

236
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,700
Now it gets tricky.

237
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,400
Dr. Hood?

238
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,800
I've tracked down your son,
but I've got to make this quick.

239
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,300
This phone's not secure.

240
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Okay.

241
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,700
Can Rachel hear me?

242
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Uh...

243
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,700
She can hear you now.

244
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,600
Okay. I want you to meet me
at 1515 Hazelwood.

245
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,700
It's the diner where
we had the worst pancakes

246
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,300
- in the world, ???
- That's it. Let's go.

247
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,500
Soon as I have the baby, I'll
tell Dr. Hood where to find you.

248
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
Listen.

249
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,300
Listen. That's a false address.

250
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
What do you mean?

251
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,400
Hood knows the FBI
is listening in.

252
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,200
And I don't know
where 1515 Hazelwood is.

253
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
But I can show you
where the diner is.

254
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
This place looks like it's
been closed for a while.

255
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,900
It's the pancakes.
They probably poisoned someone.

256
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Rachel.

257
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,200
- You're okay?
- Careful, careful.

258
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,700
- Where is he?
- ???

259
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,800
He's here.

260
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,100
Oh! Rachel?

261
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
What is that?

262
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,900
What, you thought I was just gonna
snatch him and hand him over? No.

263
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Felix?
You see them yet?

264
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,700
Uh-huh. Yeah, they've gone
into a pizza place.

265
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,000
- Wait. Here they come.
- Okay, send me video.

266
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,800
- But ,don't let them see you.
- Okay.

267
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,500
He is there.

268
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,400
And he's watching the people
who are looking after your son.

269
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
These are live pictures
from his phone.

270
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
Yeah, uh-huh!

271
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,200
No, they're
brand new in the box.

272
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,000
No, man, I heard now's the time
to get back into the stock market.

273
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,100
Okay, Rachel,
keep your eyes open, okay?

274
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,500
- Keep your eyes open,
so you can stay awake.
- Okay.

275
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We've got a location
on Jacob Hood.

276
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,700
What is the point of
this? This doesn't help me.

277
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,400
It's just making it worse!

278
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,100
You're just trying to buy time
to talk me out of keeping my son.

279
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,600
Sofia, look at him.

280
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,900
Look at him.

281
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,700
He's safe.

282
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,200
He's happy.

283
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,900
And he's loved.

284
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,100
All I'm asking is you just keep
him that way until we've
sorted this thing out, okay?

285
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,500
- Can you do that, Sofia?
- No! No! He belongs with me.

286
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,700
Tell me where he is!

287
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,200
Sofia, I'm asking you, think about
what is best for your son!

288
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,000
We made a deal, okay?

289
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,600
You said that I could trust you!

290
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,200
Yes, and you can, but we have
to get her to a doctor,

291
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,300
or she's going to die!
Now, give me my phone!

292
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,000
Give me my phone!

293
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,500
Forgive me.

294
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,300
Oh, God!
Hood!

295
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,400
Okay...
Oh, my God!

296
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,900
Doc!

297
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,600
We need an ambulance.

298
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,300
She's taken the phone.

299
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,900
Where are you going?

300
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,900
- I'm tired, Hood.
- Stay awake.

301
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,800
I'm doing the best I can.

302
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,900
I think it's only five miles
into the next town.

303
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,400
In this thing?

304
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,700
- More like 500.
- We can't complain.

305
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,800
The owner made sure
we don't need keys.

306
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,900
Told you I should drive
every once in a while.

307
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,000
Mm-hmm.

308
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,800
- Rachel? Rachel?
- Yeah?

309
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
You can do this, okay?

310
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
If it doesn't work out...

311
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
it's not your fault.

312
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
You can't fix everything.

313
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,700
Just hold on.

314
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,600
Can we get some help here,
please?

315
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Excuse me, Sir.

316
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,600
???

317
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,700
Jacob Hood.

318
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The trouble
you have caused me...

319
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,600
Ray...

320
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,200
I haven't even started.

321
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,300
Oh, I knew you'd have, uh...

322
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,300
surveillance all over my phone.
You see that?

323
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,700
That's the son you lied about.

324
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,100
And a DNA test is going to confirm it.

325
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,600
I suppose we should be thankful
you didn't just take him down
to the river and drown him.

326
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,500
It's over, Ray.

327
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,500
So are you.

328
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,200
Little puppies love to run,
they wag their tail...

329
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,400
What a lovely baby.

330
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,600
Oh. Thank you.

331
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,100
Do you mind?

332
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,700
Not at all.

333
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,600
He's got a little
bit of a cold.

334
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
- He's gonna be okay, though, right?
- Oh, yeah. He's strong.

335
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,000
What's his name?

336
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,600
Michael.

337
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,500
Like the Archangel.

338
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,300
- Hello, Michael.
- Sofia?

339
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,700
Sofia, I think
you should come with us.

340
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,800
Okay.

341
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,600
Yeah, you're probably right.

342
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,800
Bye, Michael.

343
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

344
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,000
How's your leg?

345
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,200
Uh...

346
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,700
I start physical
therapy tomorrow.

347
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,400
How's the case?

348
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,300
Oh, uh...

349
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,500
Wynne's being
held without bail

350
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,300
while they, uh...

351
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,000
work up a case for
kicking him out of the FBI.

352
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,900
And Felix tracked down Sofia.
Brought her in.

353
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,500
Good.

354
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,400
Maybe she'll finally get
the help she needs.

355
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,900
Mm-hmm.

356
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Um, you can tell your, uh...

357
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,800
new handler not to
get too comfortable.

358
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,600
I mean, I'll be out of here
fore you know it.

359
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,000
Been meaning to speak
to you about that.

360
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,400
Um...

361
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
I've been thinking,

362
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
and, um...

363
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,600
I've decided if you...

364
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
wanted to transfer out...

365
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,900
I wouldn't stop you.

366
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,600
"Welcome back, Rachel"?

367
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I'm serious, Rachel.

368
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You're lucky to be alive.

369
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,700
And if it had gone the other way,
I'd find that very hard to deal with.

370
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,200
Listen to me, Hood.

371
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,400
I don't want another assignment.

372
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,000
All right? Maybe my classmates from
Quantico are ahead of me on the ladder.

373
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,900
And maybe I barely remember what
my apartment looks like.

374
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,100
But if it was anyone else
lying here instead of me,

375
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,600
I swear to you,
I would be jealous as hell.

376
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,300
Really?

377
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,400
Besides...

378
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,200
Let's face it. You need me.
You're the worst driver in the world.

379
