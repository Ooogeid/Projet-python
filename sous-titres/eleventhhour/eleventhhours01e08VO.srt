1
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Tara?

2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,500
Tara!

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,100
Help!

4
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,100
Help!

5
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,800
Thanks, Uncle Jacob!

6
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,400
That's okay.

7
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,500
Ah.

8
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,900
You've had this
since we were kids.

9
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,800
Remember that?

10
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,800
You practically slept with it.

11
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,400
Yo, birthday boy.
Come here. Oh!

12
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,200
I got something for you.

13
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,700
What could that be?

14
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
Wow! Thanks.

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,900
Do you want to go play?

16
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,600
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

17
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
What?

18
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,500
So,Jake,

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
speaking of chemistry.

20
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,100
You and the lovely Rachel?

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,700
Strictly professional.

22
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,500
Well, of course she is.

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,500
Ooh!

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,600
Look, all I'm saying is that

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,000
is he is dragging you around
by those shiny big handcuffs,

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
well, at least tn, I would
understand why you took the job.

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,700
You know, some people
might think that

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,700
special science advisor to
the FBI is a kind of cool job.

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,300
You're my big brother.

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,700
You're cool no matter
who you work for,

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,400
even if it is the man.

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,300
What you doing, Uncle Jacob?

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,000
I was wondering.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,700
What do you think happens

35
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
if I put this

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,700
into that?

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,200
Shall we see?

38
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
-No.
-Oh, go on.

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Wow!

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,700
Awesome! How'd that happen?

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
Well, I'm not really sure,

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,100
but I think you might
find the answer...

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,700
on page 29.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,800
Sorry, guys,
but we've got to go.

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,000
No. Why?

46
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,000
A Tulsa State College student
just died of the bends.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,400
The bends?

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,600
Second this month.

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,800
In Oklahoma?

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,800
Thought only scuba divers got the bends.

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,100
That's right. And Oklahoma's
500 miles from the nearest ocean,

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,900
so I guess they weren't scuba diving.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
It gets better.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,100
One of the victims
couldn't even swim.

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,300
ELEVENTH HOUR S01E08

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,700
Tulsa International Airport
TULSA, OKLAHOMA

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,800
Here's our latest victim:
Tara Bingham.

60
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,400
She died a few hours
after getting off this plane.

61
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,500
You see this,

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,100
Rachel?

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,100
It's nitrogen in her heart
and lungs and liver.

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
It's caused by rapid decompression.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's, uh...

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
It's basically...

67
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,600
It's bubbles.

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,300
It's like this, uh,
ginger ale.

69
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,500
You think this is
a fizzy drink, right?

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,900
- Mm-hmm.
- Right now,

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,300
there's no bubbles in it. Why?

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,000
'Cause the top is keeping
the ginger ale under pressure.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,900
The gas is dissolved in the liquid.

74
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,900
All you need is
a sudden drop in pressure.

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,100
And you get the bends.

76
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,500
Nice work.

77
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,400
Sorry I made a bit
of a mess there.

78
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,500
Excuse me?

79
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
Were you the attendant
on this flight?

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,900
- Yes.
- Oh.

81
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,300
Can you tell me did anyone
complain about pressure on their, um,

82
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,700
ears or head?

83
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
No.

84
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,200
There's something
she's not telling us.

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
O2, go!

86
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
???

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,100
See, if there had been
rapid decompression,

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,700
that would have happened...

89
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,600
but it didn't.

90
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,800
So I don't think
the plane's our suspect.

91
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, back to square one.

92
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,200
So we'll have to start
with Tara Bingham.

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,400
a victim from the plane.

94
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
She has a sister who also goes
to Tulsa State College.

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,500
Mm?

96
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,300
Maybe we can get
some details from her.

97
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Told you.

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,500
Is there something
you want to tell us?

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,500
Right before her seizure,
she was in the galley with a guy.

100
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,600
They were...

101
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,400
Making a sandwich? What?

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Joining the Mile High Club.

103
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Who was the guy?

104
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,900
In the gospel group. 21C.

105
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,100
Wade Earlham.

106
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

107
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,900
Mile High Club.

108
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,400
Do they really use
that expression?

109
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,500
Don't knock it
till you tried it, Rachel.

110
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
But it's actually
six miles, not one.

111
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,800
Way to go, Hood. I'm impressed.

112
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,400
Special Agent Young, Dr. Hood,

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm Blake Miller, Tulsa State
College's Head of Security.

114
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,000
And a former FBI agent.

115
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,300
I've read your file.

116
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,100
Why the change of career?

117
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,500
Uh, less stress, more stability.

118
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,000
Besides, I-I used
to play football here.

119
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,400
I found out that the first victim,

120
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Tom Cassidy,

121
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,200
stayed on campus during the break
and moved into a new apartment.

122
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,200
That's about it.

123
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
He didn't go anywhere or do anything

124
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,900
that would cause
a pressure change.

125
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,000
We'd like to talk to
Tara Bingham's sister, Vivian,

126
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,600
and to Wade Earlham.

127
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,100
Yeah, they're probably over
at Tara's memorial.

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
???

129
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Right here.

130
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,300
??

131
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
- Hello.
- Hi.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
This is Dr. Hood.

133
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,700
I'm Special Agent
Rachel Young.

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Very sorry about what
happened to your sister.

135
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,200
Looks like a lot
of people loved her.

136
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,000
Loving Tara wasn't difficult.

137
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,100
She was always fun,

138
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
you know?

139
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
A happy person.

140
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
We just want to know
what happened to Tara.

141
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,100
We're trying to piece together
the days before she died.

142
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,200
We know she was at the
choir competition in Reno

143
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,100
with her boyfriend, Wade Earlham.

144
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Actually, we were hoping
he might be here.

145
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,600
No. Um,

146
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,600
Wade hasn't left
his dorm room since Tara...

147
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Thank you.

148
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,900
We spent the whole time
in Reno just studying.

149
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,200
She had her psych paper,

150
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,300
and I prepped for my calculus final.

151
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,900
But we even pulled
two all-nighters.

152
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,400
Dragged our tired butts
to the rehearsals and the concert.

153
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,100
I'm Phi Beta Kappa.

154
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
And she was...

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,100
Um, she was on track
to be in next year for sure.

156
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,600
Well, you definitely
get a 4.0 in lying.

157
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
I...

158
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

159
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Zolpidem.

160
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,800
Prescription's in your name.

161
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,300
You filled it last week.
There should be 30 pills.

162
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,800
I count ten.

163
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,400
And people abusing sleeping pills are

164
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,200
usually trying to come down 'cause
they're wired on some other drug.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Look,

166
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,300
Tara and I were in love. I mean...

167
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,400
But doing drugs,
having sex on airplanes.

168
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,800
That doesn't really go with
the whole Phi Beta Kappa, choir thing.

169
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,900
You know about that?

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,100
Now, Wade,

171
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
we need to find out
what happened to Tara

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,100
before it happens
to someone else.

173
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
If you cared about her
like you said you did,

174
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,300
then you'd help us.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,100
I...

176
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,600
Oh, s...

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,900
Sorry.

178
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,900
Bought 'em in Reno.

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,600
The guy said that they're
brand-new, just synthesized.

180
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,400
And he told me that
they made sex incredible.

181
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,300
Yeah, but probably not worth dying for.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,700
I don't recognize this symbol.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
He called it Pearl.

184
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,200
Do you think that
those pills killed Tara?

185
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Well,

186
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,000
if they did--
and that's still an "if"--

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,400
then, you'll be in danger, too.

188
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,800
Need to get you under
medical supervision.

189
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Can we get him to the
college clinic, please?

190
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
???

191
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,000
We need to get
to the morgue immediately.

192
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,000
Why?

193
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, I don't think bubbles
hang around long in corpses.

194
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,700
Bubbles in bodies
are always nitrogen.

195
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,000
What you're proposing
is medically impossible.

196
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,700
Not impossible.

197
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,600
Unprecedented.

198
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,100
Now, Wade said that Pearl

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,100
made sex incredible.

200
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
And you think it made an excess
of nitric oxide in the blood?

201
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
And nitric oxide is...?

202
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Uh, it's the body's natural
chemical signal, and, uh,

203
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,900
opens up the arteries and
floods the tissues with blood.

204
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll be damned.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,900
The bubbles in Tara Bingham
are nitric oxide.

206
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,300
???

207
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,900
Producing so much nitric oxide,
it overwhelmed Tara's blood.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,500
Making bubbles,
which became the bends.

209
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,500
Just like the ginger ale,
but without the pressure change.

210
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Exactly.

211
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,700
Well,

212
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,100
we have a new recreational drug,
and it's a killer.

213
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,800
Let's find out
what it's made of.

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
You play like a six-year-old.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,700
If I dedicated one tenth as much
time to this game as you do,

216
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,600
I'd kick your sorry ass.

217
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
You know what?

218
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,900
I'm going out for a run.

219
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, if I dedicated one tenth the
amount of time that you spend working out,

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
then I'd whoop your sorry ass.

221
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,700
Then tag along.

222
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Man, for real. When was the
last time you broke a sweat, man,

223
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,900
since you grew hair
on your little chest?

224
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,200
Hey, well, look,
I prefer brain sweat.

225
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,100
All right, that's it.

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
You're coming with me,
or this Xbox goes to charity.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
Hey, it's just two miles,
if you can handle it.

228
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,700
- Can you handle it?
- Yeah, I can handle it.

229
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,200
- Can you handle it?
- I can handle it!

230
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,300
All right, you know, screw that.

231
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Let's do... ten miles.

232
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
Nah, man, we got team film
to watch tonight.

233
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Texas runs this spread offense.

234
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,600
It's super-hard to read,

235
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,800
so I got to study up on it.

236
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,000
Not worried about that.

237
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,400
But I do smell... Smell that?

238
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,700
Ooh!

239
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,300
Smells like cotton candy
or something.

240
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,200
- It's the...The Cotton Bowl, baby!
- The Cotton Bowl, baby!

241
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,900
First time in Tulsa history.

242
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,700
- Yes, baby! Aah!
- Are you ready?

243
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
Come on.
I'm-I'm all ready.

244
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,000
Right on, man.

245
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
You're doing great.

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I got to get back, though.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,300
No, no. One more lap.

248
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,700
Whoever loses
does laundry for a month.

249
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,900
Isaac.

250
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,400
Come on, man.
You all right?

251
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,200
Isaac.

252
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,400
Hey, what's wrong?

253
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,800
Help!

254
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,300
Isaac.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Stay with me.

256
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,800
Come on, come on.

257
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,400
Help!

258
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,100
Help!

259
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,300
???

260
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,100
??

261
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,300
???

262
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,400
Come on. Let's get him stable.

263
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,400
Easy, easy.

264
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,900
Now, push two more
migs Lorazepam.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
???

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
??

267
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,100
???

268
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
???

269
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
Get him into a pressure chamber!

270
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,700
What are you doing here?

271
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,800
FBI. We were notified you have
a patient with bends-like seizures.

272
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,900
Get him into a pressure chamber.

273
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,200
Hopefully, we'll shrink the bubbles
and we can stop his seizures.

274
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,900
This is a land-locked state.
We don't have a pressure chamber.

275
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,400
???

276
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
This is Special Agent Rachel Young.

277
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,400
I need to find
a decompression chamber ASAP.

278
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,900
No, Florida is too far.

279
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,500
Look into Texas:
Galveston, Port Arthur.

280
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Get it here now.

281
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
??

282
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,000
???

283
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,900
Pressure stopped the seires.

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Well, I wish it were that simple.

285
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,800
We've ruled out
pressure change as a cause.

286
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
This is just a temporary solution.

287
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,100
If Isaac's body keeps
on making bubbles,

288
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,800
we're gonna have to keep
on lowering the pressure.

289
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
There's only so low we can go
before the pressure kills him.

290
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,100
So, how do we stop Pearl
from churning out nitric oxide?

291
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,100
We don't.

292
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,500
Pearl isn't our problem.

293
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,400
Just got the chem analysis back.

294
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,700
Uh... crystalline solid
disaccharide?

295
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,000
It's table sugar.

296
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,300
Pearl is a total fake.

297
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
Common narcotics scam.

298
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Right.

299
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,600
Dealer seeks out
a na ve mark like Wade,

300
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,200
takes his money,
leaves him with a dud.

301
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,800
Well, the clinic's releasing him.

302
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,400
At least he's out of danger.

303
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Yeah.

304
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,100
That leaves us at zero.

305
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,900
The victims have to have
something more in common.

306
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,500
Studying.

307
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,200
Xbox, sleeping and more Xbox.

308
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,700
Isaac's sort of been in that
routine since our folks died.

309
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
What happened?

310
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,300
Drunk driver.

311
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,500
He walked away without a scratch.

312
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,900
Dr. Hood...

313
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,900
Isaac is all I've got,

314
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,100
so I need you
to be straight with me.

315
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,900
What's gonna happen to him?

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,500
Well, Isaac's suffering from
somethinge've never seen before,

317
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,800
so I honestly can't tell you,

318
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
but we are doing everything we can
to find out what it is.

319
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
Other than the run you took,

320
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,800
had he changed
his routine in any way?

321
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,700
No.

322
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Let's go.

323
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,700
Go ahead, Lawrence.

324
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,400
Right there.

325
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,800
He can hear you.
Just talk.

326
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,500
Hey, bro.

327
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Shouldn't you be at practice?

328
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,300
Come on, with you in there like that?

329
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,700
What kind of brother
you think I am?

330
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,600
Isaac...

331
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,200
It's not your fault, bro.

332
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
Or maybe it is.

333
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,600
Maybe you owe me front row seats
at the Cotton Bowl.

334
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,300
Lawrence, go play.

335
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Mom and Dad would
have wanted you to.

336
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Yeah.

337
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,600
Take care of him.

338
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,700
We'll do everything we can.

339
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,700
So, Lawrence Richmond
is a big football star.

340
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,900
So it would seem.

341
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,900
You play any sports in college?

342
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,100
Um...

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,400
throwing the occasional Frisbee
count as a sport?

344
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,000
It's kind of a sport, I guess.

345
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,300
Yeah, well, my dad
didn't think so.

346
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,900
He was a high school football coach,

347
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,700
so, naturally,

348
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,300
he wanted a jock

349
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,800
and wound up with me.

350
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,500
Well, we have that in common.

351
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,800
Really, how so?

352
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
My dad wanted a son

353
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,600
to follow in his legendary
FBI agent footsteps,

354
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,400
and instead, he got me.

355
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,600
So, anything you need,
we'll have it brought in.

356
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,700
Oh, and the, uh, Coast Guard
guys hooked us up with this.

357
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,700
Thanks, Agent Miller.

358
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,600
Blake.

359
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,200
Right, Blake.

360
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Hood?

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What are you thinking?

362
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
Hi, um...

363
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,200
I was thinking, uh,

364
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,000
there's another connection here.

365
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,100
Tara collapsed after...

366
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,100
sex.

367
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,800
Isaac Richmond

368
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,400
after jogging.

369
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,400
And Tom Cassidy collapsed

370
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,800
moving heavy furniture
into an apartment.

371
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,100
That's it-- physical exertion?

372
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,900
But that doesn't cause
nitric oxide bubbles, does it?

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,600
No, but maybe the physical exertion

374
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,300
triggered what did cause the bubbles.

375
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I thought exercise was
supposed to be good for you.

376
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,700
Yeah, but exercise can sometimes
worsen a viral infection.

377
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,100
Do you mind if I, uh...

378
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,500
Yeah. Right here.

379
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,300
Thank you.

380
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,600
Um, Isaac?

381
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,800
Uh, yeah, it's, uh, Jacob Hood.

382
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,900
Yeah.

383
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,300
I want to ask you a question.

384
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,400
Have you had a cold recently?

385
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
No.

386
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,100
I've been fine. I got
a flu shot and everything.

387
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
All three victims got flu shots.

388
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
So, you think this flu shot vaccine
was mutated to make nitric oxide?

389
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,200
Crazy amounts of nitric oxide.

390
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,500
Here's what we have left over.

391
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Thank you.

392
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,100
Um, I got to ask you.

393
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,400
What you're talking about...
that's a theory, right?

394
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,800
You sound like the administration.

395
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,500
Worried about liability, too?

396
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,200
Of course not.

397
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,000
It's just, we gave out
over 4,000 of these flu shots.

398
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,900
We'll need all those records.

399
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Coach says take it easy, all right?

400
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,300
Rest up for the big game.

401
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,000
How's the knee?

402
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,800
It's still bugging me.

403
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,300
Yeah... so let me help.

404
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,500
Little shot of cortisone
might help that.

405
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,000
Nah, man, I'm good.

406
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,500
Yeah, why leave it to chance?

407
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,100
Hear there's a couple pro scouts
coming to this game.

408
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
All right.

409
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,100
You're right, man.

410
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Lawrence...

411
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
you know you're single-handedly lifting
TSC out of the second tier, right?

412
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,800
Cotton Bowl.

413
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,200
??

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Here you go.

415
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,800
Just make sure you don't forget
about us when you go pro.

416
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,700
All right? ???

417
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,900
What are you doing, man?

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,300
You crazy coming
anywhere near here?

419
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,800
Well, look, Ellis...

420
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,900
we got to delay phase two.

421
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,700
What are you talking about?

422
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,100
I thought you said
we were good to go.

423
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,900
New and improved, you said.

424
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,500
You, uh... you didn't start, did you?

425
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,000
You let me worry about that.

426
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,600
Hey, why do you want to delay?

427
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,900
The FBI's on campus, Ellis.
They're asking questions.

428
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,600
Smart questions.

1
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
We dropped Isaac down to 300 feet

2
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,900
because the seizurescame back...

3
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,300
just like you predicted.

4
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,900
It's not a time I want to be right.

5
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,600
They're all normal.

6
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,600
Whatever's causing the bubbles,

7
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,000
it's definitely not the flu vaccine.

8
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,100
But something's making enough
nitric oxide to kill them.

9
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,500
Rachel, Dr. Hood.

10
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,100
Dr. Cogan asked me to give you this
virology report on 3 victims' blood.

11
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,800
Thanks.

12
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,500
It is a virus.

13
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,900
It's just not the flu.

14
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,400
There's not even a trace of actual
flu vaccine in tara's blood work.

15
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,000
Meaning someone switched the flu
vaccine with...something else?

16
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,200
Pretty big mistake.

17
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,200
Unless it wasn't a mistake.

18
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,900
You're saying this was intentional?

19
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm saying it was murder.

20
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,500
Thanks for letting us access
your genetics lab, Dr. Ruscillo.

21
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,300
What exactly are we looking at here?

22
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,600
Bioterrorism?

23
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,300
Well, we don't know yet, but,
um, two students are dead;

24
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,500
one's fighting for his life as we speak,

25
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
so we have to decode this DNA.

26
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,800
And we need on everyone
who administered flu shots.

27
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,800
You're reading my mind.

28
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,500
Okay.

29
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,600
Better bring me up to speed here, Dr. Hood.

30
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,500
Healthy students get injected with that.

31
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,200
It's dormant for a couple of weeks;
then the student exercises.

32
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
All of a sudden, there's enough
nitric oxide in their blood to kill them.

33
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,800
Are you familiar with gene therapy?

34
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,400
Yeah, take DNA, piggyback it onto a virus.

35
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,500
Catch a cold, cure a genetic problem.

36
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,200
Didn't they do it with, uh, hemophiliacs,

37
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,900
give them the gene that clots blood?

38
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,900
Exactly.

39
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,200
This is the virus for gene
therapies targeted at muscles.

40
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,700
Yeah, that's all the student
volunteers who administered flu shots.

41
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,300
Clean files on all of them.

42
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,900
Four of them took genetics courses,

43
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,000
but that's no big thing since
they worked in student health.

44
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We'll question them all in the
morning, starting with those four.

45
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,700
Yeah.

46
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,000
- Tougdetail?
- Mmm.

47
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,800
Fascinating detail.

48
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,200
I mean,

49
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,300
- Hood is...
- Very smart.

50
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,600
Yes.

51
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Very smart.

52
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,200
But, you know, you're
not so bad yourself.

53
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,600
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

54
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Creative.

55
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,600
Intuitive.

56
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,700
Pretty.

57
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,000
I knew you were going to say that.

58
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,000
You did?

59
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,800
Intuitive.

60
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Yeah.

61
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,300
Nice.

62
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,400
No, I was, I was talking about the...

63
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
the detail, you know?

64
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
The grind. The road.
The endless hotel beds and,

65
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,600
you know, rental cars.

66
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,000
Mmm.

67
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,400
It's all a blur.

68
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,400
No, it's...

69
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,700
it's hard when I get back to my real life.

70
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,700
You know?

71
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,200
Yeah. I hear you. I mean, uh,

72
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,400
no, that's, that's what ended my marriage.

73
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
Part of the reason why I wound up here.

74
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,800
How are we supposed to have
relationships in this job?

75
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,100
Well,

76
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,500
I guess you, you take what
you can get and be thankful.

77
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,100
That makes us sound despere.

78
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,700
Not me. I'm a civilian now.

79
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,100
I, I have a, a car.

80
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,800
- Oh, right.
- And an apartment.

81
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Your own bed.

82
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,300
Yeah. It's nice.

83
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,200
Must be nice.

84
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,200
Text message from Hood.

85
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,200
Yeah.

86
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,500
I can't bear this.

87
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
Much lower, the pressure's
going to kill him.

88
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,200
If only there was some
way to take the DNA out.

89
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,800
Adding genes is the new
biomedical revolution.

90
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,900
Removing them we just
don't know how to do yet.

91
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah, I know.

92
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

93
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,700
Did you identify your carbonating DNA?

94
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,700
We did.

95
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,500
It's two genes.

96
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,600
One gene makes nitric oxide...

97
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,900
The other one acts like a control knob,

98
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,100
turning on the nitric oxide
in response to lactic acid.

99
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,000
That's what you get
when you exercise, right?

100
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,000
Exactly.

101
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,900
I think this is a gene dope
giving athlete and improve them.

102
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,600
But with this gene-doping,
there was a design flaw,

103
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
which made it deadly.

104
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,500
Caused when the virus migrated.

105
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,900
If you get a flu
in your nose, it's a cold.

106
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,300
Get in your lungs, it's pneumonia.

107
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,600
This gene took a detour
and ended up in the arteries.

108
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,700
Should have been in the muscles.

109
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,300
Making superior athletes.

110
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,400
Like a steroid. Better than that.

111
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,500
See, the thing with gene-doping
as opposed to steroids,

112
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
it should be undetectable.

113
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Those athletes out there-- they want
to transform themselves into Greek gods.

114
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,700
Having something like this in your muscles,

115
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,100
like having an extra pair of legs.

116
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Wait. Am I crazy?

117
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,600
Or was one of our four flu shot
volunteers a sports medicine major?

118
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Do you remember this guy?

119
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,100
Dylan Petraneck.

120
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,500
The guy who had access to the
flu shots at the medical center.

121
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
But it doesn't make sense.

122
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,900
None of the ctims were athletes.

123
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,700
Why dope them?

124
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,500
How you holding up, Viv?

125
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,900
Okay, I guess.

126
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,300
I just...

127
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,100
I just miss sister is all.

128
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,300
I know.

129
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,500
Listen, Viv.

130
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
There's something I got to tell you.

131
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,400
Life at 800 feet underwater--

132
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,000
not so bad.

133
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,300
I think I'm going to enlist on a Navy
submarine when I get out of here.

134
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,700
You will get out.

135
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,400
Isaac, you do know that, right?

136
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,300
Absolutely.

137
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,900
I'm just glad I'm me in here
and not my brother.

138
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,600
Neither of you should be in there.

139
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
I know, but...

140
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,400
my brother's talented--

141
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,600
special.

142
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,500
I checked you out.

143
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,600
You're an American Engineering Club scholar.

144
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Most people here don't
even know what that is.

145
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,000
Well, they should.

146
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,100
It's pretty impressive.

147
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
What, maybe 20 students in the
country get that scholarship?

148
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Twelve.

149
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,100
Exactly.

150
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,100
They go on to make buildings
tall and bridges safe.

151
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,500
And may not be as glamorous as other jobs,

152
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,800
but doesn't mean
it's less important.

153
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,800
Thanks.

154
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,900
How you holding up?

155
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,900
Not so good.

156
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,500
I'll-I'll be better
tomorrow though.

157
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,900
I'll have someone roll up
a TV to this porthole

158
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,000
so we can watch my brother
kick ass on that field.

159
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,800
Isaac...

160
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,600
hang in there, okay?

161
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,600
Dylan Petraneck. FBI. Open up!

162
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,400
Petraneck!

163
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,100
Blake.

164
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,600
Check this out.

165
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,500
Lawrence Richmond--

166
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,600
Isaac's brother.

167
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
Vivian Bingham--
Tara's sister.

168
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,400
Andrew Cassidy...
brother of the first victim.

169
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Son of a bitch.

170
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
I'm going to call Hood.

171
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,400
Yeah?

172
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,500
Hood. All of the victims
have siblings who are athletes.

173
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,500
Similar genetics, similar results.

174
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
They're guinea pigs.

175
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,900
Dylan's testing his gene-dope?

176
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,900
Right,

177
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,900
on someone more disposable
to them than an hlete.

178
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,700
A regular student, no one
notices if something goes wrong.

179
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,900
But a star athlete,

180
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,800
under constant scrutiny,
that's a different matter.

181
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Siblings have the closest blood relations.

182
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,300
Makes sense. I'll call you back.

183
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,900
Get this, Our victims were test
subjects for Dylan's deadly gene-dope.

184
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,900
Unwitting test subjects.

185
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,700
Isaac thinks he got a flu shot.

186
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,400
But did the athletes know?

187
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,800
Well, at least one of them did.

188
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,800
Take a look at that.

189
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,000
"Olympic Diver's Dreams Die in Steroid Scandal."

190
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,800
Tara's sister, Vivian.
Already busted for doping.

191
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,300
Along comes the promise of
an undetectable gene-dope?

192
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,400
Irresistible.

193
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,700
She greenlights the test on Tara.

194
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,200
And ends up sacrificing
her in the process.

195
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,600
You!

196
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,000
You told me it was harmless!

197
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,900
Dylan said it was!

198
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,700
We had to make sure it didn't show up
on any tests before we gave it to you!

199
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,600
But it killed her, Ellis.

200
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,800
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

201
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Those FBI people need to know this.

202
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,200
because I've got to tell them.

203
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
No, you are not telling anybody, okay.

204
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,100
You made a choice, Vivian!

205
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,800
You did!

206
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,800
You jumped at our offer.

207
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,700
Confirmed that it's undetectable,

208
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,200
so that you could keep doping without
risking your scholarship, your Olympic bid.

209
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,700
You told it would be safe!

210
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,800
I thought it would be!

211
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,400
Okay!

212
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,400
Honestly, Viv,

213
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,900
if I could give you your gene-dope

214
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,300
and your scholarship and your sister

215
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,700
and an Olympic gold medal
all without any risk, I would.

216
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,200
But I'm not a miracle worker.

217
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,900
And if you go squealing--

218
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,900
your scholarship is the
least of our problems.

219
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,700
If I had thought that
there would be any risk...

220
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,000
It's not like I wanted her to die either.

221
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,500
Okay?

222
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,500
We'll get through this.

223
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,400
Together.

224
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,800
i'm worring the press under 900 feet
under the water, Agent Young??.

225
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
it's close 2 maximum.???

226
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,800
it was a gene-dope that
killed my sister Tara.

227
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,700
??? viv come on, i did this for you.

228
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,500
Ellis brockton and dylan
petraneck are the ringleader.

229
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,700
Un-send.

230
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,700
and delete.

231
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,100
I had a feeling she knew
what happened to her sister.

232
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,300
And this confirms it.

233
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,100
Yeah, I think you're right.

234
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,100
This isn't grief.

235
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,800
This is guilt.

236
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,700
This is screwed up, Ellis.

237
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,700
Viv's dead.

238
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,200
Uh, the feds searched my apartment.

239
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,100
- Now they're looking for me.
- Relax.

240
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,300
Okay?

241
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Listen to me.

242
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,800
We'll say that Viv planted
the stuff in your apartment.

243
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,600
I'll hack her e-mail again,

244
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
send out a new and improved suicide note.

245
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,500
She can take credit for all this.

246
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,700
We play this right,

247
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,700
it'll all look like athletes testing their
siblings with gene-dope they want for themselves.

248
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,300
Nobody'll know where they got it.

249
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,100
We can regroup, improve the product,

250
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,500
and try it somewhere else.

251
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,500
All right?

252
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,100
You, you really think this will work?

253
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,900
You think Viv's way is a better option?

254
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
- Huh?
- No.

255
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,700
Teams win all the time
on Hail Marys, Dylan.

256
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,500
This is our Hail Mary.

257
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,600
Is he going to die?

258
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't know, Lawrence.

259
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm working with the school's top
geneticist to undo what's been done to him.

260
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
How much do you want to
win this season, Lawrence?

261
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,300
Enough to take a performance-
enhancing drug regimen?

262
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,900
What are you talking about?

263
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,800
An undetectable gene-dope.

264
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,500
Maybe you agreed to test it on your brother.

265
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,000
Maybe you thought it wouldn't hurt him.

266
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,600
Football's all you got, isn't it?

267
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,900
You win, everything
changes for the better.

268
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,400
Stop winning,

269
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,900
you're just another college jock

270
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,700
who doesn't quite have
what it takes to go pro.

271
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,500
You're wrong.

272
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,600
Isaac is all I got.

273
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, all right.

274
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,900
We just picked up Petraneck
at a bus station.

275
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,000
He was trying to sneak out of town.

276
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,800
No, I don't...
I don't know what that is.

277
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,300
Even though we found it at your apartment?

278
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Someone must have planted it in my apartment.

279
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,600
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we try it out on you

280
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,500
- and we'll find out exactly what it does, huh?
- No.

281
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,300
No!

282
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
All right, all right.

283
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,100
- You sure?
- All right.

284
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,400
Some of the jocks--

285
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,400
they wanted me to test the gene-dope
on their brothers and sisters

286
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,700
so they wouldn't get caught
if it didn't work.

287
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,200
Including Lawrence Richmond?

288
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,100
Then why'd you test it
on his brother Isaac?

289
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Lawrence was our meal ticket.

290
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,200
The closest thing to a superstar

291
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,100
TSC's got.

292
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,900
If I could bring it to him fully tested,

293
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,400
if my dope made him
into one of the very best,

294
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,600
there'd be no limit.

295
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,900
Next stop: other co pros even.

296
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,700
And no limit to how much money
you would have made either.

297
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,400
It wasn't just about the money.

298
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,300
It's about science.

299
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,700
I'm a scientist.

300
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,600
But your gene-dope didn't
work, did it, Dylan?

301
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,200
Three people are dead because of it,

302
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,800
and Isaac Richmond is dying as we speak.

303
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,800
We never, uh, wanted anyone to get hurt.

304
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,600
We?

305
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,800
Who's "we," Dylan?

306
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,700
Or would you rather just
sit in a cell alone?

307
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,600
It's up to you.

308
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,100
Sit in a cell.

309
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,900
Sit in a cell.

310
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,500
That's it.

311
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,200
Dr. Ruscillo, couldn't we... 

312
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,100
make a new gene
that would sit in the...artery cells

313
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,700
and trick the control-knob gene into
thinking the lactic acid was low?

314
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,100
And stops the gene-dope
from producing nitric oxide.

315
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,300
I don't see why not.

316
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,100
It's just...

317
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,000
- adding a gene.
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,300
All right, Dylan.
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

319
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,300
Who's "we"?

320
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,700
He's the only one who ever believed in me,

321
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,500
believed in my work.

322
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,700
Give me a name.

323
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,500
Ellis stop! FBI!

324
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,500
Ellis Brockton, you are under arrest.

325
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,900
Are you sure about this?

326
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,500
Don't have time to be sure.

327
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,400
put in the oxygene it would take
him 5 mins to equalize the chambers.

328
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,800
I've got him at a thousand fe, Dr. Hood,

329
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,800
'cause right now that's the
only way we can keep him alive.

330
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,000
But a healthy person
should not be doing this.

331
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,100
I'm well aware of the risks,
Officer. Thank you.

332
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,300
When I've got you down to depth,

333
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,600
you can twist that lever
and go to the next chamber.

334
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,500
Just get me down there quickly, please.

335
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,900
Lawrence. You can't play.

336
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,500
What are you talking about?

337
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,100
Listen to me.

338
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,900
Listen to me!

339
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,600
You've been injected with
the same thing Isaac has.

340
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Ellis Brockton confessed

341
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,300
that he gave you a shot of cortisone.

342
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,000
- Yeah...
- But it wasn't cortisone.

343
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,800
What?

344
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,300
They tested it on your brother first
to see what would happen to you.

345
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,000
Now...

346
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,700
if u have a seizure out there

347
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,100
we might not have time to get
you to a pressure chamber.

348
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,800
You could die.

349
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,800
Or I could make it.

350
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,100
Man, y'all, y'all dot understand.

351
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,600
I feel strong, man.

352
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,100
Man, this game is my future, man!

353
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,800
No, you don't understand.

354
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,800
All right, you go out on that field,
you may not have a future.

355
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,800
- Rachel?
- HOOD.

356
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,000
You with Lawrence?

357
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,100
Yeah, yeah.We got him.

358
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Who is this?

359
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,500
Lawrence,

360
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,100
It's me, bro.

361
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,500
I'm better.

362
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,400
I'm better.

363
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,800
I'm coming to see you, bro.

364
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,100
Yeah, man, I'm... I'm coming.

365
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,900
They're doing well.

366
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,900
Oh, they're doing awesome, especially Lawrence.

367
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,700
Thanks to you,

368
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,500
he should be able to
keep playing football.

369
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,100
Well...

370
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,700
if you ever have any other weird
scientific crimes happen around here...

371
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
you know who to call.

372
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,300
Hmm, yeah, well, you know,

373
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,500
I'll see if I can arrange something "weird"
with the physics department then.

374
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,100
Yeah... yeah.

375
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,900
All right.

376
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,600
It's been a real pleasure.

377
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,900
Likewise.

378
