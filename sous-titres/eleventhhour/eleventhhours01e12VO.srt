1
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:43,509
Can I have another cosmo,
please?

2
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:44,738
- And one for my friend.
- Thanks.

3
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:45,639
Right away, ma'am.

4
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,423
Help!

5
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:15,271
Somebody get Lowell! My husband.
He's still in the car!

6
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:21,550
Lowell!

7
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:26,593
Lowell! Lowell?!

8
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,929
Somebody! Call an ambulance!

9
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,669
Somebody do something!

10
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:32,604
- Is he okay?!
- ???checking.

11
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:33,927
- Is he breathing?!
- No breathing.

12
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,186
Why isn't he breathing?!

13
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:41,045
Breathe! Come on!
Baby, Breathe!

14
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:43,588
Lowell?!

15
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,230
guess how old this guy is.

16
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,726
42.

17
00:01:57,102 --> 00:01:58,674
No, he's 41.

18
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,151
He's 56.

19
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:02,469
I know, can you believe that?

20
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:05,741
And it's weird 'cause he had a history
of alcohol abuse and he smoked.

21
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:07,417
I knew it was time
to start drinking.

22
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:10,205
Explains why he drove
himself into the pool.

23
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:12,015
Oh, wait.

24
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,205
No, his tox report
said he was clean.

25
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,094
Really?

26
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,488
Then what made him plow
into the country club?

27
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,633
Hates rich people?

28
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,437
No, he is rich people.

29
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:22,038
You know who Lowell Parks is,
don't you?

30
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:23,977
Lowell Parks?

31
00:02:24,513 --> 00:02:26,208
As in Parks Airways?

32
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:34,126
What the hell?!

33
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,582
Get the medical director,

34
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:37,835
the chief administrator,

35
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:39,564
and the health department
on the phone.

36
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,507
They're going
to want to see this.

37
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:43,054
<font color="#ffff00">{\a6}???</font>

38
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:45,409
Those X-rays were taken of Mr. Parks
about eight months ago.

39
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,094
As you can see,
no sign of deformity

40
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:48,963
but he did have
congestive heart disease.

41
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,957
Well, he's got more
than that now, doesn't he?

42
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,216
Unbelievable.

43
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:06,239
Tell me about it.

44
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:09,867
It's not even bifurcated.
It's two separate organs.

45
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:13,120
There's no doubt about it.
This man has two hearts.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,410
Is that even possible?

47
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:17,579
Surgeon General was hoping you
might be able to tell us that.

48
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:19,522
Well, we better, uh...

49
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,772
excise the heart
and, uh, parts.

50
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,273
Keep them on ice.

51
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:26,175
We need to keep the cells alive
for testing.

52
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:27,435
Did it kill him?

53
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:29,900
Good bet.
Two extra heart valves

54
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,924
would have overoxygenated
the blood

55
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:35,199
and eventually would have slowed down
and then stopped the impulse to breathe.

56
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,040
In other words, he suffocated.

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,959
Yeah.

58
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:40,440
So, I guess two hearts
aren't always better than one.

59
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,565
Any natural causes
for something like this?

60
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:46,627
Only man's natural desire...

61
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,369
to meddle where he shouldn't.

62
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:53,695
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

65
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:04,584
<font color="#ffff00">??</font>

66
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,889
Not the kind of memorial
you'd expect a grieving widow to arrange.

67
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,037
This is exactly the kind of memorial
Lowell would have wanted.

68
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,016
He loved parties.

69
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,154
He told me he wanted his funeral
to be the biggest and best ever.

70
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:33,316
Well, he certainly seems to have
lived life to the fullest.

71
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,047
Spent every day
as if it were his last.

72
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:38,643
But then, he knew
it very well could have been.

73
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:41,008
You're referring to his heart condition.

74
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,031
Of course.

75
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:45,240
He started complaining that
he was tired about a year ago.

76
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:46,649
Trust me,

77
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,676
Lowell was never tired.

78
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:49,793
Ten years older than me

79
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:52,076
and it still took everything
I had just to keep up with him.

80
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:56,113
Anyway, he had problems
breathing and sleeping.

81
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,045
So, I finally forced him
to go to the doctor.

82
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,777
That's when we found out
it was congestive heart disease.

83
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,373
Is there anything else
wrong with him that you knew of?

84
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,243
Not until he died.

85
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:08,608
That's obviously
why you're here, right?

86
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:12,154
I mean, the FBI doesn't show up
just for heart attacks.

87
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:13,575
Not usually, no.

88
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:16,851
But when they found out Lowell
had a second heart,

89
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:20,678
well, I guess that demands
some extra attention, doesn't it?

90
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,107
Yes, it does.

91
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:26,911
Was this something that
you were aware of before he died?

92
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:31,273
Well, Lowell always
had a lot of heart.

93
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,810
But, no, I had no idea.

94
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:35,101
All right.

95
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:36,951
Was he on any medication?

96
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:40,062
Just beta blockers to relieve
the stress on his heart.

97
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:40,878
That's really it.

98
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,859
The doctor also told him
to stop drinking and smoking

99
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:44,868
if he wanted to live longer.

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,098
He thought that was
pretty funny; he'd say,

101
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,402
"What's the point of a longer
life if I can't enjoy it?"

102
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,962
He was obviously very active,

103
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:56,630
but was there anywhere
in particular he liked to spend his time?

104
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:00,777
I'm Isabelle Van Dyke.
I'm the manager here.

105
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:03,956
Mr. Parks' accident
at the pool was, well,

106
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,472
upsetting, to say the least.

107
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:08,572
I certainly hope you find
what you're looking for.

108
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:09,639
Thanks. So do we.

109
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,384
Let me know if there's
anything else we can do.

110
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:12,468
Will do. Thank you.

111
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,272
Hood, check this out.

112
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,964
It's got a doctor's label

113
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:30,719
but not one I recognize
from his medical records.

114
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:33,192
Name of the medication
isn't listed.

115
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:35,316
What do you think it is?

116
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:36,324
I don't know.

117
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,838
Let's call the doctor
and find out.

118
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,414
Small world.

119
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:53,430
Looks like Dr. Templeton's
a member of the club, too.

120
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:58,895
Dr. Bruce Templeton?

121
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,968
Yes?

122
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:02,702
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

123
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:05,311
About this, uh,
mystery substance?

124
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,598
And its connection
to Lowell Parks?

125
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,161
Uh, this is no mystery.
This is HGH.

126
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,560
Human growth hormone?

127
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,290
Yeah, I was giving it
to Lowell ever since

128
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,254
he was diagnosed
with congestive heart disease.

129
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:17,841
But you weren't
his cardiologist.

130
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,620
No, but I was a friend of some 20 years

131
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,753
who also
happened to be a doctor.

132
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:22,780
Podiatrist.
Not a heart doctor.

133
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,601
I prescribed some HGH.

134
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,557
It was somewhat unorthodox, yes,

135
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:27,499
but it was helpful.

136
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:29,177
And it could be malpractice.

137
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:32,801
Look, Lowell was terminal.

138
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:36,188
His only hope was for a transplant,
but he wasn't eligible for one.

139
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:37,159
He drank too much.

140
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:38,848
Hell, he did everything
too much:

141
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,720
smoking,
recreational drug use.

142
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,175
Let's just say
he liked to have fun,

143
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:45,792
and I gave him the HGH

144
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,517
so that he could have as much
fun as possible before he died.

145
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:50,305
- Very thoughtful of you.
- Yeah.

146
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:53,298
And I assume his actual cardiologist
was aware of this.

147
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:54,262
Yes, he was.

148
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:56,151
And there was no risk
of contraindication.

149
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,910
Look, I gave him the HGH
to improve the quality of his life,

150
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,744
and it did.

151
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:03,726
I mean, he seemed to be younger
every time I ran into him.

152
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,848
I mean, hell,
you should have seen the guy.

153
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:08,149
- Like a damn 20-year-old.
- Dr. Templeton,

154
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:12,227
I don't think it was the HGH
that gave him the extra energy.

155
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,825
He developed a second heart.

156
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:16,405
Excuse me?

157
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:19,940
Oh,My God.

158
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:21,642
That's incredible.

159
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:23,133
I've never seen anything
like that.

160
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,410
How long had you
been giving him this?

161
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:28,768
Eight months, but it wouldn't
cause anything like that.

162
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:30,665
You sure this is HGH?

163
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,295
Yes, uh, test it if you want to.

164
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,058
Oh, we want to.

165
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:41,196
Well, thank you again, sir,
for your understanding.

166
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:43,529
Really, I promise,
it won't happen again.

167
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,063
I hope not.

168
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:47,565
Let's go.

169
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:49,336
Look, Gracie, I'm sorry.

170
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,024
Don't talk to me, Brian.

171
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,894
Well? Aren't you
going to say anything?

172
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:01,115
You told me not
to talk to you.

173
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:02,317
I hope you realize,

174
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:04,982
I just used our last
sympathy card in there.

175
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,459
You get into one more fight,
you're expelled.

176
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,640
Expelled?

177
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,401
Come on, Grace.
That's ridiculous.

178
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:12,065
No, I'll tell you
what's ridiculous.

179
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,904
You getting into a fight
with half your junior class.

180
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:16,341
Come on. What was it
about this time?

181
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:17,393
- Look, all I did...
- No!

182
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,598
You know what?
I don't even wanna hear it.

183
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:23,106
Would you make up your mind!

184
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:26,228
You know, is this the person you think
Mom would have wanted you to become?

185
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:27,119
Is it?!

186
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,189
Bri...

187
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:32,406
Bri, wait, come on. Stop it.

188
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:35,483
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:38,819
Okay, that wasn't cool.
I just...

190
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,573
I am so mad at you right now

191
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:43,903
and I just, I don't have the energy

192
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:46,575
to keep getting your stupid
butt out of trouble.

193
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,309
Not right now, okay?

194
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:53,674
I know.

195
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:56,699
Okay. Let's go home.

196
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:14,404
Grace?

197
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:19,400
Grace?

198
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:24,983
Grace?!

199
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,917
Grace? Grace?!

200
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:28,957
Grace! Grace!

201
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:30,895
Hey, help! Somebody help!

202
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:31,876
Grace!

203
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,535
Was that really HGH
in that vial?

204
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,476
Yep.

205
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:39,297
And could that have made
the body grow heart #2?

206
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:40,033
Nope.

207
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:42,341
Whoa.

208
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,681
Are you trying
to gross me out, Hood?

209
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:47,412
I thought maybe if he'd injected
directly into the heart,

210
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,776
there might be some kind of
tissue mutation,

211
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:54,157
but the HGH is having absolutely no effect
on heart cells whatsoever.

212
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:56,823
It's definitely not our culprit.

213
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:58,237
What is this thing?

214
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:02,623
It's a device for keeping,
um, heart transplants viable

215
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,652
by flushing blood
through the chambers.

216
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:07,438
I'm using it to keep
the cells alive so I can test them.

217
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,175
It's amazing, isn't it?

218
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:10,634
Amazingly creepy.

219
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:16,478
Oh, my...

220
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:18,389
What?

221
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:21,798
This is the first DNA result
for the double heart.

222
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,857
The two hearts
have different DNAs.

223
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:28,052
So maybe it was
some kind of transplant?

224
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:33,043
No, I'm not saying the hearts
have two different DNAs.

225
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:38,284
The second heart has DNA
from 15 different people.

226
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:46,272
And still counting.

227
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,471
What happened to
keeping it alive?

228
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:54,853
The final DNA count
on the, uh, second heart,

229
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,699
is 19.

230
00:11:57,073 --> 00:12:00,274
I need to open it up
and check your, uh, scar tissue theory.

231
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:00,956
And?

232
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,710
And nothing. But...

233
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:05,442
ruling out surgery

234
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,805
got me to thinking
about another theory.

235
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:08,542
Which is?

236
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:14,799
There's only one way to get
19 different DNAs in one organ.

237
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:16,402
And that's stem cells.

238
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,677
I mean, it's a radically new
technique,

239
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:22,064
but it's possible that they injected
stem cells directly into his heart

240
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:24,736
as a way of repairing
damaged cardiac tissue.

241
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:28,783
So instead of fixing his first heart,
he created a second one?

242
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,953
That's my guess.

243
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,769
Say this is a,
a damaged heart,

244
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:37,048
if you can,

245
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:39,288
and this water is the stem cells.

246
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,408
You put stem cells
into your bloodstream,

247
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,880
and they naturally
seek out the damaged tissue.

248
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:50,207
They repair and they replace
the sick cells

249
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:55,373
until the organ is all
fat and happy.

250
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,487
Is that why he looks so great
despite his insane lifestyle?

251
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,347
Yeah.

252
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,293
'Cause the blood travels
through the whole body.

253
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:03,114
I mean, uh,
the stem cells would fix

254
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,697
the joints, the muscles,
the skin-- the whole deal.

255
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,712
So looking younger
could be a side effect.

256
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:09,461
Pretty sweet side effect.

257
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:10,925
Yeah. Well, that was
the good part.

258
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,940
The bad side effect
was heart #2.

259
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:15,357
I mean, theoretically,

260
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:19,652
if you take a hypodermic syringe,
filled with 19 different stem cells,

261
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,221
you inject it directly into an organ,

262
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,559
there's a chance
it can overload.

263
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,782
The stem cells could, uh,
replicate too quickly.

264
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:30,124
I think he force-fed the stem cells

265
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:32,947
to the extent that it generated a
whole, new heart.

266
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:33,467
Okay.

267
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:36,469
So now we know
what caused the second heart,

268
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:37,444
but what about who?

269
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,673
Templeton gave
him the HGH.

270
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:41,506
Maybe he gave him the stem cells as well?

271
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:43,223
Yeah, but you don't just walk into Wal-Mart

272
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,950
and order yourself a batch of stem cells,
even if you're a doctor.

273
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,555
Then where did Lowell get them
from?

274
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:51,124
I don't know--a hospital,
a research center, a cord blood bank--

275
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:52,599
but the fact is

276
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,710
you can't get stem cells in these places

277
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,621
unless your umbilical cord blood was banked
when you were born or your children's.

278
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:02,651
And that doesn't explain
having 19 different stem cells in one organ.

279
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:05,166
Yeah, but people with money
have a far reach.

280
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:08,137
What if we track down
the people the stem cells came from?

281
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:10,619
ID the multiple DNAs.

282
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,541
Put them through
the criminal database?

283
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:14,831
Not just criminal:
military, medical...

284
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,315
It's worth a shot.

285
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,378
Don't think that
being nice to me now

286
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:25,528
is going to make me forget
about how pissed I am at you.

287
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:28,193
As soon as I get out of here,
I'm going to finish kicking your ass.

288
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,851
Oh, really?

289
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:34,651
"Kick the ass" of the guy
who took on half the junior class?

290
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:35,979
I don't think so.

291
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:37,790
I said that, didn't I?

292
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:39,310
Don't worry about it.

293
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:40,856
I took it as a compliment.

294
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,464
You know, I was once
just as sick as you are.

295
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,816
Look at me now.

296
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,290
I'm going to be fine, you know.

297
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,023
Your stem cells saved you.

298
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,294
Mine are going to save me.
It's practically a done deal.

299
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:57,602
Yeah.

300
00:15:02,157 --> 00:15:03,212
You're going to be okay.

301
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:11,538
18 of the 19 DNAs came up dead ends.

302
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:12,357
And the 19th?

303
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,858
Belongs to a 16-year-old boy
named Brian Dahl.

304
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:18,019
Registered with the Leukemia
and Lymphoma Society.

305
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,853
Diagnosed with a rare form of ALL
when he was ten.

306
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:24,124
Went through extensive genetic testing
and, lucky for us,

307
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,732
his DNA ended
up on file.

308
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:26,556
Not lucky for him.

309
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,157
No, but it says
he had a full recovery.

310
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:32,684
What is it?

311
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,102
His sister didn't.

312
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:36,904
She was diagnosed
three months ago.

313
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:38,576
Same leukemia as him?

314
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:39,718
Yeah.

315
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:41,730
She's in the hospital right now.

316
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:46,138
What, what do you mean
"no stem cells"?

317
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:48,123
How, how is that possible?

318
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:49,862
I thought you said she had a
large sample?

319
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:50,881
Of the cord blood.

320
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:54,287
But that doesn't guarantee
there'd be a large amount of stem cells in it.

321
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:57,273
Okay, well, somebody must've
just screwed up then.

322
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:58,353
- Brian...
- No, no, no.

323
00:15:58,353 --> 00:15:59,635
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

324
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,131
Stem cells don't just evaporate. Okay?

325
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:06,624
Could someone
please explain this to me?

326
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:09,265
Sorry to interrupt,
but I may be able to help you with that.

327
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:11,333
Who are you?

328
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,424
My name's Dr. Jacob Hood;
I'm a scientist.

329
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,478
We're with the FBI.

330
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:16,940
We're investigating a case
involving stem cells.

331
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,142
We're in the process of  tracking

332
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:20,614
the origin of  some stem cells
that we believe were stolen.

333
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:23,767
I'm afraid yours
were among them, Brian.

334
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:25,817
I don't understand?

335
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:27,415
How is that even possible?

336
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:28,861
Well, we don't
know that yet,

337
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:30,663
but we do know
we found your stem cells

338
00:16:30,663 --> 00:16:31,998
and they were in somebody else.

339
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:35,149
And what about Grace's?

340
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,366
Well, her cord blood arrived here
safely from where it was stored,

341
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:41,767
but we were unable to find any stem cells in it
when we spun it down.

342
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:45,530
Both of your stem cells
were stored at the same place, correct?

343
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:50,099
Then it's very possible
that Grace's were stolen as well.

344
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:52,793
Why?

345
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:56,159
For what? I mean, who would
do something like that?

346
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,605
Well, I'd say
someone who was very sick

347
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:00,424
who obviously
doesn't care about you.

348
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:02,146
"Someone sick."

349
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:06,574
Well, so is my sister.

350
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:13,233
They said the chemo did so much damage
to her immune system

351
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,425
that without a transfer...

352
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,077
She isn't going to make it.

353
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:24,210
Well, that's
why we're here.

354
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:28,422
We're going to find whoever it was
stole your stem cells and get them back.

355
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:48,053
Welcome.

356
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:50,288
All right, everyone.

357
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,207
She's here.

358
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,302
Hello. Excuse me. Hi.

359
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:15,508
I want a complete tour
of the facility, please.

360
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:16,299
Are you the police?

361
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,687
We're with the FBI.

362
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:19,654
Do you know where Dr., um...

363
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:22,416
Davison is, please?

364
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,732
I need to speak to him
as soon as possible.

365
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:25,320
We need an address
and a phone number.

366
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:28,323
Um, well, he's at a fund-raiser
tonight.

367
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:29,062
Where?

368
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:30,984
At the Monticello Hills
Country Club.

369
00:18:31,969 --> 00:18:34,312
Country club--
that's a coincidence.

370
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:35,827
No such thing.

371
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:45,888
I'm Dr. Davison.
What's this about?

372
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:48,184
If you don't mind speaking
with the doctor outside,

373
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:49,299
that would be fabulous.

374
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:52,850
You're touching me now?
Really?

375
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,256
Oh, it's just that, uh...
there is a dress code.

376
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:56,337
Oh, I'm sorry.

377
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,275
My gun doesn't fit
under my gown.

378
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:00,674
Dr. Davison,

379
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,498
we believe that stem cells
 from your facility 

380
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:05,308
were used
to treat the wrong person.

381
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:08,015
I don't understand.

382
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:08,829
Treat who?

383
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:12,746
Did you give stem cells to Lowell Parks
to help him with his heart condition?

384
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:13,844
What? God, no.

385
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:14,860
I would never do that.

386
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,292
Even for a friend?

387
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,294
He was a member
of your club here.

388
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,084
La Jolla's a small world.

389
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:23,396
This club has almost
a thousand members.

390
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,804
That doesn't mean
they're all my friends.

391
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:28,430
And I certainly wouldn't compromise
my life's work for any of them.

392
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,896
Well, the fact is we have DNA proof

393
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:35,517
that stem cells from your facility 
ended up  in Lowell Parks,

394
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:37,491
and they grew him
an extra heart.

395
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,239
A second heart?

396
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:40,789
My God...

397
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:44,465
Look, all our inventory
is accounted for.

398
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:46,230
Are you sure?

399
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,433
'Cause I know a 22-year-old girl

400
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,756
who's in the hospital
right now with leukemia.

401
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:54,030
She stored her stem cells
at your place,

402
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,092
and you know what?

403
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:56,652
They're not there anymore.

1
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:01,091
Well, I sincerely hope
you're wrong about this.

2
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:03,114
People are already wary
of stem cells.

3
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:06,175
Something like this could give
the entire industry a bad name.

4
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,945
Wary because they confuse
cord blood stem cells

5
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:11,062
with embryonic stem cells?

6
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:12,520
Yeah, that's one reason.

7
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,465
Of course,
they're not the same.

8
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:16,128
These don't require
the sacrifice of any life.

9
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:18,872
As a matter of fact, you only
get cord blood stem cells

10
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:21,742
-if the baby actually lives.
-Exactly.

11
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,007
So why don't more people do it?

12
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:24,463
Reason #2: money.

13
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:26,555
People don't want to spend
the cash on something

14
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,473
they're not sure
they're ever going to need.

15
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:31,171
Personally, I think
it's the cheapest form

16
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,955
of life insurance
you'll ever find.

17
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,297
Stem cells are miraculous.

18
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:37,105
They're like little chameleons,

19
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,128
morphing into whatever
they're surrounded by,

20
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:41,233
turning sick cells
into healthy ones.

21
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,935
Exactly.

22
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:44,777
There are over 70
different diseases

23
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,977
you can treat with them now.

24
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:47,769
And we have a sister company
in Brazil

25
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:48,903
who's working on a treatment

26
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:51,983
for brain and spinal cord
injuries.

27
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:55,160
You know, these things
could cure paralysis.

28
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:57,556
And they're absolutely
noninvasive.

29
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,330
You just take something that was
going to be thrown away,

30
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,363
and freeze it.

31
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:06,725
No pain, no donors.

32
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,117
Well, so far so good.

33
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:11,789
Looks like they're all here.

34
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:12,736
Well, be that
as it may,

35
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,727
we should start
testing these samples.

36
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:16,320
Which ones?

37
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,311
All of them.

38
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,628
This isn't cord blood, Rachel.

39
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:26,893
It's not even human.

40
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:28,092
Then what is it?

41
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:30,057
-Pig's blood.
-What?

42
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,800
Whoever stole
the cord blood

43
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,916
replaced it with pig's blood.

44
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,138
It's actually quite
a smart move,

45
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:37,532
'cause chemically, pig's blood's 
very similar to human blood;

46
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:40,516
that way the theft would go 
undetected for as long as possible.

47
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,426
But I've been all over this place.
It's state-of-the-art.

48
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:44,172
Alarms.

49
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,856
Even bulletproof glass.

50
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,987
There was no sign of a break-in
and none reported either.

51
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:49,862
Well, they got in
somehow.

52
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,389
How much is missing?

53
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:52,941
About a third of the inventory.

54
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,219
And if that much
was stolen--

55
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:57,699
wasn't just
for one man's bad heart.

56
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,780
You tell me that,

57
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,651
our cord blood was ripped off

58
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:10,475
and replaced with pig's blood?

59
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,622
Um, I took a look at
your family history.

60
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:18,858
I see that your mom
passed away.

61
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:21,285
What about your dad?
Where is he?

62
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,321
No idea.

63
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:25,353
And we really don't want
to know.

64
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:26,530
Really?

65
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:29,560
You mind me asking why?

66
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:35,443
When Mom died, 
Dad fell apart.

67
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:38,063
Finally dropped us off
at Grandma's and disappeared.

68
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:38,881
We were just kids.

69
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:40,558
We haven't seen or heard
from him since.

70
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:42,222
He abandoned us.

71
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:43,653
Screw him.

72
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,842
Not to defend
him, but

73
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,462
some people just don't seem
to be equipped

74
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,222
to handle grief
the way they should.

75
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,993
I mean, I...

76
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:58,447
lost someone very close to me
a couple years ago,

77
00:23:58,447 --> 00:23:59,719
and...

78
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,975
I didn't...

79
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:05,611
couldn't speak to anyone
for three months.

80
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:09,423
That's not the same
as skipping out on your kids.

81
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:10,407
No, you're absolutely
right.

82
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,774
I'm just saying that
sometimes when people are, um,

83
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:18,717
suffering a lot of pain,
they make bad choices.

84
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,030
However you feel
about your dad,

85
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,949
I just feel I have
to tell you that

86
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:26,433
he could be a very good bone
marrow match for you, Grace.

87
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,368
Even if we did know
where he was,

88
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,583
it'd be a waste of time.

89
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:35,731
Trust me, he couldn't
even handle my mom's death;

90
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:38,314
he's not going to be able
to handle this.

91
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:42,153
What about my bone marrow?

92
00:24:42,153 --> 00:24:43,456
Sorry, Brian,

93
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:45,345
but because you've
already been sick,

94
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:48,247
I'm afraid
you wouldn't be viable.

95
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,860
Well, then...

96
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,467
I guess that's that.

97
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:57,157
Grace...

98
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:00,699
...it's not.

99
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:05,805
You still think that you're going
 to find my stem cells?

100
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:10,745
Look, I appreciate you trying,
but...

101
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:13,545
what if you can't?

102
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,901
Well, I'll put it this way.

103
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:17,630
I'm not going to give up,

104
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,620
and I don't want you to either.

105
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,492
Okay?

106
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:29,771
I ran background checks
on the staff:

107
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:31,478
-no red flags.
-Forget the staff.

108
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:33,500
We need ask our little
porcine friends.

109
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,333
Excuse me?

110
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,671
People lie.
You said it yourself.

111
00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:38,459
Pigs don't.

112
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,465
Rachel.

113
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:53,920
Oh, my God.

114
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,799
How long was I out?

115
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,577
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

116
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:01,872
I'm on day two without sleep.
I can't say I blame you.

117
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:04,298
-Was I snoring?
-No.

118
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,743
Drooling a little.

119
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:06,808
Great.

120
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:08,154
It's okay. It's kind of cute.

121
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:09,717
Found our pig.

122
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:12,993
Seems like pig breeds
are pretty easy to identify;

123
00:26:12,993 --> 00:26:17,193
this one has a low concentration 
of lipids in its blood.

124
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:19,892
"The Mangalitsa pig.

125
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,431
"Originating from Hungary,

126
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:25,135
" they are often called
 'four-footed olive trees'

127
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:27,314
because they are fed
a strict diet of mostly acorns."

128
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:30,211
Yeah, but the pig's genetics
actually make Mangalitsa fat

129
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:33,330
more unsaturated
than normal pig fat.

130
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,412
-Says the meat is marbled.
-Yeah,

131
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:37,561
it's like the Kobe beef of pork.

132
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,299
It's all very fascinating,
but more importantly,

133
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,115
it's very expensive
and labor-intensive.

134
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:42,540
Which limits the number
of places

135
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,090
-you can get them.
-Exactly.

136
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,592
I need to track down where
 these guys are sold in the US.

137
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,659
If we find out who bought
the pig's blood,

138
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,478
we can find out
who our stem cell thieves are.

139
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,814
San Diego PD.

140
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,653
Agent Young.
What's up?

141
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:01,135
Okay, we'll be right there.

142
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,218
The pigs are
going to have to wait.

143
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:05,681
They found another body.

144
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:10,759
Any ideas
on exact cause of death?

145
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,730
She suffocated.

146
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:14,575
Just like her husband.

147
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:16,852
Look at this.
Her neck's swollen, too.

148
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:19,821
Yeah, at first we were thinking
an allergic reaction,

149
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,444
until we found this.

150
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,564
Rachel, these
are stem cells.

151
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,303
Must have shot them 
directly into her face.

152
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:32,749
In her face...

153
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:34,556
like Botox?

154
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:35,429
Yeah.

155
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:37,573
To regenerate the collagen,
the elastic fiber,

156
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,558
essentially, to...

157
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:41,702
give her baby skin.

158
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,482
Is that even possible?

159
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,946
Oh, yeah, if you kept it
subcutaneous, 

160
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:47,597
but she
went too deep.

161
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:50,558
The cells proliferated in the 
fatty tissue instead of the skin.

162
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:52,158
It created tumors.

163
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:54,229
See, on the face,
it's not a pretty sight.

164
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:55,637
But on the neck? It's
deadly.

165
00:27:55,637 --> 00:27:58,958
 Yup. The tumors got so large
 they obstructed her air passage,

166
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,338
suffocated her.

167
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:01,513
Rachel.

168
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:08,596
I'm finding it hard
to escape the conclusion

169
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:12,315
that Lowell Parks didn't really
care about fixing his heart.

170
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,081
?? about fixing his face.

171
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:17,244
This whole thing
was about vanity.

172
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:18,139
Well,
I'm not saying

173
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:20,163
it didn't start out as a way
of fixing his heart,

174
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,879
but by the end,
it was definitely more

175
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,733
about the cosmetic effect
it was having.

176
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,311
And then his wife
wanted in on it.

177
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:28,686
And who knows who else.

178
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:31,143
God, what people will do
to be beautiful.

179
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,269
Put staples
in their faces,

180
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:33,995
inject themselves with Botulism.

181
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:36,166
Yeah, well, what's funny is
I think there's a tendency

182
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,039
for people to think that we're
getting worse as a species...

183
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,469
but the fact is we've
always been this way.

184
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,044
Victorian women
would literally

185
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:46,294
tear hair from their heads
to give them higher foreheads.

186
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:47,131
There's tribes
in Africa

187
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:49,022
that would elongate their necks
using rings.

188
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:53,446
I mean, it's human nature to try
to perfect ourselves.

189
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:54,831
It's never going to change.

190
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,636
Okay, we need to get this
to the hospital

191
00:28:56,636 --> 00:28:58,686
-so they can test what's left. 
-Will do.

192
00:28:58,686 --> 00:28:59,541
Maybe we'll get lucky.

193
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,092
It'll turn out
to be Grace Dahl's.

194
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:02,767
Angie Parks--

195
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:05,252
she must've suspected her
husband died of this stuff,

196
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:06,732
and she used it anyway?

197
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:08,900
People know smoking gives them
lung cancer

198
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,364
and they still do it.

199
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:13,220
I'm more concerned about the people
on the other side of this.

200
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,660
They take the time,

201
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,695
they spend the money,
get their stem cells stored--

202
00:29:16,695 --> 00:29:19,462
and then when they need them to
save their life, they're gone.

203
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,397
I mean, that's murder,
isn't it?

204
00:29:21,397 --> 00:29:23,136
Negligent homicide, maybe.

205
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,632
No, Rachel.

206
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,451
Grace Dahl is dying
because these people--

207
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:28,971
 these selfish fools,

208
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:30,405
they think they found
the fountain of youth.

209
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:31,557
It's murder.

210
00:29:31,557 --> 00:29:33,964
Okay. I'm going to get this
to the hospital,

211
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:34,904
and then we need to find out

212
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:37,368
where Mangalitsa pigs are
 slaughtered on the West Coast.

213
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:38,888
Okay, I'll catch up
with you later.

214
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:40,347
Where are you going?

215
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:42,475
I'm going to try
and fix this mess.

216
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,110
And you guys are
the only ones

217
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,259
on the West Coast
who slaughter Mangalitsas?

218
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,168
That's right.

219
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:52,825
Most people find
the subject

220
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,643
of animal slaughter
to be unpleasant

221
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:56,264
but I got news for 'em:

222
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:58,542
no such thing
as a steak tree.

223
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:01,077
Uh, we can go in the
office, if you want.

224
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:02,636
It can get pretty
gruesome out here.

225
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:03,599
Trust me, I've seen worse.

226
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,839
So who's buying
the Mangalitsa pork?

227
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,435
Well, I know eight places
buy the meat.

228
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:11,090
Actually, I'm more concerned
with the blood.

229
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,292
Okay. Blood.

230
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:15,554
Um, most of it ends up with the 
mechanically  recovered meat.

231
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:18,055
-Which is?
- Cat food, primarily.

232
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:20,774
But there are a couple places
that buy the blood straight.

233
00:30:20,774 --> 00:30:23,197
Some people consider it
a delicacy.

234
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:26,088
Let's see...
a tapas bar in Chula Vista,

235
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:29,439
a Greek restaurant
over in Spring Valley.

236
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,565
Monticello Hills
down in La Jolla.

237
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,529
Wait a minute. The country club?

238
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:43,759
Mr. Dahl?
Mr. Richard Dahl?

239
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,167
-Yeah.
-Hi.

240
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,070
I'm sorry to disturb you.

241
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,492
I'm here on behalf
of your daughter, Grace.

242
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:49,453
She needs
your help...

243
00:30:49,453 --> 00:30:50,463
Who are you?

244
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:51,588
My name's Jacob Hood.

245
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,892
I work for the FBI.

246
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,459
I'm here on my
own time today,

247
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:55,582
but I hope you don't mind.

248
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:58,869
I had the agency look up
your address for me.

249
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:00,584
-I need to talk to you.
-Actually, I do mind.

250
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:03,689
Look, you don't understand
the situation.

251
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:07,595
I'm aware it's a very
complicated situation, Mr. Dahl.

252
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,420
But I'm here to tell you
your kids really need your help.

253
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,212
No.

254
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:11,848
No. They don't.

255
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:13,614
Those kids are better off
without me.

256
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:14,733
That much I know.

257
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,971
Grace has leukemia, Mr. Dahl.

258
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,131
She's dying.

259
00:31:20,354 --> 00:31:21,508
I didn't know.

260
00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:25,880
Sometimes I drive down there.

261
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:29,934
Sit in the laundromat across the
 street from their apartment.

262
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,479
They seemed okay.

263
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:38,005
I didn't even know
Brian had been sick.

264
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:40,060
Well,
Grace is now.

265
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,379
And you can keep her alive.

266
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:43,625
Me?

267
00:31:45,157 --> 00:31:46,305
How?

268
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:48,286
Your bone marrow.

269
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,565
I should never have left.

270
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:57,419
Once I did, I couldn't go back.

271
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,883
The past is the past.

272
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:03,017
It's what we do now
that matters.

273
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,119
Watch yourselves.

274
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,646
It gets pretty busy in here
right before dinner rush.

275
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:13,418
Well, we'll be quick.

276
00:32:13,418 --> 00:32:14,833
We just need to see
where the blood's kept.

277
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,170
Of course.
I'm glad I can help.

278
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,440
So pig's blood
is on the menu?

279
00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:21,152
No, but Highland
blood pudding is.

280
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:22,473
You say something's foreign

281
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,769
and suddenly it becomes
exotic, expensive.

282
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,376
A lot of things around here
seem to be about appearances.

283
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:29,443
Aren't these
the refrigerators?

284
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:31,747
Yes, but that's not where
the Mangalitsa's kept.

285
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:34,334
We had some trouble
with employee theft a while back

286
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:36,842
so we built another fridge
with a key card lock.

287
00:32:40,477 --> 00:32:42,906
The Mangalitsa's
to the right, and...

288
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:45,729
the blood is on the back shelf.

289
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:49,176
So, who exactly has
access to this place?

290
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,113
Just me.

291
00:32:53,492 --> 00:32:55,041
That did not just happen.

292
00:32:59,515 --> 00:33:03,590
Well, the good news is,
we know who the bad guy is.

293
00:33:07,144 --> 00:33:10,495
And the bad news is she just 
locked us in the damn fridge.

294
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:13,788
Well, we're not
going to starve.

295
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:15,668
No cell service? Great.

296
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:18,347
Should be some kind
of emergency release mechanism.

297
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:21,890
Rachel, you see this?

298
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:26,065
It's a double thermostat.

299
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:27,900
It's negative 100 degrees.
It's a deep freeze.

300
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,267
Perfect for storing stem cells.

301
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:32,448
It's empty.

302
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,878
She probably took them with her.

303
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:38,601
Okay. Yeah, help me
pull this out.

304
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:39,639
Why?

305
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:42,079
Protection.

306
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,471
Don't tell me.

307
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:44,846
You're going
to build some kind of bomb

308
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:46,503
with champagne and baking soda?

309
00:33:46,503 --> 00:33:48,381
Rachel, I'm a scientist.

310
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:49,548
I'm not MacGyver.

311
00:33:49,548 --> 00:33:51,428
Shoot the lock.

312
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:04,666
Out of the fridge
and into the fire.

313
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,482
Hey.

314
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:09,897
Wake up.

315
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,318
Hey.

316
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:15,301
So...guess what?

317
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:21,846
Dr.Hood,
he thinks he might find a match.

318
00:34:21,846 --> 00:34:23,548
Who?

319
00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:32,816
Dad?

320
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:37,473
It's gonna take a few days,

321
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:39,057
while I take the medication
to build up

322
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:43,243
enough bone marrow,
but the doctors are hopeful.

323
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:49,122
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go.

324
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:53,202
started with the doctor.

325
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,305
And, uh,

326
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:58,640
I didn't want to upset you.

327
00:34:59,817 --> 00:35:01,840
No. I should be upset,

328
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:03,693
but...

329
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:07,606
...stay for a minute.

330
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:09,529
Please?

331
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,249
This is Agent Young.
Issue a be-on-the-lookout.

332
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:17,536
?

333
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:18,958
Thanks.

334
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:22,813
Turns out Isabelle used to work
at a cord blood bank in Brazil.

335
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:25,278
Explains why she's so familiar
with stem cells.

336
00:35:25,278 --> 00:35:28,206
Maybe that wasn't the only thing
she was familiar with.

337
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:29,458
What?

338
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:30,992
You've got that look.

339
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:33,106
I like that look. What?

340
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:37,057
Well, didn't Dr. Davison say
that he had a sister company...

341
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:38,605
in Brazil?

342
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:40,230
That's a coincidence.

343
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,684
There's no such thing.

344
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,123
You didn't know that Pinot Noir has the
highest resveratrol content?

345
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,534
That's the only red wine
I drink anymore.

346
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:51,708
Does it have to go there?

347
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:54,611
Well, it's the best place
to hit the neural crest cells.

348
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,344
Neural what?

349
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:57,704
 Didn't Belle
explain it to you in the tutorial?

350
00:35:58,071 --> 00:36:00,113
They're migratory,
which means it's the fastest way

351
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:03,480
to get your entire body back
to its 20-year-old shape.

352
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,147
Oh. Well, I get that.

353
00:36:05,147 --> 00:36:06,763
Do me, Doc.

354
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:07,996
Niles.

355
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,009
 Isabelle

356
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:10,896
Good to see you. You can start
setting up in the next bedroom.

357
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:12,129
We've got lots
of people waiting.

358
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,952
We have to go. Now.

359
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:22,089
-Dad?
-Yeah. Hi.

360
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:26,314
Um... I need to...

361
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,650
I wanted to tell you myself.

362
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:34,968
What?

363
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:38,772
I'm not a match, Grace.
My...

364
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:42,146
My bone marrow
isn't going to work.

365
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,746
I'm so sorry.

366
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:51,639
I didn't want to fail you again.

367
00:36:54,903 --> 00:36:56,263
You didn't fail me.

368
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:01,512
You're here, Dad.

369
00:37:06,695 --> 00:37:08,439
Will you promise me something,
though?

370
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:10,654
Of course.

371
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:14,031
Take care of Brian for me.

372
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:20,072
Isabelle and Dr. Davison
are thieves?

373
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,204
But they seem so...
I mean, they look so...

374
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:23,276
Looks are deceiving.

375
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:25,005
We got to find them
quickly, Rachel.

376
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:27,321
If those stem cells defrost,
they're gonna be useless.

377
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:28,937
I put an APB
out on the car.

378
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:30,590
Hold on. Rachel.

379
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,250
Since she's not rich,

380
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,873
but if she works
in a place like this,

381
00:37:33,873 --> 00:37:36,572
which-- let's face it--
is all about appearances,

382
00:37:36,572 --> 00:37:38,257
she's gonna need a nice car.

383
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,153
A company car.

384
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:41,157
 Do your
cars have tracking devices?

385
00:37:41,157 --> 00:37:43,845
Yeah. My car has an OnWire
system, if that's what you mean.

386
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,926
We need an account number

387
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:47,543
and a password for
Isabelle Van Dyke's company car.

388
00:37:56,282 --> 00:37:58,281
-This is crazy.
-They know, Niles.

389
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:00,079
Yeah, about you,
not about me.

390
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,381
Yeah, you should leave the
country, I should go back,

391
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,713
and when this whole thing is
over, we can get it together.

392
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:05,072
They're FBI, Niles.

393
00:38:05,072 --> 00:38:06,190
It's not gonna take long

394
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,972
for them to connect the dots
once they're looking.

395
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:10,343
We just walked away
from another 200 grand.

396
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:10,912
You know that, right?

397
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:13,031
A lot of good
it'll do us in prison.

398
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,413
She's at Castle Park.

399
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:20,946
How many miles to
the Mexican border?

400
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,825
30. Maybe less.

401
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:24,962
Call the CHP,
tell them to set up

402
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:27,537
a roadblock on the southbound
side of the freeway.

403
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,497
There's cops up ahead.

404
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,665
-Damn it! 
-You need to calm down, Belle.

405
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:51,971
There's a roadblock.

406
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,755
All right, stop the car.

407
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:56,171
There's nowhere to go.

408
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:03,447
You're right.

409
00:39:22,914 --> 00:39:24,391
Rachel? What are you doing?

410
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:27,596
Rachel? 

411
00:39:29,107 --> 00:39:31,546
Relax. I've played chicken
before.

412
00:39:32,952 --> 00:39:35,023
You need to turn the car, Belle.
You're gonna kill us both!

413
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:37,239
-No.
-Oh, God!

414
00:39:58,568 --> 00:40:00,671
Three-and-oh. Perfect record.

415
00:40:04,823 --> 00:40:07,406
Out of the car!
Put your hands on your head!

416
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:08,875
Let's go.

417
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,804
You,too.

418
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:14,820
Get out now!

419
00:40:15,236 --> 00:40:16,306
On your knees.

420
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:27,441
Rachel?

421
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,714
Stem cells are here.

422
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,417
Let's hope
Grace's are in here, too.

423
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,372
Dr. Hood?

424
00:40:49,556 --> 00:40:50,473
Mr. Dahl.

425
00:40:50,473 --> 00:40:52,407
I want to thank you
for tracking me down.

426
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:56,083
I... I wish
I could have been more help.

427
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,299
Oh, you did plenty.

428
00:40:57,299 --> 00:40:58,650
You helped.

429
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,002
Probably more than you realize.

430
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,425
Uh, is she gonna be okay?

431
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,663
Well, all three vials of
her cord blood were recovered,

432
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:10,264
so she's got more
than a good chance.

433
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:14,663
They're about to take her in
for the transplant now, so...

434
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:15,760
Ok, thanks.

435
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:09,162
You know, once upon a time,

436
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,776
getting old
was a sign of wisdom,

437
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:13,770
something to be revered.

438
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:16,251
Now people kill to stay young.

439
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:16,875
Yeah.

440
00:42:17,687 --> 00:42:19,185
Can't think why.

441
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:21,039
Being young's
a pain in the ass.

442
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:24,715
Acne. Parents.

443
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:27,560
The prom.

444
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,518
I didn't go to my prom.

445
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:35,206
Really?

446
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,842
Find that
hard to believe.

447
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:41,466
I went to my prom.

448
00:42:42,808 --> 00:42:44,519
My date puked on me.

449
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,773
What color was your tux?

450
00:42:49,964 --> 00:42:52,011
Have to call it
a kind of peach.

451
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:54,596
Well, that explains it,
doesn't it?

452
00:42:55,214 --> 00:42:56,557
Yeah. Maybe.

453
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,853
Yeah, I guess people will always
try to turn back the clock.

454
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,151
You can't stop that.

455
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:09,486
I hate to break it to you,
but...

456
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:12,969
...we just did.

457
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:20,328
