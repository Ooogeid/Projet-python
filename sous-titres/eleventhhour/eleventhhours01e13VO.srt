00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,200
HIDALGO,TEXAS

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,400
Stop the truck!

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,700
Immigration! Pull over!

4
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,600
Immigration!
Freeze!

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,300
Freeze! You,stay where you are!

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,800
You got him?

7
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,900
LAREDO,TEXAS

8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,300
Dr. Brooks to Labor and Delivery.

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,700
Dr. Brooks to Labor and Delivery.

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,600
It's kind of eerie, i't it?

11
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,000
It's not eerie.

12
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
It's profound.

13
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,300
The chances of identical 
triplets is one in 200 million.

14
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,100
That's why we called you in,Dr. Hood.

15
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm Ray de la Pena,Special Agent with
 Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

16
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,800
Hi.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,300
Uh, this was supposed to be 
just another illegal alien bust.

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
And now it's what,stolen babies for sale?

19
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Well, that's what we thought.

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,000
Problem is,we have no missing persons or 
kidnapping reports on these particular infants.

21
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,300
Why is that, hmm?

22
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,900
Why is no one anywhere screaming out for you?

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,500
ere's no heartbroken mom out
in that hallway?

24
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,300
No distraught dad crying with relief?

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,200
Unless someone wants to keep the 
existence of these three babies a secret.

26
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,100
Not three babies,Agent Young.

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,300
Four.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,700
We found this diaper bag next to the truck.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,100
It was dropped by someone
 who wasn't apprehended in the raid,

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,200
 and inside it,we found these.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Identical quadruplets?

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm gonna have to run some tests.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Maintenance to Pedes ICU.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,200
I tested the nuclear DNA
of all three babies, Rachel.

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,100
Oh, it's a perfect match.

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,700
It's pretty much
what you'd expect from, um,

37
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,800
identical triplets
created from one fertilized embryo.

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,500
Created?

39
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,300
Then I did a similar test on
the mitochondrial DNA, 

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,500
the DNA material outside
the nucleus of the egg.

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,700
You know what I found?

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,600
These three babies have 
mitochondrial DNA from three...

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
different mothers.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm lost, guys.

45
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,700
Identical babies from three different mothers.

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,700
Isn't that impossible?

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,100
In nature,absolutely.

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,900
There's only one way identical nuclear DNA
can find its way 

49
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,900
into the eggs of three different mothers.

50
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,200
Somebody put it there.

51
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,000
Can one of you guys please tell
 me what the heck's going on here?

52
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,100
Agent de la Pena,what you picked
 up in your routine bust yesterday...

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,300
is three cloned babies.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Cloned?

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
Did you just say cloned?

56
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,900
A cloning operation this 
sophisticated can only mean one thing.

57
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,100
Geppetto

58
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,100
Hood, there's a fourth baby out there.

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,500
Who the hell is Geppetto?

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,000
Geppetto is the criminal alias
of a black market geneticist

61
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,900
which we tracked down a while back in Seattle.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
And this Geppetto got away?

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Rachel,we have to find this baby.

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
And when we do...

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,800
it's gonna lead us
directly to Geppetto.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,300
This is unmanned drone footage
of the raid on the truck.

70
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,000
Interviews from detainees confirm 

71
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,700
that the quadruplets were the
 only infants in this load of illegals,

72
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
and they were all with this
young couple right here.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,400
We'll get a Persons of Interest 
bulletin out on the two of them right away.

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,800
Yeah, well, while you're at it,

75
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,200
send out a public health bulletin
to hospitals and local health facilities.

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,500
This infant may need urgent care.

77
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,700
What makes you say that?

78
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,500
Well, clones of other species 
exhibit a lot of quite severe problems.

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,300
There's no reason
why humans should be different.

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Yeah, but the three that we recovered 
seemed to be healthy enough to me.

81
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,600
Yeah, so far.

82
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's just keep them under observation.

83
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,500
I mean, they could have pretty maj problems

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
if their, uh, DNA comes
from someone who's older.

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,000
How do you mean?

86
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,200
Well, it's kind of ke an old shoelace
that snaps each time you use it.

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,500
Um, doesn't matter
how many times you tie it up.

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,500
It's gonna keep on breaking.

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,500
These babies may be starting out with the
 human cellular equivalent of that old shoelace.

90
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,600
That's the reason why ethical scientists 
don't want to get involved in human cloning.

91
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,800
Among the items found in the smuggler's 
truck was a prepaid cell phone.

92
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,500
I had someone at NSA run a matrix on 
all the calls made by numbers dialed by that phone.

93
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,700
The phone called a number
in the Mexican port of Tampico.

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,400
That number made a few calls 
to a prison in Washington state,

95
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,200
where our old friend Lea Muller is doing time.

96
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
Lea Muller--

97
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,000
she connected to Geppetto?

98
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,500
One of her key operatives.

99
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,500
Geppetto is definitely back,Hood.

100
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,700
She never went away.

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,200
She's learned from her mistakes,

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,500
and this time,she's got it right.

103
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,300
I don't believe it.

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,100
What?

105
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,500
Lea Muller died last night.

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,800
ALICE,TEXAS

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,700
Neli.

108
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Oh, my God.

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,200
What are you doing here?

110
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,300
I came to see my sister.

111
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,700
Oh. Precisosa.

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,000
Last night,when Cristofer was asleep,

113
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,400
I was alone with her.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,700
The moon was so bright and clear,

115
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,400
so I named her Espy for Esperanza, 
'cause I have such hopes for her.

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,800
You can't keep this baby!

117
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,500
Esperanza. She has a na now.

118
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Cristofer, talk to her!

119
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,500
I think she's doing
the right thing.

120
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
No, No.

121
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,200
You must give this baby back
to the people you took it from.

122
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,200
I can't do that.

123
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,200
She's not yours!

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
Listen to me,Hermanita.

125
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,600
We both know some very bad people 
spent a lot of money to get this baby.

126
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,700
They will hurt you
to get it back.

127
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Don't you see?That's why
I can't let them have her.

128
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm going to save her from them.

129
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't want to bother you, 
but we have nowhere else to go.

130
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
We have no money.

131
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Get what you need.

132
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,000
For Esperanza?

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,100
For Esperanza.

134
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,500
His name is Val Tambor.

135
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,800
Those chocolates tested positive for cyanide.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,900
We're watching a murder in progress.

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,400
And here's the information
from Tambor's Nevada license.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,900
Wait a minute.

139
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,400
The Val Taor who came to 
visit Muller isn't the Val Tambor

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,100
whose photo  on file with the Nevada DMV.

141
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,800
Stolen ID. Original.

142
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,600
Well, at least now we know what he looks like.

143
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,500
Geppetto is planning something big.

144
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,000
And she's more than capable of covering her tracks.

145
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,000
Which means she'll kill anyone
who tries to stop her.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Carla. Hi.

147
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,200
Please.What do you want?

148
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,200
The baby.

149
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,100
Where is Neli?

150
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,200
I haven't seen her
since she went back home!

151
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,800
Oh. That why you tried
to shut the door on me?

152
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,100
No!

153
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,100
Come on. Come on.

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Shh, shh, shh,shh. Come on.

155
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Come on.Let's get up.

156
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
-No.
-me on.

157
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,100
I know. I know.I know.

158
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,900
Shh.

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,000
That hurt, didn't it, huh?

160
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,000
Just tell me
what I want to know.

161
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,800
I don't know
where my sister is.

162
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,100
That's the wrong answer,darling.

163
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,900
What's wrong?

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Shh. Shh, shh.

165
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,500
I know that man.
He works for them.

166
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,700
-No, no, no, no!
-Oh, my God, Carla!

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,900
No! No!

168
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,600
Ray, I've got something.

169
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,000
An anonymous witness called in a murder

170
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,800
involving the license plate of a car rented by 
whoever's using the Val Tambor identity

171
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,300
.

172
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,200
It's a live crime scene
not far from the border.

173
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,800
Geppetto's getting desperate...

174
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,600
And desperate people make mistakes.

175
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
So, our victim was a legal
resident in this country.

176
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
She had a job.
She paid her taxes.

177
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,400
This wld look like a burglary gone bad

178
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,600
 if it wasn't for the 
connection to Lea Muller's death.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,700
Yeah.

180
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,400
Detective,this might be your guy.

181
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,800
We think he's a hired killer.

182
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,100
Okay.

183
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,400
Look familiar?

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,900
That's our couple.

185
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,700
The patient's pain level
is at nine out of ten.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,300
The prognosis,pending blood analysis,
is at ree weeks to six months of life.

187
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,000
The patient understands this
and is prepared to pursue treatment.

188
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
It's me, Geppetto.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,100
How sweet of you to call.

190
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,800
We've been missing you.

191
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,800
The sister won't be a problem anymore.

192
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,000
Did she have any information for you?

193
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,700
She was tough,but I'm right 
behind the nanny and the missing baby.

194
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,400
They're on foot,

195
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,900
and there's only so many places
to hole up in on this road.

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, we're ready here.

197
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,100
Don't hesitate to call ??

198
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,600
And hurry.

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
The patient is running out of time.

200
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,700
Understood.

201
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,400
Did you know that I passed
Phase 1 testing to get hired at the Bureau?

202
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,400
??

203
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Let me guess.

204
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,900
You want me to tell you how I passed 
Phase 2 of my FBI recruitment test?

205
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,400
You just read my mind.

206
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,200
??

207
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,200
Any luck finding out who
the couple in the picture were?

208
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,800
??... yeah.

209
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,900
The woman's name is Neli Gamarro.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
She's our victim's sister.

211
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
Turns out she had a job
here in the US as a nanny 

212
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,800
until she was deported two 
years ago for overstaying her visa.

213
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,500
Well, Geppetto's network 

214
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,400
tends to use very young, very vulnerable
 women as egg donors,surrogate mothers--

215
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,600
women who have no idea what
they're getting involved in.

216
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,000
So our Neli is running for her life,

217
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
trying to make a break
from Geppetto's organization,

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,100
along with the babies.

219
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,800
Yeah.

220
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,000
Explains why they ended up
in the smuggler's truck.

221
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,100
Financial tracking checked out Carla Gamarro's
 purchases over the last couple days.

222
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,300
Any idea why a single woman
would spend $280 on baby gear?

223
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,900
What was Carla's time of death?

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
Roughly 2:00 P.M. yesterday.

225
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,100
Then what was she doing using the same card 

226
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,400
on a motel room 40 miles up the road
last night at 8:00 P.M.?

227
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,200
Which room?

228
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,000
Same credit card paid for a
pizza to be delivered to room 5.

229
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,600
Well, let's check it out.

230
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,600
We'll go in the front door.

231
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,600
You watch the window
in the back.

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,600
You got it.

233
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,300
-Hood.
-Yeah.

234
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,200
The door's open.

235
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,200
Looks like whoever was here
is gone now.

236
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,800
They definitely left in a hurry.

237
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Get out of my way.

238
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,900
Get out of my way.

239
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,200
Get down.

240
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,800
-Get down!
-Okay.

241
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,700
Federal agent!
Freeze!

242
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,600
Ray, look out!

243
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,100
Get out of the car!

244
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,000
-Get out!
-Oh, God!

245
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,000
??

246
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,300
-Get out.
-Get down.FBI.

247
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,500
damn it!

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,900
You guys okay?

249
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,100
Very funny.

250
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,600
You do realize this is really going
to help your application at the Bureau?

251
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,600
Take it easy, Ray.

252
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,400
Well, I managed to bleed our bad guy.

253
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,200
We got a sample from
where he hit the bathroom wall.

254
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,100
We'll run it
through the NCIC's database.

255
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,800
Could have been you in there.

256
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,900
You don't get rid of me that easy.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,400
Agent Young, I'm popping the trunk.

258
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,400
What do we got?

259
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, our bad boy's
definitely an assassin.

260
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,800
This is even more interesting.

261
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,400
We're looking at the contents of
 Carla Gamarro's medicine cabinet,

262
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
cleaned out by her killer.

263
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,300
Look at this Injectable vials of
Pergonal and Lupron.

264
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,400
-Fertility medicine?
-Yeah.

265
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,800
It's used to increase egg
production during ovulation.

266
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
For egg harvesting?

267
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,100
There's no pharmacy labels,

268
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,900
which is kind of unusual
for compounds like this,

269
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,100
 but from the expiration date,

270
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,700
I'd say she had them about a year.

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,900
-It's the right time frame to make Carla eligible to be an egg donor.
-Yeah.

272
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,900
She must have been involved in 
the cloning operation with her sister Neli.

273
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,500
He cleaned out her medicine cabinet
to hide her role in the whole thing.

274
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,500
First Geppetto takes her eggs,
then she takes her life.

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,200
I'd say she's definitely after our
 missing baby and whoever's with her.

276
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,900
Yeah, and I don't think this missing
 tool kit's going to slow him down much.

277
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,600
We got to find Neli
before he does.

278
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,000
GOLIAD,TEXAS

279
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,500
Thank you for the ride.

280
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,100
I wish we could pay you.

281
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,100
You sure you want to get off here?

282
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I could take you guys to the doctor.

283
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Baby doesn't sound too good.

284
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,200
Thank you.

285
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,500
Neli, come on.

286
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,100
He's right,Cristofer.

287
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
Espy isn't doing well.

288
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,600
She's got a fever and she refuses to eat.

289
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,600
These people are after us,they're just waiting
 for us to slow down,or make a mistake.

290
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,000
If she dies it will be our fault.

291
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,700
Our fault!

292
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,700
I'm walking back Carla
Gamarro's financials.

293
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,900
How does this sound:

294
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,100
two wire transfers totaling $6,000
from an account in the Cayman Islands?

295
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,500
Yeah, that's in the ballpark
for a paid egg donor.

296
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,600
The account is held by Jennifer
 Hammer of Houston,age 38 and single.

297
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,200
Could be infertile,feeling lonely

298
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,900
and for a shortc to a child.

299
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
So adopt.

300
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,000
??

301
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,000
straight-up narcissists,looking 
to replicate themsves at any expense.

302
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Why would you even think
of cloning yourself?

303
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
That's twice as many problems.

304
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
I guess some people just can't
get enough of themselves.

305
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
Hey, what is it?

306
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,500
Hmm?

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
Is something bothering you,Hood?

308
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
No, I'm fine.

309
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,900
??

310
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,300
??

311
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,300
??

312
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,300
Sorry to bother you...
-??

313
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,300
...but you are a nurse,no?

314
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes.

315
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
My baby girl needs help.

316
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,100
We have no money.

317
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,600
We can't go to the hospital.

318
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,100
Uh, yeah?

319
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,500
Uh... I could get
in so much trouble for this.

320
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,200
Please?

321
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
She has a fever.

322
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know exactly how high.

323
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
Her throat is inflamed and 
there's congtion in the lungs.

324
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
It's definitely an infection.

325
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,100
Now, if it keeps up,
you'll need antibiotics,

326
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
 but right now she needs flds.

327
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,900
Just use a medicine dropper and
 squirt a little in her mouth every few minutes,

328
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
and give her something to help with the fever.

329
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you.

330
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,200
Well, if you do that,you'll be 
doing everything we'd do in a hospital.

331
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,100
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

332
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
And if she gets sicker,
you need to take her to an emergency room.

333
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,700
Promise me you'l do that.

334
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,900
I promise.

335
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,500
Gracias...gracias.

336
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,200
Carla Gamarro's test results confirm that
 she was an egg donor for one of the clones.

337
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,600
That means Jennifer Hammer's payment to 
Carla links her directly to Geppetto's operation.

338
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,300
That'll make it easy to get a court 
order to test her DNA,if it comes to that.

339
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,200
Right.

340
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,700
Geppetto, it's me.

341
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,800
Had a little setback
involving some federal agents.

342
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,300
Jacob Hood was there.

343
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,800
Really?

344
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,700
Well, Jacob Hood is
a very stubborn individual.

345
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,000
I could have had him.

346
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,000
Our security is still
very tight here.

347
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,900
We're just waiting for word from
you that you have the child.

348
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,800
You may have to maintain
a little longer on your end.

349
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,500
My patient may not have
much time left.

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,800
I've been in touch
with my sources in Mexico.

351
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,700
Neli's boyfriend h a cousin who's 
a construction foreman in Victoria, Texas.

352
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,700
He may be their next attempt at sanctuary.

353
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
I don't see that working out too well for them.

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,800
Next time you bump into Jacob Hood,

355
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,900
I'd consider it a personal favor
if you'd take care of him.

356
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,900
Dr. Hood, Agent Young,
I'm Jennifer Hammer.

357
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
It's nice to meet you.

358
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,200
Thanks for agreeing to talk with us.

359
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,800
Can I ask:is that your mother?

360
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,600
-Yes, it is.
-A very striking woman.

361
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,300
With a personality to match.

362
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,200
Oh, really?

363
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
She's still alive?

364
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,400
Yes, uh, but she's been ill.

365
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,600
I am lucky enough to have full-time 
care for her, so she's here with me.

366
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,400
Still,still I know that must be very hard for you.

367
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,600
Not as hard as it is for her.

368
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,100
Well, I'm surprised the FBI is 
interested in where we keep our money.

369
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,900
Offshore accounts are hardly financial exotica.

370
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
My family has investments
in many parts of the world.

371
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,500
The Cayman Islands is a 
well-known flag of convenience.

372
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,000
And a well-known tax shelter.

373
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I thought you were with the FBI,not the ??

374
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
We're kind of one big family
called the government.

375
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,500
I need to ask you about two specific
 transactions you made last year:

376
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,600
wire transfers to the account 
of a woman named Carla Gamarro.

377
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,400
Offhand, I don't recall
any such transfer.

378
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,900
But I can have my accountant
look into the notation of that payment.

379
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Would it help your memory if 
I told you that Car was murdered yesterday? 

380
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,300
Probably to keep her quiet about being an egg donor.

381
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,300
That's what you paid her for,isn't it?

382
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,300
-Egg donor?
-Yeah.

383
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
The thing is,we're 
really not interested in you.

384
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,900
We're after the people
who actually did the cloning.

385
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
It'll help this all go away 

386
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,500
if you tell us everything you know 
about a scientist known as Geppetto.

387
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
"Geppetto"?

388
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,500
As in the Pinocchio story?

389
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,600
No, as in the story of a woman
 who paid to have herself cloned.

390
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,500
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

391
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,900
Big mistake, Ms. Hammer.

392
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,900
Maybe.

393
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,500
Maybe not.

394
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,900
Doesn't really matter.

395
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,000
What do you mean?

396
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,300
Well, we found out verything we 
needed to know the moment we came in.

397
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Jennifer's eyes are a very nice shade of brown.

398
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,100
And her baby's eyes are blue.

399
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,700
They're six months old,
so they'll stay that way.

400
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Um, that means they couldn't 
have come from Ms. Hammer's DNA.

401
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,600
Your mother's eyes are blue.

402
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,200
FBI, did you say you were?

403
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,100
That's right.

404
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
Offhand, I'd say
you don't have the build.

405
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,400
Your neck
isn't thick enough.

406
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
But you'll do in a pinch.

407
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,100
Oh, yes, you'll do.

408
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,200
Thank you.

409
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,200
You don't have to answer
any of their questions, Mom.

410
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,200
First of all,you call me "Pete."
That's my name.

411
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,500
Second of all,try and shut me up.

412
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,200
I don't get many visitors
and those that do come,

413
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,700
I catch looking at their watches
as soon as they sit down.

414
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
-Sick old broad, that's me.
-Mom...

415
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,000
What can you tell us about your illness?

416
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,000
Well, it's no secret I'm dying.

417
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
Cirrhosis of the liver.

418
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,000
In my case it's caused by
 viral hepatitis, not boozing.

419
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,100
I'm not saying I won't take
a drink now and then.

420
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,000
How about you, sweetie?

421
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,900
I like a glass of Italian red.

422
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,100
Or three.

423
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,200
I hear that, honey.

424
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
My daughter here,

425
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,600
she seems to think I have
a good chance at a transplant.

426
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,300
I let her think so,
but I read the list every day.

427
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,400
I'm way too old and that
doesn't make me a priority.

428
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,400
What would you say, Pete,

429
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,400
if someone were to tell you they 
could grow you a whole new liver?

430
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,400
One  that would kind of neatly sidestep the 
main problem with organ transplants,

431
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
tissue rejection?

432
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,000
Your body would accept it more readily 

433
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,200
because essentially,the organ would be
genetically identical to your own tissue.

434
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,100
What would that be worth?

435
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,700
You couldn't put a price on it.

436
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,600
Well, right now,the state of the art doesn't really 
allow us to grow a whole organ in the laboratory.

437
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,100
We still need the protective system
of the human body for that.

438
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
So, it can't be done?

439
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,300
Oh, it can be done.
Yeah, has been.

440
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,400
If you need a particular human 
organ with a specific DNA pattern,

441
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,400
it is now possible to grow a 
whole person just for the body part.

442
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,000
And that's what we believe
your daughter has done.

443
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,700
See, right now, we have three little babies

444
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,800
who we believe were cloned
 with your daughter's help

445
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,400
in order to ow an organ 
to help her beloved mother.

446
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,300
I am going to call
our attorneys right now.

447
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,100
So...

448
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,100
You're saying Jennifer
committed a crime?

449
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,600
Well, the problem is, uh,
cloned babies are people.

450
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,400
No matter what their origin.

451
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,500
And some organs can't be removed
without killing a person.

452
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
If you remove the organ,
in order to put it into someone else,

453
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,500
the donor is going to die.

454
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,300
And that, last time I checked,was murder.

455
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,200
You leave.

456
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,300
I want to talk to Dr. Hood in private.

457
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,800
Now.

458
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,800
It's my fault, Dr. Hood.

459
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm responsible for everything.

460
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,600
For the cloning.

461
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,500
Everything,whatever.

462
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,000
I'll shoulder the blame for any
 and all crimes committed.

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,500
Well, supposing we could
accept your confession...

464
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,700
How can you help us?

465
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,900
How about a name?

466
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
We're listening.

467
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,000
GenVictus.

468
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,100
A company our family suddenly made 
a very large investment in a year ago.

469
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
Jennifer probably thought
I didn't notice.

470
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,300
I was wondering when I saw it,
and now I know the reason.

471
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,800
I want you to know,

472
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,800
I would never endanger the life
 of anyone,particularly a child.

473
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,400
It certainly wouldn't
be the first time

474
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,600
I'd known someone go to extraordinary 
lengths to help someone they love.

475
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,900
I'm sorry for you, Dr. Hood.

476
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,600
Me? Why?

477
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
??

478
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,500
??

479
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,800
We're an industrial
agricultural cloning company.

480
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,500
We clone a dozen animals a week here.

481
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,900
This is one
of our two-year-olds.

482
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Gaining weight nicely.

483
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,300
You plan on growing the next 
Triple Crown winner in a laboratory?

484
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
No, the last one.

485
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,500
The last five, actually.

486
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,900
We have an extensive library of genetic 
material from prizewinning stallions and mares.

487
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,300
We only clone prov winners who are 
already profitable semen donors and broodmares.

488
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,600
Seems like it's working out
for you, Mr. Price.

489
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,500
Well, a single stud fee can go
for tens of thousands of dollars.

490
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,700
It only makes sense to create 
a brand-new, genetically identical animal,

491
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,800
after the original can't 
produce any more equine joy juice.

492
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,200
We, uh, charge a fee for cloning
and then take a royay on ery successful mating.

493
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,900
And it's not just horses.

494
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,100
We're working on cloning
our sixth species here.

495
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
-And it's all legal?
-According to the FDA.

496
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,500
Your clones have an unusually low rate of defects.

497
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,700
What's your solution to that problem?

498
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,600
Well, that's a bit oa
"secret sauce" question.

499
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,400
We call it the Pinocchio Effect.

500
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
Let me guess:

501
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,400
you've found a way
to lengthen the telomeres the way, 

502
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,600
uh, lying lengthened Pinocchio's nose?

503
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,200
You seem to know your way
around DNA, Dr. Hood.

504
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
Yes, that's exactly
what we've done.

505
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Every time a telomere 
divides,a little bit breaks off

506
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,900
and that means there's a little bit
 less the next time it reproduces.

507
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, it's part of the
natural aging process.

508
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,000
Doesn't have to be natural forever.

509
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,300
Well, I'd certainly be interested in
 knowing how you developed that technique.

510
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,100
Uh, it was before my time.

511
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,100
Hmm.

512
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Ever hear of a scientist
who uses the name "Geppetto?"

513
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,900
That's a funny name for a scientist.

514
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,300
Quite a coincidence,

515
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,600
given the name of the technique
responsible for your company's success.

516
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,100
You know, I'm sure our
legal department would tell me

517
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,900
that we're getting into the area
of proprietary information here.

518
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,100
Jennifer Hammer placed a great
 deal of money with your company.

519
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,100
Can you tell us why?

520
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,200
Have you done any
genetic work for her?

521
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,100
Our lawyers gave me very specific instructions
on what to say and what not to say.

522
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,000
So, again, that information is not
 at my discretion to disclose. I'm sorry.

523
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,700
Not as sorry as you'll be
when we come back with a subpoena.

524
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,800
You notice you mention 
Geppetto and people clam up?

525
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,800
Whether it's to protect 
themselves or protect their profits.

526
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,700
Or both at the same time.

527
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,700
Hood, I've located
the Pinocchio patent.

528
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,600
The name on the application
is a "Dr. Miranda Cochran."

529
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Tracing her yields
only a few biographical facts.

530
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,700
Dates on her undergradand doct 
at Massachusetts Academy of Technology,

531
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,700
but not much more.

532
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,300
She added an MD at Los Angeles University,

533
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,000
and then she just disappears.

534
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,200
Falls off the grid entirely.

535
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,200
It doesn't add up.

536
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,700
Anybody who invented something so promising

537
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,200
should have a massive trail of 
articles in the scientific press. 

538
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,400
I'll contact the school.

539
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,400
See if they have a picture of her.

540
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Ya, ya,it's okay.

541
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
It's okay. It's okay.

542
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,100
Hood, the academy sent us a freshman
 yearbook image of Miranda Cochran.

543
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm gonna age her
up to her 50s.

544
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,800
Rachel,that's her.

545
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,800
Miranda Cochran is Geppetto.

546
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,800
Federal Building
Houston,Texas

547
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

548
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,300
today the FBI officially announces 
an addition to the Ten Most Wanted List:

549
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,400
Dr. Miranda Cochran,AKA "Geppetto,"

550
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,400
has been identified as the head
of a criminal enterprise

551
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,700
and involved in at least
three murders in two states.

552
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,400
She is also wanted for
wire fraud, money laundering

553
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,800
and repeatedly violating FDA regulations regarding
 scientific experimentation on human subjects.

554
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,500
The FBI has instituted
a $50,000 reward for any information

555
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,700
leading to the capture of Miranda Cochran.

556
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,300
 Now, I'll take any questions you have.

557
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,800
We're not gonna be able
 maintain much longer.

558
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,600
And if we can't maintain,
you can't get paid.

559
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Relax. This is your
last call, Geppetto.

560
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,500
It'll all be over
in a few hours.

561
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
My patient is ready.

562
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,300
Just make sure she has my final payment.

563
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm kind of a stickler about that.

564
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,300
Cristofer.Hey,where are you,bro?

565
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,500
Relax.

566
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,800
I'll come pick you up,no problem.

567
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Just tell me when and where.

568
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,500
Okay.

569
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,600
Well, you should be happy.

570
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,500
Most agents work their whole 
career for a Ten Most Wanted case.

571
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,100
Well, I'm not
really an agent,

572
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,000
so I don't care about stuff
like that so much.

573
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,800
What's on your mind, Hood?

574
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,900
And don't say "Nothing."

575
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,900
When I was, um,

576
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,800
holding that child,

577
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,500
that cloned child--

578
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,700
I had a feeling for a second
what it must be like to be Geppetto.

579
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,000
Godlike.

580
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
And it made me dizzy.

581
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,700
I mean, if this is really
where we're headed,

582
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,900
if, if we're really going
to be playing God,

583
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,600
then I don't want a part of it.

584
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,300
I mean, there have
to be boundaries.

585
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,500
Have to be.

586
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,100
There's just going to be
moral chaos out there.

587
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,000
Hopefully the Bureau making
this public will help.

588
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,100
You know a lot of cases are still solved
average caring citizens making a call.

589
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,600
So...

590
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,400
we wait.

591
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
??

592
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
-Where's Rudy?
-I don't know.

593
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,200
He said he would be here.

594
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,800
Shh.oh,it's okay.

595
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,000
It's okay.
It's okay.

596
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,900
You'll feel better soon.

597
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,200
Uh, Crtofer!

598
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,400
What is it?
What's the matter?

599
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,300
She's getting worse.
She's burning up.

600
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,500
We need help!

601
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,100
?? several tips linking this hotel room 

602
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,400
seven blocks from here to our
 Ten Most Wanted felon,Miranda Cochran.

603
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,700
Subject is in her late 50s
and incredibly creative at evading capture.

604
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,100
She's had practice.

605
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,100
??

606
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,700
??
in the last week and a strong short punch.

607
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,900
Any questions?

608
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,600
-No.
-No.

609
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,000
All right,let's check com links
before we mount up.

610
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,800
-FBI!
-FBI!

611
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,000
FBI.

612
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,200
-Clear.
-Clear.

613
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,000
Clear.

614
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,000
Clear!

615
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,200
We have somebody who saw her kind of wait in line
at the service elevator in the last half hour.

616
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,600
-Okay.??
-all right.

617
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,800
She beat us again.

618
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
She left in a hurry.

619
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,400
Look.

620
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,300
These drugs tell a story,Rachel.

621
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,800
Cytokine inhibitors.

622
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Anti-tumor necrosis factor.

623
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Insulin.

624
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,800
What are they used for?

625
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,000
Well, taken together,

626
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,500
they tell me that Geppetto's patient's 
suffering from a form of pancreatitis.

627
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
Not liver disease like Pete Hammer.

628
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,800
And with pancreatitis,the body's 
digestive juices attack the organ.

629
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,800
It's very painful,normally fatal.

630
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
There's only one cure.

631
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
Let me guess.

632
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,200
A new pancreas.

633
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,200
Makes perfect sense.

634
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,800
I mean, you can transplant a pancreas
from a child to an adult fairly easily.

635
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,400
There's a possibility that Geppetto was planning
to use more than one organ at the same time.

636
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,400
Explains the number of, uh, donors.

637
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,800
Hood.

638
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,900
You can't live without a pancreas, right?

639
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,600
No.

640
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,800
Not a chance.

641
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Help us!

642
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,900
-Please!
-What's the matter?

643
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,900
She's burning up.

644
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,100
-Is she going to be okay?
-We're doing everything we can.Excuse me.

645
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,900
Es mi prim Rudy.

646
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,900
FBI hotline.May I help you?

647
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,300
Hood, I just got a hit
off your health alert.

648
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
It's from a hospital
less than 20 minutes from here.

649
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,300
Our baby showed up in the ER.

650
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,600
 Hola, Cristofer.

651
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,500
Ah, ah, ah.

652
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Don't be stupid.

653
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,200
You're gonna take me
to that baby.

654
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,400
Or I'll blow a hole in your belly
big enough to pass a burrito through.

655
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Fancy running into you here, Wayne Swafford.

656
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,300
Yeah, that's right.

657
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,700
We ID'd you from a little 
blood smearing left behind

658
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,000
when you sucker-punched me.

659
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Did you know Wayne,

660
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,400
that in Texas they execute more
murderers than any other state?

661
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,500
Help us nail Geppetto and I'll
 make sure that doesn't happen to you.

662
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,100
You're gonna let me go?

663
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,200
After a long-?? 
prison sentence... of course.

664
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
-Do you have the child?
-I've got her.

665
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,200
We're en route to your locale.

666
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
She's perfect.

667
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,200
You know she wanted me to kill you.

668
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,600
Well, I must be doing
something right.

669
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,000
FBI! Nobody move!

670
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,200
You can wake up now.

671
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,200
It's all over.

672
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,900
Is it done?

673
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,600
Yeah, I'd say it's done.

674
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,900
This time you were the patient.

675
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,700
Miranda.

676
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
So...

677
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,900
...you cloned those
babies for yourself.

678
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,300
Alys the savior.

679
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,700
Jacob Hood.

680
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,300
Would you mind calling me Dr. Hood?

681
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,300
I don't really know you.

682
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,600
By the way,the baby...

683
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,900
she's safe.

684
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,600
She's with her mother.

685
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,700
You would sacrifice a talent
 like mine for a cloned infant.

686
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,300
She has a name:Esperanza.

687
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,000
And, yes, I'd sacrifice
your talent for an insect.

688
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I create life.

689
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,700
Only so you can destroy it.

690
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,000
I could teach you everything
I know, if you help me.

691
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,100
That's quite an offer,Geppetto.

692
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:24,900
But, um...

693
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm going to have to say no.

694
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,500
You see,unlike you...

695
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,100
I have a soft spot
for human beings.

696
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,100
You're a coward, Dr. Hood!

697
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,700
You play at being a good man.

698
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,500
But you'll never be great.

699
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,200
I can live with that.

700
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,800
Miranda Cochran...

701
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,900
...AKA Geppetto,

702
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,200
you are under arrest.

703
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,400
How is she doing?

704
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,800
She has none of the genetic 
problems you were worried about.

705
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,100
What she does have
is a very bad case of the flu.

706
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,300
Her seizures were
febrile seizures--

707
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,500
very scary,but also fairly 
common in babies with high fevers.

708
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,800
If it hadn't been for the care 
she received from these young people,

709
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,000
it could have been a lot worse.

710
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,100
Your three baby sisters
are doing just fine, too.

711
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
And we're finding
very good homes for them.

712
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,100
So something good come did come
out of Geppetto's work.

713
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,900
You do realize she's a very
special baby, don't you?

714
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,900
I know I broke the law,

715
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,200
but I also know I did the right thing.

716
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,800
I mean look at her.

717
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,700
She's alive.

718
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
And she's safe.

719
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,900
Oh, by the way,

720
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,300
um, apparently,it turns out catching a Top 
Ten Most Wanted Felon's some kind of big deal.

721
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,700
You both helped with that,

722
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,100
so thanks to the FBI,

723
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,300
your, um, immigration and your adoption 
papers are not going to be a problem.

724
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,100
So you're going to be able to stay here,

725
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,500
all three of you as a family.

726
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,400
Is that okay?

727
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,500
Mm-hmm.

728
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
