1
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,330
Help,please!

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,530
We're in here!

3
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,330
Help,please!

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,930
It's my mom,my dad and my brother.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,700
I got the kid.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,600
- Seizing. Diaphoretic.  - I don't know what happened.

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,900
Are they going to be okay?

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,500
What's wrong?

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,900
Paralysis. I'll go back for the traction board.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,000
There's no time. The kid just stopped breathing.

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,660
He's cyanotic,we got to tube him.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,260
- You have to help them,please!  - Both breathing.

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,700
Come on now,son.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,130
We're losing him.

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,160
Dr. Hood.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,960
I'm Wallace Bennett,

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,160
Chief of the Major Investigations Division.

18
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,460
I'm heading the Go Team on this case.

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,930
I put in a call to the FBI director to thank him

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,360
for sending you over here on such short notice.

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,900
My people have been over operations,

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,060
structures,power plants,

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,760
systems and human performance,

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,800
but so far,we've got nothing.

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,300
We also did a full battery of chemical testing

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,630
for explosive residue.

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,000
Results negative across the board.

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,400
We keep mining the same data,but there's something

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,300
we're missing here and I...

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,060
...over and over.

31
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,800
Over and over..

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,560
Dr. Hood,we need something...

33
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,430
Dr. Hood?

34
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,030
Dr. Hood?

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,660
Did you hear a word I just said?

36
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,630
Ice cream.

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,230
Excuse me?

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,730
Do you have ice cream?

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,160
And a hot plate.

40
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,460
Vanilla.

41
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,460
Dr. Hood,what the hell is this all about?

42
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,660
The landing gear on this

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,630
aircraft is directly adjacent

44
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,300
to the engine,right?

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
- That's where they tend to put it.  - So...

46
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,430
after a long flight,it's going to get very hot.

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,800
So... you bring my entire investigation

48
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,830
to a halt just to tell my people that engines get hot?

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,800
On the night the plane crashed,the temperature

50
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,660
on the ground was minus 20 Celsius.

51
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,930
That is way below freezing.

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,130
Thermal shock fracture.

53
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,860
Yup.

54
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,360
We tested the hydraulics in the landing gear for extremes,

55
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,500
but not for rapid temperature change.

56
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,030
I don't suppose the NTSB could help me get a new watch?

57
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,630
I'll give you my damn Rolex.

58
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,900
Oh,that won't be necessary.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,000
Dr. Hood's employers at the FBI are perfectly capable

60
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,560
of reimbursing him

61
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,760
for any expenses and/or...

62
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,330
personal items damaged during the course of an investigation.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
Mr. Bennett,

64
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,330
this is Special Agent Rachel Young,my,um...

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,230
I'm his FBI handler.

66
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,700
And we've got somewhere else to be.

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,700
Sir.

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,200
A family in San Jose,California ate breakfast

69
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,830
- approximately 36 hours ago.  - And?

70
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,030
And they've been paralyzed ever since.

71
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,260
EMT has brought them in as a triple case of spinal trauma,

72
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,630
but we ruled that out right away.

73
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,900
We did a tox screen for botulism and Lyme disease,

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,630
spinal taps for meningitis.

75
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,530
Negative on all counts.

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,930
It has to be poisoning of some kind.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Wrinkle is the daughter ate the same breakfast

78
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,200
as the rest of the family,continues to be asymptomatic.

79
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,830
Are you Jacob Hood with the Bureau?

80
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,400
He is. And you are?

81
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,660
I'm Agent Morris,FDA.

82
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,660
This is my colleague Agent Wilson with the CDC.

83
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,760
We both requested you. Thanks for coming in so quickly.

84
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,860
Heard about your work on the hantavirus case last March.

85
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,100
I'd like to hear about your work here,earlier today.

86
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,660
We screened and catalogued

87
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,100
the stomach content on all three victims,

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,900
plus the asymptomatic daughter.

89
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,400
No toxins or bacteria known to lead to paralysis.

90
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,860
The CDC's primary

91
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,900
objective is to keep this thing from spreading,

92
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
while we at the FDA are mainly concerned

93
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,060
with the safety of the food chain.

94
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,400
But frankly...

95
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,430
We're stumped.

96
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,330
Where's the daughter?

97
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,700
Emily Stanner,16 years old.

98
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,100
She's in with the police right now.

99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,860
They think she did this?

100
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,160
Well,they don't know what to think.

101
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,960
But,you know there's a case in New Jersey a couple of years back...

102
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,460
a teenage kid put antifreeze in his parents' iced tea.

103
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,700
Turned out he was pissed off about being grounded.

104
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,630
Listen,Emily,the truth is,

105
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,100
lots of kids get angry at their parents.

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,230
Look... if your folks

107
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,760
are mistreating you or abusing you,

108
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,630
mentally,emotionally... even physically,

109
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200
it could count in your favor.

110
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,000
Tell me the truth about everything you know,

111
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,060
and it could go a long way towards

112
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,530
helping you out in court later.

113
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,830
Excuse me,uh,but we're busy here,

114
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,360
if you don't mind,huh?

115
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,160
I do mind. You shouldn't be in the same room with this patient,

116
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,130
not without adequate protection.

117
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,000
What do you mean," protection" ?

118
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,160
She's carrying

119
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,730
type 5 C-vector airborne virus.

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,160
It's highly contagious,no known cure.

121
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,660
Really,no one mentioned this to you?

122
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,500
It's okay,

123
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,030
as long as you've had no physical contact,

124
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,700
it should be fine.

125
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,060
Don't go anywhere.

126
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,730
I'm going to look into this.

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,260
Don't worry... there's no such thing as a type 5 c-vector.

128
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,430
I said that to scare

129
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,030
them off so I could talk to you in private.

130
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,830
My name's Jacob Hood.

131
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,830
I'm kind of the science guy for the FBI.

132
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,860
My family... are they going to be okay?

133
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,360
Is the same thing gonna happen to me?

134
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,100
I don't know.

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
That's what I'm here to find out.

136
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,260
The police,they think that...

137
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,700
I didn't do anything

138
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,330
to my mom,my dad or my little brother.

139
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,560
I know.

140
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,630
You do?

141
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,360
Yeah.

142
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,130
The forensic pathologists,they've been over

143
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,730
your house with a fine-toothed comb to find

144
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,130
anything that would've caused your family's paralysis.

145
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,530
So if you're a poisoner,you're a very good one.

146
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,160
And I've seen your high school transcripts,

147
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,930
and Chemistry,well,you failed it,twice.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
So I don't think you're too much of a threat.

149
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,630
What I want to know is,is there anything

150
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,600
you can remember that you did differently

151
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,030
from your family yesterday morning?

152
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,400
Anything at all?

153
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,800
No.

154
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,030
All we did was eat breakfast.

155
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,960
Just breakfast.

156
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,200
We've already got forensics.

157
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,130
Want to tell me again why we're here?

158
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,060
Any idea,Rachel,how many

159
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,800
seemingly innocuous household ingredients

160
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,930
could actually kill you?

161
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Air freshener?

162
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,960
Smells good.

163
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,800
Key ingredient: formaldehyde.

164
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,630
Could cause headaches,

165
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,230
nausea,nosebleeds,

166
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,400
dizziness,memory loss...

167
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,400
Margarine?

168
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,100
What's poisonous about margarine?

169
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,200
The benzoic acid.

170
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Fatally so,if you're allergic to it.

171
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,130
You know the use of the term " nontoxic"

172
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,330
is only for advertising.

173
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,000
It has no regulated governmental definition whatsoever.

174
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,100
Well,nothing in here looks all that dangerous.

175
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,900
Be that as it may,we've got a sample size of four subjects,

176
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,000
three who ate breakfast and got sick,

177
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,960
and one who ate the same breakfast and didn't get sick.

178
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,230
Make that a sample size of five.

179
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,330
Looks like they have a dog.

180
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,400
- Hey,Eddie.  - Hey,Mom.

181
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,960
- Hey,son.  - Brought the mail up.

182
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,100
How about a cold one?

183
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,330
Don't mind if I do.

184
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
You gonna stay for supper?

185
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,930
Sounds like a plan.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
What's in the mail?

187
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,230
Oh,relax,Mom,it's just bills

188
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,960
and junk.

189
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,000
We got it,Bob.

190
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,430
All right.

191
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,560
"Notification of full payment. "

192
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,930
We did it,babe.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,360
We sure did.

194
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,030
Eddie,we paid off the farm.

195
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,030
We need to celebrate.

196
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,730
- Huh.  - Forget the beers,

197
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,660
we are opening the champagne tonight.

198
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,600
That's an idea.

199
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,430
You know,about a year ago,we were

200
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,100
a hair's breath away from losing the place.

201
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,330
Now...

202
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,230
it's ours,free and clear.

203
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,400
And we have you to thank for that.

204
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Let's go get some champagne. Come on.

205
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,100
One of the nice things about dogs is

206
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,100
that they're omnivores,

207
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,930
just like us humans.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,900
So,Trixie

209
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,060
probably just had a little bit of everything

210
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,100
the Stanners did.

211
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,600
Poor Trixie.

212
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,130
So why aren't the Stanners dead?

213
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,130
Because dogs metabolize toxins much faster than we do.

214
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,630
Look.

215
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,660
Single mass...

216
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,030
going down the digestive tract into the stomach.

217
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,960
Or up out of the stomach,

218
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,830
as the case may be.

219
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,130
What is it?

220
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
Fungus.

221
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,260
Help! Please!

222
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,330
I need help!

223
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,500
Emily,your family's bodies have been,

224
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,230
uh,colonized

225
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,160
by a fungal organisms,kind of like a mold,

226
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,160
that's growing inside of them.

227
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,300
And normally the doctors would give them

228
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,160
an anti-fungal medication

229
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,830
that kill the fungus and allow them to get better.

230
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,160
But you tried that,and it didn't work?

231
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,160
Well...

232
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,200
Mmm.

233
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,830
In this case,um,

234
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,160
even though we have killed the-the fungus,

235
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,500
the paralysis is still progressing.

236
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,060
So we are trying to find out why that is.

237
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,360
I don't have any other family.

238
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,960
You have to fix them.

239
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,200
This is our fungus.

240
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Take a look.

241
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,860
It's...

242
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,930
beautiful.

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,700
Botrytis cinerea.

244
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,730
It's everywhere.

245
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,900
There're probably spores of it

246
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,930
in the air we're breathing right now.

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
Don't worry... it only,uh,

248
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,930
grows on plants.

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,800
That's why it's on the food inside the dog,

250
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,800
but not actually on the dog's tissues itself.

251
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,460
So Trixie ate whatever the family ate.

252
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,800
Mm-hmm.

253
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,600
And we know the family ate plant material...

254
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,930
fruits and vegetables...

255
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,960
but we don't know which fruits

256
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,460
and/or vegetables were contaminated.

257
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,160
There's our conundrum.

258
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,800
In its natural state,

259
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,430
botrytis cinerea is completely harmless to humans.

260
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,100
From the looks of that specimen,

261
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,230
I'd say it's been genetically modified.

262
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,900
And it's not harmless anymore.

263
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,930
Care to explain why we're hunting a deadly fungus

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,360
in a wine shop?

265
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,860
Because some winemakers use genetically modified fungus

266
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,000
in their product.

267
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,000
And Coppertina Vineyards

268
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,100
is one of the world's leading makers

269
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
of botrytized wine.

270
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,230
Once upon a time

271
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,730
in Medieval France,there was a nobleman

272
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,730
who liked to oversee every aspect

273
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,530
of the winemaking in his domain.

274
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,900
Control freak.

275
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,730
Exactly.

276
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,530
Until one summer,he fell in love.

277
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,530
So he took the fair maiden

278
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,530
to his bedchamber.

279
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
They pretty much stayed there.

280
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,860
They couldn't wait any longer,so in desperation

281
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,860
they picked the molding grapes off the vine

282
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,500
and made wine out of what was left.

283
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,060
And?

284
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,830
And it was delicious.

285
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,600
So they named this fungus,

286
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,600
our little fella,

287
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,100
botrytis cinerea...

288
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,600
or "noble rot",after the nobleman

289
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,130
whose great love had unwittingly created

290
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,830
such ambrosia.

291
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,560
But botrytized wine making

292
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,600
is a gamble with nature.

293
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,960
One too many days of rain or sun,

294
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,000
and the whole harvest is worthless.

295
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,330
So why would the winemakers take that risk?

296
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,560
Why?

297
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,060
Because this bottle

298
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,430
of Coppertina's botrytized vintage

299
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
is $1,500.

300
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,860
The only problem with your botrytis theory

301
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,860
is that the Stanners didn't have wine for breakfast.

302
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,930
So how did they get sick?

303
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,860
A fungus's spores kind of work like,um...

304
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,300
...this little fella.

305
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,230
Any organism that reproduces

306
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,000
by spreading itself over the largest area possible,

307
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,900
you'd be a fool to think that just

308
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,060
'cause you put it on one crop that's where it's gonna stay.

309
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,060
So the fungus could be...

310
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,130
anywhere.

311
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,460
What's wrong with his eyes,Hood?

312
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,460
Keratomycosis.

313
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,500
It's an infection of the cornea

314
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,860
caused by overexposure to a...

315
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,100
mycological organism.

316
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,530
English,please.

317
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,100
There is a fungus among us.

318
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,460
And I bet it's on these grapes.

319
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,630
Hey!

320
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,230
Todo el mundo a trabajar.

321
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,260
Can't you read?

322
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,530
This area's for employees only.

323
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,660
We... We just wanted to take a picture.

324
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,400
It's our first vacation.

325
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,130
Oh,will you take it for us?

326
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,800
No? Okay.

327
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,230
You want to see the fields,

328
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,730
you can pay for the tour in the tasting room.

329
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,900
- Intending?  - Of course.

330
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
- Yes.  - Thank you.

331
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,030
Come on,honey.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Well,good news,bad news.

333
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,000
Botrytis cinerea on the grapes

334
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,560
has been genetically altered,

335
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,830
but it's not the same strain

336
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,500
that paralyzed the Stanner family...

337
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,530
the nucleotide sequence is wrong.

338
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,360
Which means we're back to square one.

339
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,330
You don't seem particularly bothered by this.

340
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,700
Well,just because the fungus trail's gone cold

341
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,330
doesn't mean the money trail isn't still hot.

342
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,430
I called in a favor at Quantico.

343
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,460
We'll have Coppertina's

344
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,530
full financial records no later than tomorrow.

345
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,030
Don't you need a subpoena

346
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,860
to look into a privately held company's financial records?

347
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,300
Gotta love the Patriot Act.

348
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,830
Damn it,Matty.

349
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,160
Hey,Liz,am I in time for dessert?

350
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,360
Oh,Matty,you can't leave your toys...

351
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,300
Oh,my God!

352
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,460
Palo Alto lawyer Sam Sheridan returned home

353
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,500
hoping to enjoy a family dinner,

354
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
but found tragedy waiting instead...

355
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,060
his wife and two children now in critical condition

356
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,230
at Maple Valley hospital.

357
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,230
Now authorities have yet to release an official statement

358
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,630
on the cause of the incident,

359
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,730
but symptoms are said to match those of a local family

360
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,560
who became paralyzed early in the week also following a meal.

361
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,330
Thanks for that report,Laura.

362
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,100
We'll let you know of any further developments

363
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,500
regarding this very strange case of possible food contamination.

364
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
We'll be right back.

365
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,860
Eddie,

366
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,930
I wanted some of that.

367
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
Oh.

368
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,330
Sorry,Mom. I thought you guys were done.

369
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,600
This thing is spreading,Hood.

370
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,660
Uh-huh.

371
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,630
Okay,look,

372
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,630
we know that it's a fungus.

373
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,130
We know that it has to be on some kind of produce.

374
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,800
So,why not just get the FDA

375
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,960
to issue a mass recall on all fruits and vegetables

376
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,630
sold in the affected area?

377
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,130
'Cause it's never going to happen.

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,400
Let's be conservative

379
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,330
and posit that our fungus

380
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,030
is residing on some form of produce within

381
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,530
only a 500 mile radius

382
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,030
of the Stanner family.

383
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,030
- Okay.  - California

384
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,360
agriculture is,what,

385
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,260
$32 billion dollar industry.

386
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,600
About 40,000 square miles

387
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,330
in the state is farmland.

388
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,930
So,

389
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,930
if the FDA were to recall just

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,800
the produce from our area,that is a loss

391
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,160
of...

392
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,200
$2.5 billion.

393
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,230
I get that it's a long shot.

394
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
But...

395
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
once people figure out that something's wrong...

396
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,360
Then they'll probably issue some kind of...

397
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,500
voluntary recall.

398
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,330
They issue warnings

399
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,660
and guidelines all the time,

400
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,330
but people don't listen anymore.

401
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,160
Like the boy who cried wolf.

402
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,730
The answer has got to be here somewhere.

403
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,360
It's not in there,Hood,it's in here.

404
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,860
It looks as though Coppertina Vineyards

405
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,500
transferred $10 million

406
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,400
to another company about five years ago.

407
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,730
Do you want to know what happened next?

408
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,660
Enlighten me.

409
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,960
Their profits started to skyrocket.

410
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,900
The company they paid

411
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,900
was...

412
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,600
Aeonium Agritech.

413
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,600
Mr. Cooper,the FBI flagged a transfer of funds

414
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,600
between Aeonium and Coppertina Vineyards

415
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,560
a couple years back.

416
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,860
Can you tell us what they spent the $10 million on?

417
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,960
I'm afraid I can't

418
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,430
get into any of that

419
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,000
without our legal counsel present.

420
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,400
I understand,Mr. Cooper,but...

421
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,000
Well,I'll get into it for you.

422
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,700
It was a botrytis fungus.

423
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,100
It was genetically altered,

424
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,560
and now a variant of it

425
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,800
is paralyzing people less than 40 miles from here.

426
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,000
You must know,Dr. Hood,that,uh,

427
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,230
anyone involved in fungal biotech

428
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,660
uses botrytis as their base organism.

429
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,800
It's common.

430
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,260
It's nontoxic,

431
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,960
relatively simple to manipulate.

432
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,460
Uh,any one of our corporate colleagues could have made

433
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,330
- what you're looking for.  - I know what you

434
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,100
and your corporate colleagues

435
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,300
tend to do is you push a little hard,

436
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
a little bit fast-- you don't really do

437
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,660
scientific due diligence,so,uh...

438
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,100
in the past decade,you've introduced

439
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,560
genetically modified product

440
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,000
into the market without anything close

441
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,200
to the kind of rigorous,long-term testing

442
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,230
necessary to guarantee public safety,

443
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,960
and now lives are at stake.

444
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,860
So,you think we're moving forward too fast?

445
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,960
You want to talk about,uh,lives at stake?

446
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,560
See,our products increase yield

447
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,630
so that farmers

448
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,000
can produce more food for people to eat.

449
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,830
Why don't you ask

450
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,130
the millions of people

451
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,330
on the verge of starvation in Bangladesh,

452
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,230
Niger,Egypt...

453
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,400
why don't you ask them if we're moving forward too fast?

454
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,930
See,you want humanity

455
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,500
to keep its food all natural,

456
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,400
and that's very poetic,

457
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,100
but human beings can't eat poetry.

458
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,360
Without genetic modification,

459
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,630
most of the Third World will starve to death

460
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,230
within a few months,and the rest of us...

461
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,360
we won't be far behind.

462
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,760
Your altruism is an example to us all.

463
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,900
Does that apply to the prices you charge the starving nations,

464
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,030
or does Aeonium offer some kind

465
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
of Third World starvation discount?

466
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,100
Just curious.

467
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,600
Any more questions,you're gonna need a warrant.

468
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,560
I think we still have those in this country,don't we?

469
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,030
You know,if you let me do my job,

470
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
I could actually help you.

471
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,530
Jason Cooper is everything

472
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,200
that is wrong with global agribusiness.

473
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,330
Greed masquerading

474
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,530
beneath a thin veneer of lofty idealism.

475
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,260
Which is why you don't confront him head-on.

476
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,600
You stroke him,finesse him,get him

477
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,430
to drop his guard,and then you pounce.

478
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,600
Okay,I'm sorry,I apologize.

479
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,260
But we need answers.

480
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,460
This is not the only place we're gonna find them.

481
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,160
I thought this was a public university.

482
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,500
It is.

483
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,130
Welcome to the brave new world

484
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,860
of academia,bought and paid for

485
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,800
by multi-billion-dollar corporations.

486
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,000
These companies finance the university's labs,

487
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,600
and the scientists who work in them,

488
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,800
they pay millions of dollars in sponsorship,

489
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,900
and in return they get to keep all discoveries

490
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,000
the university makes.

491
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,130
So,all of Aeonium's research...

492
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,500
Is here.

493
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,300
What are they doing?

494
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,330
Recording spectra from deep in the ultraviolet region

495
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,100
of the electromagnetic spectrum,

496
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,300
through the visible region,

497
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,960
into the near infrared.

498
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,360
No,really,what are they doing?

499
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,830
May I?

500
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,260
You got the wrong maximum absorbency wavelength.

501
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,930
For pnitrophenol,the machine should be

502
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,700
at 410,not 418.

503
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,160
I knew that.

504
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,730
Oh,who's,uh...

505
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,500
who's been,uh,working with botrytis fungus?

506
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,960
Oh,that's,uh... that's Professor Altschuler.

507
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,860
Botrytis has been his thing

508
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,100
ever since he was an undergrad

509
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,230
at Cal Tech.

510
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,760
Looks good-- who's his underwriter?

511
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,530
Aeonium.

512
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,260
Well,we're here with the...

513
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,500
FBI.

514
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,130
And,uh,

515
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,400
I'd kind of like to talk to Professor Altschuler.

516
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,800
Yeah.

517
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,660
Sure... I mean,if you can find him.

518
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,400
What do you mean?

519
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,800
He's MIA.

520
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,130
He hasn't been into work all week,

521
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,460
and he's not returning his phone calls,either.

522
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,360
Not gonna get tenure slacking off like that.

523
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,230
No.

524
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,830
Mr. Cooper,Karl Altschuler is here.

525
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,130
I told him you were busy,but...

526
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
This is why we stopped.

527
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,230
This is what we thought could happen.

528
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,360
I read that.

529
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,700
Calm down,Karl.

530
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,930
I won't calm down!

531
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,900
People are dying because...

532
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,000
you restarted the project

533
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,500
against my explicit recommendation.

534
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,260
And I followed your recommendation,

535
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,230
and I shut that research down.

536
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,860
My name is all over this research,Jason.

537
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,530
This isn't connected.

538
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,560
It's in the records.

539
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,700
It just can't be.

540
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,830
It is,and you know it.

541
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,300
Be very careful,Karl.

542
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,860
You have a career to think about.

543
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,800
And if you start telling everybody

544
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,600
that Aeonium is involved in this,well...

545
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,560
an accusation is just as good

546
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,830
as a guilty verdict in this day and age.

547
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,360
And it's just as dangerous,too.

548
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,430
For you.

549
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,030
For all of us.

550
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,530
For all of us,Karl.

551
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,660
Karl!

552
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,600
Altschuler last swiped his credit card here.

553
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,960
Patriot Act again?

554
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,500
You're lucky I'm not tempted to abuse my powers.

555
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,060
This should be it.

556
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,160
Professor Altschuler?

557
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,400
Professor Altschuler,it's the FBI.

558
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,860
Let's try this.

559
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,160
He's dead.

560
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,100
Drug overdose?

561
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,530
I'll call the police.

562
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,960
Fascinating.

563
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,130
That's got the thickened tail

564
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,760
of the Androctonus crassicauda,but the size and coloring

565
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,860
of the Leiurus quinquestriatus.

566
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,760
But it's a scorpion.

567
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,100
Yeah,it's a scorpion.

568
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,760
But it's no species I've ever seen before.

569
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,660
I expect a geneticist

570
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,700
of Altschuler's caliber would be

571
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,900
more than able to engineer a hybrid.

572
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,260
So,what are you,a bug expert,too?

573
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,460
It's not a bug; it's an arachnid.

574
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,800
And no,I'm no expert.

575
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,200
Someone very close to me

576
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,230
was,um,involved in an experimental

577
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,930
brain cancer treatment that used scorpion venom.

578
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,060
It was your wife...

579
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,860
right?

580
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,260
I... I know she died of cancer

581
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,360
two years ago.

582
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah,it was quite a promising treatment,actually,but,um...

583
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,260
unfortunately,not quite on time.

584
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm sorry,Hood.

585
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,160
This wasn't drug related.

586
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,560
This was an overdose of scorpion venom.

587
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,630
The thing about scorpions is they don't go for humans.

588
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
They go for insects.

589
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,530
That's it.

590
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,560
It's a pesticide.

591
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,500
What?

592
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,330
Oh,my God,it's brilliant.

593
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Scorpion venom is made to paralyze insects.

594
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,600
If Altschuler could take the botrytis fungus

595
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,460
and combine it with the scorpion venom,

596
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:47,600
he would have a totally organic pesticide.

597
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,160
To spray on the produce...

598
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,200
to kill insects with the venom?

599
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,630
And that is what

600
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,360
has been paralyzing our victims.

601
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,130
No bite marks or stings.

602
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,130
And nobody's going to be checking for scorpion venom

603
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
because the only deadly scorpions native to the U.S.

604
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,660
are in the Arizona desert.

605
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,400
What I don't understand is

606
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,960
why the venom was released in our victims

607
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,160
when it's only supposed to attack insects.

608
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,300
Or why it affected everyone in the Stanner family

609
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,660
except for Emily.

610
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,330
We've got the bullet,but we don't have the trigger.

611
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,360
No... but we have something else.

612
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,360
Poor bastard.

613
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,130
He was trying to atone for the mess he made.

614
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,400
But to make enough antibodies

615
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,000
to produce a scorpion antivenin,

616
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,960
he'd have to endure sting after sting.

617
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,360
Let's just hope the dose that killed him

618
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:53,260
was enough to turn his blood...

619
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,830
into a cure.

620
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,460
Dr. Richards has the hospital toxicologist

621
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,460
working on synthesizing an antivenin

622
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,860
from Altschuler's blood.

623
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,160
We'll just have to wait and see.

624
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,130
You hungry?

625
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,030
No,I'm fine.

626
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,960
Hood,you should eat something.

627
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,630
You call that eating?

628
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,560
I know,the sweet tooth.

629
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,700
You could've just asked.

630
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,030
This is it; this is the trigger.

631
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,660
My candy?

632
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,730
You know what's in this?

633
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,930
"Licoricey" goodness?

634
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,730
Insects.

635
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,500
Carmine. It's a red food coloring

636
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
made from a South American beetle.

637
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,100
I'm suddenly in the mood for some fresh produce.

638
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,360
Have you had breakfast yet,Mr.Cooper?

639
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,760
Strawberries,maybe?

640
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,860
Rachel,what did the Stanners have for breakfast?

641
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,700
Corn flakes,pancakes,fruit salad...

642
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,060
grapefruit juice?

643
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,000
Pink grapefruit juice made with carmine.

644
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,760
And the fruit salad

645
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,060
probably contained fungus from your pesticide.

646
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,830
The Sheridan family.

647
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,630
Oh,the Sheridan family,

648
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,830
they ate any number of fruits and vegetables for dinner.

649
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,430
Finished with red velvet cake,carmine red.

650
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,500
It's a synergy effect.

651
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,730
See,the fungus,

652
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,400
it attacks the insect proteins.

653
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,760
It doesn't know they've already been eaten by a human.

654
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,130
So the fungus is the loaded gun,

655
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,860
and the food coloring containing the insect proteins

656
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,930
is the trigger.

657
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,030
Around two years

658
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,360
and several million dollars into the project,

659
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,060
we decided that the end product

660
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,830
wasn't viable anymore.

661
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,360
You see,when we fed our test animals food which was dusted

662
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:39,200
with the,uh,pesticide,see,most of them were fine.

663
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,430
Except for one.

664
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,930
Which was paralyzed.

665
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,130
I mean,we did everything by the book,

666
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,630
you know,for a phase three trial.

667
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,730
The test sample sizes,

668
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
genetic lines,everything.

669
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,460
And I thought it was just some kind of anomaly,

670
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,930
but Altschuler,of course,he was obsessed,

671
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,600
so he,he did a culture of the dead animal's body,

672
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,100
ran all kinds of tests and...

673
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,000
And that's when he discovered the fatal synergy.

674
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,560
We stopped the project before it went any further.

675
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,830
We sent what was left to a biowaste disposal facility,

676
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,630
and that was that.

677
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,030
Until now.

678
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,530
You should have contacted the authorities

679
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,000
the minute you suspected something.

680
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,260
If those people die,it's negligent homicide.

681
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,000
No,uh,you got to believe me here.

682
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,700
I have all the paperwork on file,

683
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,460
uh,all of our waste goes to a federally licensed

684
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,700
disposal facility just east of here.

685
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,530
It's a 45-minute drive.

686
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,830
All right,all right!

687
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,100
Nice and easy!

688
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,000
Two-three-five- eight- seven-zero-one.

689
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,060
This one checks out.

690
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,000
- Where are the rest?  - That's it!

691
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,300
Ground radar confirms we got

692
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,600
ten tanks of pesticides.

693
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,130
There should be 14.

694
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,900
We're going to have to question all these workers,

695
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,630
anyone whose had access to the disposal field

696
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,760
in the past 12 months.

697
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,000
Hood,car!

698
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,660
Where are the four missing canisters of Aeonium pesticide?

699
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,460
People are going to die!

700
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,930
- Tell me!  - O-Okay...

701
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,960
Okay! I-I gave them to my dad.

702
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,930
I just wanted to help him out a little,

703
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,430
that's all!

704
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
And it did!

705
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,460
Rachel...

706
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,130
Sir!

707
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Put the can down!

708
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,930
You get away.

709
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,360
My boy called me and told me to burn the fields.

710
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,860
That's exactly what I'm doing.

711
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,760
People are sick because you put

712
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,930
Aeonium pesticides in your crops.

713
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,760
You put the lives of every person who ate

714
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,430
produce from your farm at serious risk.

715
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,630
By burning your fields,

716
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,260
there's a very good chance you're going to spread

717
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,000
whatever organism made those people sick

718
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
to the neighboring farms.

719
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,360
You see those fields over there?

720
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,960
Monsanto.

721
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,960
You see these fields over here?

722
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,260
Crops all the way to the base of those mountains?

723
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,460
That's Dole.

724
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,460
When my father's father

725
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,500
settled this land,it was small family farms

726
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,730
for as far as the eye could see.

727
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,930
Now,we're the only ones left.

728
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,760
Drop it,now.

729
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,160
Last year we almost lost this place.

730
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,960
Yeah,when we planted the new crop

731
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,900
my boy called me and he said,

732
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,360
"Dad," he says,"I got something that we can put on the crops

733
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,900
"that'll really make a difference."

734
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,360
So we put it on there.

735
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,560
We used it,yes,sir.

736
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,030
Now,I knew where it come from.

737
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,460
It worked so good,I didn question it.

738
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,030
Well,maybe you should have.

739
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,760
That's the state police.

740
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,860
It's over,sir.

741
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,930
Well,I'll,uh...

742
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,160
I'll,I'll go with you.

743
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,360
I'm sorry about what we did.

744
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm real sorry.

745
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,400
Mom,Dad,this is Dr. Hood.

746
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,230
He's the only one that believed

747
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,930
I wasn't trying to poison you guys.

748
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,900
Thank you.

749
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,560
Oh,don't mention it.

750
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm just glad the scorpion antivenin worked.

751
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,660
But Emily still needs to see a chemistry tutor.

752
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,130
We were lucky.

753
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,960
Fungus tends to mutate really quickly.

754
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,000
Sooner or later,there'd be a hardier strain

755
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,060
and way more people would've been at risk.

756
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,700
Guess I'm going to have to look at my food labels

757
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,400
more closely from now on.

758
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,230
Uh,natural coloring.

759
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,660
So,you're saying that's just bugs,huh?

760
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,000
Maybe,maybe not.

761
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,660
According to the FDA

762
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,860
as long as it's "natural" it could be anything.

763
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,530
Green food coloring,on the other hand,

764
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,500
is a petroleum derived triphenylmethane.

765
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,330
Nothing natural about it.

766
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,830
Yummy.
