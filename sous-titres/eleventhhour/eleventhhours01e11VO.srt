00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,540
Where are we going, Dad?

3
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,440
Higher ground, Nicky.

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,180
This flash flood could kill us both.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,960
I don't feel so good.

6
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,910
The doctor said to keep
taking your chemo pills.

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,530
Here. Take one of these.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,590
Hang on, Nicky.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,280
If we get up over the
ridge, we'll be safe.

10
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,600
Come on...

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,210
Dad! Dad!

12
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,470
Can't hardly see anything.

13
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,910
Come on! Come on, baby. Come on!

14
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,890
We're gonna make it!

15
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,360
We did it, Nicky.

16
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,440
No way the floodwater
will reach this high.

17
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,790
Dad?

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,960
If I'm gonna die...

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,350
who's gonna take care of you?

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,540
Come here, buddy. Come here.

21
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,780
You're okay.

Stealing second. Stealing
second. Bring it in, nice!

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,390
Listen to that crowd go crazy! Yeah!

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,290
Hey, hold on, Nicky.

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,040
Why don't you head inside, son?

27
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,580
Okay.

28
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,880
Dr. Reeves.

29
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,950
Nicky was scheduled
for surgery a week ago.

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,290
Why haven't you returned our calls?

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,520
'Cause Nicky doesn't
need surgery. He's fine.

32
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,090
Daniel, he has a tumor on his kidney.

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,070
Without surgery, he is going to die.

34
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,160
Where's your faith, Dr. Reeves?

35
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,510
You know I'm not going
to let you take him.

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,910
Officer?

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,510
Mr. Harris, we have a court
order appeal by Child Services.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,810
They're forcing us to act in the
best interest of Nicholas Harris.

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,090
Lave my son alone!

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,620
Let go of my son!

41
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,610
He'll die if we don't
get him to a hospital.

42
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,390
Does it look like he's gonna die to you?

43
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,730
Dad, it's okay.

44
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,370
- Nicky!
- It's okay.

45
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,270
Dr. Reeves?

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,040
Do you believe in miracles?

47
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,400
You will.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,820
What's the problem, Dennis?

50
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,700
Veronica, where exactly was
this tumor supposed to be?

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,870
On the right kidney.

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,810
It's on the MRI scan and the ultrasound.

53
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,720
Taken when?

54
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,020
Three weeks ago.

55
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,840
Well, look at the ultrasound now.

56
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,210
I checked the other one,
too, just to be safe.

57
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,580
This boy's kidneys are
immaculate. Perfectly normal.

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,230
That's not possible. I
performed the exam myself.

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,300
The tumor was right there.

60
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,860
Well, it's not there now.

61
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,200
People are flocking to what is
being called a miracle spring,

62
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,570
which suddenly appeared during the heavy storms that
hit Lewiston, Montana a little over three weeks ago.

63
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,560
Now, this is eight-year-old
Nicholas Harris,

64
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,880
who was diagnosed with a
cancerous tumor on his kidney,

65
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,550
but after he started drinking from the
mysterious spring, the tumor just disappeared.

66
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,740
The boy's father
believes it was a miracle.

67

68
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,160
What the...

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,100
- Hood?
- Hey, Rachel, you seen this?

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,530
Hood, what are you doing here?

71
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,640
- Nice place.
- Hood, it's Sunday.

72
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,310
Rachel, you have to see this.

73
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,930
I have to see this?

74
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,380
Miracle boy.

75
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,190
Miracle cure for cancer found.

76
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,050
Miracle spring.

77
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,900
Okay, I saw them. Are you happy?

78
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,550
Hood, it's Sunday and it's 6:00 A.M.

79
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,130
Rachel... we have to
go to Montana right now.

80
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,190
No. No, no, no, no. Please,
please don't. I'm begging you.

81
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,720
If this is my weekend free of all
things "Hood," unless this is a dream.

82
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,890
Is this a dream?

83
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,900
Actually, you know what,
uh, I just realized...

84
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,190
I think I could be able
to do this on my own, huh?

85
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,620
Wait.

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,080
I need an airtight, seamless, indestructible reason
to leave my apartment before 7:00 A.M.Monday morning.

87
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,150
Let's hear it.

88
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,410
Okay.

89
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,920
If this causes very sick people to walk away from
their medical treatment to drink from this spring,

90
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,550
they're going to die.

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,450
That'll do. Turn around.

92
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,800
Turn around.

93
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,710
How'd you find my place, anyway?

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,990
Oh, the FBI has its resources, Rachel.

95
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,120
Anyway, what about Mr. Shoes?

96
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,790
Don't worry.

97
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,470
He'll wait.

98
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,600
So, Hood,

99
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,810
what if we get to Montana and
realize it really is a miracle?

100
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,950
Oh, take it from me, Rachel.

101
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,700
There's no... such... thing.

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,390
$40 a jar.

107
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,030
There you go, sir. Good luck to you.
And you can keep the jar. That's on me.

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,010
Come on. Who's next?

109
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,620
And you've been using
the walker for how long?

110
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,740
About ten years.

111
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,350
There he is, over there!

112
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,210
Nicky, how much water did
it take to cure your cancer?

113
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,080
When did you start
drinking from the spring?

114
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,760
No more questions. Please, come on.

115
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,910
Hey, Daniel, are you a religious man?

116
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,070
FBI. Clear a path! Or you'll
be charged with trespassing.

117
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,260
- Can you do that?
- Sort of.

118
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,290
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

119
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,630
Mr. Harris, we need to talk.

120
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,140
Those didn't look like weekend bags
you were loading onto your truck.

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,700
Planning a trip?

122
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,710
I'm sorry I ever told
anyone about that spring.

123
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,550
I just want to get
Nicky away from all this.

124
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,180
You think what happened here
is just going to go away?

125
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,410
If you leave here now, you're
going to be running forever.

126
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,930
This needs to be explained.

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,890
I can help you do that.

128
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,210
Now, I want to know
about the spring. Tell me.

129
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,850
Well, what's to tell? I mean, three
weeks ago the storm hit real bad.

130
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,930
So, we took off until it was safe.

131
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,280
Then we found water
gushing out the hillside.

132
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,270
Who owns this property?

133
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,150
Travis Dobbs and the guy
that owns this trailer.

134
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,450
So, what, you just filled a bottle with this mysterious
untested liquid and gave it to Nicky to drink?

135
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,680
- No.
- My dad didn't do anything. I did.

136
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,920
The spring-- it looked so clean
and fresh, I wanted to taste it.

137
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,580
I had to.

138
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,660
Buddy, give us a few minutes.

139
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,880
Okay.

140
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,270
Look, my son was going to die.

141
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,630
And he drank some of that water,
and something happened, I...

142
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,920
I don't know what, but
he got better quick.

143
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,210
I took it as a sign and I threw
away all those pills he was taking.

144
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,490
- The chemotherapy pills.
- Yeah.

145
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Do you mind if I, uh, just do a little
investigating into Nicky's recovery?

146
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,840
What's there to investigate? I mean,
he's perfectly healthy. You've seen him.

147
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,890
Even the doctor said so.

148
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,460
Yeah, and that's an incredible thing.

149
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,810
But my concern is how Nicky got better

150
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,250
will lead to other
people getting sicker.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,880
Do you know why they call it a miracle?

152
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,300
Because there is no explanation.

153
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,110
I owe you, tough stuff. Thank you.

154
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,100
That's okay, Lily. No sweat.

155
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,320
Nicky? Come here, son.

156
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,390
Come on. One at a time, folks.

157
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,830
There's plenty of miracle
water for everybody.

158
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,850
$40 a jar.

159
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
Please have your money ready.

160
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,530
Exact change is always appreciated.

161
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,320
- There you go, ma'am.
- Oh, bless you.

162
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,430
You take care of yourself now.

163
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,290
I'm just curious.

164
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,540
Has anyone been down here
to prove this empirically?

165
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,920
I mean, like a researcher or
scientist-type person to see what,

166
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,120
if anything, is actually in this water?

167
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,950
It cures cancer. That's all I know.

168
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,100
That's all any of these
folks need to know.

169
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,110
Look, buddy, you're holding up the line.

170
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,570
You want to buy a jar or don't you?

171
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,920
Oh, yes, please. How much?

172
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,200
$40, please.

173
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,180
40,00 Okay.

174
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,530
Thank you. You take care now.

175
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,160
So, uh... this is going to
fix all these sick people, huh?

176
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,180
Yeah.

177
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,070
Going to cure over 200 types of cancer--
leukemia, brain tumors, breast cancer?

178
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,290
How about insomnia? I have trouble
sleeping. Is it any good for insomnia?

179
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,510
We'll see, huh?

180
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,070
As far as I know, only one person
actually seems to have gotten any better.

181
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,080
One person.

182
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,900
I'll tell you what. How about I take this
back with me, I test it scientifically,

183
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,400
and if I can prove it's not what you say it is,
you can give all these people their money back.

184
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,140
Well, let me ask you this.

185
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,920
How are you going to
test a miracle? Huh?

186
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,500
Besides, it don't matter.

187
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,990
I own this land and everything
on it, so go ahead and test.

188
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,950
You're Travis Dobbs, correct?

189
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,940
Yeah.

190
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,700
The same Travis Dobbs who's on
probation for selling alcohol to a minor

191
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,610
at the Gas and Sip off of Route 28?

192
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,680
The hell is this?

193
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,860
FBI.

194
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,370
With your criminal record, fraud can
get you up to ten years in prison,

195
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,940
whether this is your property or not.

196
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,520
So arrest me.

197
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,450
You're okay. What's your name, honey?

198
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,270
Lily.

199
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,940
Lily, can you tell me
what's wrong with you?

200
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,510
I have lymphoma.

201
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,960
Let's get her to the hospital.

202
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,710
We have got a serious problem here.

203
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,540
Most of these people are patients from
across the country who should be in bed,

204
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,610
not standing in a
field for hours on end.

205
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,460
Where do you want me to put them?

206
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,920
First the storm flood shut down
half the hospital, now this.

207
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,930
Okay, put 'em on gurneys,
keep them in the hallways.

208
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,460
I'm going to check out maintenance, see if
we can get "B" ward up again and running.

209
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, careful
where you step, Ms. Cole.

210
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,180
You know, we still got a few live cables
down here. Those puddles could be damn hot.

211
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,770
Hurdle, what the hell is taking so long?

212
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,470
Well, the storm really did a
number on this place, you know,

213
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,150
so, uh, we're about halfway through
replacing the fried circuitry.

214
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,310
I need power back up on "B"
ward. I need it yesterday.

215
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,770
How about a week from yesterday?

216
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,400
How about I fire you and hire someone who will charge
half of what you do and get it done twice as fast?

217
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,950
Ma'am, we've been working all kinds
of hours to get thelace fixed up.

218
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,010
I don't want to lose my job.

219
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,390
How about two more days?

220
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,570
You know, we'll just
work around the clock.

221
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,870
All right. Without overtime.

222
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,000
Sure, no problem.

223
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,650
Come on. Let's get back to work.

224
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,340
All staff, please stand
by to test power...

225
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,730
Okay.

226
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,780
Lily, what happened?

227
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,940
She overdosed on spring water.

228
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,390
And you are?

229
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,480
Dr. Jacob Hood.

230
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,550
He's the special science
advisor to the FBI.

231
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,710
I'm Agent Rachel Young.

232
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,420
Lily, you've stopped your
chemo treatment, haven't you?

233
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,050
Not you, too.

234
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,540
Oh, come on, Dr. Reeves.

235
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,960
We both saw what that
water did for Nicky.

236
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,790
You can't deny that it cured him.

237
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,980
There is no scientific proof of that, which means
there is no reason for you to stop your treatment.

238
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,240
When did you go off the chemo?

239
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,350
Just over a week ago. I...

240
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,160
I got to know Nicky while we
were both being treated here.

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,580
I trust him; he wouldn't
lie to me about the water.

242
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,400
Nina.

243
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,830
Yes, Dr. Reeves.

244
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,400
Make sure she has zero water and
start her on a hypertonic saline drip.

245
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,570
- Okay.
- Thank you.

246
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,930
Doesn't really make sense.

247
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,050
Coming off the chemo, she should be
feeling better, at least temporarily.

248
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,270
Any other patients exhibiting symptoms
not really typical of their illness?

249
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,790
Yes, several.

250
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,260
Um, there's a woman with rheumatoid
arthritis who can't stop vomiting.

251
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,920
There's a Down syndrome patient
who's got chronic insomnia.

252
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,320
I mean, these are symptoms that are
completely unlated to their illnesses.

253
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,090
But they're all drinking from
the same spring. Am I right?

254
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,860
I have tested that water countless times,
and I can tell you there's no mystery to it.

255
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,770
Good or bad, it is just water.

256
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,540
Okay. Can I see your results?

257
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,660
Can you wait for me to get off my shift?

258
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,510
Cute dog.

259
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,190
I rescued her from the pound.

260
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,850
You're a sweetheart,
aren't you, Bonnie? Come on.

261
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,010
You know, understandably, Helen Cole
and the rest of the hospital hierarchy

262
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,790
want nothing to do with this miracle,
so I brought my research home.

263
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,640
Any idea of the source of the water?

264
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,560
We can't get any access
to it because of Dobbs.

265
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,760
Property owner?

266
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,130
Yeah

267
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,800
Is there any way that you could have the FBI step
in and shut him down so we can trace the source?

268
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,890
Well, first we have to get proof of some
dangerous element in the water, then we can...

269
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,640
shut him down.

270
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,340
Could I see your results, please?

271
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,670
Thank you. You mind if I...

272
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,580
Nicky's tumor was
diagnosed six weeks ago.

273
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,380
The storm that caused the spring to
emerge was three weeks after that.

274
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,810
Nicky started drinking
the water immediately.

275
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,260
Three weeks later,
Nicky's tumor is gone.

276
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,100
Now, still, I tested that water
and I can't find anything in it.

277
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,480
I see that you tested for infrared
spectroscopy, crystallization...

278
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,010
You're right.

279
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,390
This is normal water.

280
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,220
Veronica, can I ask you a question?

281
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,410
Do you think it's possible this spring
water contains some magic property

282
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,100
that could wither away a tumor?

283
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,920
I don't know.

284
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,150
That's not really an answer. Either you
believe in miracle water or you don't.

285
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,660
The fact is: an eight-year-old
boy had cancer and now he doesn't.

286
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,880
It's not because of any
medical treatment I gave him,

287
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,630
so whether you like to believe
it or not, that is miraculous.

288
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,340
Yeah, well, there's just this
one fact going through my head,

289
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,930
and that's that every year, half a million men,
women, children in this country die of cancer,

290
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,470
and they all ask for miracles,
every last one of them.

291
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,940
So what makes this...
little boy special?

292
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,370
No, I believe there's
something... in this water.

293
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,260
I'm gonna find out what it is.

294
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,520
Thank you very much for
your time. Excuse me. Rachel.

295
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,940
He wasn't speaking as
a scientist, was he?

296
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,890
He always speaks as a scientist, but he did
lose someone to cancer a couple years ago.

297
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,140
Thanks again.

298
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,750
Who the hell are you?

299
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,560
You need to close the spring down.

300
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,360
You need to get the hell
out of my truck, pal.

301
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,340
Wrong answer.

302
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,310
Yes.

303
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,670
Well, I respectfully disagree.

304
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,860
I feel that it is in
our jurisdiction t...

305
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,850
Yes, sir.

306
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,920
It's the director. He's really pissed.

307
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,260
Your face has been all over the TV.

308
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,550
Hey, Frank.

309
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,720
Well, 'cause I'm worried about the media spreading
the kind of superstition that could cost lives.

310
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,490
No, I know it's not an official case, but
there's definitely something going on here.

311
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,260
Well, 'cause I'm looking at a
body right now. That's how I know.

312
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,960
Um, you're breaking up. I
can't... you're breaking up.

313
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,290
What do we have here, Detective?

314
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,230
Somebody snapped his neck.

315
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,140
Death was instantaneous, but we
found some blood in his pickup truck.

316
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,500
Looks like they wanted his cash.

317
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,240
Maybe.

318
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,810
So why make the statement?

319
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,400
Why drag his body all the way up
here and dump it in the spring?

320
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,340
Thk you, Detective.

321
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,640
Well, if you wanted to shut
the miracle spring down.

322
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,810
But it's just a crime scene.

323
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,280
In 72 hours, it goes back to
being open to the hopeful masses.

324
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,500
72 hours would be enough.

325
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,780
For what?

326
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,100
Well, if someone is dumping
contaminants in this spring,

327
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,600
then all this miraculous attention has
got to be the last thing they'd want.

328
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,740
72 hours could be enough
time to flush the water clean.

329
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,560
We need to find the underground
source of this spring right away.

330
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,260
I'll get the Department of the
Interior to send out a hydrologist.

331
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,480
Good, but even if we can't get results from
the water, maybe we can get it from the cancer.

332
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,160
We need to talk.

333
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,680
What about?

334
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,440
One of the miracle seekers just died-- a
26-year-old man-- and the others are getting sicker.

335
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,490
Was he an oncology patient?

336
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,920
No, it wasn't cancer. It was sepsis.

337
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,010
Blood poisoning?

338
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,140
Hold on.

339
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,700
Was he sick before he took the water?

340
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,900
How much spring water did he drink?

341
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,000
A gallon a day for the past week.

342
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,120
A gallon a day?

343
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,710
Okay, well, that settles
it. It's definitely a cause.

344
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
Jacob!

345
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,370
Couldn't have done this by phone
or computer or satellite link?

346
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,620
Well, then, you wouldn't get
to meet Dr. Veronica Reeves.

347
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,720
Oh, see, he thinks I'm buying
this crap, but I know his MO.

348
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,230
Firsthand observation,
hypothesis, experiment, result.

349
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,090
It's all about the
cheeseburger and the beer.

350
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,170
Hi, nice to meet you.
Matthew Kaplan, genius.

351
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,370
Matthew is one of the country's
leading cancer researchers.

352
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,050
One of. He jests. Big-time.

353
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,390
- Is that the specimen?
- Yes.

354
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,370
I call him Quasimodo. Nefroblastoma.

355
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,210
Stage 3 kidney tumor. It's
the same tumor that Nicky had.

356
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,630
It's just what we're looking for.

357
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,660
Well, let's hope the
little guy is thirsty.

358
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,920
Miracle water for the
rat coming right up.

359
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,190
You're not gonna see results
for at least 24 hours.

360
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,020
I'm gonna get back to my patients.

361
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,760
Very nice to meet you, Dr. Kaplan.

362
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,890
That's what they all say.

363
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,710
Now, if this soil had a
higher salt concentration,

364
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,440
I'd be using a resistivity array to
chart the flow of subterranean water

365
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,880
by measuring changes in electrical conductivity
at progressively deeper subsurface levels.

366
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,280
Oh, you would, would you?

367
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,630
Have you tracked the
source of the spring?

368
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,100
Ironically, the, uh, rocky soil here

369
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,850
actually helps our ground-penetrating
radar map subterranean terrain.

370
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,510
Soft, silty soil, on the
other hand, would, uh,

371
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,800
deaden our signals and make
undergrnd mapping far more difficult.

372
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,250
Oh, my God.

373
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,480
What is it?

374
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,630
Hood, you're not gonna believe
what this water runs under.

375
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,180
This place was a storage depot
until just after the first Gulf War.

376
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,760
Storage for what?

377
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,690
Depleted uranium, mostly.

378
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,090
What did you say?

379
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,990
Depleted uranium.

380
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,530
Uh, the base was decommissioned
by the army in 1995.

381
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,430
Post-Cold War downsizing.

382
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,190
Yep.

383
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,960
Dr. Hood, it's Veronica Reeves.

384
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,080
I just spoke with the coroner who worked
on the patient that I lost to sepsis.

385
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,200
And?

386
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,380
And there was significant cellular damage
to the stomach lining and the intestines,

387
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,910
none of which would have
shown up on X-rays or MRIs.

388
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,930
- It's classic symptoms of...
- Radiation poisoning.

389
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,460
You know what? I think
I just found the source.

390
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,920
Will you excuse me a second?

391
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:26,460
Rachel... think we're gonna need a full
radiological analysis of this facility now.

392
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah. Sergeant.

393
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,040
Hello again.

394
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:29,940
Where are you?

395
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,720
I'm at an armory on Pennington Hill...

396
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,610
where they used it to store
depleted uranium routes.

397
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,940
I know where that is.
I'm coming right now.

398
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,780
Still nothing above
background radiation.

399
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,620
Have you checked the storm drains,
the, uh, ventilation shafts?

400
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,340
All done, and we found nothing.

401
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,580
Okay, thank you.

402
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
Can you check the calibration
on your Geiger counter?

403
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,990
You're operating at maximum sensitivity?

404
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,870
Dr. Hood, we've checked and rechecked.

405
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,850
I'm sorry, sir. There's no radiation.

406
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,390
If depleted uranium was ever stored
here, it was removed a long time ago.

407
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,300
Can I see your hydrological map, please?

408
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,280
This doesn't make any sense at all.

409
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,520
She drank the water, but it
made her worse. Not better.

410
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,960
Hey, it's not your fault,
Nicky. It's not your fault.

411
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,360
This was your miracle, okay? Come on.

412
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,440
No, no, this isn't fair!

413
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,540
Lily deserves a miracle, too!

414
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,900
I know. I know. It's okay.

415
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,270
Some unknown substance is
contaminating the groundwater.

416
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,160
Groundwater that's...

417
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,740
sprung up since that storm.

418
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,660
The armory is testing
negative for radioactive waste.

419
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,360
And there's no natural radiation.

420
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,790
No radioactive ore within 100 miles.

421
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,480
But, uh, well, there's...
there's something.

422
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,010
Something's here, and I can't see it.

423
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,260
And I'm not wrong.

424
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,270
Everybody's wrong sometimes, Hood.

425
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:26,690
Yeah, yeah, maybe, Rachel. Not today.

426
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,190
Okay, well, we'll start from
the periphery of the water table,

427
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,710
and we'll work our way down the slope.

428
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,510
Hood.

429
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,620
There's a possibility that it could be
something else causing the contamination,

430
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,560
something that mimics the
effects of radioactive poisoning.

431
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,920
We know that it's not a miracle.

432
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,850
It's not a miracle 'cause
there's no such thing.

433
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,520
Hood...

434
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,980
don't make this about your wife.

435
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,200
It's not about my wife, Rachel.

436
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,680
This is about all the people who
will die if I don't help them.

437
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,640
Really?

438
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,630
You said, "What makes
this boy so special?

439
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,340
"How come he gets a miracle
and no one else does?"

440
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,960
Agent Young.

441
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,430
We'll be right there.

442
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,690
Dr. Reeves is dead.

443
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,970
Clean swipe of the femoral artery.

444
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,070
She knew what she was doing.

445
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,470
Must have bled out in a second.

446
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,320
And this was in her hand?

447
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,970
Yeah.

448
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,460
One clean cut. Suicides...

449
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,230
even with doctors, you
usually have hesitation marks.

450
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,130
You check her system for drugs?

451
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,400
Already in the wor.

452
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,190
Should have results by tomorrow.

453
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,290
- Thank you.
- Detective, coroner needs you.

454
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,500
- Rachel.
- Yeah?

455
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,750
I have a really horrible feeling...

456
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,660
Veronica died because she gave a damn.

457
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,160
Me, too. Come on.

458
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,280
Where?

459
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:24,060
I want to confirm this really
was suicide and not murder.

460
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,520
Hey, Quasi.

461
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,290
Drinking like a camel, aren't you?

462
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,100
You like this stuff.

463
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,510
I'll be damned.

464
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,360
Hello.

465
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,890
Jacob! I've never seen anything like it.

466
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,130
Quasimodo... his tumor,
it's gone. It's disappeared.

467
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,890
Look, you got to find
out what did this, Jacob.

468
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,030
Yeah. This is unbelievable.

469
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,930
Okay, thanks.

470
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,570
Tell me.

471
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,390
That spring water we gave Quasimodo
seems to have shrunk his tumor.

472
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,030
So, it did cure Nicky.

473
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,180
- Look out!
- Geez.

474
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,270
You okay?

475
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,080
Yeah, I'm okay. That raccoon isn't.

476
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,360
I didn't hit it, did I?

477
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,140
No, raccoons are nocturnal animals.
They don't come out in the day.

478
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,300
So, maybe it has rabies.

479
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,120
Maybe it has somethinglse.

480
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,180
Hey, Bonnie. Hi, girl. How you doing?

481
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,020
How you doing? You miss your mommy?

482
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,760
No water, no food.

483
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,240
If she were gonna kill herself, she would have made
arrangements for someone to take care of her dog.

484
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,950
It wasn't a suicide.

485
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,860
She was murdered,
just like Travis Dobbs.

486
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,650
Should I ask?

487
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,140
I'm making ice cubes.

488
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,900
Okay, Bonnie.

489
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,570
Pee-pee time.

490
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,110
Pee-pee time.

491
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,200
Hey, tough stuff.

492
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,800
How you feeling?

493
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,080
Fabulous.

494
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,370
You know what I'm going to
do when I get out of here?

495
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,560
No.

496
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,280
Teach you guitar.

497
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,590
We could get our own band going.

498
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,620
What do you say?

499
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,060
Okay.

500
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,160
It's my fault you're in here.

501
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:36,270
No, it's not. Come on.

502
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,900
But you could do me a favor.

503
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,930
Anything.

504
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,680
I need a drink.

505
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,380
Can you get me a lemonade?

506
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,530
- Okay.
- Thanks.

507
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,910
Okay, Rachel.

508
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,180
What do we know about ice?

509
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,890
It goes great with Scotch.

510
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,880
Yeah, well, off of
that, you know it's cold.

511
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,680
It's hard. It's crystalline.

512
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,480
And...

513
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,850
With normal water,

514
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,200
It floats.

515
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,110
Now, this ice is from the spring.

516
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,460
Our so-called "miracle water."

517
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,020
What kind of water makes
ice cubes that sink?

518
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,930
Very rare, very special kind
of water called heavy water.

519
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,400
The molecules in heavy water have
extra neutrons that make it, um...

520
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,260
heavier.

521
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,660
and in humans it has been
known to shrink cancer cells,

522
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,140
but this never occurred to me
because it's so incredibly rare.

523
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,710
But if it shrank Nicky's tumor, that
would make heavy water a good thing, right?

524
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,280
No. Heavy water is not a good thing.

525
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,470
It's really toxic.

526
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,930
It's like radiation except it's not
radioactive and it's practically undetectable.

527
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,710
However, it is the only substance
that can actually effect a change

528
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,200
in sleeping patterns in mammals.

529
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,300
The raccoon.

530
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,890
So, it's just a fluke that this
spring pops up full of heavy water?

531
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,720
No, no, it's not a fluke.

532
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,070
Only one in 5,000 water
molecules is heavy water.

533
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,370
Only human technology can
produce it in large quantities.

534
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,050
Even I know one use for heavy water.

535
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,150
Nuclear weapons.

536
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,510
So, this is the kind of
water worth killing for.

537
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:16,390
So, you're telling me that Dr. Reeves was
murdered by some nuclear terrorist here in Montana?

538
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,350
She was killed because she was
getting too close to the truth.

539
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,360
And Travis Dobbs was killed because he
wouldn't stop promoting s miracle stream.

540
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,240
Your radiology department's the only place
in the area actively producing nuclear waste

541
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,110
of any kind on a daily basis.

542
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,100
Now, I know it's small amounts
but it's real nonetheless, so...

543
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,470
where do you store it?

544
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,610
We've been doing electrical
repairs ever since the storm.

545
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,010
Look, is this really necessary?

546
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,060
Only if you want to find out
if you've been irradied or not.

547
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,880
It's normal levels of
background radiation.

548
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,070
Still use this?

549
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:11,340
No, it's one of the original water heaters
from when the hospital was built in the '50s.

550
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,630
- It hasn't been used in years.
- By you.

551
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,830
That is a centrifuge tube.

552
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,800
And it's used to make
heavy water by electrolysis.

553
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,720
See, with the right
amount of, uh, current,

554
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,120
you can split regular water molecules
leaving nothing behind but heavy water.

555
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,740
Yeah. There's some radiation.

556
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,600
Nothing dangerous, but
more than there should be.

557
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,780
Well, whoever was here probably used
the thalium 201 from your hospital's, uh,

558
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,760
stress tests, add the neutrons,
to change it to thalium 202,

559
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,840
thereby increasing the gamma ray count.

560
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,660
- Gamma rays?
- Yeah.

561
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,820
Puts the "dirty" in dirty bomb.

562
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,300
The heavy water must've been
stored in here in this tank.

563
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,490
Yep.

564
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,150
When the basement flooded, the water
pressure must've cracked the fittings.

565
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,220
The heavy water would've flowed out.

566
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:27,290
Into the hospital drains, down in the
water table that runs below ground.

567
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,180
The amount of pressure changed,
and found its way into the spring.

568
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,530
And gave Nicky his miracle.

569
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,280
Yeah, I think they must've
built a dirty bomb here.

570
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,940
Explains residual radiation.

571
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,180
Then took it with them.

572
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,310
Who did you hire to do
the electrical repairs?

573
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,070
Just our regular people.

574
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,370
Our chief maintenance
man and his assistant.

575
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,690
What are their names?

576
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,980
Brandon Hurdle and Ben Adams.

577
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:52,060
I think the symptoms all your patients have been
suffering from are caused by heavy water poisoning.

578
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,800
You need to flush it out
of their systems right away.

579
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,820
Brandon Hurdle has a degree in physical
chemistry from Emory University,

580
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,110
as well as a record of
weapons and explosives charges.

581
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,970
A little bit overqualified to be a
hospital maintenance man, don't you think?

582
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:06,880
What about Adams?

583
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,660
He was separated from the service
during basic training two years ago

584
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,510
for refusing to take orders from
a non-white recruit squad leader.

585
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,770
This is all very hard to believe.

586
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,130
Timothy McVay's neighbor
said the same thing.

587
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,830
Hold on, guys.

588
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,830
Agent Young speaking.

589
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,070
Got it. Stay on the line, please.

590
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,950
Local cops hit both
their homes. Nothing.

591
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,820
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

592
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,800
Hurdle has a house up at Kramer Lake.

593
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,370
He uses it during hunting season.

594
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,300
Really think these guys
have a dirty bomb in there?

595
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,060
Positive.

596
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,100
And now we're going to get a look at it using
my Bluetooth and the camera on their computer.

597
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,110
We got barely 50 milligrams.

598
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,270
More than enough to turn
Billings into ground zero.

599
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:14,100
A few dozen milligrams of that, a stick
of dynamite: a hell of a lot of damage.

600
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,400
All rit, when the
suspects exit the cabin,

601
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,310
I will order them to lay
down what's in their hands.

602
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,200
If they comply immediately,
we will take them into custody.

603
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,510
If they do not, we will
put them down. Understood?

604
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,600
- Copy that.
- Keep your head down.

605
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,510
This is the FBI!

606
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,710
Drop what you're carrying or we'll sot.

607
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,020
You bastards!

608
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,290
Hood!

609
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,330
The dirty bomb has
got to be in the case.

610
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,060
Don't touch that! Don't touch that.

611
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,750
Don't touch that.

612
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,080
Central, we're going to need
an ambulance dispatched...

613
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,560
Hi, Lily.

614
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,320
How are you feeling?

615
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,940
Better. At least for now.

616
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,840
Now's good. Nicky?

617
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,720
I think Special Agent
Young has something for you.

618
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,620
She likes you.

619
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,750
What do you say, Nicky?

620
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,970
You think you can give her a good home?

621
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,050
- Can I, Dad?
- Yeah.

622
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,410
Here you go.

623
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,010
Hey, little one.

624
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,340
I spoke with the director.

625
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,790
He said to tell you "good call."

626
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,900
So, the big question is, do
you believe in miracles now?

627
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,780
Define "miracle."

628
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,620
Well, if that storm hadn't hit,

629
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:07,890
Nicky Harris would still have cancer and half
of Billings, Montana could have been irradiated.

630
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,620
Sounds like a miracle to me.
