2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,487
Are you okay?

3
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:03,988
Hey, little man,
come on.

4
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:06,055
Try and get...
try and get his helmet off.

5
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:07,322
What happened?

6
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:08,322
Oh, my God.

7
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:10,921
God, he's not breathing.

8
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:19,050
Freddy St. John is

9
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,300
the third 11-year-old boy

10
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,753
to drop dead of a heart attack
in the last four weeks.

11
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,999
Otherwise perfectly healthy?

12
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:25,487
Yep.

13
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,925
All the local doctors
are stumped.

14
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:34,886
This town is desperate
for answers, Hood.

15
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:38,120
Welcome to Pooler,
Georgia.

16
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:40,237
Rachel,

17
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:40,707
look around.

18
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:42,886
What's missing?

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,253
Kids.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,300
There are no kids.

21
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,086
Something's put
the fear of God
in this place.

22
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:58,253
It's nothing to do with God.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,853
People fear
what they don't understand,

24
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,853
and right now
what they don't understand

25
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,652
is healthy 11-year-old boys

26
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,552
dropping dead
from heart attacks.

00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,175
How y'all doing?

30
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:29,050
Hi.

31
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,487
Bill Larsson.

32
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:33,287
Dr. Jacob Hood, Special
Science Advisor to the FBI.

33
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,287
This is
Special Agent Young.

34
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:36,654
Hi, there.

35
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,454
Listen, no disrespect,

36
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:42,254
but a lot of other doctors
have been here and none of 'em

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,987
come up with any answers.

38
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:46,621
Well, I'm not actually
that kind of doctor,

39
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:49,654
but I'll bear that in mind.

40
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,587
Well, if you'd like
to step this way,

41
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:55,953
the hospital administrator
is waiting for us.

42
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:03,581
<i>We've had to bring in
extra doctors</i>

43
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,863
<i>from Savannah and Garden City
just to cope.</i>

44
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:07,050
<i>Every parent</i>

45
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,717
with an 11-year-old boy
wants an EKG, a stress test,

46
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:11,450
and a CRT performed
on their son,

47
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:13,216
whether their insurance
can cover it or not.

48
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:15,216
Can't say I blame them.
Hmm.

49
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:16,417
Of the three victims,

50
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:17,983
none of them had
any indication

51
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,849
of a genetic disorder
or a history of heart trouble.

52
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,283
Blood tests
reveal nothing.

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,684
Autopsies came up negative

54
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,083
for anything
other than cardiac arrest.

55
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,517
Daniel Harker,
first victim,

56
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,849
11 years old,

57
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,717
<i>suffered from asthma;</i>

58
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:34,583
<i>the second victim
Peter LaTerriere,</i>

59
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,383
<i>11 years old, was...</i>

60
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,784
borderline obese;
and the third victim

61
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,550
<i>Freddy St. John</i>

62
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:41,183
was an athlete.

63
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:45,722
11-year-old kids don't just
drop dead of heart attacks.

64
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,216
This is my son
Stephen.

65
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:50,116
Mom, can I go home now?

66
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:51,949
Hi, Steve.

67
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,784
Go wait for me
by the nurses' station.

68
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,250
Nice to meet you.

69
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,216
Some of us parents
have decided

70
00:03:58,283 --> 00:03:59,317
to keep
our children home

71
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,617
until we know what's going on.

72
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,941
The school
really isn't

73
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,784
up to the standards
it should be these days,

74
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,816
though few of them are.

75
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:08,517
We'll start
at the school.

76
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,216
Mm-hmm.

77
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,050
<i>We need to check in</i>

78
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:15,116
with the office
upstairs.

79
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:17,116
Where are you going?

80
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:19,550
Just going to take a look
at something.

81
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,016
What are we supposed
to do?

82
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:25,717
Walk through the doors
like normal people.

83
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,417
And the bear said,
"You didn't really come here

84
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,050
to hunt, did you?"

85
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:38,684
No, thanks.

86
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,684
That bear.

87
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,517
I thought I told you
to wait for me

88
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,849
in the hallway.

89
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,410
I'm sorry. Sorry isn't good enough.

90
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,083
You should know better.

91
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,691
And you shouldn't be
spending time

92
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,083
with these kids.

93
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,016
You get back to my office.

94
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:58,517
Go.

95
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:04,754
I tell you.

96
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:07,216
I sure hope you and your partner
can get to the bottom of this.

97
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:10,983
Dr. Hood is not my partner.
He's my responsibility.

98
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,425
Oh, hi.

99
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,456
Well, you must be Dr. Hood.

100
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,183
I'm, uh, Charlie Craig.

101
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,949
I'm the principal here.

102
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:22,450
D- Do you mind telling me
exactly what it was that, uh,

103
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:23,849
you were doing
up there?

104
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,350
You got a CO pocket in
your ventilation shaft.

105
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,784
Um, a what?

106
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:28,916
Carbon monoxide.

107
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,717
There's a, a dip
in the shaft

108
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,738
where carbon monoxide
likes to accumulate.

109
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:33,583
I found a dead
rat in there.

110
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,113
It was poisoned
by the CO.

111
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:38,550
And, and you can tell that by...? Blood.

112
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:39,916
Blood.

113
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:42,883
Carbon monoxide clings
to the hemoglobin

114
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,717
and it turns the blood

115
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:47,050
kind of bright red.

116
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:48,644
You see how
my blood

117
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:51,350
from before
is much darker

118
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,383
than the blood
exposed to the CO.

119
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,216
And that- is this
what's killing the kids?

120
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:58,566
Carbon monoxide is potentially
lethal, but I don't think

121
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,684
your leak is big enough
to cause heart attacks.

122
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,883
However, it is a hazard.

123
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,116
You need to get
it checked out.

124
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:04,483
Rachel, Deputy,

125
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,383
let's check out the
rest of this place.

126
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:13,784
<i>Mom, I want to go back
to school.</i>

127
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:16,916
You will when
this is all over.

128
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:20,550
Who were those
people in here?

129
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:21,878
The government sent them

130
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:24,629
to find out what happened
to those boys.

131
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,250
Did you finish
your homework?

132
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,483
Yes.

133
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,383
I'm going to walk home, okay?

134
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,717
Alone?

135
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:35,150
You have to work
for another two hours.

136
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:36,650
Nothing's going to happen to me.

137
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:37,650
Honest.

138
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:39,016
You have your key?

139
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,183
Yeah.

140
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,393
All right, you call me
when you get home.

141
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:43,363
Okay?

142
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:45,650
I will.

143
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:46,949
Hey, get your backpack.

144
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:48,816
Oh, thanks.

145
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,150
Running your environmental
inspection of the school

146
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,150
was the easy part.

147
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:00,283
What do you mean?

148
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,150
From here on in,
every site we hit

149
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:04,983
comes with
grieving parents.

150
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,150
What exactly
are you looking for?

151
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:08,684
Anything that will help us learn

152
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,999
what brought on
Daniel's heart attack, ma'am.

153
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,450
Mind if I, uh...?

154
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,517
Are either of
you two into,

155
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,784
uh, computers?

156
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:30,583
No, that was our
son's thing, not ours.

157
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,949
Uh-huh.

158
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,450
Did you find
something on there?

159
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:35,550
No.

160
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:44,675
Mrs. Harker?

161
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,450
You should come
and take a look at this.

162
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,083
Well, it looks to me like, um,

163
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,250
like Daniel was making
some kind of video journal.

164
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:01,949
See, from all
these entries here,

165
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:05,050
it looks like it goes back
a long time, maybe, uh,

166
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:07,317
half a year.

167
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:09,150
Show you how it works.

168
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:13,925
Trisha Gordon smiled
twice at me today,

169
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,050
and I think
she switched places

170
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:16,317
in line with Cindy Mollo

171
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,738
so she'd wind up
on my softball team.

172
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:21,717
Girls are sort of stupid...

173
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:24,317
but she's kind of cool.

174
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:27,550
God.

175
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,983
Hey, Stephen,
Jesse got it.

176
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,883
Yeah, just like
I said I would.

177
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:58,016
You coming?

178
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,883
I guess.

179
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:03,216
Yeah.

180
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,316
I don't want to do this, Jesse.

181
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,550
Me neither.

182
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,483
Maybe we shouldn't,
Jesse.

183
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,831
I think it's dangerous.
Me, too.

184
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,949
Oh, chicken.

185
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,083
Chicken!

186
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,717
Come on, man.
Do it.

187
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:41,216
Show these wimps
how tough you are.

188
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:42,650
He's too scared.

189
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:44,925
Ha, ha, looky
what I got for you.

190
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:46,253
Ooh, look at that.

191
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,583
JESSE
Lick it. Lick it.

192
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,956
Come on, Stephen.
Lick it.

193
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,050
You got to lick it.

194
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:52,216
Do it, man.

195
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:53,417
Come on, chicken.

196
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:56,283
Come on. Lick it. Crazy, dude.

197
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,417
That's it.

198
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:00,815
You see anything
in there

199
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,628
that might be responsible
for these deaths?

200
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:03,784
Unfortunately, I haven't seen

201
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:06,300
anything in this town that
could be responsible for that.

202
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,175
It's Neal St. John,
Freddy's father.

203
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,383
You about to head
on over to my place,

204
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,216
see what I got at home
might have killed my son?

205
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:17,016
Take it easy, Neal, come on.
That's your brilliant plan, huh?

206
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,417
Take it easy. Sir, we're
just trying to find out

207
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:21,425
what caused
the heart attacks.

208
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:22,116
So what do you got

209
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:24,175
so far? That's none
of your concern, Neal.

210
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:25,999
Oh, no?!

211
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,644
Well, you're
wrong there, Bill.

212
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:28,175
No, Neal,

213
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm 100% right,

214
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,266
and unless you
want to commemorate

215
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,200
your son's tragic death
by getting thrown in jail,

216
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,050
you'll back off.

217
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:41,066
Who the hell are you?

218
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,567
Mr. St. John,
all that's important is

219
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,899
I'm here to find out exactly
what or who killed your son.

220
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:53,233
All right.

221
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,367
But I can't wait forever.

222
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,899
Go home.

223
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:06,200
Maybe we can call
a parent meeting at the school.

224
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,133
You know, you bring everybody
together and you talk

225
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,667
to them at once.

226
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,033
Maybe.

227
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,734
Just sit down.

228
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,033
Just calm...
Going now.

229
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,866
All right, let me just
get this rolling.

230
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,200
Sit down.
Come on, everybody.

231
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,600
Let us get it going.

232
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,467
Bill, this isn't good, boy.

233
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,767
Uh, can I have
you two come down?

234
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,600
Can't you see that you're not...

235
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,600
All right, quiet.
Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

236
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,533
Quiet, please. Please.

237
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,533
Calm down, everybody.

238
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,800
Just calm down.

239
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:35,200
We're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

240
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:36,734
We're gonna get
to the bottom of it.

241
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,565
Now, I want to thank y'all
for coming tonight.

242
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,633
We're not interested
in thanks.

243
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,675
We want to know
if our kids are safe!

244
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:44,667
Y'all quiet down.

245
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,100
Should we
be leaving town?

246
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,300
I mean how are you gonna protect
our kids?

247
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:50,999
Now let's not get

248
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,567
hysterical, but, all
now, listen to me.

249
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,133
Everybody, just calm
down please.

250
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,467
Now, the government
is trying to help.

251
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:56,567
They have sent us

252
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,734
a scientist
from the FBI.

253
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,033
He's gonna help us.

254
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,400
I want to... I want
to introduce him to you.

255
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,567
His name is Dr. Jacob Hood.

256
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:04,925
Dr. Hood.

257
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,999
Hood?

258
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:19,166
Hood?

259
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,667
Hood.

260
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:35,500
They're waiting for us
back in the auditorium.

261
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,633
No drugs or viruses.

262
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,667
No poisons.

263
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:42,400
No visible signs
of bruising,

264
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:45,066
trauma, or stress.

265
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:50,066
Common denominators:
same age, same sex, same school.

266
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,066
So what am I missing?

267
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,333
We came here

268
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,800
to talk to the parents.

269
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,500
So, don't you think
that we should head on...

270
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,300
Are you okay?

271
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,567
Who... who are you?

272
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:10,767
We're here to help you.

273
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,166
I'm Dr. Hood, Stephen.

274
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,999
We met at the hospital.

275
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:20,550
I... I have to find my mom.

276
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,899
Stephen. Come on.

277
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:25,237
Breathe deeply.

278
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,600
He's hyperventilating.

279
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,367
Chatham County.

280
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,266
McKinley Elementary
School.

281
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,100
We need an ambulance.

282
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,500
It could be
cardiac arrest.

283
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:36,467
Mom!

284
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,933
Stephen,

285
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,766
you scared me.

286
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,466
I could have lost you.

287
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,500
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,166
What happened?

289
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:52,500
You never went home.
Where did you go?

290
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,867
Hello again,

291
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,366
Stephen.

292
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,199
Dr. Hood?

293
00:13:58,266 --> 00:13:59,533
That's right.

294
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,700
How are you feeling?

295
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,032
Stephen,

296
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,999
tell me what happened.

297
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:08,612
Stephen,

298
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:10,166
who are you protecting?

299
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,399
Get it off!

300
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:15,500
No, Stephen, don't!

301
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:16,700
He's terrified of needles!

302
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:17,566
Can we get a nurse?

303
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:19,266
Right here.

304
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,633
Thank you very much.

305
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,566
The tox panel shows traces
of bufotenin.

306
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,500
What the hell
is bufotenin?

307
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:29,691
It's a hallucinogenic,

308
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:33,032
and it's more than capable
of causing a heart attack.

309
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,733
He was with a boy
named Jesse Freeman

310
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,166
out by the swamp.

311
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,099
They were getting high.

312
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,833
He wouldn't tell me with what.

313
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
Thank you, Mrs. Brown.

314
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
That's... that's helpful.

315
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:49,600
Jesse Freeman.

316
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,833
Mrs. LaTerriere

317
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,333
mentioned him, too.

318
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,199
Where'd they get the bufotenin?

319
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,867
You can find it
in mushrooms,

320
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:59,600
but more commonly in the skin
of a very special toad.

321
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,700
That's a black
swamp snake, Rachel.

322
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,533
Don't worry.

323
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,867
He's perfectly harmless.

324
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,900
That right there
is just a baby.

325
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,266
Yum, yum.

326
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,800
Pretty damn tasty.

327
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,933
There's one
right there!

328
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,900
Hood, what exactly
are we looking for

329
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,366
<i>here?
Bufo alvarius.</i>

330
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:22,032
Colorado River toad.

331
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,399
In Georgia?

332
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,967
That's the species
that carries the bufotenin.

333
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,967
These kids must have got it
somewhere.

334
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:31,132
This swamp is the closest thing
we got

335
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,132
to a toad's natural habitat
in this area.

336
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,700
Hello.

337
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:45,956
I know
you.

338
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:50,700
I got him.

339
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,633
Ribbit.

340
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,066
See, this little guy-

341
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:59,237
say hello.

342
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:01,566
When he's agitated
like that,

343
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,633
he secretes this poison,
which is a hallucinogen

344
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,967
bufotenin.

345
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,633
What people normally do
is they...

346
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,299
they burn off
the poisonous element,

347
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,933
and render it harmless;
then they smoke it.

348
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:14,299
But if it's harmless, then
why did Stephen have a seizure?

349
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:15,466
Well, I think what

350
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,466
our kids have been doing is, uh,

351
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,733
a thing called "toad licking. "

352
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,425
You, uh, get him agitated.

353
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,488
Kind of like
he is now.

354
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,456
Soon as he starts
to secrete the poison,

355
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:29,706
you lick it, get very high.

356
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:31,800
That's sick.

357
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,967
But if toad-licking
caused

358
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:35,399
the cardiac arrests,

359
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,233
then why didn't the other boys
test positive

360
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,500
for the bufotenin?

361
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:40,500
Rachel, that's a very
good question.

362
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,066
Well, I got
another one for you.

363
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:46,300
How does a Colorado River toad
end up in a Georgia swamp?

364
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,967
That's simple.

365
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,333
Someone brought him.

366
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,566
But who?

367
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,700
I think we should ask
Jesse Freeman.

368
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:54,999
He seems to be
our local toad pusher.

369
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,566
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, Jesse.

370
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,867
Where'd you get the toads?

371
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,700
Stephen Brown
almost had a heart attack

372
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,967
because of it.

373
00:17:05,032 --> 00:17:07,700
You give it to any
of the boys that died?

374
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,199
No way.

375
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,833
I never hang
with any of those losers

376
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,366
except for school

377
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,378
when I got no choice.

378
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,366
Jesse,

379
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,366
why don't you do
your mom a favor

380
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,633
and be straight
with us?

381
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,166
If you cooperate,
I'll get the deputy here

382
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,113
to keep you
out of this.

383
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,099
Tell them, Jesse.

384
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:35,566
All right.

385
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:38,378
I took them
from Lizzie Summers' place.

386
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,266
I didn't mean
for anyone to get hurt.

387
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,666
Just wanted to have some fun.

388
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,733
Okay.

389
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,766
Thank you.

390
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,233
What's Stephen's mom
doing here?

391
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,733
Lizzie Summers has been in town
for about three years.

392
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,066
She set up shop out here

393
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:28,166
as a homeopathic
pharmacist.

394
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,867
Miss Summers!

395
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:45,466
Deputy, how can I help you?

396
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,132
Miss Summers,

397
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:49,132
these folks are
from Washington, DC.

398
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:51,166
They're here
to help us find out

399
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:53,199
how those young
boys died.

400
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,233
Special Agent Rachel Young

401
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,175
from the FBI.
Hi.

402
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:59,066
Dr. Jacob Hood.

403
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,433
<i>The Jacob Hood?</i>

404
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,199
Um... I suppose.

405
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:06,366
I read your paper
on dark matter.

406
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,600
"Unknown,

407
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,933
"intangible, immeasurable

408
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,597
and yet without it,
the heavens would fall. "

409
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,433
I was rooting for you to win
the Nobel Prize that year.

410
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,099
Oh, well, if you were,
you're one of only three people

411
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,132
in the western hemisphere,
but thanks nonetheless.

412
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:20,833
Yeah.

413
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,833
Do you grow, uh,

414
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,500
<i>sceletium tortuosum?</i>

415
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:25,999
Oh, yeah, and kanna.

416
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,032
I use it as an
anti-anxiety remedy.

417
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,299
Yeah, but it's much more
than that, isn't it?

418
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:32,299
Kanna goes back
to prehistoric times.

419
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,900
Early hunter-gatherers used it
as an appetite suppressant

420
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,299
so they could hunt

421
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:38,199
for days
without going hungry.

422
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:43,112
But show us where you keep
your Colorado River toads.

423
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,233
You have quite a variety
of dangerous animals

424
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,566
and insects here.

425
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:53,666
Well, sometimes
the most

426
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,199
dangerous venoms and poisons

427
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:56,900
serve as lifesavers.

428
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,233
What do you do
with the toads?

429
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,666
Oh, homeopathic
erectile dysfunction medication.

430
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,666
I sell it
over the Internet,

431
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,733
along with other remedies.

432
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,766
Miss Summers,

433
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,233
we found bufotenin

434
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,366
in the blood
of an 11-year-old boy

435
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:15,733
who nearly had
a heart attack.

436
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,666
Jesse Freeman

437
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,466
said he got the toad
that produced it here.

438
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,433
I keep this shed very secure.

439
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,433
Now, these... these toads,
they breed like rabbits,

440
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,266
so it's very hard
to keep a head count.

441
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,766
Now, if someone wants
to take a chance

442
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,099
and come in and steal one,

443
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,800
I don't see what I can do
to stop it.

444
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,299
But if I've got
to string up razor wire,

445
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,433
I might as well move
back to the city.

446
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,466
Yeah, well, maybe
if you'd stayed in the city

447
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:50,066
all three of these young boys
might still be alive.

448
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse.

449
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:25,299
What's up, honey?

450
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:29,050
Mommy, why is Jesse so cold?

451
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:46,833
No!

452
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:00,987
It's rather late.

453
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:01,987
I'm sorry
about the hour,

454
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,621
Beatrice, but we need
to speak with you.

455
00:22:04,688 --> 00:22:05,920
My son is asleep.

456
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:07,554
He's been through
a terrible time.

457
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:10,487
Jesse Freeman is dead.

458
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:13,020
Another
heart attack.

459
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:19,175
Well, I feel for his mother.

460
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:22,787
God knows she's suffered a lot
because of him.

461
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:24,521
Nothing to what she'll suffer
now that he's dead.

462
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,128
What were
you doing

463
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:28,534
outside the Freeman house
today, Mrs. Brown?

464
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:30,378
I went to give that boy
a piece of my mind

465
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:32,277
and to tell him
to stay away from my son.

466
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,945
Then I saw that
you beat me to it.

467
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:39,362
Do you mind if I take a look
at your bathroom, your kitchen?

468
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:40,113
Why?

469
00:22:40,113 --> 00:22:43,237
To satisfy
my... scientific curiosity.

470
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:46,487
Help yourself.

471
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:47,787
Thank you. Through here?

472
00:22:47,854 --> 00:22:49,019
Mm-hmm.

473
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:12,581
No TV?

474
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:13,320
We don't have a TV.

475
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:15,720
It's an unnecessary
distraction.

476
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,553
Did you find what
you were looking for,

477
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,220
Dr. Hood?

478
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,487
Not yet, Mrs. Brown.

479
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:32,253
Thank you. Good night.

480
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,190
Well, that was an interesting
response to Jesse's death.

481
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,425
I'll say.

482
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:40,687
I didn't find
any environmental toxins

483
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,019
that could cause
heart attacks in children.

484
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:44,628
WOMAN ... Could you
get there right away?

485
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:46,894
Word travels fast.

486
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:49,113
Freddy St. John's dad heard
about the toad venom.

487
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:51,479
Went out to Lizzie Summers'
place and busted it up.

488
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:53,988
I'm gonna go pick him up.

489
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:58,878
Miss Summers.

490
00:23:58,878 --> 00:23:59,988
We heard what happened.

491
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,316
Are you okay?

492
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,800
No. Not really.

493
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:08,712
I don't get someone taking
their anger out on plants.

494
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:17,999
Deputy Larsson is arresting

495
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,733
Neal St. John
at his home.

496
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:22,932
No, no, I'm not
gonna press charges.

497
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,433
I just...

498
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:26,800
I can't be angry at a man
who just lost his son.

499
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,266
I could use a drink.

500
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:32,800
Want to join me?

501
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:34,433
Sure.

502
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:38,190
Lizzie?

503
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:38,987
Huh?

504
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:41,175
Do you always
wear these gloves?

505
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:43,099
Whenever I'm handling
poisonous plants.

506
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:46,499
<i>Poison? You mean, like
Digitalis purpurea?</i>

507
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:49,633
I didn't see it
in your garden.

508
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,425
Well, I don't grow it here.

509
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,399
There's no need.

510
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:54,166
It grows wild
all over the fields.

511
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:55,366
How did you know?

512
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,433
Purple petals.

513
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:00,099
Can you show us where?

514
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:05,965
There they are.

515
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:12,899
<i>Digitalis purpurea.</i>

516
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:14,533
Mm-hmm.

517
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,599
Foxglove.

518
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,299
Incredibly toxic plant.

519
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:23,633
Several medicinal properties.

520
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,932
Primarily, uh, heart medication.

521
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:26,999
Mm-hmm.

522
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:28,862
Why is it called foxglove?

523
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,499
Well, it's an old wife's tale
from medieval days.

524
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:32,425
They believed that

525
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:35,366
the foxes would put
their paws in the flowers

526
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,366
to cover the sound of them
creeping up on the chickens.

527
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,599
Quite deadly, though,
you get the dosage wrong.

528
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,433
I know what you're thinking,
but you're wasting your time.

529
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,132
After the first boy died,

530
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:48,488
<i>I contacted the hospital
and suggested Digitalis.</i>

531
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:49,599
Oh, yeah?

532
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,132
It didn't show up
in the blood test

533
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,700
of any of the victims.

534
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:55,266
Hmm.

535
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,266
Well,

536
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:00,166
that's our mystery
then, isn't it?

537
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:02,733
Just to satisfy
my curiosity,

538
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,925
do you use foxglove to
make heart medication?

539
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:06,800
That's right.
And for?

540
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,333
Anyone in town?

541
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,266
There's one person-
Sam Tewsbury.

542
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,466
The school
math teacher.

543
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:14,932
Well, according to Larsson,

544
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,865
Tewsbury is well-liked
in the town,

545
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:19,066
and the kids love him
as a teacher,

546
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:21,999
but that wasn't always the case.

547
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,316
Oh. Explain.

548
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,050
Well, back in the day,
he was the first

549
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,099
African-American teacher
at the school.

550
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,333
The grandparents
of at least one

551
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,366
of the victims wanted him

552
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:34,128
kicked out
of town.

553
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:35,238
Right.

554
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:37,232
He took a lot of abuse.

555
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,965
Could be motive.

556
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,066
Avenging the sins of the father.

557
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:44,965
Why do it now,
after all these years?

558
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:46,499
He's old

559
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:47,932
and sick.

560
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,999
He's looking to settle the score
before he dies.

561
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,366
Hmm.

562
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,132
People get a
little crazy

563
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,066
in their old age
sometimes.

564
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:58,633
Sometimes at a slightly
younger age.

565
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,733
It's called dementia.

566
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,099
And I could go at any time.

567
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,832
Sorry this is all
I can offer you

568
00:27:07,832 --> 00:27:09,899
this time of evening.

569
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:11,847
Homemade lemonade.

570
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,599
Thank you.

571
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,613
Please.

572
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:17,238
You have an impressive
collection of early

573
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:20,666
math and philosophy editions,
Mr. Tewsbury.

574
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:22,766
Avicenna.

575
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:25,266
<i>Descartes. Rules
For the Direction Of the Mind.</i>

576
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,932
Rene Descartes.

577
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:29,832
Oh, he was an innovator.

578
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,599
Hmm.
"Accept nothing

579
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,832
as true that is... "

580
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,113
Not self-evident. "

581
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:37,999
"And always
recheck the reasoning

582
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:39,175
behind every
problem. "

583
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:41,099
You have congestive
heart disease?

584
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,733
Something tells me that

585
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,566
you know that I do.

586
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:54,366
You also use a

587
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:56,399
homeopathic medicine

588
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,366
that Lizzie Summers makes from

589
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,433
<i>Digitalis purpurea.</i>

590
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:04,800
Thought we were here

591
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,899
to talk about the children
I teach, Dr. Hood.

592
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,266
Yup.

593
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,999
The dead ones.

594
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,099
Who all died from heart attacks.

595
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,333
Several witnesses
place you at the hospital

596
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,366
after each of the
students' deaths.

597
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:21,099
I was concerned
about my students.

598
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,378
They've been having
a hell of a time.

599
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,800
And now,

600
00:28:29,865 --> 00:28:32,700
I'm going to ask both of you
to leave my house

601
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:34,766
right now.

602
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:42,066
Thank you for your time.

603
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:52,519
All right, I want you all
to copy these down

604
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:55,232
and turn them
in tomorrow.

605
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:56,633
Quit it!

606
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,266
You suck!

607
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,433
Hey! Hey!

608
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:03,366
I'm gonna kick your ass!

609
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,700
Hey, break it up!

610
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:05,865
CHILDREN
Fight! Fight!

611
00:29:05,932 --> 00:29:07,533
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

612
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,733
Fight! Fight! Fight!

613
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,566
What's gotten

614
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,366
into you boys?! Hey!

615
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,700
Hey! That's it! Quiet!

616
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:16,112
Now, what's gotten
into you two?

617
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:18,253
He started it! He was kicking
the back of my chair.

618
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:19,800
No, I wasn't,
you liar!

619
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,691
Quiet! You know,
I'm really disappointed

620
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:24,050
in both of you.

621
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:27,599
I wish you were dead
like the others.

622
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,899
What are you saying?

623
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:32,433
You kids know something
about these deaths?

624
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,800
If you do, tell me!

625
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:42,050
You two ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

626
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,399
Come on.
Get out of here.

627
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:48,466
Get your stuff.

628
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:16,366
We've retested
Jesse Freeman's blood twice

629
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,366
<i>for every variation
on Digitalis.</i>

630
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:20,366
Negative all the way.

631
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:21,932
Are you sure?

632
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,499
Twice.

633
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:02,550
"Best teacher in school. "

634
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,099
<i>Well, we'll check that out.</i>

635
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,766
Thank you.

636
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:33,132
That was Lizzie Summers.

637
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:35,299
Sam Tewsbury
ordered more

638
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:36,472
heart medication from her,
but he didn't pick it up.

639
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:39,865
She's been calling him
all day. No answer.

640
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,999
Mr. Tewsbury?!

641
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:50,099
Mr. Tewsbury?!

642
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:53,766
Sam?!

643
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:11,738
Mr. Tewsbury?

644
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,112
He's dead.

645
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:31,166
<i>"Thus Spake...?"</i>

646
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,366
<i>Zarathustra.</i>

647
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:34,733
Don't touch it.

648
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,487
What is it?

649
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:57,199
Foxglove.

650
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,733
Somebody

651
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,865
went to a lot of time,
and a lot of patience

652
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:04,299
into sticking these pages
together with it.

653
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,566
How are sticky pages
gonna kill somebody?

654
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:08,366
Well, it depends how you read.

655
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,865
But if you lick your fingers
to turn the pages,

656
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:12,965
you'll probably end up
ingesting the poison that way.

657
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,999
Catherine De Medici,

658
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:17,899
16th century France,
she used this method

659
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:20,488
to kill most of her enemies.

660
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:24,800
I need to see everything
the victims were wearing

661
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:26,499
or carrying
at the time of their deaths.

662
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:28,232
I'm gonna call this in.
I'll get right on it.

663
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,333
Thank you.

664
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,999
Nietzsche?

665
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:36,675
Someone around here is...
killing off the weak.

666
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:38,566
Clearing a path
for the Ubermensch.

667
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,599
The Over-Man.

668
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:41,932
Rachel.

669
00:33:42,865 --> 00:33:43,899
I'm going to need some

670
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:45,466
buff-tailed bumblebees.

671
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,865
In the bathroom.

672
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,499
Here you go.

673
00:33:57,832 --> 00:33:59,700
Why are we in the bathroom,
Hood?

674
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:01,366
'Cause we want
a clean environment

675
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,099
with no pollen
distractions.

676
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,865
If there's foxglove on any
of the victims' possessions,

677
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:08,999
it's gonna be the first thing
our little friends are gonna be
attracted to.

678
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,299
Here we go.

679
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:14,166
I think I'll wait out
on the porch

680
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:15,700
if y'all don't mind.

681
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,333
Yeah, that's a lot of bees.

682
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,099
Here's your gloves.

683
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,666
Oh, thank you.
Put your helmet on.

684
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:41,032
There they go.

685
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,466
They're going right

686
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,366
for the foxglove in
the victims' belongings:

687
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:45,800
tote container,

688
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,232
asthma inhaler,

689
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:49,466
lunch box,

690
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,733
and Freddy St. John's
bicycle.

691
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:56,232
<i>Foxglove was on all</i>

692
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:57,499
the victims' belongings.

693
00:34:57,566 --> 00:34:59,299
So now we know what caused
their heart attacks.

694
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:02,199
<i>Digitalis purpurea didn't show
in any of the autopsies. Why?</i>

695
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,466
I want to do DNA tests on all
the victims and their parents.

696
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,099
But don't have
the hospital lab do it.

697
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,666
Get your boys at Quantico
to take care of it.

698
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:13,266
Okay, sweetie.

699
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,766
Bye.

700
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:18,499
DNA results.
Get this.

701
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,032
According to the
blood samples

702
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,533
this hospital
gave Quantico,

703
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,599
none of the dead boys
are related to their parents.

704
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:25,932
That's ridiculous.

705
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,932
I've known those families
for a long time.

706
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,399
Seen most of them
get brought home

707
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:30,865
from the hospital.
I'm with the sheriff.

708
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:33,399
Somebody must've switched
the blood samples.

709
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,166
No...

710
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,132
Hold on.

711
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:48,899
Hold on.

712
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:50,299
What'd you find?

713
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,099
According to these DNA markers,

714
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,800
all the blood
must come from

715
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:05,333
one pubescent boy.

716
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,666
Maybe the school
is the source of our deaths.

717
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:14,132
Not the environment.

718
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,533
A student.

719
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,434
Do you have a plan?

720
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:21,533
More like a hypothesis.

721
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,000
Care to let me
in on it?

722
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:26,050
Trust me.

723
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,565
Does he actually know
what he's doing?

724
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:29,925
Most of the time.

725
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,167
All right, settle down.

726
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,487
Settle down.
Everybody pay attention.

727
00:36:34,487 --> 00:36:35,800
Up here.
Settle down.

728
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:39,300
All right.
All ready for you.

729
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,867
Thank you.

730
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:50,175
I'm Jacob Hood.

731
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,050
I'm a scientist,

732
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,067
and I work
with the, uh, FBI.

733
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:57,200
Now, uh...

734
00:36:57,267 --> 00:37:00,367
I met your math teacher,

735
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:05,363
Sam Tewsbury,
before he died.

736
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:06,533
As you know, Sam,

737
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,900
he gave his life to this school.

738
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:11,566
Before he died, he asked me

739
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:15,234
to come up
with a math problem for you

740
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,501
as a sort of challenge.

741
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:19,034
He said some of you were

742
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,167
getting too smart for him.

743
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:24,700
Even though he's not here,

744
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:28,100
I'd like to...

745
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:35,987
...give you a chance to solve
my problem for him.

746
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:39,034
Oh, and the winner

747
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,867
gets a genuine pair
of FBI handcuffs.

748
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:50,933
Pay attention.

749
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,401
Good.

750
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:56,300
So the first stage "F"

751
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,434
of a rocket burns 25 seconds

752
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:02,600
longer than the second stage,
which we'll call "S."

753
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:06,100
Now, if the total burning time
for both stages

754
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:10,401
is 145 seconds,

755
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:15,925
s each stage burn?

756
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,833
Anybody?

757
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,867
Anyone?

758
00:38:29,347 --> 00:38:31,050
No?

759
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:35,925
Okay.

760
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:39,050
Tell you what I'll do.

761
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:42,700
I will leave this on the board

762
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:44,700
till tomorrow.

763
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:46,815
We'll just have

764
00:38:46,815 --> 00:38:48,690
to wait and see
what you can do.

765
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:53,675
Thank you very much.

766
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:54,988
Back to you.

767
00:39:19,134 --> 00:39:22,175
It's purple, Stephen.

768
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:24,363
But it's not foxglove.

769
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,467
Actually, it's a dye

770
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:29,941
from a Japanese indigo.

771
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:31,550
Just a little taste

772
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,767
of your own medicine.

773
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:38,334
Except this plant
won't kill you.

774
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,425
We need to talk about why you
killed your classmates, Stephen.

775
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,222
He didn't kill
those little bastards.

776
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:47,894
I did.

777
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:50,000
Mom.
Shut up, Stephen!

778
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:52,237
Mrs. Brown,
please step back.

779
00:39:52,237 --> 00:39:53,134
I killed them.

780
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
I had access

781
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:56,167
to the toxicology lab
at the hospital.

782
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:58,503
I used Stephen's blood.
I switched the samples.

783
00:39:58,503 --> 00:40:01,367
Every one of those kids
was nothing but trouble.

784
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,000
They had my son drinking
beer, getting high.

785
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,362
Your mom's trying

786
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:06,867
to protect you, Stephen.

787
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:09,300
She obviously

788
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,367
loves you very much.

789
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:13,334
But we know, though,

790
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:16,666
<i>she wouldn't be able
to whip up Digitalis</i>

791
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:18,833
from foxglove plants.

792
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:23,691
You could've, though.

793
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:24,867
Couldn't you?

794
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:28,501
Incidentally, uh,
the deputies,

795
00:40:28,566 --> 00:40:31,300
they found your,
um, chemistry kit.

796
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,675
It was covered in foxglove.

797
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:35,237
No, it's not his. It's mine!

798
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:36,467
No!
Stop!

799
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,733
Mrs. Brown,
the serial numbers

800
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
on the lab equipment
are from the school.

801
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,440
For God's sake,
he's only 11 years old!

802
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,740
He's all I have left.

803
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:45,907
Do you understand that?
Stop it, Mom.

804
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:49,206
You shouldn't get in trouble
for what I did.

805
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,074
I had to kill them.

806
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,673
They were
holding me back.

807
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,306
They were holding
the whole school back.

808
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,206
The whole school was suffering

809
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:01,873
because of those
stupid kids.

810
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,640
Because of how bad

811
00:41:03,707 --> 00:41:06,040
our overall grades
and test scores were.

812
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:07,273
Even some
of the teachers

813
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,907
were leaving for other schools.

814
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:10,800
Somebody had to do something.

815
00:41:11,128 --> 00:41:13,206
Why Sam Tewsbury?

816
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,940
I saw Mr. Tewsbury
in the classroom.

817
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,940
I heard him
question the kids.

818
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,573
I was certain he suspected a kid
was behind all the deaths.

819
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,425
It was only a matter of time

820
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:27,273
before he figured
everything out.

821
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:29,506
He was a smart man.

822
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,239
Almost as smart as me.

823
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:35,973
So you sent him
Nietzsche's book?

824
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,239
My mom's copy, actually.

825
00:41:38,306 --> 00:41:40,040
It's her code
to live by.

826
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:43,206
"What doesn't kill me
makes me stronger. "

827
00:41:43,273 --> 00:41:46,040
You took quite a risk,
licking the toad venom.

828
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,473
Why?

829
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,174
To blend in with the others.

830
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:51,675
Throw suspicion off myself.

831
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,473
You drew your own blood,
switched the samples

832
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,107
and you made your mom believe
you were terrified of needles.

833
00:41:58,174 --> 00:42:00,007
I made her believe
a lot of things.

834
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,815
When was it going to end?

835
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:07,238
When someone was smart enough
to stop me, I guess.

836
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:09,425
Did you know that
the comic book,

837
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:12,640
<i>Superman, was actually based
on Nietzsche's philosophy?</i>

838
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:18,074
"Up, up and away... "

839
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:30,840
How'd you like to be
the court-appointed psychiatrist

840
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:32,740
whose full-time job
is observing

841
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:34,940
little Stephen Brown
for a decade or two?

842
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:38,707
I can think of worse things
to do for a day.

843
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:43,074
So, Hood...

844
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,640
what were you like
as an 11-year-old boy?

845
00:42:49,238 --> 00:42:51,675
I was kind of like
Stephen, I guess.

846
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:55,406
I wanted to compete
with the best.

847
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:57,925
But it's hard to know
how good you are,

848
00:42:57,925 --> 00:42:59,573
if you kill off the competition.

849
00:43:02,074 --> 00:43:04,540
Well, I for one am relieved

850
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:07,040
that you used that brain
of yours for good.

851
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:08,606
Thank you.

852
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:10,873
Maybe I just
never got caught.

853
