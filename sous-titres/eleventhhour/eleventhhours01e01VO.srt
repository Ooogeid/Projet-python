1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,700
<i>Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.</i>

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,600
This is unit 25.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,300
In pursuit of tan pickup,
refuses to stop.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,900
WOMAN
25, copy.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,400
<i>Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.</i>

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Forgive them, Father,
for what they've done.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,100
My God.

8
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,600
That makes 19 of them, sir.

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,900
19 containers...

10
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
19 fetuses.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
Is this the last one?

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,100
Yeah.

13
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,900
Hey, there's a guy
from Washington, DC

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,300
in the evidence tent.

15
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,300
Sorry. Who did you say
you work for?

16
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,300
I didn't.

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,400
What the hell's
going on here?

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
Do you have a badge?

19
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,200
I'm Detective McNeil.

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,900
I'm in charge of this case.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Sorry.

22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,800
But you came up on him
too quick.

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,400
Good morning.

24
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm Dr. Jacob Hood.

25
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,600
Special science advisor
to the FBI.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,900
And that's Special
Agent Rachel Young.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,200
Science advisor?

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Yeah, I was appointed
to investigate

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,600
crimes and crises
of a scientific nature.

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,200
What you found here
certainly falls

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
under that category,
wouldn't you say?

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,500
You.

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,000
Out.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,600
You mean the 19 dead babies

35
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,600
and 19 graves
that didn't dig themselves.

36
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
That's not accurate;
what you've got here

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
is 19 terminated fetuses.

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,600
You drink milk from a carton?

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,900
Why?

40
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,000
The barcode on the carton

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,500
is the same principle
as a DNA profile.

42
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,100
DNA is a personal
barcode.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Each one is different,
therefore unique.

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,600
Now, this... is the profile

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,800
of the 12-week-old fetus

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,700
that was thrown from
the truck last night.

47
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,500
And this is a profile

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,400
of the first one
you dug up.

49
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,800
Spot the difference.
I dare you.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
I can't.

51
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,800
Of course you can't.

52
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,600
Because they're identical.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,600
All 19 of them.

54
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,300
Do you know anything
about cloning?

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
Remember Dolly the sheep?

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
Yeah.

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Well, this abomination

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
is what happens when you try it
with human beings.

????

63
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,900
What's he need you for?

64
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Dr. Hood is
a high-priority asset.

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,200
He's a brilliant
biophysicist,

66
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,000
but he spends most of
his time in his head,

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
so I have to
watch his back.

68
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,600
About a year ago,

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
some radical group
had his car bombed.

70
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,300
You want to
see him blush,

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
ask him where
the shrapnel is.

72
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,700
You see,

73
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,900
he's got this annoying habit
of telling the truth,

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,300
and the truth hurts
a lot of people's pockets.

75
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,100
And no, I'm not free for dinner.

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
It's in the eyes,
Detective McNeil.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,500
David?

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,100
David?

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
David?

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
Has anyone seen my son?

81
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,700
David?

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
The judge told you
to leave us alone.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
It's a free
country, Kelly.

84
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,400
I can move to any
city I want to,

85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
just like you did.

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,900
Kid's got a right to
see his dad, you know?

87
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
Not after what you did to me.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,900
Let go of my son.

89
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,000
Wait for Mommy
over there, okay?

90
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,500
Well...

91
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,900
I notice you've
been keeping busy.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm taking care of us,

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,800
which is more than you ever did.

94
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,400
Don't say that,

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,900
and then walk
away from me!

96
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,900
Hey, you leave her alone!

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,500
Should I call the police?

98
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
This guy you arrested

99
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,000
is not a microbiologist,
by any chance, is he?

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,100
He's an unemployed
security guard.

101
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,900
No priors.

102
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,700
He said that someone
was paying him

103
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,200
to incinerate the containers;
then once he found out

104
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,300
what was in them, he couldn't
bring himself to do it.

105
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,600
How come you
don't know

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
who's behind all
this cloning stuff?

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,600
You seem to know
everything else.

108
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
There's someone
we've been chasing

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,500
for a long time,
and his first attempts

110
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,600
at human cloning
were in Eastern Europe,

111
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,700
then South America.

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
Both failed.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,400
Now I believe he's come here.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,100
The question is, why?

115
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,400
So, what's next?

116
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,100
Can you recommend a good hotel?

117
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,800
Kelly?

118
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,700
It's Mrs. Muller.

119
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,100
I've come
to get you.

120
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,500
Kelly, can I come in?

121
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,400
I trusted you people.

122
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
That's why I'm here.

123
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,200
Your own personal nurse.

124
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,100
Let me help you.

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,500
Please.

126
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Hi.

127
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
So, I'm gonna charge Sanders

128
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,600
with accessory to murder.

129
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,700
That will get him talking.

130
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,000
A judge will ask why.

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,900
Technically, a fetus
is medical waste.

132
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,000
It's not murder.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
What, so I've got nothing?

134
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Breathe, McNeil.

135
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,900
You got a crime here,
a big crime.

136
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,200
I wouldn't be here
if you didn't.

137
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,000
Implanting a woman

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
with an embryo
created by any means

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
other than fertilization
is illegal.

140
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
Yeah, but it's not murder,

141
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
which means I've wasted
too much time already.

142
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,200
Tell me you didn't
just say wasted.

143
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,500
Anything that helps us,
Detective,

144
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,600
call me.

145
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
He's just doing his job.

146
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,400
19 fetuses.

147
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,800
You know
what that means?

148
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,500
19 mothers.

149
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,600
How do you keep them all quiet?

150
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Is the baby okay?

151
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,900
Please tell me.

152
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,600
Kelly, in a minute.

153
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,200
I just keep thinking

154
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
about that childless couple,

155
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,100
and it would break their hearts
if I lost this baby.

156
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,900
That's a nice
thought, Kelly.

157
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,500
Keep that thought.

158
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,500
What is it?

159
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,400
What's wrong?

160
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,600
It's the placenta.

161
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,300
It's lying a little low

162
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
and blocking the entrance
to the womb.

163
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,600
Is that bad?
You just relax.

164
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,900
Nature has a way
of making things right.

165
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,300
If something
did go wrong,

166
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,200
I would still get

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,700
the money,
wouldn't I?

168
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,100
That childless couple
you're so concerned about

169
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,700
are not a charity, Kelly.

170
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,000
I need that money, Doctor.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
I need to get away from here.

172
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,400
From people.

173
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,500
<i>We should send her home.</i>

174
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
She's got
grade three previa.

175
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,100
She's also got the most
viable fetus we've ever seen.

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,300
More reason to have
her in a hospital

177
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,400
under constant
supervision.

178
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,600
For a doctor, you can
be amazingly stupid.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
She should be delivered.

180
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,800
It's too early.

181
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,700
Besides, the baby
might not survive.

182
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,400
At least the girl would.

183
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
She's a time bomb.

184
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
You want to risk that?

185
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,100
With great risks
come great rewards.

186
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,400
I don't want
another dead mother

187
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
on my conscience.

188
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,800
If she goes into labor,
she will die.

189
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,800
Hello, Will.

190
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Do I know you?

191
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,800
We need to have a talk.

192
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,600
Cops never charged me.

193
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,500
Who the hell are you?

194
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,900
By nature, a deeply
sensitive person.

195
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,600
But she's not.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Get lost.

197
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,400
Sugar rush.

198
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,700
Wait. Wait.
You can't do this to me.

199
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,100
It's time to clear
your conscience, Will.

200
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,800
I know you're
a man of faith,

201
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
and we both know, at
the heart of faith...

202
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,600
lies the truth.

203
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,100
Jesus knows my heart,
and he forgives me.

204
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,300
Does he?

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,700
Okay, let's ask him.

206
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,500
Look at him, Will.

207
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,700
Look at the nails
in his hands,

208
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,300
in his feet,
the wound in his side.

209
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,800
You telling me you'd let
that suffering continue?

210
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Answer me!
Please let me go.

211
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Ask his forgiveness,
and he will forgive you

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,100
if you truly repent.

213
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,300
Now, tell the truth.

214
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,900
Who paid you to get rid
of the containers?

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Can you please stop this? He knows

216
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,800
the secrets of
your heart, Will.

217
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,600
Cleanse yourself, Will.

218
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,600
Tell him.

219
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,400
It was a woman.
I didn't know her name.

220
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,000
You lie to me,
you're lying to him.

221
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,400
I burned the first one 'cause
she said it was medical waste.

222
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
It was easy money.
I didn't think.

223
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,700
Easy money
means restless nights.

224
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,900
You must have a name.

225
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,700
I don't know her name.
Liar!

226
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,400
I looked inside the second one
and I wished I hadn't.

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,900
But it was too late.

228
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,800
My soul was dark.

229
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,700
God must forgive me, though.

230
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,400
Yoknow what I think, Will?

231
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,000
I think you're a waste
of God's time.

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,800
Let's go.

233
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,800
Geppetto.

234
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,000
She talked to somebody
on the phone called Geppetto.

235
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,000
There's where they treated
the girls.

236
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,800
I worked here as a night guard till
they shut the place down.

237
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
You don't see divine
intervention at hand, man?

238
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
The woman asked me to
drive the girls here.

239
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,000
Then she gives me something,
says I should burn it.

240
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,500
I look anyway.

241
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,700
I praise God for choosing me
to give them a decent burial.

242
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,100
It's a shame he didn't choose
you to tell the cops instead.

243
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
How did they
keep this quiet?

244
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,600
Cash.

245
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,000
Lots of cash.

246
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,400
A traveling clinic.

247
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,500
Is this where the woman
treated the girls?

248
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,800
Her and a man.

249
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,200
Sharp guy-
a... doctor.

250
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,000
Geppetto?
No, that's who they call

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,700
after they were finished
with the girl.

252
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Well, this is stage two.

253
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
This is where they implanted
the embryos, but this isn't

254
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,500
where the actual cloning
would take place.

255
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,400
That would require
a real lab.

256
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,200
Liquid nitrogen.

257
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,700
Westec Veterinary Services-

258
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,200
for the transporting

259
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,900
of bovine semen.

260
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
They're hardly going
to label it

261
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,700
"Frozen clone embryos:
handle with love. "

262
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,100
This was just a cover.

263
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,800
You got your panic button?
I think so.

264
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,700
Freeze! FBI!

265
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,166
Hey!

266
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,366
Hood!

267
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,133
What was that?

268
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,000
What?

269
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,500
That, with the arms?

270
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:05,800
I got the license plate.

271
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:09,578
Why do I bother?

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,196
I guess they won't be coming
back here for a while.

273
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:16,967
Ow.

274
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,533
This place was
set up just to...

275
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,735
monitor the pregnancies
and terminate the failures.

276
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:24,254
Any obstetrician, along
with a half decent nurse,

277
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:27,766
could do that, but
stage three, the birth-

278
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,029
that's when you need
the scientist.

279
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:31,862
Geppetto.

280
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,600
What?

281
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,067
Wood, where are we going now?

282
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:44,800
To see a vet.

283
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:48,495
<i>What if I told you</i>

284
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:50,512
that someone not far from here
is close

285
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:51,867
to cloning a
human being?

286
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,534
Is that supposed
to shock me?

287
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:55,079
What was your
title again?

288
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,200
Dr. Hood is fine.

289
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,600
Well, Dr. Hood, some people
think it's already been done.

290
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,334
Not by you, right?

291
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,105
We found this

292
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:05,841
in a... makeshift delivery room.

293
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,707
And so you presumed
we're cloning people?

294
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,300
I'm flattered.

295
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:14,950
We're the largest biological
distribution company

296
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,993
on the West Coast.

297
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:17,949
We ship hundreds of samples
from around the world

298
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:19,067
every day.

299
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,109
And you're asking me
to trace a label?

300
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:25,900
That was a waste of time.

301
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,257
In science,
a negative result

302
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:30,833
is just as important
as a positive one.

303
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,171
"And when the king
returned to his castle,

304
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:42,160
"he found that his trusted
servant had made him

305
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,225
a beautiful... "

306
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,910
..."a beautiful coat
filled with all kinds of... "

307
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:51,877
Oh!

308
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,747
Oh, David, honey.

309
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:57,270
Oh, give Mommy a second while...
while this pain goes away.

310
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,200
Okay?

311
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:02,304
Yes.

312
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,234
Dr. Hayward?

313
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,267
Kelly.

314
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,342
Can I meet you at the warehouse?

315
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:06,833
No.

316
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,666
Y- Y-You can't do that.
Oh!

317
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,494
Then I have to go
to the hospital.

318
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,933
No, uh, Kelly, um,

319
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,056
if you go to the hospital,
Social Services

320
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:15,664
will take David away from you.
Do you want that?

321
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:17,097
But I'm bleeding really badly.

322
00:17:17,097 --> 00:17:17,800
No hospitals.

323
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,499
Understand?

324
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,362
Can I buy you a drink?

325
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:35,806
Before you disturb me,

326
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,361
you should know I'm
filling out this paperwork

327
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:38,877
because I shot at a man today.

328
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:40,100
Why?

329
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,499
Because he disturbed me.

330
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,058
Okay.

331
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:50,020
Thanks.

332
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,100
Why does the name Geppetto
sound so familiar?

333
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,192
You mean apart
from being Pinocchio's dad?

334
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,148
Right.

335
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,167
You know, I never
understood that story.

336
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:02,456
An old wood-carver
wants a son so badly

337
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,040
that he makes
one of his own?

338
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,578
Get a wife,
why don't you?

339
00:18:06,578 --> 00:18:07,254
Weird.

340
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,712
Rachel.
Hmm?

341
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,650
You are brilliant.

342
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,234
I know.

343
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:14,876
Why?

344
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,267
Why am I brilliant?

345
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,442
I kept asking myself,

346
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,489
"Why choose to do
the embryo implanting

347
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:23,226
here?"

348
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:25,113
But he didn't choose,
you see.

349
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:27,482
That decision was made
for him, for Geppetto.

350
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,290
He who pays the piper
calls the tune.

351
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,067
Somebody right here in Seattle

352
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,167
wants their son
back from the dead.

353
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:34,366
Excuse me.

354
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:37,267
Local publications,
2005, please.

355
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,766
Why 2005?

356
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,300
The first fetus
was found 18 months ago.

357
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:42,726
Whatever we're looking for

358
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:44,133
must have happened
before then.

359
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:11,433
Give Mommy her phone, please.

360
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm calling 911.

361
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,442
Look for families
who have lost a son.

362
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,236
What makes you think
we'll find it here?

363
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:24,700
Whoever fronts Geppetto
has got to be wealthy.

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,466
Cloning is
a very expensive business.

365
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,811
The poor die in silence,
the rich die public.

366
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:34,801
That's the way it's always been,
so keep looking.

367
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:36,100
For what?

368
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,933
The small ads
under "Human Cloning"?

369
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,310
What's your name?

370
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,067
Can you hear me?
Laura.

371
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,300
Laura's my name. Laura, how
long have you been bleeding?

372
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:46,833
Not long.
Mom!

373
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,833
David!

374
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,633
Mom!
David!

375
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Just relax. Social Service
is taking care of him.

376
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:52,800
No!

377
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,200
No!
Mom!

378
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:09,295
I think I've found him.

379
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,268
A needle in a haystack.

380
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:16,184
How many needles try
to commit suicide three times

381
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:18,167
after they've
lost a loved one?

382
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,027
Why can't we go
visit this man,

383
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:36,115
Mr. Gifford?
Because it's late.

384
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:38,210
Keep your panic button
handy, please,

385
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,700
and use your cover name if... If I want

386
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,436
to order in myroom.

387
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,835
Good night.
Good night.

388
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:48,666
What is your
cover name?

389
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:49,833
Mr. Smith.

390
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,977
Jones.
Mr. Jones.

391
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,297
I'll be right down.

392
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
What do you got?

393
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:05,473
The car that tried
to run over your guy

394
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,267
was rented
by a Dr. Sidney Hayward,

395
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:08,600
an obstetrician.

396
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,610
Can you trace him?
Already did; he's gone.

397
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,833
What do you mean "gone"?
Struck off the medical registrar

398
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,034
two years ago.

399
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,680
Drink?
No.

400
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,200
His house was put
into foreclosure

401
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:20,300
and the IRS froze
his bank accounts.

402
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,434
Ah.
I owe you one, okay?

403
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:26,401
So how long you been
with the doctor?

404
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,700
Uh, it was supposed
to be two months and...

405
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,696
You know,
I looked you up.

406
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:32,933
FBI Executive

407
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,666
Protection Detail.

408
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,312
That's, uh,
pretty cool.

409
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:39,933
Sure you don't want a nightcap?

410
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,768
I said I owe you one.

411
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,331
I never said I'd give you one.

412
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,967
<i>Sidney Hayward- erratic driver</i>

413
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,933
and baby doctor.

414
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,967
What did he do,
run off with a patient?

415
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:10,100
Does it matter?

416
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,533
Give me a doctor
with a steady hand

417
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,416
over one with a
steady home anytime.

418
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,372
But you don't think

419
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:16,034
he's our Geppetto, do you?

420
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:18,271
No.

421
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
To clone anything
requires skill

422
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,268
and knowledge way beyond
this guy's capabilities.

423
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:24,776
Well, how do you know
he doesn't have

424
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,134
those capabilities?

425
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,134
Because

426
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
to clone anything...

427
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,167
takes science

428
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:33,600
stroked gently

429
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,700
with artistic hands.

430
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,434
You got a pair of tweezers?

431
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:43,401
Yeah.

432
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:45,134
Not to keep.

433
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,092
Now, imagine
this is a woman's egg.

434
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,267
Well, the seed

435
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:57,867
inside it is her nucleus

436
00:22:57,933 --> 00:23:02,043
that contains her unique DNA.

437
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:04,300
Now, if you want
to make a clone,

438
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:07,114
the first thing you do
is get rid of the nucleus.

439
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:09,058
Believe it or not, I use those.

440
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:11,800
Then, you replace it

441
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:14,134
with the nucleus of any cell

442
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,398
of the person you want to clone.

443
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:19,306
Original egg, new DNA

444
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,143
in the nucleus.

445
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:25,117
So, next, you shock it

446
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:27,134
with a little jolt
of electricity.

447
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,434
Don't say Frankenstein.

448
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:30,769
The electricity
fools the egg

449
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:33,038
into thinking
it's been fertilized.

450
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:34,979
Within a week,

451
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,300
it's making
stem cells,

452
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:39,933
which then grow
into the person of your choice.

453
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,461
You place these
inside the womb

454
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:43,726
of your carrier.

455
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:44,663
Next, you hire

456
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:46,367
a disgraced and
penniless gynecologist,

457
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:48,555
like Hayward,
to bring in the harvest.

458
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:52,767
Cannibal.

459
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:56,364
<i>McNEIL: We've been monitoring
city hospital maternity wards</i>

460
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:57,902
<i>for any suspicious activity.</i>

461
00:23:57,902 --> 00:24:00,433
We got a call on the radio
about a girl who was admitted

462
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,449
to intensive care
with her four-year-old son.

463
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:04,755
Hospital child care
was looking after the boy

464
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:06,523
when she just goes in
and grabbed him

465
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:07,858
and then just vanished.

466
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,600
Apparently,
she's in bad shape.

467
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,788
And pregnant, right?

468
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,631
Right.

469
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:13,967
The bleeding's not
her biggest problem.

470
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:16,401
Her placenta is covering
the exit of her womb.

471
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:17,666
Placenta previa.

472
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,100
If this girl's
contractions start

473
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,267
with this condition,

474
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,105
she could die.

475
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,700
Can we go home, Mommy?

476
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,039
Not just yet, sweetie.

477
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:52,134
<i>We're wasting precious time.</i>

478
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,800
We should go
and see this man.

479
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,467
Let the cops find
the girl first.

480
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,367
See if she leads us
back to Gifford.

481
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:59,267
Right now you need
to get some rest.

482
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:01,167
We'll go first thing
in the morning.

483
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,868
But this is the only lead
we've got.

484
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,401
He's a name in a newspaper,
not a lead.

485
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,399
You don't know if this girl's
involved with Geppetto,

486
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:09,314
and you want to go bang on some
billionaire's door in the middle

487
00:25:09,314 --> 00:25:11,367
of the night with no
real justification?

488
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:12,867
Don't push me, Hood.

489
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:14,367
I won't let you
wear me down

490
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:15,833
like you did the
others before me.

491
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,467
I have never failed
at any assignment,

492
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:19,200
and I don't intend to start now.

493
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,467
Settled.

494
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,633
If you need me,

495
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,200
I'll be right
down the hall.

496
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,689
WOMAN It can literally turn
back the clock on aging skin.

497
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,963
Its special
deep-penetration formula

498
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:02,000
acts to reduce lines...
Lies.

499
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:03,767
Do you suffer
from male-patterned baldness?

500
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:04,854
Not anymore.

501
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,973
Renewgent 12 is guaranteed
to grow new hair...

502
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:08,111
More lies.

503
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:24,503
You got a nice, uh, 18-year-old

504
00:26:24,503 --> 00:26:25,535
single malt?

505
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:26,393
Okay.

506
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,939
No ice.

507
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,165
Hood? Hood?!

508
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:05,067
Oh, crap.

509
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,350
I must have sat on it.

510
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:13,434
Drink?

511
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:26,545
We shouldn't be doing this.

512
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,511
It's a blind risk
factor for you.

513
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,252
Based on what, a hunch?

514
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:32,943
Once upon a time,
gravity was just a hunch.

515
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:46,800
Mr. Gifford,
I'm Dr. Jacob Hood.

516
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,100
This is Rachel Young.

517
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:50,800
What can I do for you?

518
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,566
We're here
about your late son, Gabriel.

519
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:55,717
<i>Meningitis</i>

520
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,394
is a terrible disease.

521
00:27:58,234 --> 00:28:01,557
Maybe it wouldn't be
if they did some more research.

522
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:04,513
Is Mrs. Gifford at home?

523
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:07,392
Losing a child
has repercussions.

524
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:09,026
My wife left.

525
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:11,445
Would you say life is precious?

526
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:14,234
<i>Where did that come from?</i>

527
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,733
It's just a question.
Can you answer?

528
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,853
Hood.

529
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:20,666
See, there's a pregnant girl
out there, Kelly,

530
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,093
and she's going
to lose her life

531
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:25,833
because she's too scared
to get medical help,

532
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,000
so... is life precious,

533
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,743
Mr. Gifford?

534
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,537
I think you should leave now.

535
00:28:37,537 --> 00:28:39,716
I suppose you don't know
who Dr. Sidney Hayward is?

536
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:40,796
Do you?

537
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:44,645
Where is she?

538
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:47,034
Where's Kelly?

539
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,889
That girl is
somebody's mother,

540
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,000
and if she dies,

541
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,833
she'll be missed

542
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,501
by her own son.

543
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:58,334
Don't you dare try
to teach me about grief.

544
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:00,767
And if you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

545
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,700
We'll save you the call.

546
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:17,372
Guys like him can lie
all day day long

547
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:19,034
and never get
tired of it.

548
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,954
Let's try... this.

549
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:24,979
You stole his telephone?

550
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:26,315
It was just lying there.

551
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:27,637
Now this'll
work as long

552
00:29:27,637 --> 00:29:29,617
as we stay 100 feet
from the phone base.

553
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:30,878
There was a brochure

554
00:29:30,878 --> 00:29:33,267
for Westec Veterinarian
services on the table,

555
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:36,167
and in about 30 seconds,
he's gonna make a panic call.

556
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,473
Why are you calling us?

557
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:47,322
Someone named Jacob Hood

558
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:48,896
just left my house.

559
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,450
He knows.

560
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,363
I'm telling Geppetto
to cut this girl loose.

561
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:54,698
You can't do that.

562
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:55,666
Why not?

563
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:57,227
Because she'll die.

564
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:01,595
And her baby has the best chance
of a live birth yet.

565
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,036
Now, calm down while we go

566
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,867
check on the girl.

567
00:30:20,267 --> 00:30:21,401
Kelly?

568
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:24,900
Kelly?

569
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,240
Kelly, it's me.

570
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:32,867
I brought Dr. Hayward for you.

571
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,100
The contractions have started.

572
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,127
He'll take care of you.

573
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:41,445
No. I want a hospital now!

574
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,800
McNEIL:
Kelly Frost, 20 years old.

575
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,879
She has a criminal record?
Yeah, assault.

576
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,600
Her ex used to treat her
like a punching bag.

577
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,733
When she got sick of it,
she fought back.

578
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,867
And what do you know.

579
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,234
He pressed charges.

580
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,533
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

581
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,900
A big problem.

582
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,467
Girl needs
an emergency C-section.

583
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh, my God.

584
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,867
Wait. Geppetto wants
to be present at the birth.

585
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:01,225
I've made that call already.

586
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:03,367
If we don't do this right now,
they're both going to die.

587
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:05,833
Whatever it takes.

588
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,072
There's a clinic
on Bainbridge Island.

589
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:10,134
It's been closed
only a few months,

590
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,992
but it's still fully equipped.

591
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:14,633
I can use it, but we're
gonna need cash up front.

592
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,200
Consider it done.

593
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:17,833
And Gifford,

594
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,300
you know we're only talking
viable here.

595
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:22,367
Nobody's promising perfect.

596
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,767
Who are you?

597
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,800
You must have
the wrong apartment.

598
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,278
Where's Kelly?

599
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:42,967
I don't know any Kelly.

600
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,401
All right.

601
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:47,376
Kelly?! Kelly?!

602
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:53,200
David, can you tell Daddy
where Mommy went?

603
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:55,034
The man took her.

604
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,633
What man?

605
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:58,626
Do you know?

606
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,833
Uh-uh?

607
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,334
All right,
can somebody please tell me

608
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,005
what the hell's going on here?!

609
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,053
Can you talk?

610
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:24,534
Who are you?

611
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,950
...you!

612
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,213
Right.

613
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,813
Abusive ex-boyfriend.

614
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,246
Who did this?

615
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:31,742
Some woman did this.

616
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:33,554
Can you get me an ambulance?

617
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:34,425
Please?
Where's Kelly?

618
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:35,868
I don't know. Agh!

619
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:37,778
Okay, okay.

620
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:39,389
Just pull this out of my neck.

621
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,485
It's not a good idea.

622
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:42,361
That's your external
jugular vein.

623
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,292
Scissors are actually
slowing the blood flow.

624
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:45,738
Pull those out,
you'll be dead in minutes.

625
00:32:45,738 --> 00:32:47,080
Best if you
stay calm.

626
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,728
Where's my mommy?

627
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:54,164
It's okay.

628
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,994
I need you
to help me save a life.

629
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:10,378
But it could mean your job.

630
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:18,167
Would I be doing this
in the name of science

631
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:19,501
or the law?

632
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,614
How about in the name of good?

633
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,651
Geppetto will
be here soon.

634
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,262
Hayward?

635
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:07,156
We could save ourselves.

636
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:09,568
Give them Geppetto.

637
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,091
I agree.

638
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,683
Make the call.

639
00:34:34,895 --> 00:34:36,250
Mr. Gifford?

640
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,277
You know what today is,
Mr. Gifford?

641
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:00,223
Yes.

642
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,932
It's my son's new birthday.

643
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:02,985
No.

644
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:06,716
Today is the first day

645
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:09,599
of you accepting
Gabriel is dead.

646
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:14,213
Do you have any idea
how long I've waited for this?

647
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:18,125
How many false hopes?

648
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:20,393
You won't stop this.

649
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,826
In an hour,

650
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:25,940
I'm gonna have my reborn son
in my hands again.

651
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:27,797
You can't believe that.

652
00:35:27,797 --> 00:35:29,516
You ever lost a child?

653
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,094
How could you possibly know

654
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:34,045
what I'm going through?

655
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:39,066
Two years ago my wife died.

656
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,702
I nursed her
till her last breath.

657
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:45,006
Every day,
I'd look for some...

658
00:35:45,805 --> 00:35:47,238
little sign.

659
00:35:47,238 --> 00:35:49,514
Helped me to believe
she might get better.

660
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,944
There isn't a day

661
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:55,284
that passes...
when I don't wish she was back.

662
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:56,825
It's not the same.

663
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:00,215
One of you dies first.
That's sad.

664
00:36:00,597 --> 00:36:02,637
But that's the deal.

665
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:04,159
When my son died,

666
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,523
my life was over!

667
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:08,562
It's called grief.

668
00:36:08,562 --> 00:36:09,762
It's natural.

669
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:11,223
I want him back.

670
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:14,880
What you're doing is only making
your pain intolerable.

671
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
What could be worse
than my son dying?

672
00:36:16,546 --> 00:36:19,070
Your son dying
over and over again.

673
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,780
That's not possible.

674
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,024
You want to see Gabriel again?

675
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:24,706
Do you?

676
00:36:36,313 --> 00:36:37,645
Behold...

677
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,213
your son.

678
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:44,780
Now, even if he'd survived
the genetic mutation,

679
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:47,080
even if he'd been perfect
in every sense,

680
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:49,780
this would never have
been the boy you knew.

681
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:52,331
This would have been
some other...

682
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,181
different child.

683
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,613
Gabriel is not the
product of his DNA.

684
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,980
He's the sum of every day
you spent with him.

685
00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:04,838
Every meal his mother
cooked for him.

686
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:06,946
Every story you read him.

687
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:10,457
Every ball you threw
for him to catch.

688
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,178
I'm sorry you had
to find out this way,

689
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:16,981
that Gabriel's soul...

690
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,113
is so much more than just
its constituent chemical parts.

691
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,147
I don't know
what's going to happen

692
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,447
to the baby
the girl is carrying,

693
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,954
and she is that.

694
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:33,024
She's just a girl.

695
00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:37,480
And she will die
unless you help me.

696
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:42,910
So where is Kelly?

697
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:17,414
What happened?

698
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:20,813
Somebody asked me
to come in here and help.

699
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,846
Do you know this girl?

700
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,313
Kelly.
Her name is Kelly.

701
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,480
Do you know CPR?

702
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:25,679
Of course.

703
00:38:25,746 --> 00:38:27,047
Get the air bag.

704
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,501
She's lost a lot of blood.

705
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:34,387
Find a refrigerator,
O negative.

706
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,671
Do it.

707
00:38:37,546 --> 00:38:39,410
You a doctor?

708
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,793
I was.

709
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:42,147
More oxygen.

710
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:44,819
Squeeze until you see
the chest inflate.

711
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,260
What about the baby?

712
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:19,080
She lost him a long time ago.

713
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:21,247
"Him"?

714
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:23,164
How'd you know that?

715
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,913
You're Geppetto.

716
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,380
You'll have
to take over now,

717
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:39,613
if you want to save her.

718
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:41,880
So you just walk away?

719
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:45,880
Every scientific experiment
requires sacrifice.

720
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,514
She's not an experiment.

721
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,280
She's a human being.

722
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:50,946
You should care.

723
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,013
Playing God
has its disadvantages.

724
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:58,514
Nice to finally meet you,
Dr. Hood.

725
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:08,147
Come on, Kelly!

726
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,377
Hood!
Rachel, I need your help.

727
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,646
Cops are on their way.

728
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:18,360
Oh, God...

729
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:23,646
Come on, Kelly!
Come back for David!

730
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,780
Come back for David,
Kelly. Come on.

731
00:40:33,846 --> 00:40:34,913
Hood.

732
00:41:04,746 --> 00:41:07,247
So thank you, again,
for everything.

733
00:41:07,313 --> 00:41:09,480
You're gonna be okay.

734
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:12,213
The doctor said I can't
have kids anymore.

735
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,546
All the more love
for the one you have.

736
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:26,380
You take care.
You, too.

737
00:41:29,213 --> 00:41:30,679
No sign of Geppetto.

738
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:33,480
But, uh, Lea's in custody

739
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:34,874
and talking.

740
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,878
Yes?

741
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:41,687
Hello?

742
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,349
Okay.

743
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:47,078
Gotta go.

744
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:49,147
There's a situation.

745
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:50,780
What kind of situation?

746
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:52,347
A delicate one.

747
00:41:52,414 --> 00:41:56,016
