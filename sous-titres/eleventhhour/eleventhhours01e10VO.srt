1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,700
White tail hills, Texas

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,100
Okay, body. Just settle down, okay?
We will be out of here, just a minute, okay?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,100
You know, we don't need it. We got plenty
at home but around way out of here, okay?

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,700
Just soon down, Troy!

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,800
Okay.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,000
Daddy!

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,300
What's the hell was it!

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,200
Dude, I think you might
have more than ten items.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,500
We'll be out of here
in just a minute, pal, okay?

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,400
Daddy!

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,300
Uh, that's not the point here, is it?

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,900
- Daddy!
- Settle down, buddy.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,300
It's more about the principle of the thing, pal.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,300
Principle.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,100
You got to be kidding me.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,600
- Daddy!
- Guess manners don't run
in the family, do they...

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,400
- Pal?
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, 

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,300
Daddy!

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
So, you ready to try this?

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,700
Isn't this the kind
of thing I have you for?

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,700
What if I'm not around?

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,500
Or what if you're in a situation
you can't think your way out of?

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,300
You've been with the Bureau
for over two years now.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,500
This is something you need to know.

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,400
If you say so.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,400
Good.

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
Okay.

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,700
- Feet shoulder-width apart.
- Uh-huh.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,100
And remember, 

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,600
align your front sight
with the rear sight.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,800
- Gotcha.
- Focus on the front sight.

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,700
That's it.
Aim at the bad guys, 

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,300
and don't shoot any old ladies.

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,600
Okay.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
Hood, that was a criminal.

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,300
Could have been a misguided kid.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
Bad home life, not a lot of options.

38
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,600
I mean, why can't people
try talking to him?

39
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, okay. I'm ready.
I'm ready. I'm serious.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,700
Stop messing around.

41
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,800
Oh, come on.
Who doesn't hate a poodle?

42
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
What is it?

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,300
Looks like something or
someone is messing with Texas.

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,300
What do you mean?

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,700
An epidemic of sudden violent
outbreaks in a small community, 

46
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,300
all committed by people who
have no criminal record whatsoever.

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,800
What turns upstanding citizens...

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,000
into violent criminals?

52
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,000
Mommy!

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Hi.

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
You this boy's mother?

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,600
- Sure I am.
- ID?

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,000
This is a release form
for a minor into parental custody.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Please sign here and here.

58
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay.

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,900
-All right.
- Thanks.

60
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,500
Time to go home, baby.

61
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,500
You know, this is for the best, Troy, 

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,100
at least now you don't have to keep going
back and forth to your daddy's place.

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,900
I miss Daddy.

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,900
Honey...

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,900
Daddy keeps telling us
that he's gonna change, 

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,100
but sometimes, people can't change, 

67
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,300
no matter how hard they try.

68
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Okay, let's go home.

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
Sorry I'm late.

70
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,300
Dr. Hood, Agent Young.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Gill Strickland... I'm an epidemiologist
with the Texas Center for Infectious Diseases.

72
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Well, so far, it seems that we have 23 cases
of what you'd call aberrant behavior.

73
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,300
Now, that's your folks,
uh, disrobing in public,

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,400
walking into traffic,
running around Costco, 

75
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,800
saying they're the president.

76
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
And the violent behavior?

77
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,900
Nine cases that all started about the same time,
so we're thinking they're related.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,200
- What's your hypothesis?
- We got a group of unrelated people

79
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
behaving strangely for no apparent reason.

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
They test negative for drugs.

81
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,300
Their psychic come in fine
just a few hours later

82
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,800
Best thing I can come up
with is encephalitis.

83
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,600
But you're not sure
or we wouldn't be here.

84
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,600
Encephalitis is a swelling
of the brain 

85
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,900
caused by, well, lots of things.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,300
Um, viruses, bacteria, even parasites.

87
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,600
It makes it hard to test for with any accuracy.

88
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,100
But psychosis is one
of the symptoms, isn't it?

89
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,700
In extreme cases, 

90
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,100
I've seen it manifest
with some odd behavior, 

91
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,000
some confusion, but we're talking about folks

92
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,800
violently attacking complete strangers.

93
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,900
I've never seen that.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,300
Especially not in individuals with, uh, 

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,900
no prior history of antisocial behavior.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,900
The worst part is, 

97
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,200
there's no pattern here.

98
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
I mean, all these cases
seem totally random, 

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,500
and you know that's the toughest
sort of crime to prevent.

100
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Have you tested for, uh, rabies?

101
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,700
Distemper?

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,700
Yeah, no positives.

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,100
And we're sure it's not drugs?

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,800
We tested them for everything
we could think of, and we got zip.

105
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,600
Plus, we got no history of substance
abuse in any of the perpetrators.

106
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,900
Actually, Gill, that's not
the case any more.

107
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,900
Says here you served six months in 2005

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,600
for buying Roxicodone with a fake scrip.

109
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,100
No, I'm clean now.

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,700
I haven't had so much as
an aspirin in 16 months.

111
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,900
I had to do it.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,300
For my wife and my baby boy.

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,500
And I need to see them.

114
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,500
Is Ashley here yet?
Can I see her?

115
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,100
Your wife came by about an hour
ago to pick up your son.

116
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,200
She wouldn't see me.

117
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,900
Guess not.

118
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,700
I've been staying with
my brother up in Cedar Park.

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been going to my meetings
I've been...

120
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
making progress.

121
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,200
Greg?

122
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,400
Why don't you just try
telling us what happened?

123
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,600
It was like...

124
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,900
it was like I was outside myself.

125
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,100
It was like when I used to party,
but more intense.

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,900
I don't know, that guy behind me
in line was being such a jerk, 

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,900
and I... I was so tired, 

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,600
and Troy was...

129
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,700
he was grinding my last nerve,
and I... don't know.

130
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,100
I just... I just lost it.

131
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Mr. Filmore, I've seen
a lot of addicts like you.

132
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,600
You get sober just long enough to
work your way back into your family, 

133
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,100
and then you tear them apart all over again.

134
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,400
That's not true.

135
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,300
They tested me, and I'm clean.

136
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,300
Right.

137
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,300
Okay. Um...

138
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
The truth is, 

139
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,900
there have been other cases
of unexplained behavior in the area,

140
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
and we don't know what caused it.

141
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,900
When that doc came to take my blood,

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,100
I heard him say, "Encephalitis."

143
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,500
Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,900
That's fatal, right?

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,700
Right?

146
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,500
Yeah, it can be,

147
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,100
but just because you test positive today

148
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,100
doesn't mean it won't come up
negative in one or two days' time.

149
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,200
Encephalitis is, um... 

150
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,600
it's basically a symptom.

151
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,300
It can be caused by any
number of underlying issues.

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Just be straight with me, man.

153
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Does me freaking out
in that supermarket 

154
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,300
mean I'm going to go die?

155
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,500
We don't know yet.

156
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,500
Rachel?

157
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
You okay?

158
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

159
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,400
Well, he's having a tough time.
You could have cut him a little slack.

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,900
Hood, in my experience,
addicts are all the same.

161
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
For every one that breaks
the cycle of dependency,

162
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
there's 1,000 more out there

163
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,800
ruining lives, destroying
families, committing murder.

164
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
Okay.

165
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,900
Well, um, the only thing our
32 victims/perpetrators 

166
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,000
have in common is they
come from this area,

167
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,400
three of them from a five-block radius.

168
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,900
The answer's got to be here somewhere.

169
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,900
Well, this environment is hot; it's humid.

170
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,600
Low ground.

171
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,600
Plenty of open pools and fountains.

172
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,800
Ideal habitat for mosquitoes.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Which can carry Encephalitis.

174
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,300
True, but despite what the media says,

175
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,600
mosquitoes are far more likely
to infect birds than humans.

176
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,600
Hey, little buddy.
Your mama home?

177
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,300
- May I help you?
- Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

178
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
We're just gonna be doing
some work out here tonight.

179
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Got to replace some malfunctioning
pressure gauges all through the neighborhood.

180
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,000
Will there still be
water in the house?

181
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,700
Sorry, no. Not till
we're done working, ma'am.

182
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,400
The Department of Water and Power
is sorry to inconvenience.

183
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,900
Here are some earplugs.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,100
We'll get finished up as soon as we can.

185
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Okay, buddy.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,400
Okay, let's set up and start digging.

1
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,500
To us, it feels like mosquitoes exist
just to make our lives miserable,

2
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
but the truth is, we're
their second choice.

3
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,300
They'd much rather
be feeding on birds.

4
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,700
Viral encephalitis is
primarily an avian disease.

5
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,000
A mosquito bites an infected bird...

6
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,500
it becomes a lifelong carrier.

7
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,700
Passes it along to every
other bird it feeds on.

8
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,300
And then, those birds get
bitten by other mosquitoes.

9
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,000
And then, those mosquitoes
pass it on to more birds,

10
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
and so on and so forth,
but generally, 

11
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,400
a bird population develops an immunity
to the local mutation of the virus,

12
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
and it doesn't get
affected anymore.

13
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,300
So, we're looking for new birds?

14
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Uh-huh.

15
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,700
Any new flocks appear lately?

16
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Mm-hmm, society finches.

17
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
They're migratory.

18
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,400
Flocks have been showing up
since the beginning of the month.

19
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,500
Right around the time

20
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
our unexpected behavior started.

21
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, finches are known
carriers of encephalitis.

22
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Have you tested these?

23
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, we sample all incoming
populations for infectious diseases,

24
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,000
including encephalitis.

25
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,600
These guys just tested negative
a couple of hours ago,

26
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,500
so they're set for rerelease
in a... tomorrow.

27
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
So, we're saying now
it's not encephalitis?

28
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,800
Yeah, that's what we're saying.

29
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Dr. Hood!

30
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Dr. Hood.

31
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Agent Young.

32
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm glad I caught you.

33
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Mr. Strickland,

34
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
is everything okay?

35
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,200
I wanted, uh...

36
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,300
second round of tests
came in on the 32 perps.

37
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,700
No positives for encephalitis.

38
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Not rabies, not dis...
distemper, nothing.

39
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,900
People want to hurt me.

40
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Excuse me?

41
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
You came here to help them.

42
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,300
To make me look like an idiot.

43
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,200
Idiot!

44
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,900
He's hallucinating.

45
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,000
People are talking.

46
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Mr. Strickland...

47
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,500
Who's talking?

48
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
I could hear them.

49
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,200
Mr. Strickland, there's
no one else here.

50
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Just stay calm.

51
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,900
And we'll get some help for you.

52
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,100
Oh, please don't.

53
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,100
They're coming for me.

54
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,200
Mr. Strickland?

55
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,300
I got to protect myself,
I got to protect myself!

56
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,100
Mr. Strickland! Calm down!

57
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,500
Shut up, you bastards!

58
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Bastards!

59
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Leave me alone!

60
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,400
Leave me alone!
You bastards!

61
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
He's dead.

62
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,800
What the hell is going on here?

63
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
This is where
Mr. Strickland was staying.

64
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thanks.

65
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
You guys know who's
going to settle his bill?

66
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
No.

67
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
But you all work for
the government, right?

68
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,000
He was state.
We're federal. Thanks.

69
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,400
I'll have Strickla's autopsy
report in a couple of days.

70
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,000
And I'm going to ask
for his medical records

71
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,200
and any recent purchases
he made on his credit card.

72
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Rachel?

73
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
- Sunscreen?
- And bug repellent.

74
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,300
Containing DEET.

75
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,300
A known psychotropic
in high enough doses.

76
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, we used military-grade
DEET at Quantico.

77
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,900
Made some of the recruits
sick. Scary stuff.

78
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
And effective.

79
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,200
Maybe it's not the mosquitoes
causing this mass psychosis.

80
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
Maybe it's what people are
using to keep them away.

81
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,400
Could it be a bad batch?

82
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,200
I'm more worried about this.

83
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,500
Hmm, what's a nanoparticle?

84
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,700
A nanoparticle is, uh...
it's a tiny, tiny piece of...

85
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,500
Well, just about anything,
right, and, um,

86
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,400
cosmetics companies like
them because they're, uh,

87
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
easy to absorb and they make
their products feel less greasy.

88
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,300
Problem is...

89
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,100
Sometimes they can be so small,

90
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,000
the particles travel
right through the skin

91
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,200
directly into the body itself.

92
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,500
So, if this lotion made
DEET into nanoparticles...

93
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,200
Whoever's using this could
be absorbing it at much

94
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,200
higher doses than intended.

95
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Excuse me.

96
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,400
Excuse me.

97
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,300
Is there a problem?
Can I help you?

98
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,300
I'm Agent Rachel Young of the FBI,

99
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
this is my colleague,
Dr. Jacob Hood.

100
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,200
We'll need receipts for all purchase
made of this product in the last month.

101
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,500
We've only been selling
that item for three weeks now.

102
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,100
Great, then mining your sales
records from your system

103
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,300
won't be too difficult, will it?

104
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,100
It's a test product.

105
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,500
We're the only ones in the
Austin area who carry it.

106
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,800
So far it's been
a pretty good seller.

107
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
The state police will be here soon.

108
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,000
They'll need to take all
remaining stock into custody.

109
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,700
The manufacturer pays us
to sell this stuff.

110
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,300
I can't just stop selling it until I
check with my corporate office first.

111
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,200
How does corporate feel about people

112
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,300
trying to kill each other with
their bare hands on store property?

113
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,300
Get this product off
your shelves. Now, please.

114
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
I miss Daddy.

115
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
I know you do, honey.

116
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,200
Do you miss him?

117
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Of course.

118
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,400
But the most important thing 

119
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,500
is we'reonna be fine.

120
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,000
Just the two of us.
Like peas in a pod.

121
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,700
Now, let's put in some earplugs
for the noise outside tonight, okay?

122
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,500
Those workers might
be here pretty late.

123
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,400
All right, sweetheart.
Good night.

124
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
How many houses we got
line on after this one?

125
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,100
Two more confirmed.

126
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,900
After that we're flying blind.

127
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,300
Until we get a lead
on that distributor.

128
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Yeah, yeah, I bought
some of this stuff.

129
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,900
I never got a chance
to use it, though.

130
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,400
That's not what you
wanted to hear, huh?

131
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,500
Better than if you lied to me.

133
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Hmm.

134
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,000
I've made my amends.

135
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
I'm done lying.

136
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,500
I've recommended you be released, 

137
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,800
contingent on regular
drug tests, okay?

138
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I don't know what to say.

139
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Don't say anything.

140
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,700
Just don't make me look bad.

141
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,900
That's a promise.

142
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,000
- Hey.
- Hi.

143
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Greg Filmore bought the sunscreen, 

144
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,100
but he didn'use it.

145
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,300
Any luck with the receipts?

146
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,600
Looks like "Sun-N-Shoo" is
not the common nominator.

147
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,700
- You're positive?
- Yeah,

148
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,700
cross-referencing the booking
records and the grocery receipts,

149
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,200
only four of the 23 people
brought in for erratic behavior

150
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,800
purchased the product.

151
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Hang on.

152
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,800
Looks like they all
bought something else.

153
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
What?

154
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,500
Travis Springs bottled water.

155
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,400
Travis Springs?

156
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,300
Didn't Strickland have a bottlef
Travis Springs when he went crazy?

157
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Hi.

158
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
How's it testing?

159
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,400
Uh, it's a little acidic.

160
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,300
Gonna have to up the filtration.

161
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,400
Uh, excuse me, but

162
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,100
- who are you?
- FBI, Mr. Driggs.

163
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,100
We're here to ask you a few
questions about your operation.

164
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I didn't know the feds had
an interest in bottled water.

165
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,900
Well, we do when the people
who drink it are going crazy.

166
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,500
What are you talking about?

167
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,900
Not exactly the mountain
spring I was expecting.

168
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,100
Bottled water is one of the least
regulated industries in the country.

169
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,700
It's mostly just tap water.

170
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,300
So, this is the same thing that
comes out of the tap in people's homes.

171
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,000
At a buck 50 a bottle.

172
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,300
Not a bad markup
if you can get it.

173
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,500
??

174
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,900
And what comes out of the tap
that's got all kinds of crap in it:

175
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,700
fluoride, ammonium, chlorine.

176
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Nitric acid.

177
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,200
And how is your water
any different?

178
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,500
I filter out the chemicals
and restorit to its pure state.

179
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,100
My water is as clean and
refreshing as a mountain spring

180
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,100
even if it didn't
start out that way.

181
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,000
- What is your source?
- The county reservoir.

182
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,100
They're doing another chlorine
burn to kill off bacteria this week.

183
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,700
Keeps the tap water clean,
okay, but it tastes terrible.

184
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Just another reason why
people drink bottled water.

185
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,300
How often does the treatment
center do the chlorine burn?

186
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,000
several times a month
during the rainy season.

187
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,000
The rain can wash all kinds of nasty
contaminants down into the reservoir.

188
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,700
Which is very good for business.

189
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,400
Excuse us a second.

190
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,000
What is it?

191
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,600
Chlorine, uh,
kills bacteria.

192
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,300
Which for drinking water,
it's a really good thing.

193
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
But chlorine is also
really good at, um,

194
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,300
combining itself with
whatever it touches.

195
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,300
So, there's a possibility that some
kind of, uh, chemical combination

196
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,600
is what's causing
all this psychosis.

197
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,400
Excuse me, can you get me a
sample of your filtered water

198
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
and your source water, please?

3
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,000
Sure.

4
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,600
Okay, well, I'm going
to go test this water.

5
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
All right, I'll be next door

6
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,900
checking out
Gill Strickland's paper trail.

7
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,300
I'll let you know
if anything turns up.

8
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,600
That sounds good.

9
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
Agent Young.

10
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,200
Just one bottle
of Travis Springs?

11
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,700
Are you sure?

12
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,600
Okay, got it.

13
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,200
What?

14
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,600
Get away!

15
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,000
Hood.

16
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,900
What's going on?

17
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,600
If Krauss is correct,

18
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,400
then we appear to be living

19
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,800
in the worst
of all possible universes.

20
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,100
But if Dyson is correct,

21
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,100
then the universe is receding

22
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,100
into the threshold
of the unknowable.

23
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,200
But if
Witten is correct,

24
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,200
then all matter will dissolve
into nothingness.

25
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,000
Hood.

26
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,400
The universe is dying,

27
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,900
and we're l...

28
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,500
alone.

29
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Hood.

30
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,800
It's me.

31
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Rachel.

32
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,900
You're not alone.

33
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,600
Stay back!

34
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,100
Don't come any closer!

35
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,700
They told me about you.

36
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,200
Don't come any closer.

37
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,700
Listen to me.

38
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,500
Right now you're not yourself,
Hood.

39
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,200
Don't come any closer!

40
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
Stay away.

41
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
-Please....
-Hood.

42
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,700
Ah!

43
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,000
I just want to help you.

44
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,400
Hood, Hood.
Hood, I just,

45
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,200
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

46
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,400
Jacob.

47
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Jacob, look at me.

48
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,200
Rachel?

49
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,300
I'm right here.

50
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,200
Rachel?

51
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,500
I'm not alone?

52
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,800
No.

53
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
No, you're not.

54
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,900
I'm not alone anymore.

55
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,600
Good morning.

56
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,500
Morning.

57
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,600
You had a rough night.

58
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,500
Doctor said
you'll be fine.

59
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Whatever, uh,

60
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,900
came over you, um,

61
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,200
passed through your system
within a few hours,

62
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,500
same as the other
victims.

63
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,600
Wow.

64
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Here.

65
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,100
Oh, bless you.

66
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,400
Yeah.

67
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So, there were three other
cases picked up

68
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
by Austin PD
last night,

69
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,700
right around the time of your...

70
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,000
-My freakout?
-Yeah.

71
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,100
Your freakout.

72
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,800
Do you remember anything?

73
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,500
Well, I was
in the shower

74
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,500
and suddenly everything went
really, really weird.

75
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,700
I mean, it was...

76
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,000
I think

77
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,900
maybe there's something
in the water

78
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,500
that was coming through my
mucous membranes, my skin,

79
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,600
because the onset was so fast.

80
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
It was, like, pow!

81
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,400
Okay, but if it was
in the water supply,

82
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,800
then wouldn't it
have affected the whole area?

83
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,500
Well...
excuse me.

84
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,100
It's, uh, most definitely not
in the reservoir

85
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,800
'cause I tested the water
last night.

86
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,000
But I don't know
about that.

87
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,500
-Why?
-'Cause last night I found out

88
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,700
that Gill Strickland's
hotel bill showed

89
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,300
that he only purchased one
bottle of Travis Springs.

90
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm thinking that he was
refilling it in the sink.

91
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,100
You were taking
a shower,

92
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,600
he was drinking out of the tap.

93
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,800
It's got to be the water.

94
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,700
But if it's in the tap water,
but it's not in the reservoir, then...

95
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,900
Then something's happening
to the water in between.

96
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,500
In the pipes.

97
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,800
We got to get on this.

98
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Rachel.

99
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,100
Yeah?

100
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,000
Did I do, uh, anything...

101
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
or say anything,
you know,

102
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,600
weird last night?

103
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,800
Not really.

104
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Except the break-dancing.

105
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,200
Nice to have you back, Hood.

106
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,900
Thank you.

107
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
Good to be back.

108
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,000
Stop!

109
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,600
Someone's been digging trenches
here.

110
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,700
This is a new
development.

111
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,300
Why would you dig up pipe
on a brand-new house?

112
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,000
You wouldn't.

113
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,000
But this might help
us find out why.

114
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,500
I'd say it's
from a water pipe.

115
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,700
What are you doing here, Gre

116
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,800
Daddy!

117
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,600
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

118
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,300
Come here, Troy.

119
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,700
Well, I...

120
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,300
I wanted to see you
and Troy.

121
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,100
And, uh,

122
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,600
look, I wanted to say
that I'm...

123
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,500
What, Greg?

124
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,800
You're sorry for being in jail?

125
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,500
I just, I just need you and Troy

126
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,000
to know that you don't need
to be afraid of me. Okay?

127
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,600
Stop, Greg. Just...

128
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
stop.

129
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,100
I filed for a restraining orr.

130
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,900
Please, just listen.

131
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,900
Even the FBI said...
said it wasn't my fault.

132
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,800
But...

133
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,300
God knows in the past
I've given you reason

134
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,200
to be real mad.

135
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
I know that, but

136
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm clean, Ash.

137
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,500
For 16 months now, I got my,
my plumbing coany up and running...

138
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,300
And what?

139
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,500
What, Greg?

140
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,700
And I want to come home

141
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,300
to my family.

142
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,200
To my life.

143
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,400
Th's all.

144
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,700
They said it wasn't your fault?

145
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,500
You've seen the news--

146
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,800
all kinds of people
acting crazy lately.

147
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
Ash.

148
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,300
I can't do this again, Greg.

149
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,200
Keep away from us.
Or I'll the police.

150
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,400
Ashley.

151
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Nice family.

152
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,900
Do what we say,
you might get to see them again.

153
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,100
If our victims didn't have clean
backgrounds,

154
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,500
what would you say these
random outbursts point to?

155
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,400
It's a no-brainer.
Drugs.

156
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,500
But these people aren't
drug users, Hood.

157
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
You're not a drug user.

158
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,800
Remember the Salem
witch trials?

159
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Yeah, sure.
Uh, puritans, repression,

160
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,300
teenage girls freaking out
and seeing witches.

161
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
We read The Crucible
in tenth grade.

162
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,900
Well,

163
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,200
some historians
now believe

164
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,000
that those, uh,
bewitched girls

165
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,800
were actually eating
grain tainted

166
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
with a naturally occurring
hallucinogenic compound.

167
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,400
-So they were tripping?
-Maybe.

168
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Are you saying
there's some

169
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,500
kind of hallucinogen
in the pipes?

170
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,000
Well, I'm saying
that the most

171
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,600
logical explanation is
usually the right one.

172
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,700
And if people are acting like
they're on drugs,

173
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,600
-then chances are...
-They're on drugs.

174
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,800
Whether they know it or not.

175
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,800
Hey, I thought we were
done talking.

176
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
You're not under suspicion,
Mr. Driggs.

177
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,400
But we need your help.

178
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Do you have any small scale

179
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,300
-filtering equient here in your office?
-Yeah.

180
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,600
I test our samples
every couple of hours.

181
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,200
That's much more often
than the water treatment plant.

182
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,100
Well, that's
very good.

183
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,500
Um, can I borrow an Erlenmeyer flask?

184
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,300
Right over here.

185
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,600
Great.

186
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,400
Thank you.
That's very helpful.

187
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,400
And, um,
a funnel, please.

188
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,400
Thank you.
Some filter paper--

189
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,200
-ashless, please.
-You got it.

190
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
Jatorial closet.

191
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
-Yeah, can I...
-Sure.

192
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,200
Thank you.

193
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,700
Perfect.

194
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,600
Mind if I sit down?

195
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
-Bleach?
-Yeah.

196
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,000
Six percent solution
of sodm hypochlorite or

197
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,900
half the percentage used
in the chlorine burn.

198
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,100
Take our water pipe.

199
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Add the chlorine.

200
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,900
Stirred, not shaken.

201
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,300
What's it doing?

202
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,900
Hopefully, it's making
whatever happened to the pipes

203
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,900
after the chlorine burn
happen for us now.

204
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,900
That ought to do it.

205
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,100
If the chlorine did manage

206
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,100
to pull some kind of drug
out of the pipes,

207
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,600
whoever drank the water
or bathed in it

208
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
immediately afterwards
would have been affected by it.

209
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,800
Now, whatever's in
this solution

210
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,400
is what will have been ingested
by our victims, including me.

211
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,200
If there are drugs
in the pipes,

212
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
why would all the victims'
drug tests come back negative?

213
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,200
Because plastic is so good

214
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
at leaching
onto other substances,

215
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,000
altering the compounds.

216
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,600
Now, chemically speaking,
what we get out of this

217
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,800
won't be exactly the same
as heroin or cocaine,

218
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,600
but it will be similar enough
to get you high.

219
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,500
But different enough
to fool a drug test.

220
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,100
Exactly.

221
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,900
Phencyclidine.

222
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,600
The pipes were embedded
with PCP.

223
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,300
Rachel, it's not
like I'm an expert on street drugs, 

224
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,300
but didn't PCP go out of style

225
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,900
with Deep Purple and Pet Rocks?

226
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, angel dust
is off the market,

227
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,500
but PCP is making
a major comeback.

228
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,700
Street gangs make it into pills
or soak marijuana in it,

229
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,000
then distribute via existing
cocaine connections.

230
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,400
So, if the pipes were a way
of transporting the drugs,

231
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,600
how'd they end up
in the ground?

232
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,300
Probably a mix-up.

233
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,000
Drug-laced pipes somehow got
swapped with the real ping.

234
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,400
And White Tail Hills got
itself a bad trip.

235
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
The question is...

236
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,400
how much more is out there
and how can we track it down

237
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,200
without anyone else
being affected?

238
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,800
We start by shutting down
its method of delivery.

239
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,200
Who are you calling?

240
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,400
The reservoir pumping station
that services White Tail Hills.

241
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,700
I'm gonna have 'em shut off
the water for the development ASAP.

242
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,300
Hey, Greg.

243
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,700
Who the hell are you?

244
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,900
Someone who's missing
something valuable.

245
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,400
And this place?

246
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,800
This is the lost and found.

247
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,900
You buy a flat of three-inch pipe
schedule 40 recently?

248
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,600
Why?

249
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,200
Because it's ours
and we want it back.

250
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,600
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

251
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,300
You're the only
plumbing supplier

252
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,800
in this crappy little
prefab paradise, Greg.

253
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,100
-You know what that means?
-No.

254
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,500
-It means you're lying.
-No, I'm not.

255
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,000
The drug traffickers
must be digging up pipes,

256
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,200
looking for their merchandise.
But how do they know where to dig?

257
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Grab Greg Filmore's case file
from my bag, will you?

258
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,800
Got it.

259
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Now, he said that he lived
with his brother in Cedar Park.

260
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,600
Right,

261
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,900
but on his paperwork,
he listed his address

262
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,800
at 131 Columbia Street,
White Tail Hills.

263
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
That's where we got
the pipe sample.

264
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
That's right.

265
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,400
Somebody is digging up pipe

266
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,600
based on the police reports
of erratic behavior.

267
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,000
With all the chlorine burns
at the water treatment plant,

268
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
we can be sure those pipes
already had a big percentage

269
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,800
of the PCP
flushed out of them.

270
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,900
They need to reclaim their merchandise
as quickly as possible.

271
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,700
Well, Greg Filmore listed
his place of employment

272
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,700
as Kingston Plumbing
and Pool Supply.

273
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,800
What is it?

274
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,700
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

275
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,600
Yep, it's an ID stamp.

276
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Suppliers put them on pipes
in case a pipe fails inspection.

277
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
K- I.

278
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,400
Kingston.

279
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,000
Where are the rest
of the pipes?

280
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,400
I told you.

281
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Those pipes are just what
the manufacturer shipped us.

282
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,400
The, the truck pulls up and I take
what they give me.

283
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,700
One pipe looks
the same as the next.

284
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,000
Now, that's it,
man, that's it.

285
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,100
2,000 feet of pipe
per pallet.

286
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,000
We've taken 78 feet of pipe
out of the ground.

287
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,300
You want to tell me
how much you think is left?

288
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,000
Uh, 1,900.

289
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,300
Close enough.

290
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,800
So what I want
to know is:

291
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,500
where's the rest
of my stuff?

292
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,500
I don't know, man.
I swear to God I don't know.

293
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,200
You're lying!

294
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,000
Where's the rest
of my damn pipe?!

295
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,400
I don't know.

296
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,400
Isn't that the truck we saw
at White Tail Hills?

297
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,600
It sure is.

298
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,900
They were working
near Greg's house.

299
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,800
Keep your head down
and the door locked

300
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,300
-while I check this out.
-Well, Rachel...

301
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Hood, it's best
you stay here.

302
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,600
You got to believe me, man.

303
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,900
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

304
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,200
You got a wife and kid back in
that crappy new house, don't you?

305
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,200
You don't start talking,
it'll be them sitting here.

306
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,700
Maybe this will help you
remember where my stuff is.

307
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Spin him around.

308
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,900
Sit up.

309
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,200
I don't want
to do this, Greg,

310
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,700
but we're talking close to
$20 million worth of product.

311
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,300
My PCP!

312
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,700
I don't know nothing.

313
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,200
I don't know nothing!

314
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,200
Found it, boss.

315
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,500
Here you go.

316
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,700
I'm done
asking you nice, Greg.

317
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,900
Give me his hand.

318
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
No, no, please.

319
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,000
Hold still.

320
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,300
-This is hot enough to melt metal, Greg.
-Rachel.

321
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,400
What do you think
it'll do to your hand?

322
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,400
Do you ever listen to advice?

323
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Screw you.

324
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,400
All right,
now, hold him.

325
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,700
Rachel, they're
going to kill him.

326
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,000
I already called for backup;
that's all we can do.

327
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,300
-We're outgunned and outmanned heavily.
-Hold still.

328
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,300
I don't want to sit here
and watch him die either,

329
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,400
but your safety
is my priority.

330
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,600
Chlorine.

331
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,100
Where is our pipe?

332
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,400
What are you doing?

333
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,700
Shh...

334
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,000
Perfect.

335
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,700
I don't know
nothing, man.

336
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,400
That's not the answer
I'm looking for, Greg.

337
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,800
Hood.

338
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,500
It's really not.

339
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,700
It's possible to think your way
out of a problem.

340
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,600
No more.

341
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,100
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance

342
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,600
to tell me where
my stuff is!

343
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,000
I don't know, man, I swear.

344
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,700
Where's our pipe?

345
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,100
What the hell is that?

346
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,900
Go check it out.

347
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,400
-Give me your jacket.
-Why?

348
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,600
'Cause I want to tear it apart.
Come on.

349
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,700
Antifreeze--

350
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,300
propylene glycol-- is
a non-toxic humectant.

351
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,300
Put it over your nose and mouth.
It'll protect you from the chlorine.

352
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,500
Come on. Let's go.

353
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,700
Greg told me
he wasn't responsible

354
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,400
for what happened
at the supermarket.

355
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,300
Well, he told
you the truth.

356
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,500
He just drank the wrong water
from the wrong tap.

357
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,800
Could have happened
to anyone whose house

358
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,400
was fed by those pipes.
Believe me, I know.

359
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Mrs. Filmore,
in my line of work,

360
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,300
I, I don't tend
to be very forgiving

361
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,300
when it comes
to substance abuse.

362
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,700
But I was wrong
about your husband.

363
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,200
He was clean

364
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,700
and he's going to stay clean
for you and your son.

365
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,000
We'll leave
you two alone.

366
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,400
Thank you.

367
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,100
Hi.

368
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,500
How was your phone call
to the FBI?

369
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Well, the Bureau's
concerned

370
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,800
you're turning
into a rock star--

371
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,700
doing drugs,
trashing your hotel room.

372
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,000
Well, what can I say, Rachel?
I'm a wild and crazy scientist.

373
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,300
Any news on the case?

374
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,300
Did they find the
rest of the drugs?

375
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,700
Yeah, they tracked down
the four missing pallets

376
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,500
of PCP-laced pipe
near San Antonio.

377
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,400
Speaking of which,

378
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,800
was that your first time?

379
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,200
First time what?

380
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,700
Getting high.

381
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,600
On PCP?

382
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,100
Yeah.

383
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,900
Don't tell me.

384
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,200
You didn't inhale.

385
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,900
Or better yet,

386
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,300
to be a true scientist
requires experimentation.

387
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,900
What is this,
cop humor?

388
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,800
I'm not a cop.
I'm a fed.

389
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,000
What's the difference?

390
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Uh, we don't get paid overtime
and we're special.

391
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,000
Agents, that is.

392
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,200
So...

393
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,100
Special Agent
Rachel Young,

394
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,800
when are we going back
to the shooting range?

395
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,600
We are never going back
to the shooting range.

396
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Why?

397
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Because you think really well, but
you can't shoot rth a damn.

398
