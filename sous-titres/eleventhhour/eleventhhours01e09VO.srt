Spring break date, gentlemen!

7
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:46,576
Greg.

8
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:48,144
Lenny.

9
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52,959
Are you okay?

10
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,909
Are you all right?

11
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,589
Somebody call 911!

12
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,284
Dude...
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:06,953
Are you okay?
Is he gonna
be all right?

14
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:12,217
ARE YOU OKAY?

15
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:13,533
What happened?

16
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:14,895
Lenny.Lenny.

17
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:21,542
Hate this time of year.

18
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:23,099
Yeah, spring break sucks.

19
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,943
?

20
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:27,576
Damn it. V-fib.

21
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:29,605
Got it.

22
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,141
200 ??

23
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,242
Charging 200.

24
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:40,309
Clear.

25
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,363
nothing

26
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,374
?

27
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:45,153
Charging 250.

28
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,309
Clear.

29
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:49,408
still nothing

30
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,581
Mine's a V-fib, too.
here we go again.

31
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,185
Charging 200.

32
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:55,326
Clear.

33
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,319
?

34
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,455
Time to call it.

35
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:08,157
Subject number two
is Leonard Reese.

36
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:12,058
Male, Caucasian, five-foot-11.

37
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:15,234
No significant
birthmarks or moles.

38
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:19,975
Subject has a tattoo
over his left shoulder blade.

39
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,344
In the form of a dagger

40
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,375
piercing a pair of cherries.

41
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:27,792
Tasteful.

42
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:31,942
I'll now begin
the internal examination.

43
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:03,708
Where the hell am I?

44
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:09,675
Greg?! Greg!

45
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:11,342
Oh!

46
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:12,775
We need some help in here!

47
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:14,142
What did y
do to us?!

48
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:16,675
Can I get some help in here?!

49
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,675
What did you do?!

50
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,025
PALO ALTO,CALIFORNIA

51
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:25,263
Tanner still
misses you.

52
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:27,247
Yeah, well,
the feeling's mutual.

53
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:30,488
But, mm, it wouldn't have
been right to hold onto him

54
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:31,856
after my job change.

55
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,075
I'm never at home.

56
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:35,109
And he needs
his exercise.

57
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,608
Don't you, boy?

58
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,616
Hey, the last time
you were in town,

59
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:41,385
someone from the Congressional
Science and Technology Committee

60
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:43,442
asked you out on a little date.

61
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:46,708
You know, didn't feel right.

62
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:50,342
You know, it's been two years
since Maggie died.

63
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,175
Don't you think
it's time to move on?

64
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:57,908
Anna, I'm here as a friend.

65
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:59,611
I'm not one of your
psychiatric patients, okay?

66
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:00,460
I know.

67
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,075
And I'm asking
out of concern, as a friend.

68
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,908
Come on, boy!

69
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,975
If you don't want
to talk about it,

70
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,608
that's fine.
But, uh, how else...

71
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:16,975
How else can I, uh,
deal with my grief?

72
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:20,942
I am dealing with it.

73
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:24,375
I am.

74
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:29,704
I'm just dealing with it
in my own way.

75
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:32,071
And that doesn't
involve a lot of

76
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:36,571
crying on people's shoulders
and analyzing feelings.

77
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:38,505
Okay?

78
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,238
What does it involve?

79
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:45,351
Hood.

80
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:50,438
What happened
to the weekend off?

81
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:51,334
Cut short.

82
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,029
Some college kids
in Daytona Beach

83
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,505
died of
mysterious causes,

84
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,338
then came back to life.

85
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,339
Excuse us.

86
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:03,605
What does it involve?

87
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,971
It involves this.

00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,762
Audrey Simone,
internal medicine.

92
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,762
So you're the FBI's go-to guy

93
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:32,864
for when the dead
come back to life?

94
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:34,263
Well, not exactly, but they, uh,

95
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:35,895
come to me with
a variety of problems.

96
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,563
Well, I can't wait
to hear you explain this.

97
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:42,943
Lenny Reese, age 21.

98
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,589
He spontaneously recovered
from his apparent death

99
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,629
12 hours ago.

100
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,769
We've never seen

101
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:49,457
anything like it.

102
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,895
Please, get me out of here.

103
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:53,895
Lenny...

104
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:55,062
I'm serious, man.

105
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,640
I woke up in a room
full of dead peoe.

106
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,730
I saw one of
my best friends cut open

107
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,682
while his heart
was still beating.

108
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:02,263
Greg McCarthy?
Yes.

109
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,563
Uh, now, w-whatever I need to do
to get out of here...

110
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,062
You need to tell me
what you were doing yesterday.

111
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:10,596
Well, um, we had just
finished up midterms

112
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,563
at Maryland State,
and a bunch of us

113
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,762
came down here to de-stress
a little, you know?

114
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:18,453
Drink some beers,
hook up with some hotties.

115
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,162
Just party, man.

116
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,263
What did you and Greg
do in common the past 24 hours?

117
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,029
The only thing that Greg and I
shared in the past 24 hours

118
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,762
was a runner-up Miss Teen USA.

119
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:32,296
She consented to that?

120
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:33,196
Hell yeah.

121
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:34,463
What's her name?

122
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,096
Tabitha, uh, Jackson.

123
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:39,363
I'm not... I'm not sure.

124
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:41,548
Will you excuse us for a second?

125
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:49,217
If the only common thread
between the two victims

126
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:50,630
is sex with the same girl,

127
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:54,062
then we're looking at
sexually transmitted infection.

128
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:55,663
That instantly slowed
their heartbeats down

129
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,830
to next to nothing?

130
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,062
Well, yeah, it's possible.

131
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,229
Could be toxic shock syndrome,
which could result from, uh,

132
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,363
bacteria passed through
intercourse.

133
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:06,529
Could lead to
heart and lung failure,

134
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:08,329
even coma.

135
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,696
I'll have Dr. Simone
check for it.

136
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:11,696
If it was that,

137
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,663
what woke him up from the coma?

138
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,282
Well, find the girl
they slept with,

139
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:16,795
we could find the answer.

140
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:18,410
Hey! The cops said
I had to stay here

141
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,730
until I talked to you guys.

142
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:20,830
Well, now I talked to you,

143
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,795
so I'm-I'm free
to go, right?

144
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:26,730
Uh, you're at the center
of a public health crisis.

145
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:29,263
We got to check you out,
make sure you're okay.

146
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:30,436
I'm fine.

147
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:32,461
Sorry, but we've got to
run you through the system,

148
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,229
get 100% positive ID.

149
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:36,196
Positive ID? What the hell
are you talking about?

150
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,396
You know exactly who I am.

151
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:38,462
I'm Leonard Reese.

152
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:39,895
Maybe.

153
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:41,829
Maybe not. Leonard.

154
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,033
If that is your real name.

155
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:46,988
We'll check your
fingerprints, your DNA,

156
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,329
see what they tell us.

157
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:49,762
That's ridiculous.

158
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,493
No, that's federal procedure.

159
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,429
I need to track down a person
of interest: Tabitha Jackson.

160
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,096
Oh, my God.

161
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:46,157
No.

162
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,730
No.

163
00:08:56,862 --> 00:09:00,396
No. No!

164
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,263
Tabitha Jackson
checked in here two nights ago.

165
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:07,996
This brings back memories.

166
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:11,762
Really?

167
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,929
You were something
of a party girl?

168
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,846
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

169
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,639
You know, last week,
all my hard work paid off.

170
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:27,062
Aced exams.

171
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,181
I just thought
I would reward myself.

172
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:34,229
You know, like,

173
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:36,468
blow off some steam.

174
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,862
Do you remember what happened?

175
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,588
I was so drunk.

176
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,903
God, it was so stupid.

177
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,403
I can't believe
there were two of them.

178
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,939
Um...

179
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,946
Tabitha...

180
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:00,235
I'm not a police officer--

181
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:03,068
I'm not really sure
how to ask you this, but, um...

182
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,170
I need to know something
about your sexual history.

183
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,103
What?

184
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:10,766
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:12,416
Um...

186
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,382
those two boys...

187
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:17,369
may have contracted a sexually
transmitted disease,

188
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,372
and we don't know
where it's from.

189
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:23,062
But I can count on my hand
how many people...

190
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:24,256
that I've had sex with.

191
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,193
I'm telling you,
I'm not this girl.

192
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,608
I'm not this girl.

193
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,068
We believe you, okay?

194
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:34,801
We believe you.

195
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,792
Okay, I'm gonna take you
to the hospital now, okay?

196
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,636
Let's go.

197
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:48,402
Do you want us
to call your parents?

198
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:49,786
Do we have to?

199
00:10:49,786 --> 00:10:51,363
No, we don't have to.

200
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,335
I think you should.

201
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,536
I think they'd want to know
so they can be here for you.

202
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,602
I doubt that.

203
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,291
Just keep walking, babe.

204
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,955
But that's...

205
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:08,981
that's one of them!
I know.

206
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,525
It's okay.

207
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,820
All right.

208
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,435
It's okay.

209
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,135
You all right, Tabitha?

210
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:20,172
Son of a bitch.

211
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,269
He acts like
nothing had ever...

212
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:25,902
ever happened.

213
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,636
Tabitha!

214
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,022
We need a doctor over here, now!

215
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,419
Pulse ox tanking!

216
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:33,874
She's asystole!
Let's go!

217
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:35,483
Nope. She's got
a heartbeat.

218
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,356
That's just a residual, sir--
please stand back.

219
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:38,356
No, it's not.

220
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:39,967
I don't think shocking
her is gonna help.

221
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,853
I already told you,
stand back.

222
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:42,645
Dr. Simone!

223
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:43,866
Dr. Simone, please!

224
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,654
?

225
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:47,491
Defibrillation did nothing
for Lenny or Greg.

226
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:48,984
This is no different.
Clear!

227
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,530
Stop.

228
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,556
The heartbeat's regular,

229
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:55,536
but impossibly slow--
five beats per minute?

230
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:56,751
That's why
the medics

231
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:57,879
thought Greg and Lenny
were dead.

232
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,172
Five beats a minute?

233
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,871
That's, like, one beat
every 12 seconds.

234
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,668
What's her body temperature?

235
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,584
It's only 75.

236
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:05,763
Seventy-five?

237
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:07,463
It's as if
she's turned ectothermic.

238
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:09,536
Well, that's not consistent
with toxic shock syndrome.

239
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:10,387
It's not consistent

240
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,701
with anything else
I've ever encountered, either.

241
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:16,442
Any body that's that cold

242
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:19,301
with a heartbeat that slow...

243
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,335
that's not a coma.

244
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:24,963
That's suspended animation.

245
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:34,008
Excuse me,
can you help us?

246
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:36,252
We're trying
to find our daughter.
Tabitha Jackson?

247
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:38,289
Oh, uh, I'm Special Agent Young.

248
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,182
I'm the one who
called you yesterday.

249
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:42,378
Your daughter is stable now.

250
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,115
Let me walk you to her room.

251
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:45,902
Yes, please. Thank you.

252
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,735
That's great...

253
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,868
Yeah. That's...

254
00:12:57,935 --> 00:12:59,902
All right,
you got to flip him.

255
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,567
All right... flip it.

256
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,849
Let's see.

257
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:07,181
Oh! All right.

258
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,737
Come on, down the hatch.

259
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:09,848
I can't.

260
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:10,980
Yes, you can.

261
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,678
come on Drink up, Belinda.
Oh...

262
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:14,970
You have to.
Oh, I know, I know.

263
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,603
Rules are rules.

264
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:18,121
But I thought the rules were...

265
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:19,557
Come on, come on.

266
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:21,813
Less thinking, more drinking.

267
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:28,393
See? It's not
that bad, right?

268
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:29,349
Hey, uh,

269
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,133
I just got the weirdest message
from our boy Lenny

270
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,128
saying Greg is dead?
All right,

271
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,519
I'm not getting punked again
by that dude.

272
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,106
Remember April Fools?

273
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:39,299
Yeah, you're
probably right.

274
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:42,665
Yeah. And hey, you know what, if they want to miss out on this,

275
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:44,402
fine by me.

276
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,448
More for us.

277
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,276
Absolutely.

278
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:49,164
Boo-yah.

279
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:51,179
I hate playing kings.

280
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:53,069
<i>I love playing you.</i>

281
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:55,162
Only two kings tonight, sweetheart.

282
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:58,376
Lucky for you,
we know how to treat a queen.

283
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,636
Oh, yeah?
Let me show you.

284
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:21,219
Oh, hi, Rachel.

285
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,573
You don't mind
if I call you Rachel, do you,

286
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,296
Agent Young?

287
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,980
Good news for both
of us, Lenny.

288
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,168
You seem to be fine,

289
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,609
so you're no longer
under Federal supervision.

290
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:36,166
But the nurses say
you've been harassing them.

291
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,119
So my advice to you

292
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,413
is stay out of trouble,
or next time

293
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,276
you won't be in a hospital bed,
you'll be in jail.

294
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,618
God, you're beautiful.

295
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:47,636
A woman like you...

296
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:50,599
FBI agent.

297
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,328
Bet you've been
through a lot, huh?

298
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:56,235
You know, after
my brush with death,

299
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,068
the things that I've seen,

300
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:02,102
the friend that I lost...

301
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:07,402
It's not a doctor that I need,
if you know what I mean.

302
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:10,154
Ow!
I don't know what

303
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,444
turns me on more-- the fact
that you might be diseased

304
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,330
or that you got a girl drunk
so you and your buddy

305
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,890
could gang bang her.

306
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:18,035
You are a bitch!

307
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:19,847
And I'm out of here!

308
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:34,851
Lenny is suffering
from something called

309
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,713
necrotizing fasciitis,

310
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:39,679
more commonly known as
flesh-eating bacteria.

311
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,149
Sounds almost as
disgusting as it looks.

312
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,165
What causes it?

313
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:45,544
Well, actually, it's
the same strep A bacteria

314
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:49,172
that causes common diseases like
tonsillitis and strep throat.

315
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:54,902
Change of plan?

316
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,394
We're going somewhere else.

317
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,317
Pet store.

318
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:07,194
Now, little known fact

319
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,321
about strep A bacteria.

320
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,165
In addition to causing
necrotizing fasciitis,

321
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:15,643
it naturally produces
hydrogen sufide.

322
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:18,567
Watch this.

323
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:25,006
Uh, Hood...

324
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,459
you can wake him up, right?

325
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:29,653
No, I just murdered him.

326
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:32,039
What kind of scientist
do you think I am, Rachel?

327
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:36,270
No, at this dosage,
all hydrogen sulfide does is

328
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,284
induces a state
of suspended animation.

329
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:41,329
Just like Lenny and Greg.

330
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:44,298
And now Tabitha Jackson.

331
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:46,584
Mickey's breathing is reduced

332
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,223
to just a few breaths a minute.

333
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:51,218
His metabolism slows
to a crawl.

334
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:55,501
When normal air
is reintroduced...

335
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:59,536
Mickey?

336
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:04,800
Mickey comes back to life.

337
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:07,415
So someone dosed our victims

338
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,241
with hydrogen sulfide gas.

339
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,415
Not really.

340
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:13,415
I think the strep A bacteria
in their bodies

341
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:15,547
somehow directly released
hydrogen sulfide

342
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:16,881
into their bloodstream.

343
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:18,214
Suspended animation.

344
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,148
That's right.

345
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:22,248
<i>So, you're telling me</i>

346
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:23,714
that if we revive
Tabitha Jackson,

347
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:24,874
she'll come down
with a case

348
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:26,314
of necrotizing fasciitis.

349
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:27,847
It's quite simple--
think of it

350
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,314
as a two-stage process,
like a cavity in a tooth.

351
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,663
Stage one's just a hole.

352
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:34,133
Without intervention,
it proceeds to stage two.

353
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,281
When infection sets in,
it spreads out until

354
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:37,868
it devours everything.
So we need

355
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:39,516
to prevent
Tabitha Jackson's case

356
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,086
from developing to stage two,

357
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:42,881
keeping her in
suspended animation.

358
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:44,843
Yeah. Until we find out
what's causing it

359
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,814
and we can find out
how to stop it.

360
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:49,814
And we do this
by prolonging her current state?
Well, it doesn't appear

361
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:52,881
to be causing any long-term
damage to the body so far.

362
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:55,960
Well, I suppose we could try
ice water immersion.

363
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,481
We have a few tubs in the back--
we could use one of those.

364
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:00,714
Good. Keep her as cold
as possible. Listen--

365
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,914
we're smack in the
middle of spring break.

366
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,381
If this thing is spread
through sexual contact,

367
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:09,105
you better start preparing
for a lot more cases
just like Tabitha.

368
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:38,342
Belinda! Are you okay?

369
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,062
Belinda!

370
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:51,947
You got a condom?

371
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,214
Oh, come on, Kayla.

372
00:18:56,714 --> 00:19:00,202
You don't need
protection from me.

373
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:03,181
Sorry, babe,
no condom, no nasty.

374
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:13,116
Lucky you.

375
00:19:30,014 --> 00:19:32,214
Wake up, sexy.

376
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,575
Hey.

377
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:37,248
Hey.

378
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,135
Wake up.

379
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,148
Oh, my God.

380
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:48,214
Oh, my God.

381
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:49,415
Help!

382
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,547
Somebody help us!

383
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:52,947
Help!

384
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,415
So I'm not gonna get sick?

385
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,781
Not from Seth.

386
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:01,947
Thanks to the fact
that you were

387
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:04,781
responsible enough
to use some protection.

388
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:06,881
Guess my party's over, huh?

389
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,673
For now.

390
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,058
Screening your calls?

391
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:24,763
Let me guess.

392
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:26,281
The dog sitter?

393
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:30,248
She's a professor
of psychiatry, actually.

394
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,947
So are you
seeing her?

395
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:34,314
No, she was a friend
of my wife.

396
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:37,475
I meant as a
psychiatrist.

397
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:41,377
No, no, not that either.

398
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:42,914
When are you
gonna tell her

399
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:44,214
the dog was
just a ruse

400
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:45,658
to spend more
time with her?

401
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:48,281
Tanner is not a ruse.

402
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,314
Could have fooled me.
Wait a second.

403
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,281
Several cases of a deadly form
of flesh-eating bacteria

404
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:53,981
were reported
in Daytona Beach today.

405
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:55,281
The bacteria is believed

406
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:57,248
to spread
through sexual contact.

407
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:59,448
To prevent a possible
epidemic,

408
00:20:59,515 --> 00:21:02,041
the County is prohibiting
the service of alcohol

409
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,114
after 8:00 P.M.,
and the 10:00 P.M. curfew

410
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,248
is being enforced on all
residents of Voluisa County

411
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:10,781
including spring break visitors.

412
00:21:11,255 --> 00:21:12,415
I'm glad to see

413
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,839
the local health
department is complying

414
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,348
with our request.

415
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:16,914
But it's not enough.

416
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:18,388
Yeah.

417
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,161
We have two more victims
in suspended animation,

418
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:29,014
Belinda Shea and Seth Sandel.

419
00:21:29,014 --> 00:21:30,930
How are they
holding up?

420
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,881
Well, we're monitoring
their vitals continually.

421
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:35,281
to prevent hypothermia.
So far, so good.

422
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:37,333
You got any more tubs?
No, we're not equipped

423
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,381
to handle this sort of thing.
on a large scale.

424
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,097
It may be getting larger.

425
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:42,133
Well, what can we do?

426
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,705
Our entire infrastructure
is built around

427
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:47,739
maintaining a body
temperature of 98.6, not 70.

428
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,714
With one pretty major exception.

429
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:53,547
What's the coldest place
in the building?

430
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,503
The temperature
at our morgue is kept

431
00:21:57,503 --> 00:22:00,279
at a constant 36 degrees
at all times.

432
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:13,426
She looks like
she's already dead.

433
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:17,231
She's not, Mr. Jackson.
This could help keep her alive.

434
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:20,548
If she wakes up now, she's gonna be in terrible danger,

435
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,248
but if we can somehow
crack the code

436
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:24,611
of the bacteria
that made her sick,

437
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,881
we should be able
to engineer a cure.

438
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,849
How long would that take?

439
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,614
I wish I knew.

440
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:42,952
Rachel, sit down.
I want to show you something.

441
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:47,303
This is the DNA sequence
of normal strep A.

442
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:51,237
This is the DNA sequence
of the new bacteria.

443
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,947
It looks a lot shorter.
Yeah, it's a lot

444
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:54,448
simpler, too; it's got

445
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:57,248
less than half the
number of base pairs.

446
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,647
What does that mean?

447
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:02,048
It's got no junk DNA--

448
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:07,614
the portions of the DNA that
serve no identifiable purpose.

449
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,390
Every natural organism
has junk DNA.

450
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,297
So the bacteria
infecting the kids

451
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:14,660
is manmade.

452
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,341
Yeah. The good thing about that
is, if someone created it,

453
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:19,175
then we'll know
how to destroy it.

454
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:21,747
I'm gonna have
the hospital geneticist

455
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,415
build me a gene map
of the bacteria.

456
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:26,847
It's kind of a like
a forensic scientist

457
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:29,381
putting together the pieces
of an exploded bomb.

458
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:30,653
If we do that...

459
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:33,230
We'll have a shot
at tracing it to its creator.

460
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,076
Exactly.

461
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:50,190
Any signs
of flesh-eating bacteria?

462
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:51,448
No.

463
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,589
So far, so good.

464
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:57,014
Wait.
What is it?

465
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:02,314
The autopsy photo
of our first victim,

466
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:03,781
Greg McCarthy...

467
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,048
I remember something.

468
00:25:00,726 --> 00:25:02,784
Hood, All the male victims had

469
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:04,613
the same daggers-
and-cherries tattoo.

470
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:05,809
I looked into it.

471
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:07,608
It wasn't
a fraternity tattoo.

472
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,110
It's got nothing
to do with Maryland

473
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,342
State University or any
of its sports teams.

474
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,142
The dagger and cherries?

475
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:14,842
When these guys were so proud

476
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,509
of taking advantage
of young women,

477
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:18,644
maybe one of them crossed
the line, got busted.

478
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,755
I'm gonna have the National Crime Information Center

479
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:23,909
do a cross-search of all our
male victims and sex crimes.

480
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:25,775
What's this?

481
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:27,987
Hot off the press.

482
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:30,543
Gene map of our
manmade bacteria.

483
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:32,276
Our bone parts.

484
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:33,476
That's right.

485
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:34,608
Now...

486
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:36,409
every gene here
has a purpose,

487
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:37,772
seeing as it
was built

488
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:39,742
and designed
for a reason.

489
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:42,618
So what have we got?
We got...

490
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:43,875
resistance to

491
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,242
ultraviolet rays,

492
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,842
resistance
to radiation,

493
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:51,361
tolerance for oxygen loss,
tolerance for...

494
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:54,342
extreme cold.

495
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:56,962
What is it?

496
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:58,675
Space.

497
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:00,676
The suspended animation

498
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:04,737
this bacteria causes could
conceivably allow someone

499
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,342
to survive
long periods

500
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:07,793
in space.

501
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:10,342
Are you saying our bomb
was built by NASA?

502
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,771
it's not about???

503
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:19,460
FLORIDA SAPCE CENTER

504
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,841
<i>I'm shocked you found</i>

505
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:23,067
Chronos-X-Coli
outside these walls.

506
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,368
Chronos-X-Coli?

507
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:26,902
It's the name of hydrogen-sulfide-producing bacteria.

508
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:29,135
"X" as in experimental.

509
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:31,635
And "Chronos" as in
the Greek god of time.

510
00:26:31,702 --> 00:26:34,035
Exactly. Our goal
here is to enable

511
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,140
astronauts to travel
to destinations

512
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,186
that would otherwise
remain out of reach.

513
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:41,736
Now, we may not see spaceflight utilizing
suspended animation

514
00:26:41,736 --> 00:26:44,411
in our own lifetimes,
but our children will.

515
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:45,935
Well, unfortunately,

516
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:48,802
there's a few college-age
children who won't, Dr. West.

517
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:50,368
And it appears to be associated

518
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:52,202
with the work you're doing
in this lab.

519
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,952
I'm sorry. This is
the Space Science Center,

520
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:57,368
not some biological warfare
facility

521
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:59,269
in the former Soviet Union.

522
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,836
My people don't sell
their wares on the
black market.

523
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:03,496
And while the bacteria found

524
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,824
in your victims does match
Chronos-X-Coli,

525
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,802
Chronos-X-Coli wasn't designed
to cause necrotizing fasciitis,

526
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:11,085
and that's actually what's
harming your victims,

527
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:12,802
not suspended animation.

528
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:15,657
There's no record
of a break-in or reports

529
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:17,924
of stolen materials
in the past three years.

530
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:18,935
That's 'cause,
like I said,

531
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:20,635
that kind of thing
doesn't happen here.

532
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:24,568
Dr. West, when I was analyzing
your Chronos-X-Coli's DNA,

533
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:26,806
there was one gene
I couldn't quite work out.

534
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:28,626
It's an apoptotic gene,
I think.

535
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,668
It's a built-in failsafe;

536
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:32,616
the gene designed
to initiate cell suicide.

537
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:33,835
Exactly.

538
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,471
Your built-in
self-destruct mechanism.

539
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:39,346
Yeah.
Well, right now we have

540
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:42,336
innocent victims that are lying
in hospital,

541
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:43,602
and there's a possibility

542
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:46,397
that your failsafe
could help cure them.

543
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:48,236
Tell us how it works?

544
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:50,802
I wish I could help you,
Dr. Hood,

545
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,914
I truly do, but I can't.

546
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:55,824
National security
regulations make
it impossible.

547
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:58,343
The information you're
asking for falls
under the heading

548
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,368
"federal proprietary
technology,"

549
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:03,202
and I can't share that with you.

550
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,969
You understand young people's
lives are at risk?

551
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,871
Yes, I'm aware
of that.

552
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:09,735
I'm also aware that we don't
pick and choose

553
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:11,435
where we want the law to apply.

554
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:14,135
It applies
all the time or
it means nothing.

555
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:16,062
It applies until we get
a federal court order

556
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,247
that says it doesn't.

557
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:20,514
Hopefully, no one else
will be dead by then.

558
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:24,068
We'll see ourselves out.

559
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:33,935
How long's it gonna take
to get a court order?

560
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:35,768
If things work out,
we could have it
by midnight.

561
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:36,768
Let's hope.

562
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:39,668
This is Agent Young.

563
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,435
Okay, thanks. Got it.

564
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:49,501
Get this. It turns out Lenny
Reese, his buddy Greg McCarthy

565
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:51,568
and our latest victim
Seth Sandel

566
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:54,269
were all accused
of gang-raping a girl

567
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:57,501
here in Daytona during
spring break last year,

568
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:59,391
and they all got off.

569
00:29:01,236 --> 00:29:03,574
So maybe it isn't an epidemic.

570
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:06,401
Maybe it's revenge.

571
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,535
If that is the case,
it's not over yet.

572
00:29:08,602 --> 00:29:10,935
There's a fourth suspect
accused of the same crime.

573
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,535
Rapist or not,

574
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:15,353
we better find him
before the killer does.
Yeah.

575
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,810
The victims include three male
students visiting

576
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,768
from Maryland State University.

577
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:28,035
We're reporting from Daytona
Community Hospital.

578
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:29,802
Back to you.

579
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:32,515
You walking away from me?

580
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:33,856
ha.. yes

581
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,571
Hey!

582
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:44,729
He's dead. We'll contact
his family, Dr. Hood.

583
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:49,381
Four accused rapists.

584
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,674
Lenny and Greg are dead.

585
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:54,316
And one in suspended animation--

586
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:55,732
Seth Sandel.

587
00:29:55,732 --> 00:29:57,628
What do we know
about the fourth?

588
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:00,063
His name is
Derek Kenin.

589
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:01,080
He attended

590
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,654
Maryland State with
Lenny, Greg and Seth.

591
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:06,533
Rape charges were thrown out
due to lack of evidence.

592
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:08,224
The victim was local?
That's right.

593
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,543
Julia Taylor, age 19.

594
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,927
If anyone wanted revenge
it'd be her.

595
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:15,055
Yeah, but I doubt
a 19-year-old

596
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:16,346
would have been
able to get around

597
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:19,020
the federal wall
of proprietary technology

598
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,960
or convert Chronos-X-Coli
into a biological weapon.

599
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:26,221
Maybe she had help.

600
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:36,009
So Julia Taylor still
lives at home.

601
00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:38,795
You go through that
kind of trauma,

602
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:41,267
you just look for
someplace safe.

603
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:47,161
I don't understand.
The case was closed.

604
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:49,461
We've reopened it.

605
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:51,761
Two of the four accused
are dead.

606
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:53,261
A third is very sick.

607
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,828
So you're not here
about the rape?

608
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:59,261
You're investigating
murder?

609
00:30:59,327 --> 00:31:01,960
Two murders, possibly more.

610
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,043
Wait a minute.

611
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:06,739
You think Julia
had something to do with this?

612
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,652
Mrs. Taylor--

613
00:31:07,652 --> 00:31:09,392
Unbelievable.

614
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:12,127
You're treating my daughter
as a suspect?

615
00:31:18,763 --> 00:31:21,079
Here's your suspect.

616
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:28,018
Why don't you lock her up
and throw away the key.

617
00:31:28,628 --> 00:31:32,311
I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor.
We didn't know.

618
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:36,528
The D.A. said it would just be
he said, she said.

619
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,491
She took it really hard.

620
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:40,923
Blamed herself.

621
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:44,803
It took so much
just to come forward,

622
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,118
and then to be labeled
a slut and a liar.

623
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:51,994
The doctors gave her
a prescription for
her depression,

624
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,982
but it didn't work.

625
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,370
She started
drinking instead.

626
00:31:56,963 --> 00:32:01,089
One night she drank too much
and tried to drive home.

627
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,708
Crashed into a divider
and never woke up.

628
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:07,865
So you brought her home?

629
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:10,250
This is better for her anyway.

630
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,343
To be where she's loved.

631
00:32:12,895 --> 00:32:15,027
This is all her stuff?

632
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,603
Yes.

633
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:22,895
Would you mind?

634
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,559
No.

635
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:27,466
Pure silica fiber.

636
00:32:27,466 --> 00:32:29,244
It's light enough
for flight,

637
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:33,155
but strong enough for
withstanding G-forces.

638
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:34,696
Mrs. Taylor, this is

639
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:36,795
a space shuttle tile.

640
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:39,793
Do you know anyone
who works at NASA?

641
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:41,694
My ex-husband.

642
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:42,997
It was a gift
from him--

643
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:44,728
Julia's father Henry.

644
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:46,861
Henry West?

645
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:48,261
Yes.

646
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:51,243
Excuse me.

647
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:52,498
This is Special Agent Young.

648
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:55,281
I need to locate
Dr. Henry West.

649
00:32:56,795 --> 00:32:58,037
I'm really sorry

650
00:32:58,037 --> 00:33:00,040
for any trouble we've caused.

651
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:03,927
I wish you
and your daughter well.

652
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:05,194
Thank you.

653
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:10,598
All right, keep me posted.

654
00:33:10,803 --> 00:33:12,006
West disappeared.

655
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,437
He left the lab
and hasn't gone home.

656
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:16,828
That's why he
stonewalled us.

657
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:21,561
With his daughter in a coma,
I guess it seemed appropriate.

658
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:23,252
Put the rapists
in the same state--

659
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:26,021
then administer
a flesh-eating disease

660
00:33:26,021 --> 00:33:28,027
to ravagers of the flesh.

661
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:29,914
They didn't get
it quite right.

662
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:31,224
Innocent girls are dying.

663
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:32,823
There's no justice in that.

664
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:35,404
Maybe he wasn't aware
of the potential for
sexual transmission.

665
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:37,204
Or maybe he just
didn't care.

666
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:40,365
I have the Bureau
tracking the GPS on
Derek Kenin's cell phone.

667
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:43,649
Derek's the only rape suspect
who hasn't been infected yet.

668
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,449
We find him, we find West.

669
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,445
No, I can't wait until tomorrow.

670
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:53,749
I need to go home now.

671
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:56,752
Okay, all right, what about
a different airline?

672
00:33:57,474 --> 00:33:59,378
Well, can't you
just do something?

673
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:01,957
I mean-- all right,
just listen to me.

674
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,085
Just listen to me, okay?

675
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,250
Listen to me.

676
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:05,649
No, please, don't put me
on hold.

677
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,283
Come on!

678
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:16,605
Don't move.

679
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:19,907
Stay back.
Stay back.
Dr. West...

680
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:21,174
You're too late.

681
00:35:21,241 --> 00:35:22,741
It's over.

682
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:24,775
He was
the last one.

683
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,114
Stay back!

684
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:35,102
My little girl is... gone.

685
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:40,637
My life is just a memory.

686
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,762
Everything I've done--

687
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:46,651
I'm not sorry.

688
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,450
Tell me about the fail-safe.

689
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:52,117
How does the organism
destroy itself?

690
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,617
Tell me.

691
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:55,881
Why?

692
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:01,019
So you can save
a bunch of rapists?

693
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,651
No.

694
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:04,816
No.

695
00:36:04,883 --> 00:36:06,195
No!

696
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,547
Dr.West no.

697
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:23,437
Hood.

698
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,095
I need two ambulances.

699
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:31,217
415 River Street.
Shark Cove Hotel, now.

700
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,612
You infected more
than rapists, Henry.

701
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:39,297
The infection spread
through sexual contact.

702
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,683
Those boys--

703
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,750
they infected at least
two innocent girls.

704
00:36:43,816 --> 00:36:45,943
Girls just like your
daughter Julia.

705
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:50,683
These girls, they had nothing to
do with what happened to Julia.

706
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,417
They don't deserve to suffer
any more than she did. Come on.

707
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:56,693
This can't be what you wanted.

708
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,816
What, you need a pen?

709
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:04,892
Here you go.

710
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,192
You want to write
on my hand?

711
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,551
Okay, is that an "A"?

712
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,683
"Ag."

713
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:19,683
the periodic table of elements.

714
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,384
Ag is the symbol for silver.

715
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:24,716
Is it silver?

716
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,746
It's called colloidal silver.

717
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:52,150
Until the 1930s,

718
00:37:52,217 --> 00:37:54,850
it was quite a widely
used antibiotic.

719
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:56,392
Now it's more
commonly known

720
00:37:56,392 --> 00:37:58,033
as a dietary
supplement.

721
00:37:58,033 --> 00:37:59,547
But its value here is as

722
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:03,484
a trigger for the fail-safe
gene inside the bacteria.

723
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,637
It should cause
the bacteria

724
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:07,184
to destroy itself.

725
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,917
The only thing is,

726
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:12,716
for the silver to work, um,
the blood needs to circulate.

727
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,450
So we're going to have
to wake them up.

728
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:18,050
But if we wake them up

729
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:20,551
then we wake up
the flesh-eating bacteria

730
00:38:20,617 --> 00:38:21,638
and then they they die.

731
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:23,450
Isn't that what you
told us before?

732
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:25,517
Personally I believe
it's worth the risk.

733
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:11,751
<i>Well, it's been 48 hours
and there's no sign</i>

734
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,451
<i>of the fleshating bacteria</i>

735
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,576
on any of the
victims, Dr. Hood.

736
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:17,006
Thanks for everything.

737
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:18,849
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

738
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,262
Oh, I understand.

739
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:22,528
What I was suggesting did
sound a little crazy.

740
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:24,742
I'm just glad your
daughter's okay.

741
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:26,055
Will you excuse me?

742
00:39:26,055 --> 00:39:27,907
There's something I have to do.

743
00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:29,442
Thanks again.

744
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:33,479
PALO ALTO,CALIFORNIA

745
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,728
Come on, Tanner.

746
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:40,034
Hey, buddy.

747
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:48,706
Anna?

748
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:51,671
Yeah, it's Jacob.

749
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:56,932
Oh, uh, I was thinking, um...

750
00:39:58,233 --> 00:40:00,296
I, uh...

751
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:04,869
I really enjoy
our conversations

752
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:10,362
and, um, I kind of regret
the-the way the last one ended.

753
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,172
Me, too.

754
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:18,664
Want to try again?

755
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,248
Great.

756
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:26,640
Well, how about this,

757
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,629
um, I'm going to be passing
through Stanford

758
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:32,157
sometime soon.

759
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:37,484
Sure, if you got the time.

760
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,248
You know, I'd like that, too.

761
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:42,581
Yeah, I got to go.

762
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:44,470
Yeah, no, I got to go. Bye.

763
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,152
Professor Yang?

764
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:49,135
Yeah.

765
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,026
Good for you.

766
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:55,052
I think so.

767
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:58,859
