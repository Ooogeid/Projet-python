1
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,450
Whoa.

2
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,830
I take it you're the
ice man from the FBI.

3
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,050
Ice man?

4
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,220
Hmm.

5
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,480
That's a little harsh.

6
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,370
Actually, I'm the
science man from the FBI.

7
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,920
I'm Special Agent Rachel Young.

8
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,160
I'm assigned to Dr. Hood.

9
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,840
Well, I'm Detective Cordero, LAPD.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,620
This is Dr. Nash from
the coroner's office.

11
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,210
Hi.

12
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,840
Dr. Nash. How are you doing?

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,580
This was our case

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,840
till the feds showed up,

15
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,040
told us to wait for you.

16
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,190
Why is the FBI so interested?

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
Uh, you should, uh, put on a mask.

18
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,570
No.

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,720
- I don't think so. 
- Funny, I wouldn't

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,620
have pegged you as the
"live dangerously" type.

21
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,070
There's nothing dangerous about it.

22
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,400
An airborne pathogen couldn't

23
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,440
have frozen her like this.

24
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,760
- Why not? 
- It's thermodynamically impossible.

25
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,290
Uh, airborne molecules...

26
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,490
they're too small.

27
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,700
They don't have anything close

28
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,660
to the heat capacity

29
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,340
to cause this kind of
damage to a human being.

30
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,140
Well, then, what did?

31
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,500
I mean, there are no wounds,

32
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,540
no puncture marks on
the body,no bruising,

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,510
lesions, injection marks.

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,340
No indication of physical
trauma whatsoever.

35
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,250
Who was she, Detective?

36
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,980
Marlena Gower.

37
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,120
Marketing student at Malibu State.

38
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,650
She spent most of last night

39
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,650
at a house about 100 yards from here.

40
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,110
Left near dawn.

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,690
Was a big party.

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,800
A few noise complaints
from the neighbors,

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,660
but no reports of screams
or signs of a struggle.

44
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,290
39 degrees Fahrenheit.

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,540
Seven degrees above freezing.

46
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,530
Her body shows no signs
of sub-thermal exposure.

47
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,300
And it appears like she's
not warming up, either.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,050
Detective, can you tell me

49
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,180
how a seemingly
healthy college student

50
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,900
in the prime of life
freezes to death on the beach

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,390
on one of the hottest
days of the year?

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,190
No.

53
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,470
Doctor?

54
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:22,640
No.

55
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,320
Neither can I.

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,440
Which is why the FBI is interested.

57
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,360
Anything unusual on Marlena's body,

58
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,460
maybe in her purse?

59
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,980
We found a near-empty
bottle of champagne...

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,930
pricey stuff...

61
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,960
a bottle of prescription
tranquilizers

62
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,280
and some odd text
messages on her cell.

63
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,850
Odd in what way? Well, they

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,170
were pretty cryptic, asking her

65
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,780
if she had reconsidered something.

66
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,360
Have you traced them?

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,570
To a prepaid cell.

68
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,250
We're trying to track
it down right now.

69
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,510
She wrote back some
pretty nasty responses,

70
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,640
so whatever it was
about, she didn't like it.

71
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,850
And you checked her cell record?

72
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,160
There were three other

73
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,550
"Have you reconsidered?"
text messages.

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,060
First one came in five days ago.

75
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,470
Could be connected to the death.

76
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,440
I asked Dr. Nash to
run a metabolic panel,

77
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,410
also to check the stomach contents,

78
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,660
see if there was anything unusual

79
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,930
in that champagne she had.

80
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,150
Please call us with the results.

81
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,140
Will do.

82
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:30,890
Thank you.

83
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,230
Also, we should check out

84
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,380
the house she visited last night,

85
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,920
see if there's anything there
to give us a clue as to how

86
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,800
she ended up like this.

87
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:37,720
Or why.

88
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,910
Yeah,she was here.

89
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,400
Too bad... she was a real hottie.

90
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,070
Came with a bunch of
coeds from Malibu State.

91
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,610
Real party girls, if
you know what I mean.

92
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,830
And I'm sure they were
all over 18, right?

93
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,460
All my parties are legal.

94
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:03,950
Hey.

95
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,270
Hey!

96
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,920
What are you doing, man?

97
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,390
Just checking out your AC unit here.

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,740
Yeah, well, it's up to
code and state of the art.

99
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,550
You use it very often?

100
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Now and then... doesn't get

101
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,490
over 90 in Malibu that often.

102
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,230
It did yesterday.

103
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,640
Yeah, well, I had it on for
a few hours in the afternoon.

104
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,040
Turned it off as soon
as the sun went down.

105
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,380
Okay, thank you very much.

106
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,540
Someone slipped our
victim a Freon Mickey?

107
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,450
They don't use Freon in
air conditioners anymore.

108
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,850
Damages the ozone layer.

109
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,060
Any sign of tampering on the unit?

110
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,040
No.

111
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,240
So we can rule out
death by air conditioner.

112
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,920
She was taking

113
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:47,370
prescription medication.

114
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
Maybe we should go
talk to her doctor.

115
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,530
She was taking

116
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,600
benzodiazepine for anxiety.

117
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,480
Understandable, of course.

118
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,400
Why, was she having trouble
at school or with a boyfriend?

119
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,890
She had bigger problems.

120
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,360
- I assumed you knew. 
- Knew what?

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,170
She was diagnosed last month
with severe aplastic anemia.

122
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,430
Unfortunately, we couldn't find it

123
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,300
in time to begin effective treatment.

124
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,690
She was terminal?

125
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,490
I'm afraid so.

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
Could the illness have contributed

127
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,400
to her freezing to death?

128
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,600
It's a very rare

129
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,400
blood disease with a
lot of horrible symptoms,

130
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,640
but fatal hypothermia
isn't one of them.

131
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,350
It's amazing.

132
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,150
You can actually see
the heart beating.

133
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,530
And now we know what
color to paint the nursery.

134
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,120
I've always loved the color blue.

135
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,970
We'll name him after you.

136
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,530
I just wish I could give
him more than a name.

137
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,040
Maybe you can.

138
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,580
Honey, I made that appointment
for us at the Foundation.

139
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,720
I think you should
at least consider it.

140
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,170
We still have some
time left before...

141
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,340
It's, uh, been over 24 hours

142
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,580
and the extremities are
finally starting to thaw.

143
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,490
Her body is just a,uh,few
degrees below ambient.

144
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,280
Autolysis has begun.

145
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,100
The body has started
to digest itself.

146
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,040
It's always such a...

147
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,630
brutally efficient process to watch.

148
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,600
Yeah.

149
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,780
Life is a miracle, but, uh,

150
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,990
death, in its own terrible way,

151
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,210
is no less beautiful.

152
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,090
She was only 21.

153
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:49,590
Oh.

154
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,400
Well,her death is
tragic, no question,

155
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,570
but, uh...

156
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,220
I did this autopsy
on a guy last month

157
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,520
who had been hooked up
to a heart-lung machine

158
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,000
for, uh, 12 years because his family

159
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,240
just couldn't accept the
fact that he was brain-dead.

160
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,550
The way our culture tries

161
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,330
to deny death, uh, hide from it...

162
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,970
I just think that's tragic, too.

163
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,000
You got a tissue sample?

164
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,110
Yeah,I got a liver section

165
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:17,690
right over here.

166
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,120
Thank you.

167
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,000
No frostbite.

168
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:39,990
But that's impossible.

169
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,620
I mean, she was frozen, wasn't she?

170
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,540
Well, that's

171
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,700
the interesting thing.

172
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,570
She was frozen, but...

173
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,950
but not with ice crystals.

174
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,830
Were there any chemical compounds

175
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,670
in the blood work
you couldn't identify?

176
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,010
Well, the tox panel was clean.

177
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,500
There were a few lines in, uh,

178
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,490
the spectral analysis
that I didn't recognize,

179
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,960
but of course, that in
itself isn't unusual.

180
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,690
Well,I'm gonna need at
least 100cc's of her blood,

181
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,340
tissue samples from her major organs,

182
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,590
and a real lab.

183
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,350
Rachel, can you find me one?

184
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,520
Oh, yeah, not bad.

185
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,860
Not bad at all.

186
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,490
Can I help you?

187
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,130
Yeah, I'd like to borrow
your facility, please.

188
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,470
I beg your pardon?

189
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,560
Uh, Dr. Hood and I
are here to discover

190
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,000
exactly what killed Marlena Gower,

191
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,640
a 21-year-old student from
your school, and to ascertain

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,270
whether or not it poses a
risk to national security.

193
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,600
Now, I can't legally
compel your cooperation

194
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,680
or the use of your
lab, so I'm asking you

195
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,760
to compel yourself

196
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,020
to do the right thing.

197
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,450
I have good days

198
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,270
and bad days.

199
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,970
I'm set to start chemo
treatments next week.

200
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,230
I'm doing everything
that the doctors tell me.

201
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,690
I'm glad to hear you're
following their advice.

202
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,710
We at the Forever
Forward Foundation want

203
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,850
to see you live a long
and productive life.

204
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,660
Look, I know that
time isn't on my side,

205
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,980
but I don't intend to go out
a moment before I have to.

206
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,110
We just found out it's gonna

207
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,150
be a boy.

208
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,670
I may not be around when he's born...

209
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,910
...but maybe, with your help,

210
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,000
when he's grown up,

211
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,300
I could be back and
spend some time with him,

212
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,980
Talk to him.

213
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,890
That would certainly
be our hope as well.

214
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,270
But...

215
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,410
I have an ethical obligation

216
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,080
to be crystal-clear on
this point with both of you.

217
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,540
We can't make any guarantees.

218
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,030
It could be decades

219
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,190
before a cure is found
for your illness,Edward,

220
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,550
even longer before the technology

221
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,890
is available to successfully

222
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:54,880
revive you.

223
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,950
Maybe you'll be able to meet our son

224
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,800
and our grandson.

225
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,960
Now, I'm using

226
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,520
a fluorite substrate
instead of glass.

227
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:15,830
Why?

228
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,170
Glass blocks infrared.

229
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,240
Very good.

230
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,860
And we need infrared data

231
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,670
to get a complete organic profile.

232
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,930
And fluorite is
transparent to infrared.

233
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,860
You care to assist?

234
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,490
Sure.

235
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,140
Run this sample, please.

236
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,210
- Mm-hmm. 
-Thank you.

237
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,890
Is that an ice pack?

238
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,920
Did you hurt yourself?
You got a spare one

239
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,910
of those I could borrow
for a second,please?

240
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,750
Mmm. Sure. Here you go.

241
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:43,750
Thank you.

242
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,070
This is an example of
an endothermic reaction.

243
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:48,620
Squeeze it;

244
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,330
water mixes with
the ammonium nitrite;

245
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,960
it gets colder than ice.

246
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:52,950
Exactly.

247
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,230
I have a lot of
experience with ice packs.

248
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,820
See, most reactions,

249
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,760
they release heat.

250
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,870
An endothermic reactions
does the opposite.

251
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,690
It absorbs it.

252
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,500
Thanks, Dr. Hood.

253
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,840
Bye now.

254
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:09,770
See you around.

255
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,900
So, you think Marlena Gower

256
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,240
was dosed with ammonium nitrite?

257
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,550
No, because it would've
left behind ice crystals.

258
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,490
But it's something similar.

259
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,400
It's a pair of compounds

260
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,890
that absorb heat when they react.

261
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,920
Just got to work out which compounds.

262
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,500
So, who would have a reason
to create something like this?

263
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,260
Well, sometimes
people need to ship,um,

264
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,000
transplant organs from
one state to another.

265
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,510
Refrigeration's a way of keeping
them viable, but if ice crystals

266
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,660
form inside the cells, it
can cause a lot of damage.

267
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,940
If you could find a
way of preserving organs

268
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,170
without freezing them, you
could save a lot of lives.

269
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,460
Or take them.

270
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,110
Or take them.

271
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,960
Where's Mr. Science?

272
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,480
He's at the lab.

273
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,760
You two,um,strictly business,right?

274
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,980
- Of course. Why? 
- Oh, just checking.

275
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,210
Tell you the truth,

276
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,110
I wouldn't mind brushing
up on my biology with him.

277
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
Janitor found him
about a half hour ago.

278
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,820
Name's John Robbins.

279
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,400
Big-time entertainment lawyer.

280
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,700
Coroner's on the way.

281
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,680
Unnaturally low body temperature.

282
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
No apparent signs of trauma.

283
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,480
Same text message.

284
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,880
Little less

285
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,330
cold and stiff than the other victim.

286
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,350
But just as dead.

287
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,600
We'll take excellent care of you,

288
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,050
Mr. Grekowski,

289
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,230
when the time comes.

290
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,890
My wife convinced me.

291
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,620
If there's even a
one-in-a-million chance

292
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,570
I could see my son
someday, I'm gonna take it.

293
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,040
I'll, uh,

294
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,080
I'll bring you the check tonight.

295
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,320
I think you've made
the right decision

296
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,880
for yourself, and for your family.

297
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:12,870
Thank you.

298
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,940
The trunk is still somewhat rigid,

299
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,360
but the rest of him is...

300
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,710
nearly back to room temperature.

301
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,740
And still no puncture wounds.

302
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,270
It took Marlena Gower
close to a day to thaw out.

303
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,280
This man's been dead for
less than eight hours.

304
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,660
If this is due to
a chemical reaction,

305
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,860
the hormonal differences

306
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,040
between men and women
could affect its rate.

307
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,910
He's also older than
the previous victim.

308
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,870
He was getting the same
text messages she was,

309
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,820
asking if he'd "reconsidered,"
but with no indication

310
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,150
- of what he was supposed to reconsider. 
- The text message

311
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,280
on the second victim's
phone gave us probable cause

312
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,150
to geo-locate the caller's location,

313
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,620
but so far nothing.

314
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,980
Whoever made those calls
knows their telecom tradecraft.

315
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,270
What does that mean?

316
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,390
It means they
compartmentalized the device.

317
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,290
Never use it for
anything but those calls.

318
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,480
And probably remove
the SIM card and battery

319
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,190
when they're done sending the text.

320
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,570
These spectrographs from
our victim's blood samples

321
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,530
represent half a dozen
different compounds.

322
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,380
We've got to identify

323
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,330
the one that caused
her to freeze to death.

324
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,540
So, we have to work backwards, right?

325
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,040
Figure out the set of
all possible reactions

326
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,020
that could make them.

327
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,490
Yeah, but there's literally hundreds

328
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:27,880
of possibilities.

329
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,200
Just got the final autopsy report

330
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,880
for our latest victim John Robbins.

331
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,320
He was terminal, too.

332
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,780
Hemochromatosis.

333
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,380
That's a fatally high
level of iron in the blood.

334
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,900
The answer is here.

335
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:43,830
I just...

336
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,190
I just can't see it.

337
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,890
You'll figure it out, sir.

338
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,530
You're brilliant.

339
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,790
Thanks for the vote of confidence,

340
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,270
Janet, but I keep telling you...

341
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,790
please stop calling me "sir."

342
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,590
It's Jacob.

343
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,150
Okay, well, we know
what the reaction makes,

344
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,760
but we don't know what
makes the reaction.

345
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,380
Maybe I'm thinking
of this the wrong way.

346
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:16,790
I'm assuming that...

347
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,460
...these two or three
different compounds

348
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,960
were going together
to make the reaction.

349
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,890
That's how chemistry usually happens.

350
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:30,620
Yeah.

351
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,030
But what if...

352
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,270
the fragments we've identified

353
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,030
are all

354
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,000
part of the same molecule?

355
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,080
But how would that work?

356
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,140
What would it react with?

357
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:43,900
With itself.

358
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,370
It's like the Ouroboros
from the Egyptian methodology

359
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,040
the snake that swallows its own tail.

360
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,320
Eventually, it consumes itself.

361
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,420
But if this is a
self-reacting molecule,

362
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,280
there would still have to
be some kind of catalyst

363
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,760
to get the reaction started.

364
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,190
Potassium?

365
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,990
It's a catalyst in lots
of organic reactions

366
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,480
and there's plenty of it in
human cells in mineral form.

367
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,950
There's only one way to be sure.

368
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,490
We have to synthesize the molecule.

369
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,070
Rachel, you hungry?

370
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,680
Not particularly.

371
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,030
I need a hamburger.

372
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:16,980
Okay.

373
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,150
I'll see what I can
find at the cafeteria.

374
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,700
How do you want it?

375
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:22,900
Raw.

376
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,180
One raw hamburger.

377
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,700
So that's our killer, huh?

378
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,370
Well, if we're lucky,

379
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,010
and my organic chemistry
isn't too rusty.

380
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,560
Here's a perfectly raw hamburger.

381
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,320
Now watch.

382
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,720
This'll just take a... a few moments

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,180
for the potassium in the meat

384
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,520
to trigger the process.

385
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,670
Do you want me to go back to
the cafeteria for some fries?

386
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,450
Where's your team spirit?

387
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,640
Have a some patience, please.

388
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,350
It's 39 degrees.

389
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,480
Same temperature as the first victim.

390
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:08,990
Frozen solid.

391
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,240
But what about John Robbins?

392
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,140
If the same compound killed
him, why didn't he end up frozen?

393
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,660
His terminal hemochromatosis...
too much iron in the blood.

394
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,610
Iron reverses the process.

395
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,370
Janet, could you get the
iron sulfate for me, please?

396
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,080
Watch this.

397
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,680
You see, Robbins had just
enough iron in his blood

398
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,330
to prevent the process
from completing.

399
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,980
But not enough to keep him alive.

400
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,770
Unfortunately for him, no.

401
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,510
And now we're back
to normal temperature.

402
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,870
Okay, you said the
chemical would be developed

403
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,540
to preserve organs
for transplant, right?

404
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,990
Absolutely. To that market,

405
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,550
it's gonna be worth
its weight in gold.

406
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,860
So, it would definitely
be worth patenting.

407
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,020
Janet, there's no
Internet on this computer.

408
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,620
Is there a T3 connection
anywhere in the building?

409
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,340
Our professor's computer.

410
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,350
Or if you'd like

411
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,430
a little privacy, I have
WiFi in my dorm room.

412
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,650
No. Your professor's
computer will be fine.

413
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,710
Application No.8293024

414
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,590
An endothermic chemical process

415
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,240
for the purpose of
tissue preservation.

416
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,390
It's the same as the
molecule we just synthesized.

417
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,610
The patent was filed by...

418
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,660
Adastra Pharmaceuticals.

419
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,630
Biomedical firm in El Segundo.

420
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,590
Now we know where the
murder weapon came from.

421
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,400
Agent Young, Dr. Hood,
I hope this is important.

422
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,560
You pulled me out of
a stockholders meeting.

423
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,760
I need to get back
as soon as possible.

424
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,460
Oh, I'm very sorry, Dr. Ramesh.

425
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,860
Were you telling your stockholders

426
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,130
about Trimethyl-cryazine?

427
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,230
Cryazine is still in development,

428
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,500
not nearly ready to
bring to the public.

429
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,130
What's your interest in it?

430
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,630
My interest is, I, uh,
synthesized it in a lab.

431
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,360
And we believe it's being
used to murder people.

432
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,460
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

433
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,030
Cryazine is manufactured
to preserve organs.

434
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,600
At this stage, the
FDA has only approved

435
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,760
of limited clinical trials
on kidneys and livers.

436
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,930
Who's conducting
your clinical trials?

437
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,460
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say.

438
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,960
You know, two people
have already died

439
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,130
because of your research.

440
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,300
I hardly believe

441
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,600
anyone associated

442
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,300
with this company is responsible.

443
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,660
Anyone familiar with the
chemical is a possible suspect,

444
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,860
including you, Doctor.

445
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,500
If Cryazine

446
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,360
is successful, it could
save thousands of lives.

447
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,960
An investigation could
compromise our research,

448
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,630
scare off our investors.

449
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,830
Well, we wouldn't want
anyone getting cold feet.

450
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,330
We're simply asking

451
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,500
for your cooperation.

452
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,900
Tell us who your partner is

453
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,700
on the clinical side,and
we'll be discreet.

454
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,030
And

455
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm sure your stockholders

456
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,230
will be relieved when you
go back to your meeting

457
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,100
and tell them you avoided
a federal subpoena.

458
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,660
The Forever Forward Foundation.

459
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,230
Here at the Forever
Forward Foundation,

460
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,330
the idea of immortality

461
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,530
is no longer a fantasy.

462
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,360
Dr. Gregory, there's
someone to see you...

463
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,930
from the FBI.

464
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,900
At 320 degrees below zero,

465
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,930
liquid nitrogen can
preserve them indefinitely.

466
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,560
A doctor is always present
to certify time of death.

467
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,100
It's best that our clients
spend their last moments here,

468
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,130
so we can begin the process
as quickly as possible.

469
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,400
So how many floating
heads do you have here?

470
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,360
We prefer the term
de-animated neural suspension.

471
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,800
Each cylinder contains four clients.

472
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,360
There are ten cylinders in
this storage unit and five

473
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,460
more units just like this one.

474
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,100
You do the math.

475
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,830
You promise these people that someday

476
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,000
when there is a cure for cancer
or whatever else killed them,

477
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,560
you'll just thaw them out?

478
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,400
It was good enough for Walt Disney.

479
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,630
And then what?

480
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,330
You put their heads on wheels?

481
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,630
In the future,

482
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,800
it will be possible

483
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,030
to clone yourself a
young and healthy body.

484
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,500
Why bother preserving the old one?

485
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,460
Plus,it's cheaper to just
freeze the heads, right?

486
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,700
Do you know a Marlena Gower,

487
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,800
or a John Robbins?

488
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,760
They have contracts with us.

489
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,500
What do those contracts run, exactly?

490
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,160
$80,000.

491
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,860
Our service isn't cheap.

492
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,160
But they both have money.

493
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,660
Robbins is a successful lawyer,

494
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,830
and I believe, Ms.
Gower has a trust fund.

495
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,530
Do you know they're dead?

496
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,330
When? How?

497
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,000
A couple of days ago.

498
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,000
Well, they have to be
brought here immediately.

499
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,560
The longer we wait,

500
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,260
the lower their chances
are for reanimation.

501
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,700
Are you aware of a substance
called Trimethyl-cryazine?

502
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,400
How do you know about it?

503
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,500
It killed them both.
Do you use it here?

504
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,860
For clinical trials only.

505
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,000
We encourage our neural
suspension clients

506
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,830
to donate all of their
harvestable organs for research.

507
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,500
If Cryazine proves effective,

508
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,830
it could be a huge step forward.

509
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,160
See, our biggest challenge
is preventing cellular damage

510
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,930
caused by freezing brain tissue.

511
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,660
Do you have the
chemical on the premises?

512
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,930
Oh, yes.

513
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,700
There are only...

514
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,730
nine bottles.

515
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,560
There should be,

516
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,530
uh... 15.

517
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,730
Who else has access to this cabinet?

518
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,030
Our lead researcher, uh,

519
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,600
two technicians,

520
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,430
uh, security guards.

521
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,660
We'll need all their names so
we can run a background check.

522
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,560
I'll also need to see
a list of your clients.

523
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,900
Just the ones who aren't dead. Yet.

524
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,460
So, you do have a contract

525
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,600
with the Forever
Forward Foundation for...

526
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,960
de-animated neural suspension?

527
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,260
Actually, I'm calling to see

528
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,000
if you've received a
threat of any kind recently,

529
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,560
possibly a text message

530
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,160
from an unknown sender
asking you to reconsider?

531
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,000
Okay.

532
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,730
Well, if you do
receive such a message,

533
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,460
please contact us immediately.

534
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,830
Thank you.

535
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,330
Still waiting

536
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,960
to hear back from
a couple of clients,

537
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,900
but no one else got an unusual text.

538
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,160
Not yet.

539
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,160
Rachel Young here.

540
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,030
Something came up on
one of the employees

541
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,430
at the frozen head shop.

542
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,600
Security guard named Joey Lux.

543
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,360
He used to be a cop.

544
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,700
Retired?

545
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,060
He was forced to resign.

546
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,400
One too many police
brutality complaints

547
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,930
and a corruption
charge to go with it.

548
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,230
Sounds like a real
upstanding citizen.

549
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,030
I have a search warrant, and I'm

550
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,930
texting you his address.
I'll see you there.

551
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,330
Okay.

552
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,560
That was Cordero
with a possible lead.

553
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,860
We could use one.

554
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,930
By the way, she likes you.

555
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
What?

556
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,000
Police! Open up!

557
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,430
Police! Open up!

558
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,960
Don't move! LAPD!

559
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,730
What the hell?!

560
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,960
We have a few questions
to ask you, Mr. Lux.

561
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,000
You worked security at the Foundation

562
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,860
when they started testing a
new tissue-preserving chemical.

563
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,400
So?

564
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,630
So, several bottles of
the chemical are missing.

565
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Stolen.

566
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,900
And two people are
dead because of it.

567
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,400
- Who's next, Joey? 
- I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

568
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,130
We're talking about
the fact that you're one

569
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,330
of the few people who had
access to the chemical.

570
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,630
And a couple of your
coworkers saw you

571
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,630
snooping around the room
where the chemical is kept

572
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,960
after your shift had ended.

573
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,560
And you think that makes me a killer?

574
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,660
Well, standards for promotion

575
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,330
to detective have seriously
dropped since I left the force.

576
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,760
We canvassed the neighborhoods

577
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,600
where the two victims were killed.

578
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,860
We found a syringe with
traces of the compound in it

579
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,860
and your fingerprint.

580
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,700
You care to explain that?

581
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,000
Hey, kiss my ass, Detective.

582
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,460
I was a cop, remember?

583
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:20,530
If you'd found a syringe
with my prints on it,

584
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,400
we wouldn't be talking.

585
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,960
Are we done?

586
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,560
We're done.

587
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,330
For now.

588
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,860
But don't leave town.

589
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,160
Rachel?

590
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,100
What?

591
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,460
Not a syringe.

592
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,200
A gun.

593
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,860
I don't follow.

594
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,060
Detective Cordero just
tried to trick him into

595
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,800
confessing by suggesting
that we had found a syringe.

596
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,700
Well, there are no

597
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,900
puncture marks on any
of the victims' bodies.

598
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,160
No bullet holes, either.

599
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,000
I don't mean that kind of gun.

600
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,560
Jet injector gun.

601
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,260
Uses a powerful jet of
liquid instead of a needle

602
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,600
to penetrate the skin.

603
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,830
No puncture marks.

604
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,760
We need to subpoena

605
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,730
all medical suppliers
of jet injector guns

606
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,460
and get names of any
individuals or companies

607
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,760
in Southern California

608
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,660
who've made purchases
in the last 12 months.

609
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,660
What is it?

610
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,600
Uh... uh, it's nothing.

611
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,960
I just keep getting

612
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,160
the same junk mail text message.

613
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,700
Uh, it's so annoying.

614
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,200
Do you think there's really a chance

615
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,730
the people in those cylinders...

616
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,930
those heads...

617
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,160
can ever be revived?

618
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,230
Well, the science is debatable

619
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,330
and the ethics are
questionable, but sure,

620
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,100
there's a chance.

621
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Just as there's a chance a snowstorm

622
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,630
could bury the East Coast
on the Fourth of July.

623
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,900
I'm serious.

624
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,130
So am I.

625
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,460
It happened.

626
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,330
1816.

627
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,960
It was a combination

628
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,100
of low-magnetic
activity from the sun,

629
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,330
ash clouds and sulfur aerosols

630
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,100
from a volcanic
eruption the year before,

631
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,000
but it... it created a...
a summer of snow and rain

632
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,600
across the entire
Northern Hemisphere.

633
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,730
So, if there is a chance,

634
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,900
it's probably worth
taking it... I mean,

635
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,660
considering the alternative.

636
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,130
Sooner or later,
Rachel... everyone dies.

637
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,000
I mean, you can fight it.

638
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,930
My wife did.

639
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,760
But in the end, um...

640
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,600
in the end, I think it's how
you face your death that counts.

641
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,160
I don't know about you,

642
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,660
but I wouldn't like to face mine

643
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,600
as a frozen head on a Popsicle stick.

644
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,600
Cordero.

645
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,860
This is Rachel.

646
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,830
We'll be right there.

647
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,300
That ex-cop, Lux...

648
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,100
they just found him
dead in his apartment.

649
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,130
Nothing says guilty

650
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,030
like killing yourself
with the murder weapon.

651
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,060
I'm not so sure.

652
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,860
Drinking this compound's
not a very efficient way

653
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,560
of absorbing it into the bloodstream.

654
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,360
The stomach acids would break it down

655
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,030
before it had a chance to
reach the rest of the body.

656
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,160
One thing we do know for sure.

657
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,760
Our prime suspect just
became our latest victim.

658
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,260
Anything good?

659
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,430
Jet injectors were ordered

660
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,230
by Camp Pendleton near San Diego

661
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,000
and a diabetes research
institute in Pasadena.

662
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,830
All of them are accounted for.

663
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,160
Another dead end.

664
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,360
Hang on a second.

665
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,130
I also got a subpoena

666
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,660
for all PayPal transactions
involving online purchases

667
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,430
of surplus jet injectors

668
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,260
- over the past six months. 
- And?

669
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,530
One was shipped to a Malibu
PO box less than a month ago.

670
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,960
The user name on the PayPal account

671
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,760
is... Glacialis?

672
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,360
Glacialis.

673
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,600
That's Latin for "frozen."

674
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,000
What's the name on the account?

675
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,930
Eddie?

676
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,660
No, Mrs. Grekowski.

677
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,900
Yes?

678
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,200
This is special agent Rachel Young.

679
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,330
I'm from the FBI.

680
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,130
I'm trying to find your husband.

681
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,060
I've been calling his cell phone,

682
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,230
but he doesn't pick up.

683
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,500
Is something wrong?

684
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,200
He signed a contract

685
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,960
with the Forever Forward
Foundation yesterday.

686
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,260
I'm afraid he might be in danger.

687
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,260
And I'm wondering if he's gotten

688
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,060
any odd text messages recently?

689
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,130
No, just junk mail, but nothing.

690
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,560
He's at the Foundation right
now dropping off a check.

691
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,600
Dr. Nash.

692
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,500
What is this?

693
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,000
FBI, Mr. Grekowski.

694
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,300
What are you doing here?

695
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,330
We could ask you

696
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,430
the same question,

697
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,100
but we already know the answer.

698
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,630
I'm here to certify a
death. That's my job.

699
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,160
"The way our culture tries
to deny death is tragic."

700
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,460
Isn't that what you told us

701
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,630
at the morgue?

702
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,200
I'd be happy to have this discussion

703
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,200
some other time, but right
now I have work to do.

704
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,930
Whoa, whoa, what the
hell is going on here?

705
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,960
Dr. Nash is the one who sent you
those threatening text messages.

706
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,760
I don't understand.

707
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,030
There's nothing to understand.

708
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,860
This is crazy.

709
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,530
Cryonics attacks your whole
belief system, doesn't it?

710
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,000
Your world view.

711
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,330
I just respect death.

712
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,860
I think everybody should.

713
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,960
Well, that respect is
what's kept you going,

714
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,500
helped you cope with your job

715
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,230
day in, day out.

716
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,330
Year after year.

717
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,830
Corpse after corpse.

718
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,730
You know how much money people
like Grekowski here waste

719
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,030
trying to cheat
death, what that money

720
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,500
could be used for?

721
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,830
A billion children go to bed

722
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,160
on this planet every night hungry

723
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,260
while hundreds of millions of dollars

724
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,500
are thrown away

725
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,500
on ridiculous dreams of immortality.

726
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,260
Joey Lux stole the chemical

727
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,830
for you and provided
information on clients.

728
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,060
You killed him to
keep him from talking

729
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,000
and tried to make
it look like suicide.

730
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,730
And you came here to kill
Mr. Grekowski on the premises.

731
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,700
A customer frozen to death

732
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,600
at a cryonics lab?

733
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,260
Well, that's big news.

734
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,800
Could certainly close down
this facility for good,

735
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,700
maybe bring the whole
field into disrepute.

736
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,860
You're both crazy.

737
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,560
You don't have proof of any of this.

738
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,800
Well,we know

739
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,200
that you took delivery
of a jet injector gun,

740
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,660
the type used to administer cryazine

741
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,030
without leaving any marks.

742
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,430
The LAPD's on their way.

743
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,230
I wonder what they'll find

744
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,930
when they search your place.

745
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,030
More missing bottles
of cryazine, maybe?

746
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,030
Don't move!

747
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,530
You move...

748
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,300
He dies.

749
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,660
They were all gonna die anyway.

750
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,960
Let's go.

751
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,300
Stay here.

752
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,800
Drop it, Nash.

753
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,900
It's over,

754
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,000
Doctor.

755
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,500
Let him go.

756
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,260
Step back!

757
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,530
Everybody...

758
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,260
Move away.

759
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,160
I mean it!

760
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,360
I will kill him.

761
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,630
Don't do it, Nash.

762
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,760
One more step.

763
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,130
It's over, Lucas.

764
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,160
Everybody back away.

765
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,060
I'm serious.

766
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,630
Come any closer, he dies.

767
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,630
Please...

768
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,830
I just want to see my son.

769
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,160
Nash, listen to him.

770
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,660
Oh, no.

771
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,130
Rachel,

772
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,330
this man needs an iron infusion now!

773
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,860
This is Special Agent Rachel Young.

774
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,030
I need an ambulance at
Forever Forward Foundation.

775
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,730
Third and Rosemead.

776
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,560
Temp is 95.7 and falling.

777
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,900
Come on, Mr. Grekowski.

778
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,400
- Stay with me. 
- Is he gonna make it?

779
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,960
If we keep his temperature

780
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,600
above 86 degrees,
he may have a chance.

781
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,930
Temp is 95.2. He needs more iron.

782
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,100
Eddie, you hear me?

783
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,700
I need you to stay
awake for me, Eddie.

784
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,360
I need you to stay awake.

785
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,600
We're almost at the hospital.

786
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,200
Now, please, keep your eyes open.

787
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,860
Can you see me?

788
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,560
Now, I want you to think
about your little boy.

789
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,360
I want you to think about your son.

790
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,230
Think about how much
you want to see your son.

791
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,160
Keep your eyes open. Can you see me?

792
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,600
Stay awake. We're almost

793
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,230
at the hospital.

794
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,400
He's right over there.

795
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,900
- Oh, hi. 
- Hi.

796
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,360
I'm Emily Grekowski.

797
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,230
Yes, of course, please sit down.

798
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,300
Oh, no, thank you.

799
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,960
I just wanted to let you know

800
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,100
that the doctors say my
husband's going to be fine.

801
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,600
For now.

802
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,260
Thanks to you.

803
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,530
Uh,

804
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,230
but I don't even know your names.

805
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,430
Oh, I'm Jacob Hood.

806
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,460
This is Rachel Young.

807
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,860
Hi.

808
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,460
- Hi. 
- Mrs. Grekowski,

809
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,600
a friend of mine works

810
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,260
for Memorial Sloan Kettering

811
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,500
in, uh, Manhattan.

812
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,900
He's part of a team

813
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,760
working on a new treatment
for your husband's illness.

814
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,300
Last I heard they were getting

815
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,260
some positive results.

816
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,930
No worry.

817
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,160
He's expecting your call.

818
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,500
We were going to name
him Edward, but...

819
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,300
I kind of like the sound of Jacob.

820
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,160
Thank you.

821
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,100
No, you should, uh,

822
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,100
you should call him, uh,
Edward. It's a cool name.

823
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,930
Thank you so much.

824
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,460
What?

825
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,360
Pregnant women, they...

826
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,630
they get really emotional.

827
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,830
Actually, it's more
to do with the buildup

828
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,830
of oxytocin hormones in the bodies.

829
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Of course.

830
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,760
So, you said

831
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,830
the ethics of cryonics is debatable,

832
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,530
and it's probably crazy

833
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,500
to have your head

834
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,830
lopped off and
preserved for future use.

835
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Does that

836
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,260
mean you agree with Nash?

837
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,500
You think cryonics should be stopped?

838
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,500
Oh, on the contrary.

839
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,660
When, uh, immortality is outlawed

840
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,830
only outlaws will be immortal.
