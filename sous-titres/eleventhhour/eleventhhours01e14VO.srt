1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,300
???

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,400
It looks like we have some
breaking news out of Highway 894.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,300
Terry Gillman, our traffic reporter,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,500
joins us live with the latest. Terry?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,400
Hello in the studio.
Are you guys getting this?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,800
This guy's hauling through traffic,

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,500
heading southbound on the 894,
doing at least 100.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,200
The real problem is he's driving on
the northbound side of the highway.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,800
Well, Terry, we can see that a
police copter is in hot pursuit,

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
but are there any ground
units pursuing this guy?

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,400
No. Ground units broke off

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,800
when the suspect decided to use
a freeway exit as a freeway onramp.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,700
This guy is crazy.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
Whoa! Oh, my God!
Did you guys just see that?!

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Oh, man. Oh, let's, uh...

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,800
hope, uh, uh, whoever
is-is in in the, uh...

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,700
is-is in the other...
other car lives-lives to, um... Oh...

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,400
There's something wrong with him.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,000
TV News Helicopter, this is
Milwaukee Police Air Control.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are dropped into restricted airspace.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,800
Request you immediately climb
to 10,000 feet and hold.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,900
Oh, I can't...

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,300
There's something wrong with Terry.

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,200
Uh, Terry, can you see anyone
moving out of either vehicle?

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Are there any signs of life down there?

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't... I can't see. My eyes...

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
There's something wrong
with my eyes. I can't...

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,700
I can't... I can't see.

29
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,300
I can't... Um....

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,500
Help me.... Uh...

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,700
I'm... I'm blind!

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,900
Did he just say he was blind?

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,500
Terry, are you okay?

34
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,100
TV News Helicopter, this is
Milwaukee Police Air Control.

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,800
You are on a collision course
with Police Air pursuit.

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Turn immediately and vector 3-0-0-7

37
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,400
- and climb to 10,000 feet.
- Keep talking.

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,700
Repeat: turn immediately and climb.

39
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,400
- I can't see. I-I can't see!
- Turn immediately and climb.

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,300
Cut the feed!

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,100
I said, cut the feed!

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,300
Are you looking for someone?

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,300
The director assigned a trainee

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,300
to cover preliminaries and provide
support for this investigation.

45
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,200
An agent by the name of Lee?

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,600
Lee.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Kind of big guy?

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,900
Enthusiastic?

49
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,800
You know him?

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,900
Think I'm about to.

51
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,600
Hey. Dr. Hood.

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,700
Agent Young.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,100
Hi. I'm Felix Lee.

54
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Uh-oh.

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,300
I know what both of
you guys are thinking.

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
Really? Tell us.

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,600
Dr. Hood,

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,300
you're wondering why
the director would burden you

59
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,300
with some rookie agent at the
head of a very serious case.

60
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,200
Well, why would he?

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
Funny you should ask.

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
I know I don't have
much field experience.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And science-- not exactly MIT.

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,700
The whole tactical training
bit wasn't really my bag.

65
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,000
- So, what do you do?
- Recon.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
I'd have to say recon.

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
It's easy for me

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
'cause I'm real good at blending in.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,100
I'm like a mouse.

70
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,700
A 6'6" mouse.

71
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,700
Exactly.

72
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,300
What was Agent Young thinking?

73
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,900
Why I didn't flash my FBI badge until now.

74
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,200
Okay, so, what do we have here?

75
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,900
Well, the pilot's name
was Terence Gillman.

76
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,900
Reportedly suffered a loss of vision

77
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,500
right in the middle
of a live news broadcast.

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,400
Anyone on the ground when he crashed?

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
No. That's the only
good news, actually.

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,100
The pre-crash footage
was all over YouTube.

81
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,800
Think that where the director saw it.

82
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,400
Yeah. Prior to joining
the, uh, news team here,

83
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,800
Gillman flew for the FBI as part
of the Hostage Rescue Team.

84
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,500
The director served with HRT.

85
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Yup. And Gillman saved his
life not once, but twice.

86
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,100
Well, that explains why we're here.

87
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,900
Solving this case just became personal.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,500
So, Gillman was in perfect health,

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,300
and without warning,

90
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,300
his sight goes.

91
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Yeah. I'm thinking river blindness.

92
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Caused by those nasty little nematodes

93
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,800
that can live in the
human body for up to...

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
15 years.

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,800
Wikipedia.

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
River blindness?

97
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Um, those nasty little
nematodes are fairly common in,

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
uh, Western Africa.

99
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
But not really likely Milwaukee.

100
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,700
Did we get anything from the autopsy?

101
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,500
Body was toast.
It was practically cremated.

102
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,600
Oh. So it will be pretty hard
to identify any other symptoms.

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Oh. There was this.

104
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah. He was married.

105
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,100
I found it in the crash sight.

106
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,600
- We need to talk to his wife.
- Yeah.

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Here.

108
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,300
She would want that.

109
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,600
I know I would.

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,600
Let's hope she's the only widow
we have to speak to while we're here.

111

113
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,800
eleventh hour s01ep14

114
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,000
Terry loved that job so much, so much.

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,200
For the last five years,
he never missed a morning commute.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,800
You know, it's funny.

117
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,500
He wasn't even supposed
to be working last night.

118
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,400
They just called him in
to cover the chase, and...

119
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,300
We're sorry for your loss, Mrs. Gillman.

120
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,400
I need to know what happened, please.

121
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,600
We believe Terry suffered
from something called,

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
uh, rapid onset blindness.

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,400
It's a very rare condition.

124
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,700
Need to ask you.

125
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,900
Did he complain recently of, uh,

126
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,300
poor vision or headaches?

127
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Nothing.

128
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,300
He would have told me
if something were wrong.

129
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Maybe he didn't want you to worry?

130
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,000
Terry took the responsibility
of being a pilot very seriously.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,300
And he would have never flown

132
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,800
if he felt that he were impaired in...

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,200
...any... Oh!

134
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you okay?

135
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,300
Yes.

136
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,300
Just... pregnant.

137
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,400
I never thought that I would
be raising a baby by myself.

138
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,100
It's not fair.

139
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,300
I want to have my husband back! I...

140
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,100
You'll let me know
if you find out anything?

141
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,600
I promise.

142
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,400
Thank you.

143
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
What now?

144
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,000
We find out from Mr. Gillman
if he had any more symptoms.

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
You can talk to dead people?

146
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,200
Remarkable.

147
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
He was on TV every day for
the last five years, remember?

148
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,600
Well, eastbound I-94 is
really gonna put a wrench

149
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,900
in this morning's commute...

150
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
What exactly are we looking for?

151
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,100
Any, uh, indication that he was sick...

152
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,300
Well, good luck.

153
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,700
In the three years I knew Terry,

154
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
he never caught so much as a cold.

155
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,600
It's gonna be a rough
one out there, folks.

156
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,900
In a bizarre twist, a few
lanes are blocked by chickens

157
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,100
who apparently fell off a delivery truck...

158
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,400
How long were you Terry's assistant?

159
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,100
Three years.

160
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,900
Couple months ago, I got
promoted to junior reporter.

161
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,500
It never would have
happened without Terry's help.

162
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,300
God. His poor wife.

163
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
She must be heartbroken.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,500
You and Erica are friends?

165
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,500
Yeah.

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,400
We got thrown together
at a couple of office parties,

167
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,100
but we decided we liked each other.

168
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,900
She must feel so alone right now.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
This is really helping.
Thank you, Debbie.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
So, if I were to give you any advice...

171
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,300
That's the third time he's adjusted
the volume on his headset in two minutes.

172
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Maybe the roar of the engine was too loud?

173
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Well, why's he turning the volume down?

174
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,300
Could be, uh, hyperacusis.

175
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,800
It's, uh, extreme noise sensitivity.

176
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
Scratching his neck.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
Why is that odd?

178
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,500
Well, it's odd if you have an itch
in the same place for three days.

179
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,300
Could be, uh,

180
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
dermatitis.

181
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,600
Deie, was the cabin,
uh, climate-controlled?

182
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,500
Yeah.

183
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,800
That's why I never flew with him.

184
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,100
He liked it arctic.

185
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,400
He kept the air conditioning at 65.

186
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,700
Freeze that, please.

187
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,900
Well, you can add
hyperhidrosis to the list.

188
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Sweating when it's cold, right?

189
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,400
Yup.

190
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
My God.

191
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,200
Why didn't I notice this?

192
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,100
No. If he didn't notice,
why would you?

193
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,400
Um, what was the date
of the first broadcast

194
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,100
where we see Terry's symptoms?

195
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,100
The Monday before last,
so, two weeks ago.

196
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
- It narrows the timeframe.
- Yeah.

197
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Excuse me.

198
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah?

199
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,000
I was the first person he told.

200
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
About them being pregnant.

201
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
He was so thrilled to become a dad.

202
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,000
911 just dispatched an ambulance
to Erica Gillman's house.

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,200
- Terry's wife?
- She's blind.

204
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Dr. Nayar, I'm Jacob Hood.

205
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
This is Rachel Young.

206
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,200
We're with the FBI.

207
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,700
Oh, Dr. Hood, yes.

208
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,600
Hi.

209
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,700
How's, uh, Mrs. Gillman and her baby?

210
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,200
They're doing okay.

211
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,700
I-I have to say,
I've never seen this before.

212
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,000
She suffered spontaneous blindness,

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,300
but nothing in her medical
history relates to it.

214
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,800
Her husband had the same thing,
and it cost him his life.

215
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
What tests did you run?

216
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,000
Every diagnostic panel I could think of.

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
They're shots in the dark, huh?

218
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,900
Exactly right. So far,
we just can't make the connections.

219
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,900
Oh, you should know that
there's been a flurry of patients

220
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,100
with really strange combos of symptoms.

221
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Really? Such as?

222
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,600
Pins and needles; numbness
in their hands and feet;

223
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,300
a lack of muscle coordination.

224
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,200
Skin rashes?

225
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,500
Memory loss?

226
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,600
Yeah.

227
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,100
What are you thinking, Hood?

228
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,800
Can you give me
uh, a specific example?

229
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,200
Well, um, this morning
a traffic cop came in.

230
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
He was having trouble writing tickets.

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Also had a bad rash.

232
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,200
And this afternoon a woman was
complaining of numbness in her feet.

233
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
We're testing her for Buerger's disease.

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
- Minamata.
- Minna who?

235
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,300
All the symptoms point to it.

236
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,900
Minamata-- it's a...
it's a city in Japan,

237
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,500
and it's kind of where the real
dangers of heavy metal poisoning

238
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,900
were first discovered.

239
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,300
This chemical plant,

240
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,100
they dumped a load of
methyl mercury into the bay,

241
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,400
and it poisoned the sea life,

242
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,100
which was the town's main food source

243
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,800
and it devastated the population.

244
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,300
I'll begin targeted
hair and blood analysis.

245
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,900
If it is mercury poisoning,
we'll know within the hour.

246
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
- Thanks. We appreciate that.
- Yes.

247
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,400
Where would people be
exposed to mercury here?

248
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,100
I don't know.

249
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,600
That's what we're here to find out.

250
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,000
- Before this town ends up like...
- Minamata.

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,200
Yeah, that place.

252
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
???

253
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,700
Hey!

254
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,000
Hey!

255
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh, hi.

256
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,700
Hey, what are you doing?

257
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,700
Hey, how you doing?

258
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,900
Not good.

259
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
You know what that does
to the ecosystem around here?

260
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,800
You're sorry?

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,300
You will be.

263
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,800
Once I give you a $500 ticket.

264
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,700
- $500? Come on, man!
- 500 bucks.

265
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,100
You're killing me.

266
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,200
Maybe next time you'll think about

267
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,500
what you're killing, "man."

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
Analysis of Erica Gillman's hair

269
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,400
indicated a mercury level
of 2.9 parts per million,

270
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,500
almost six times the normal range.

271
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,700
My other patients have
similar mercury levels.

272
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,900
Certainly enough to
prove mercury poisoning.

273
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,400
- Is it treatable?
- With chelation therapy.

274
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,900
We inject a binding compound
to collect any heavy metals,

275
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,600
then the body excretes them naturally.

276
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,900
The treatment should work.

277
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,700
For the other patients, maybe,
but not for Erica Gillman.

278
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,200
I don't understand.

279
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,900
If you know what's making me blind,

280
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,400
why can't you fix it?

281
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,500
In most cases,

282
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,600
the chemical used in
chelation therapy is safe.

283
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,100
Most cases?

284
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,000
It's not safe if you're pregnant.

285
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,700
Erica, right now the
mercury in your system

286
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,000
is being passed through the
placenta to your developing fetus.

287
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,100
With every minute that passes,

288
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,000
the danger of serious
complications multiplies.

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,500
My baby is sick?

290
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,200
The sooner we stop the, uh,

291
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,400
baby's exposure to the toxins, the better.

292
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,900
Erica, I need your permission
to perform an emergency C-section.

293
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,300
I'm in my second trimester.

294
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
My baby won't survive.

295
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,400
Preemies as young as 23 weeks have
gone on to live normal healthy lives.

296
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,200
Give me a percentage.

297
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,700
Every case is different.

298
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,300
I don't care about every case.

299
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,200
What are the chances
that my baby will survive?

300
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,000
10 to 15%.

301
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,300
Erica, before you make your decision,

302
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,800
you need to know that
without intervention,

303
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,200
you and your baby will
get much, much sicker.

304
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,900
The only way to treat you effectively,

305
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,500
is to treat the two of you separately.

306
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,000
I've lost my husband.

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,600
I won't lose my child, too.
You understand?

308
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
We're bringing in a
diagnostic team from the EPA

309
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,200
to help with this investigation.

310
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,400
Well, we're going to need it.

311
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Identifying the mercury
was the easy part.

312
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Finding the source--
that's gonna be difficult.

313
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,100
Any ideas?

314
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,200
Ah, well, the upside of
what happened in Minamata

315
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,500
is it was fairly contained.

316
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,700
But nowadays, the way
the food supplies are,

317
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
it could be up and down
the country very quickly.

318
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,800
Then how serious a health
risk are we talking here?

319
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,300
Well, I think from a few isolated
cases to a full-fledged epidemic.

320
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,900
Well, with only four cases so far,

321
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,200
let's keep our fingers crossed
that it stays that way.

322
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,100
Excuse me, I had a
mercury advisory issued to

323
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
all the local hospitals like you asked.

324
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,200
And every patient with the
appropriate symptoms is being tested.

325
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,000
It's not pretty.

326
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,000
They've already identified 25 new cases.

327
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,700
Six in the last hour alone.

328
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,100
So much for keeping
our fingers crossed.

329
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,000
We have to find the source.

330
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,700
Otherwise, what happened in Minamata's
gonna be like the best case scenario.

331
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Where do we start?

332
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm thinking,

333
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
a little of something the science
community calls immersive garbalogy.

334
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,100
Oh, yeah... Cool.

335
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,200
What's that?

336
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,800
Gillman on the address.

337
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
Got another one.

338
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,600
Hood, you can tell your friends
in the science community

339
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
that immersive garbalogy sucks.

340
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Hey, Doc, isn't mercury
used in thermometers?

341
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,000
Used to be.

342
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
They don't use mercury anymore.

343
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,700
I'm pretty sure as a kid,

344
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,400
my mama put those things in places

345
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,000
mercury definitely should not go.

346
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,600
Yeah, well, even if they
didn't have toxic mercury

347
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,300
in their house as a permanent fixture

348
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,500
maybe they just had
to pass through it once.

349
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,500
Something they already ate
or drank in large quantities?

350
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Yeah.

351
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, but those other 25 victims

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
weren't all hanging out
at the Gillmans, were they?

353
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
No, probably not.

354
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,900
But, uh, there's got to be
some kind of common thread.

355
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
You Officer Walter Barrett?

356
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,800
Hi.

357
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,300
The traffic cop who had
trouble writing tickets.

358
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,000
And had the weird rash.

359
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,200
Uh, yeah, that's me.

360
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000
Nice to meet you, Officer.

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
I hear your toxicity levels aren't
as high as some of the others.

362
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,900
But if you start to feel
nauseous or sick in any way,

363
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,800
- just let us know.
- Will do.

364
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,400
So, how can I help?

365
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,600
Well, as we go through this trash,

366
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,300
if you see anything
that you ate or drank

367
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,600
in the last couple of weeks,
you just tell us, okay?

368
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,900
Peanut butter?

369
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,400
No, I'm allergic to peanuts.

370
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
My head swells up
like a watermelon.

371
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,500
Mayonnaise?

372
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,200
Ew, never touch the stuff.

373
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,600
All those preservatives
give you Alzheimer's.

374
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,100
Well, the Gillmans
sure like their milk.

375
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,200
Lake Fresh.

376
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,100
I use that in my coffee.

377
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,500
How many times a day?

378
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,600
Breakfast, lunch, dinner,

379
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
and every hour in between.

380
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,400
Prevents gout.

381
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,100
Well, if there is toxic
mercury in this milk,

382
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,100
the compound on the swab
should find it pretty quickly.

383
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,600
It's positive.

384
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Felix, call the Health Department,

385
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,100
have them issue an immediate recall

386
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,600
on all Lake Fresh dairy products.

387
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,400
I'm on it. Officer Barrett.

388
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Doesn't the milk industry
have safeguards in place

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,500
to stop something
like this from happening?

390
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,400
Yeah, sure it does,

391
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,800
but it doesn't normally
include testing for heavy metals.

392
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,600
We can get the remaining
stock off the shelves

393
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,900
but what about the milk
that's already been sold?

394
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,300
- I don't know.
- Do it, okay.

395
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,500
Lake Fresh has, uh,
two local bottling plants.

396
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,900
They're shutting down production.

397
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
We need to investigate both.

398
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,900
We should split up.

399
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,300
This guy's all through traffic
heading southbound on the 894

400
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,900
doing at least a hundred.

401
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
The real problem is

402
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
he's driving on the northbound
side of the highway.

403
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,600
Ground units broke off...

404
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,100
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

405
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,600
How you doing?

406
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,500
All right.

407
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,300
I'm just putting together
a memorial segment for Terry.

408
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,500
Oh, yeah.

409
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm sure it'll be amazing.

410
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,900
Oh, um, I know I told you I'd be done with

411
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
that wetlands pollution
piece by the end of the week,

412
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
- but it's just...
- It's okay, honey.

413
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
- I can't.
- Don't worry about that,

414
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
all right.

415
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,200
This is way more important.

416
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Thank you for understanding.

417
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,200
I just wish...

418
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,600
I just wish there was
something I could do.

419
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,900
Something I could say.

420
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
I'll be okay.

421
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
I just, um...

422
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,200
I just miss my friend.

423
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,700
I know you do.

424
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,000
Agent Lee.

425
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
- ???
- Thank you.

426
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,400
It's Agent Lee.

427
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
We could use some good news, Felix.

428
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,300
Sorry, Lake Fresh East is clean.

429
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,900
The equipment is anyway.

430
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Some of the milk is
testing positive for mercury,

431
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
but it is not coming from this plant.

432
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Lake Fresh West is negative, too.

433
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,700
So, the milk was tainted
before it got to Lake Fresh?

434
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,100
Where does that leave us?

435
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,600
Well, the victims that drank
the, uh, poisoned milk,

436
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,900
they're the final link in the food chain.

437
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,900
Processing pnts--

438
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,100
they prepare their raw product for
distribution-- they're in the middle.

439
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,400
But it all begins with the dairy farms

440
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,800
and the cows that supply the fresh milk.

441
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,900
There have got to be, what,

442
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,600
at least a dozen dairy
farms in this area.

443
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,900
26, actually.

444
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
But according to the Wisconsin
Department of Agriculture's database,

445
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,800
only one supplies milk to
both Lake Fresh facilities.

446
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,700
???

447
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,100
All right, I'm forwarding the coordinates
to your onboard GPS, Agent Young.

448
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,500
Thanks, Felix.

449
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,000
I didn't know you could do that.

1
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Afternoon.

2
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,600
Something I can help you with?

3
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,900
I need a refrigerator.

4
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Something old.

5
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
Right this way.
I got a bunch of 'em over here.

6
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,700
How much for this one?

7
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,800
Uh, you don't want that piece of junk.

8
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,100
The compressor's shot and
the coils are rusted through.

9
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Better to repair it
than buy a new one, right?

10
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm big on recycling.

11
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,700
A sale's a sale.

12
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
Come on back. I'll write you up.

13
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,700
Cash or charge?

14
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,300
Oh, I prefer cash.

15
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,600
Works for me.

16
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,900
I already told you,
my girls are healthy.

17
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,100
This is quite a large barn
for such a small amount of cattle.

18
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
What happened to
the rest of your cattle?

19
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,300
I sold off some head to raise cash.

20
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,200
The ones I kept produce more
than enough milk to make my quota.

21
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,500
You expanding your dairy
to something more agricultural?

22
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,300
Looks like that field's just been plowed.

23
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,200
Rachel...

24
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,900
...will you give Felix a call.

25
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,200
Something I need him to grab for me.

26
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,400
??

27
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,600
???

28
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,400
Did I tell you I come from
a family of farmers?

29
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

30
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, third generation.

31
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,200
And with the economy the way that it is,

32
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,300
it's impossible to
not cut corners, am I right?

33
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,300
So, uh, you understand.

34
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,200
I understand.

35
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,900
You did what you had to do, right?

36
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,700
Right?

37
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,300
They were losing weight,

38
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
staggering around a lot.

39
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,800
I figured it was mad cow disease.
I was really scared.

40
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
I euthanized them last week.

41
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,200
Your cow didn't have mad cow disease.

42
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,300
They had mercury in their systems,
which went directly into the milk.

43
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
Well, how could I have known that?

44
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
You knew they were sick,

45
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,300
and that's when you're supposed to
call the health department.

46
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
But instead, you just covered it up.

47
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,200
I was protecting my livelihood.
I was looking out for my family!

48
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,900
Really?

49
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,200
What about the families
who drank the milk?

50
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,800
Look, I don't think I should say
anything else until I talk to a lawyer.

51
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,900
You're going to need one.

52
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,600
Take him into custody.

53
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,900
??

54
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,500
Three generations of farming?

55
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,600
Well, now we know how the mercury
found its way into the milk.

56
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,100
But not how it got into the cows.

57
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,600
Every inch of this farm
has to be tested--

58
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,300
the feed, the grass, the water.

59
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,100
Turn everything over.

60
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,300
??11 inches.

61
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,700
Does everything look okay?

62
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,400
The baby's heart and lungs
are developing normally. So far.

63
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
It's your heart I'm worried about.

64
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
The longer you wait to treat this,

65
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,100
the more stress is put
on all your vital organs.

66
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,800
Erica, I don't want to lose both of you.

67
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,100
But you said the baby looked good.

68
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,900
Unfortunately,

69
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,000
there's no way of knowing whether the
mercury is affecting him at this time.

70
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,100
But, Erica, with the levels
in your system,

71
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,000
the chances are, it will affect him.

72
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,800
The question is how much.

73
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,900
Wait a minute.

74
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,000
You said him-- affecting him?

75
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Is... is it a boy?

76
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes...

77
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,500
you're having a baby boy.

78
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,600
Okay, so far we've run
trace metal screens

79
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,900
on the storage silos, feed troughs,
and the cattle feed itself--

80
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,600
all negative for mercury.

81
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,800
Jacob Hood.

82
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,800
Yeah, did you run the simulation
with a lower dose?

83
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,800
Okay. Well, thanks for trying.

84
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
What was that about?

85
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,600
It's the head of obstetrics
at Johns Hopkins.

86
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,200
I thought maybe a low-dose chelation
regimen might help out Erica's baby.

87
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,100
That didn't sound like a yes.

88
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,000
No, it wasn't.

89
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,300
You know, Doc,
when you're behind a desk,

90
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
??victims are just names
on a computer.

91
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,200
Out here it's different.

92
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,400
How do you deal with people
who've lost so much?

93
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,500
to tell you the truth, Felix, I haven't
really worked that one out yet.

94
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,000
Hood.

95
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,100
We checked out
Breen's remaining livestock.

96
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,900
All clean.

97
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,100
Well, that means the infected cows
ate something the others didn't.

98
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,800
Well, the remains have been sent out
for stomach content analysis,

99
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,000
but it'll take time.

100
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Well, till we get the results,

101
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,700
all the local dairy farms are
going to have to be quarantined.

102
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,200
Isn't there a faster way to
figure out what those cows ate?

103
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,100
Faster?

104
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,500
Yeah.

105
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,300
Oh, don't tell me we're
dumpster-diving again.

106
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,100
??We don't really have to.

107
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,100
You're kind of standing in it.

108
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,300
Oh, crap!

109
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,200
You know, contrary to popular belief,
cows do not have four stomachs,

110
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,100
but they do have
four digestive compartments.

111
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,100
Girls must love you.

112
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,700
I do all right.

113
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,900
This is interesting.

114
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,700
??What's that? What? Let me see.

115
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,400
What the hell is that?

116
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,200
It's fish bones.

117
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,100
- Fish bones?
- Yep.

118
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
I thought cows were vegetarian.

119
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,800
Well, they may think they are.

120
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
But farmers have been
supplementing their feed

121
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,700
with meat by-products for years.

122
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,300
And the cheapest one is fishmeal.

123
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,000
Well, we need to find out
the name of this fishmeal distributor.

124
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,900
If other farms are still using it,

125
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,200
dairy products could be
just the tip of the iceberg.

126
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,000
Nailed it!

127
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,900
Tests confirm the fishmeal Breen
got from here is our source.

128
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,700
This is what his cows were eating.

129
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,100
Blue Fleet's wastewater
is laden with mercury.

130
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,900
Notify every cattle farm and feed house
that bought from them in the last 60 days.

131
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,200
I've already got disposal
teams out handling collection.

132
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,200
Agent Lee, exactly what kind of fish
does Blue Fleet process?

133
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,500
mostly menhaden and lake herring.

134
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,000
Herring?

135
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,600
I don't really like fish.

136
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,700
You know that, uh,

137
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,300
Three Stooges movie, where
Curly swallows that fish whole,

138
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,000
in the X-ray you can it
swimming around his ribs?

139
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Freaked me out.

140
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,500
Anyway, there's, uh,

141
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,400
not really many kinds of fish that
can carry dangerous levels of mercury.

142
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,800
It's only really predators like,
um, swordfish, and sharks.

143
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,900
Big fish that eat other big fish.

144
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,900
I doubt we'll find swordfish
or sharks in the great lakes.

145
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,500
So, how'd the mercury find
its way into the little fish?

146
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
Lake Michigan is huge.

147
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
It's bigger than some countries.

148
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
There's no way we can search all of it.

149
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,300
You don't have to.

150
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,800
Someone's done it for us.

151
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,900
Let's see if we can find more seagulls.

152
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,400
<i>The handy thing about gulls
is they'll eat anything.</i>

153
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,300
So, if they've been feeding on
tainted herring

154
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,600
there's going to be signs.

155
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,200
What kind of signs?

156
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,100
Tremors, ruffled feathers,
droopy eyelids, um...

157
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,600
...violent behavior.

158
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
??

159
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,700
??Roll your window up!

160
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,500
You folks okay?

161
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,400
Yeah,

162
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,000
thanks to you.

163
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,900
Rachel, I think we really
need to get to the source

164
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,200
before it turns up somewhere
else in the food chain.

165
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,300
Oh, thanks for the, uh...

166
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,000
by the way, it's...

167
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,300
How long have you been with
the Department of Fish and Wildlife?

168
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,300
Long enough to see

169
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,100
the number of species facing
global extinction raise to 16,000.

170
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,600
The evidence that we're killing
our planet keeps piling up

171
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,900
and we keep ignoring it.

172
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
It's frustrating.

173
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,000
The only time the federal
government takes notice

174
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,700
is when their bottom line is threatened.

175
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,000
We're not the enemy, Officer.

176
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200
- Is this your transmitter?
- Yeah.

177
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,500
We use them to track the bird's
breeding and migratory patterns.

178
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,600
Rachel...

179
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,000
this is why we're here.

180
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,400
If these sick gulls are
feeding from tainted herring,

181
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,500
we can use this
to lead us to the source.

182
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,800
So the GPS data from the bird transmitter
narrowed our search to five square miles.

183
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,800
This sonar will find any, uh,

184
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
foreign debris on the lake floor
that could be poisoning the herring.

185
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,400
What was that?

186
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,400
Only one way to find out.

187
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,700
Gas masks on.

188
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,300
Yeah, that's, uh,

189
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,200
that's liquid mercury.

190
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,400
Are those maggots?

191
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,400
Yeah.

192
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,600
Well, that'd certainly have the effect
of luring the fish toward the mercury.

193
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,800
What's the glass from?

194
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,200
It's a barometer.

195
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,100
yeah.

196
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,300
Old barometers had glass servoirs
filled with pounds of liquid mercury.

197
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,200
That's right--

198
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,000
Wikipedia?

199
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
??

200
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,200
This sure as hell wasn't an accident.

201
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,000
Someone could be out there
right now dumping more of this.

202
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
I think I know how to find him.

203
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,800
Liquid mercury is classified
as a hazardous material.

204
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,300
So if you wanted to buy this much
of it without a license, you'd...

205
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,700
Just get a truckload of
mercury-filled antiques with cash.

206
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,200
From a dealer who won't ask
too many questions.

207
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,100
Exactly.

208
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,300
yeah.

209
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,700
That was... that was a beautiful thing.

210
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,600
Okay, let's get every available
field agent from here to Detroit

211
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,400
canvassing antique stores
and local online dealers.

212
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,300
Felix...

213
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
find out who those
barometers were sold to.

214
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
It's the hospital.

215
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Erica suffered a generalized seizure.

216
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,100
The uterine contractions triggered
a drop in the fetal heart rate.

217
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Well, if nothing is done,

218
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,400
she'll lose the baby and her life
will still be in jeopardy,

219
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,600
so delivery is now the only option.

220
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,200
Yeah, she still won't give consent.

221
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,300
Well, can you blame her? She's facing
the toughest decision of her life.

222
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,400
And she can't even
ask her husband about it.

223
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,800
Then if I, I don't induce,
my baby will die? Is that for sure?

224
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,300
There's always exceptions, but, uh,

225
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,300
no, it doesn't look good.

226
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,600
If I make the choice and I fall on
the wrong side of the percentage,

227
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,200
I'm always going to wonder if I...

228
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,200
Not a great bet, is it?

229
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,700
No...

230
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,400
no.

231
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,300
Can I ask you something?

232
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,600
Sure, anything.

233
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
What would you do?

234
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,200
If it were your wife?

235
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,100
If it were my wife.

236
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,600
You know what...?

237
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,300
I think I'd say to hell with
the science, just go with your heart.

238
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Agent Young.

239
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,400
How is she?

240
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,800
About to make the hardest
decision of her life.

241
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,700
She's having the baby.
They've got to induce.

242
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,500
I'll tell Dr. Nayar.

243
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
So what now?

244
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,100
We wait.

245
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,900
Excuse me, ma'am, official FBI business.

246
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,400
So, in the last six weeks,

247
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
local antique shops have sold

248
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,300
more than 30 mercury-filled barometers,
thermostats, and thermometers.

249
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,300
The parts recovered from the refrigerator
account for only half of them.

250
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,500
So that's over 200 pounds
of mercury unaccounted for.

251
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,700
Who bought the antiques?

252
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,200
A man using the name
of Lars Saunderski.

253
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,600
He left a phone number
with several dealers

254
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,800
so they could call him
when more barometers came in.

255
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,500
The phone number traced back
to a disposable cell phone

256
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,000
and the name doesn't exist.

257
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,500
actually, yes, it, it does, uh...

258
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,700
Larus saundersi-- it's the
Latin name for the Saunder's gull.

259
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,900
It's an endangered species.

260
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,400
Okay, so who in the hell uses
an endangered bird as an alias?

261
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,700
Sorry, do you mind me asking...

262
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
your, um, necklace.

263
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,000
Couldn't help noticing it's, uh,
it's beginning to oxidize.

264
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,200
There isn't a chance that
anyone, uh, been handling...

265
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,900
mercury could have, uh,
touched that, is there?

266
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,900
I mean, uh,

267
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,100
you don't know anyone

268
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,500
who works for the Department of
Fish and Wildlife or anything?

269
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,800
my husband.

270
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,700
He gave me this necklace last week.

271
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,900
Your husband.

272
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
??That would count.

273
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,800
Debbie.

274
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,500
You, you shouldn't be here.

275
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,400
What's in there, Ben?

276
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Tell me you didn't
poison all those people.

277
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,900
It was the only way
to get their attention.

278
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,000
The toxic effects of mercury--
they're reversible.

279
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,700
Terry died...

280
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,700
and his wife could, too,

281
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,000
and their baby.

282
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,900
I didn't mean for that to happen.

283
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, my God.

284
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,400
Ben.

285
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,900
What did you do?

286
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,000
I did this for us,

287
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
for the baby we're
going to have someday,

288
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
and for, for their children, too.

289
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,800
My God, Debbie, th...

290
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,600
Th-This planet is under
attack and nobody cares!

291
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,900
But I do.

292
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,600
I mean, I'm...

293
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,700
I'm actually trying to fix it.

294
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,100
Do you know how crazy you sound?

295
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,300
No, aren't you the one
who's always telling me

296
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,400
that the only time people
sit up and take notice

297
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,500
is when something tragic happens?

298
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,900
that's what I give them, honey.

299
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,000
This is front page news.

300
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,400
Debbie, come on.

301
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
Debbie.

302
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,400
Let me explain.

303
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,400
There's nothing more
to explain, Mr. Finney.

304
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,800
You're coming with us now.

305
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,800
I did what I thought was right,

306
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,700
and when there's no fish
and no forests...

307
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,900
you'll wish you hadn't stopped me.

308
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,400
You killed someone.

309
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,200
I'm not sorry I stopped you.

310
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,100
??

311
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,300
??Ben Finney, you are under arrest.

312
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,600
How's the baby doing, Doctor?

313
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,000
Strong.

314
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,800
Like his mom.

315
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,800
Hey.

316
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,300
So...we recovered the last of the
antiques from Finney's storage unit.

317
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,200
You add to that
what we got off his boat.

318
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,300
Looks like we got it all.

319
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,000
Okay, so, um,

320
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,500
the lake should clean itself
within a couple of months,

321
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,700
and that's, uh...

322
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,800
Well, thank you very much
for all your help, Felix.

323
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Please, don't mention it.

324
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,400
Oh, so I guess that's it.

325
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yep, this is it.

326
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,300
Okay, Agent Young.

327
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Agent Lee.

328
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,200
- Dr. Hood.
- See you around.

329
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,200
You know, uh, I could hang
around if you guys wanted.

330
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,200
That's something that
I would consider if you asked.

331
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,400
But just know there are
several other posts at the Bureau

332
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,900
who have expressed interest in what it is
that I bring to the table and what I do.

333
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,800
Really?

334
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,400
That's weird 'cause
I spoke to the director

335
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,700
and he said that you begged
for this assignment.

336
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah, he did say that.

337
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,300
- Director said that?
- Quite specifically.

338
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,100
Okay, well, I'm just going to
be honest with you guys, then.

339
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I think that the work
that you guys do...

340
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,400
...is awesome.

341
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,200
Thank you very much.

342
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I just had to see it for myself.

343
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,900
Can I stay?

344
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,900
I don't know.
Rachel, what do you think?

345
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,000
It's your call.

346
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,100
I guess I can deal with him.

347
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,700
You're not going to make me
regret this, are you, Felix?

348
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,000
??Doc, please.

349
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,900
It's the Three Musketeers,
one nation under a groove, baby.

350
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,600
That's kind of what I mean.
