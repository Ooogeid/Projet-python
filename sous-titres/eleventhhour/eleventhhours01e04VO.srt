00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,362
Are you all right?

4
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:28,006
You need to get out
of the street, honey.

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,615
You need to get out of
the street. Watch out!

6
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:35,206
Watch where
you're going!

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,835
Keep moving!

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,867
Go on.

9
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,207
Hey!
Excuse me!

10
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:14,175
???

11
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:16,835
Champagne, please.

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,167
I'll have the same.
Yes, ma'am.

13
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:19,267
Here you go.

14
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:20,735
Thank you.

15
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:23,201
You do know it's free.

16
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,894
Nobody tell you
this is a charity concert?

17
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:27,728
Well, it can't be
that charitable

18
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:29,900
if they force you to sit
through the damn thing.

19
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,050
Cheers to that.

20
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,524
Cheers.

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,316
I'm Jacob.

22
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,784
Hi. Elizabeth.

23
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,750
Pleasure to meet you.

24
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:38,349
So what do you do?

25
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:42,863
I'm special science advisor to the FBI.

26
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,217
How intriguing.

27
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:47,817
Job description would be...?

28
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:50,487
Well, scientific advancements

29
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:53,650
have greatly benefited
humanity, but...

30
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:58,488
if those advancements
are abused, could be very dangerous.

31
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,150
My job...

32
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:02,017
is to make sure
that never happens.

33
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:06,117
And what kind of science crimes
do you like to handle, Jacob?

34
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,750
Kind of classified.

35
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:12,550
What about your phone number?

36
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:15,217
That classified, too?

37
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:16,917
Hood.

38
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,112
We have some place to be.

39
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,383
Let me give you my card.

40
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,117
Duty calls.

41
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:30,783
I always wanted
to say that.

42
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,284
Sorry to interrupt.

43
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,175
The FBI is holding
two seats on a flight that leaves
in half an hour.

44
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:36,583
So what's this about,
Rachel?

45
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,017
Okay. Teresa Kimsey.

46
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,583
She's 16.
Went missing July 7.

47
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,616
Suddenly showed up
August 9.

48
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:44,050
Unharmed?

49
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:45,217
Physically.

50
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:46,583
Benjamin Gonzales, 15.

51
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,950
Disappeared August 11.

52
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:49,550
Reappeared September 8.

53
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,449
And Reggie Leinhart, 17.

54
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:54,316
Missing September 10,
back October 15.

55
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:58,254
 When the National
Center for Missing and Exploited
Children detected the pattern,

56
00:02:58,254 --> 00:02:59,583
they contacted the FBI.

57
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,683
Well, the approximate age
is the same.

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,159
Duration of abduction is roughly a month...

59
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,284
That's not what
they're focusing on.

60
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,017
Or why they want you involved.

61
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:13,284
All of the children
are severely autistic.

62
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,576
At least, they were
when they were abducted.

63
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:19,987
Were? Now they're exhibiting symptoms of savant syndrome.

64
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:23,800
From mentally challenged to mentally gifted
in the space of a month?

65
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,592
That's extraordinary.

68
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,628
When they found
Reggie Leinhart,

69
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:46,737
he'd carved
657 squares

70
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:48,623
in the side of an 18-wheeler
with a screwdriver.

71
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,737
Perfect quadrilaterals.

72
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,323
Benjamin Gonzales's
mother

73
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,072
 found her recently
abducted son

74
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:55,800
frantically
building that.

75
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:59,007
Which means these must
be Teresa Kimsey's.

76
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,706
I find it hard to believe that
these children were diagnosed

77
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:03,072
with Heller's syndrome.

78
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,050
It's a relatively
rare form of ASD.

79
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,925
Autism spectrum disorder.

80
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,106
I have a cousin who's autistic.

81
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:12,191
But he has a mild form.

82
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:14,907
So, what were you saying
about Heller's syndrome?

83
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,339
Well, it's one
of the most severe.

84
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,806
A child can
be developing normally

85
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:20,306
and then sometime between
the ages of two and four,

86
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,339
they start to regress.

87
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:24,406
They lose skills that
they've already developed

88
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,439
like, uh, language,
motor skills.

89
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:29,106
Some of them even stop
communicating altogether.

90
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:31,215
Savantism

91
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:33,512
 is an even more
uncommon condition

92
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:36,357
where a developmental
disability coexists

93
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:39,046
with an extreme ability
in other areas

94
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,579
like mathematics
or art.

95
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:42,280
Yeah, I never understood
how that works.

96
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,713
Well...

97
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,779
Okay.

98
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,046
Um, wait.
Look.

99
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:49,247
Wait. That's mine.

100
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:51,913
This is an ordinary
person's brain.

101
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,260
By ordinary you mean incredibly charming
and full of personality.

102
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:58,113
Ordinary people organize.

103
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,213
They sort things.

104
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,613
They make connections.

105
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,813
It's called logic.

106
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,113
Now, this...

107
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,313
Um, what are you doing?!

108
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:05,713
Is the brain...

109
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:06,779
Hood!

110
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:09,113
...of an autistic person.

111
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:11,247
You see, although types
and degrees of autism

112
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:12,738
vary widely
across the spectrum,

113
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:13,987
most of them have trouble
with connections.

114
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:16,154
The ability to organize that
I was talking about. Now...

115
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:18,287
Hood!

116
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:19,520
This...

117
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,287
...is the brain

118
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:24,821
of a savant.

119
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,925
It's the ability
to focus on one thing

120
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,847
to the exclusion
of everything else.

121
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:33,580
Now, if you have nothing
but toothpaste in your suitcase,

122
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:34,675
what would happen?

123
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,144
You'd know a hell of a lot
about toothpaste.
Exactly.

124
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:38,613
You know everything there is
to know about toothpaste.

125
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:40,488
You'd be a toothpaste expert.

126
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:41,737
The question is:

127
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:44,470
how does a severely
autistic

128
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:46,337
otherwise ordinary person

129
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:48,337
become a savant

130
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:50,370
inside of a month?

131
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:53,771
What happened
to these children?

132
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,504
And why?
Well,
we'll start with Teresa Kimsey.

133
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:59,300
She's our first victim,
with the thickest case file.

134
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:01,904
And next time,

135
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:04,004
use your own luggage.

136
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,804
<i>I didn't know the FBI
had a science division.</i>

137
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,404
They don't. They have a
Science and Technology branch-

138
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,737
deals with all manner
of intelligence-gathering

139
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,404
and criminal investigation.

140
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,938
And then there's me.

141
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:17,337
Is this Teresa?

142
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,337
Yes.
She was two

143
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:21,104
when that picture
was taken.

144
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,437
She was such a
funny baby,

145
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:25,437
always smiling.

146
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,437
About six months later,
she just stopped.

147
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:31,938
No more smiling,
no more hugs.

148
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:33,938
Sometimes
she'd look at me

149
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:37,104
like she didn't
know who I was.

150
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:39,971
Before we go in,
I should warn you.

151
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,971
Usually Teresa doesn't
like visitors.

152
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,470
She can get
anxious and upset.

153
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,138
But then...

154
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,205
she hasn't exactly been
herself lately.

155
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:15,004
Wouldn't even go
near a coloring book

156
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,271
before she went
missing.

157
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,305
Hi, Teresa.

158
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,938
Now I

159
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,138
can't get her to stop drawing. Mmm.

160
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:23,504
And not that
I want to.

161
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:24,904
Mrs. Kimsey,

162
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,205
would you mind if we spoke
to Teresa for a few minutes?

163
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,704
Well, actually,
you see,

164
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,704
Teresa doesn't
really talk.

165
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:33,704
Oh, it's okay.
She doesn't need to.

166
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:39,504
There was a 13-year-old
girl with autism

167
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:41,537
at Syracuse a
few years ago.

168
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,171
She never spoke.

169
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:44,838
Certainly didn't think
she could read or write,

170
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:46,504
and when they gave her
a computer keyboard

171
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:48,838
she typed out the words
"I love Mom. "

172
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:51,038
So Teresa's preferred
method...

173
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,071
Would appear
to be drawing.

174
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:56,704
Hiya.

175
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:05,437
This...

176
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:08,904
...is me.

177
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:11,305
Sort of.

178
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:14,804
I like science.

179
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,404
That's an atom.

180
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:24,537
this is...

181
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,238
Rachel.

182
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:30,271
She likes to beat up bad people.

183
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:31,938
Hey!

184
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:33,271
And this

185
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:36,504
is you.

186
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:37,831
Can you show me
what happened to you

187
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,437
when you went away?

188
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:50,470
You were sleeping?

189
00:08:50,537 --> 00:08:51,800
Were you sleeping?

190
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,871
You're being very
helpful,

191
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:59,104
Teresa.
Thank you.

192
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:03,504
What is that?

193
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,370
Some kind of tube.

194
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,737
Is that a tunnel?

195
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,104
Were you in a tunnel?

196
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,637
Where'd they take you,
honey?

197
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:27,305
Is that a...

198
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,771
Was she in
an MRI machine?

199
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,878
Were you in a machine?

200
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:40,437
You see, these
are, uh,

201
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:43,470
these are surface coils.

202
00:09:43,537 --> 00:09:46,637
They increase
the magnetic sensitivity.

203
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:50,271
And... these...

204
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:53,753
Rachel, can I have
the sidewalk picture, please?

205
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,537
These are DTIs-

206
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:01,038
Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

207
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:03,882
DTI is a specific
type of MRI

208
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:05,851
that tracks the movement
of water through the brain.

209
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,281
Teresa,

210
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:08,848
you're drawing
what's inside your head?

211
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:10,149
But...

212
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:11,882
the last time
she had an MRI

213
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:14,381
was when she was
but five years old.

214
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,748
Where?

215
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,182
Well, the Autism Institute
of Chicago.

216
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,115
We're meeting
with the chief administrator,

217
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:23,782
Catherine Bonatelli.

218
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:25,182
Both kidnap victims

219
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,115
Benjamin Gonzales
and Reggie Leinhart

220
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:29,115
had MRIs taken here.

221
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:31,115
They were also five
years old at the time.

222
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:33,149
That's got to mean
something, right?

223
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,149
Means we're getting closer.

224
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:37,149
I don't understand.

225
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:39,481
Why are these children
being taken?

226
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,481
That's what we're trying
to find out.

227
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:44,015
Well, I want you to know
that the Institute will do

228
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:45,748
whatever we can to help.

229
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:47,782
Thank you.
Rachel.

230
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,982
Do you have the picture
of Benjamin's sculpture?

231
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:02,115
These were taken
of Teresa

232
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:03,487
over ten years ago.

233
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:05,815
I hope they still pertain
to your investigation.

234
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,269
Miss Bonatelli,
we'll also need to see the scans

235
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,878
for Benjamin Gonzales
and Reggie Leinhart.

236
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,314
Excuse me. Do you mind
if I take over for a second?

237
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:25,815
Oh, sure.

238
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,381
These scans are almost exactly
the same.

239
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,862
Even if these patients
have the same type of autism,

240
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,281
it doesn't mean their scans
would be this close.

241
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:47,414
Brain patterns
are as unique as fingerprints.

242
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:51,715
You have so many kids with the
same distinct brain pattern.

243
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:54,481
I'm going to need to see all
the DTIs you've taken here.

244
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:58,082
Oh, I'm sorry, but we've
confidentiality issues.

245
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,314
Without express permission
from every patient involved...

246
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:02,253
Or a court order.

247
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:07,581
Our facility's
been taking DTIs since '94.

248
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:09,414
We're talking
thousands of patients.

249
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:10,448
And if any one
of those

250
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:11,715
matches the three
we just found,

251
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,182
they're in real danger
of being abducted.

252
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,249
So the sooner we get started,
the better.

253
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:23,581
Hood...

254
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,300
Yep.

255
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,893
I think I've got one.
Scott Butler.

256
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,426
He doesn't have
Heller's syndrome

257
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:29,425
like the other three victims.

258
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:32,458
But his scans were also
taken when he was five.

259
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:35,025
He's 18 now.

260
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:37,958
And they're almost identical
to the others.

261
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,863
Yeah, that's a match.

262
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:47,191
If these MRIs were taken
over ten years ago,

263
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:49,391
then it's
not these MRIs

264
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,658
that the kids are
remembering, is it?

265
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,059
No, I don't think it is.

266
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,238
I'm going to try
Scott's contact number.

267
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:55,892
Yeah.

268
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:59,992
Voice mail full.

269
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,092
We'll need to go
check on him.

270
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,059
Hold on.

271
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,925
I found another one.

272
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,358
Cameron Stewart.

273
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,658
Five years old
when he had the scan done.

274
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,253
Now he's 16.

275
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,258
Let's give it a try.

276
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:21,425
Hello?

277
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:23,892
Hello. Is this... Mrs. Stewart?

278
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,425
Yes.
Who's this?

279
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:28,558
Hi. I'm Jacob Hood.

280
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,291
I'm-I'm with the FBI.

281
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:31,800
Is your son home, please?

282
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:34,487
Hello?

283
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,892
Did the police call you?

284
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,925
No. Is he all right?

285
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,258
Then, how did you know?

286
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:45,458
Cameron went missing from school
this morning.

287
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,825
All right now. We have to be
real quiet. Okay?

288
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:57,758
Don't want to upset
our new friend Cameron.

289
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:02,491
Hello, Cameron.

290
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,825
You're going to be very
comfortable here.

291
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:10,224
I promise.

292
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,725
Missing Persons Unit is
at Cameron Stewart's residence,

293
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,458
getting a full report.

294
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,958
Dr. Hood and I found
four more potential victims.

295
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,224
Are they accounted for?

296
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,858
Yeah, they're all accounted for.

297
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:27,125
Placing undercover units
at each one of their houses,

298
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,692
24-hour protection.

299
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:31,892
<i>Mr. Butler?</i>

300
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:35,858
<i>Scott Butler?</i>

301
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:44,025
Scott?

302
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,113
Scott?
Hood, look at all of his mail.

303
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:47,237
There's at least
a month's worth.

304
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:48,892
He's already been taken, Rachel.

305
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,458
Taken and returned.

306
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:51,992
Clear.

307
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,525
Looks like
he lives alone.

308
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,925
Well, that explains why no one
reported you missing, Scott.

309
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,291
Scott...

310
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:00,499
we're with the FBI.

311
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,159
Do you mind if I, if I just make
a recording of that?

312
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:16,458
Scott, would you mind stopping
playing for a moment.

313
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,391
I'd like to ask you
some questions.

314
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:21,862
Scott, are you all right?

315
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:24,625
He's bleeding.

316
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,441
Get an ambulance!

317
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:33,615
Code Eight. Ambulance needed
at 146841st Street,

318
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:53,625
You hear that?

319
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:54,999
What?

320
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:02,580
Music.

321
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:06,800
The same notes.

322
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,392
Same as what?

323
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,316
Full sentences, Hood.

324
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:17,792
*
Hear that?

325
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:21,692
Now listen.

326
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,692
Same notes.

327
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,358
Scott's phrase used
the same notes

328
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:30,125
as a common
anesthesia machine.

329
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:32,859
You don't need one of those
to get an MRI.

330
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:35,113
I don't think
someone
was taking pictures
of his brain.

331
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:37,725
I think
they opened it up.

332
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:40,325
I don't think he was
the only one either.

333
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,958
Look at the back wall.

334
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,487
It's a clean room filter.

335
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:54,113
You don't need one of those
to get an MRI either.

336
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,146
You only need them
for operations.

337
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,113
Time of death
is 3:47 p. m.

338
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:15,914
'Cause of death:
rapid blood loss

339
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,179
due to a trauma
to the carotid artery.

340
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,113
Cause of trauma:
yet to be determined.

341
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:21,914
Perhaps I can help with that.

342
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,246
I'm sorry. Who are you?

343
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:24,246
FBI.

344
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:25,780
I'm Dr. Jacob Hood.

345
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:26,628
If you don't mind,

346
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,503
I'd like to take a look
at the body.

347
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,280
What is this about?

348
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:31,780
What are you looking for?

349
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,046
A scar.

350
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:34,813
Would you mind if I, uh...

351
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:39,980
What kind of scar?

352
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,380
Can I borrow a nasal probe?

353
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:46,046
Right here.

354
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,980
Thank you.

355
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:51,680
This should just take a second.

356
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:54,547
Okay. I got it.

357
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,280
There's the scar.

358
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,647
Have you taken X-rays yet?

359
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,513
Cameron?

360
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:39,947
Cameron!

361
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,014
Cameron?

362
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,980
The operation was done through
an incision in the gum,

363
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:08,914
and then you walk the bone
up to the pituitary gland.

364
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,613
It's a new kind
of brain surgery

365
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,643
that doesn't leave
any visible scars.

366
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:15,313
Wait. You're saying someone
secretly performed

367
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,847
brain surgery on this boy
without consent?

368
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,947
That's exactly what I'm saying,
Dr. Fisher.

369
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:22,280
Someone tried to alter
Scott's brain neurons

370
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:25,480
by surgically implanting
some kind of microfilament.

371
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:26,613
That sounds risky.

372
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,847
The brain is
highly prone to infection.

373
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:31,813
Or you can nip the carotid
artery during the procedure

374
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,280
and the clot wouldn't hold.

375
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:35,313
One sneeze would
dislodge the clot,

376
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,914
and you'd bleed to death.

377
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,488
Which is exactly what happened
to Scott.

378
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:41,800
Hood, Teresa and the other two
boys could be walking around

379
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,925
with these wires
inside their head.

380
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:44,331
Cameron Stewart could be
undergoing

381
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:45,816
the same procedure
as we speak.

382
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:47,253
We need to go.

383
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:49,050
Can you check the wires
for serial numbers

384
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,384
when you do the autopsy, please?

385
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,551
No problem.

386
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:53,884
Don't send me
somewhere else, please.

387
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:54,425
This is the third place

388
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:55,258
that I've been to
in this hospital.

389
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:56,458
Now where is he?

390
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:58,725
Where's Scotty?
I want to see him.

391
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:01,591
I just...
I want to see my son.

392
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,222
You're Mr. Butler?

393
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:06,355
Do you know something
about what's happened to Scotty?

394
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,487
What's happened to my son?

395
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:12,288
It was a month.

396
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:15,821
A month.

397
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:17,888
The most he'd ever gone
without calling me back

398
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:21,322
was two weeks.

399
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,921
I should've flown out
to check on him.

400
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,988
Why didn't I fly out?

401
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,021
It's not your fault.

402
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:31,555
Yeah...

403
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:34,854
Yeah, it is.

404
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:38,288
I never should have let him
move away.

405
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:43,021
He had no business
living by himself.

406
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:45,288
How long was he
on his own?

407
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:49,689
I lived with him
the first six months

408
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:51,988
to make the transition.

409
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:55,988
He was high-functioning
in terms of his autism.

410
00:20:56,055 --> 00:21:00,222
He had been on his own
about a year now.

411
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:05,488
He only wanted to be normal.

412
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:14,854
What did I do?

413
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:18,754
I promise you, Mr. Butler,
it was nothing you did.

414
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:20,955
Whoever took Scott
would have done it

415
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,788
whether he was
with you or not.

416
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:36,222
Still no answer at Teresa's.

417
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:37,854
I hope she's all right.

418
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,222
What is up
with this damn traffic?

419
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:43,055
You okay?

420
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:44,821
I'm fine. I just...

421
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,589
I just keep thinking
about Cameron Stewart,

422
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,589
out there somewhere.

423
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:49,854
Who would do this, Hood?

424
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:52,088
Put kids through this?

425
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:53,622
What would their motive be?

426
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:57,238
Well, some people believe that
autism, specifically savantism,

427
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:59,753
is like some sort
of clumsy step forward

428
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:00,737
on the evolutionary path

429
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,555
to the ultimate potential
of the human mind.

430
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:05,175
And if someone
could figure out

431
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:07,589
how to recreate what gives them

432
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:11,088
certain advanced abilities while
preventing the disabilities...

433
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:15,589
then you can significantly
advance human intelligence.

434
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:17,689
How does sticking wires
in somebody's brain do that?

435
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,754
By forcing the neurons
to find

436
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,255
alternate paths
to their destination.

437
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:24,888
Those alternate paths
could be better paths.

438
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:37,188
I'll try her cell.

439
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:41,888
No!

440
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:50,690
Miss Young.

441
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,254
Hi.
Dr. Hood, hi.

442
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Teresa, look
who's here.

443
00:22:57,503 --> 00:23:00,420
She spoke yesterday.

444
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:01,347
She said,

445
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,113
"Thanks, Mom.

446
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:05,128
Do we have any ice cream?"

447
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:07,228
And "Where's Bob?"

448
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,727
Who's Bob?

449
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:10,395
Our dog.
Oh.

450
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:12,295
Mrs. Kimsey...

451
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,361
um, we'd like to take
Teresa to the hospital.

452
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,662
Why?

453
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:18,961
What is it?

454
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:20,894
She needs an X-ray.

455
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:23,261
No.

456
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:25,195
No, she's not going anywhere.

457
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:27,894
Mrs. Kimsey.

458
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:36,562
Teresa might have been, um,
subjected to an experimental

459
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,727
neural implant.

460
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:41,395
Her health could be at risk.

461
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,727
But Teresa's never
been better.

462
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:44,794
Look at her.

463
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:47,861
I mean, she's
talking.

464
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:50,694
Not a lot, but
she is talking.

465
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:53,727
She called me Mom

466
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:57,675
for the first time
in 16 years.

467
00:23:58,662 --> 00:24:00,361
Do you know
what that's like?

468
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:04,028
No, I don't.

469
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,228
And that horrible month.

470
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:08,395
No, uh-uh.

471
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:10,261
No, I don't want
to lose her again.

472
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:12,528
Of course you don't,
Mrs. Kimsey,

473
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:14,694
but this is happening
to other teenagers, too,

474
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:16,128
just like Teresa.

475
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:18,928
One died yesterday.

476
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:22,395
Another was taken
from his home.

477
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,261
Kidnapped.

478
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:26,562
His name's Cameron,
and he's 16 also.

479
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:27,628
You see,
the more we know

480
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:30,094
about what happened
to Teresa...

481
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,928
the better chance
we have to find him.

482
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:35,694
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:37,827
She's not going with you.

484
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,061
Yes, I am.

485
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:43,737
???

486
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:49,925
Cameron's gone.

487
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,999
He must be hiding.

488
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,199
I searched his room.

489
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,999
He's scared.

490
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,166
It's not unusual
for them

491
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,899
to find refuge
in extremely confined spaces.

492
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:00,032
I looked everywhere.

493
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,932
He's gone.

494
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:14,665
You okay back
there, Hood?

495
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:16,465
You're awfully quiet.

496
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:18,133
It's nice, but I'm
starting to worry.

497
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,999
There's probably
only 50 or 60 doctors

498
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,365
in the Midwest capable of this

499
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,862
kind of surgery-
maybe we should just visit

500
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:24,999
them all and see if Teresa
recognizes anybody.

501
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:28,465
You can't just go
around confronting

502
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:30,766
upstanding members of
the medical community

503
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:32,365
without probable cause.

504
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:33,665
Why not?

505
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:36,599
I have to go
to the bathroom.

506
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:40,499
<i>Cameron?</i>

507
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:46,932
Cameron?

508
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:53,398
Cameron?

509
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,532
Teresa?

510
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,799
You okay?

511
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,465
Come on, Teresa.
You're scaring me.

512
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:03,665
What's going on?

513
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,565
Teresa?

514
00:26:12,632 --> 00:26:15,432
You okay?

515
00:26:16,766 --> 00:26:18,233
Hood.

516
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,332
You're drawing again?

517
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:28,999
Well...

518
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:30,199
I suppose it is still

519
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:31,999
her dominant form
of communication.

520
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,832
Teresa,
what is this?

521
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,166
Looks like a pattern.

522
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:36,866
It's definitely some
kind of sequence.

523
00:26:36,932 --> 00:26:38,766
I wonder...

524
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:41,332
What?

525
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,199
Synesthesia.

526
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:44,799
Or, actually,
a specific kind

527
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,732
of synesthesia
called grapheme.

528
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,166
Okay, back up
and start

529
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,166
with the first word
I don't understand.

530
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,925
Um, many people
with savant syndrome

531
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:54,465
experience something
called synesthesia

532
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:57,066
where one sensory
experience

533
00:26:57,133 --> 00:27:00,499
triggers an overpowering
response in another.

534
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,199
Like, um,

535
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:03,732
every time you
hear a door slam,

536
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,632
you get a taste of
mint in your mouth

537
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:06,832
or vice versa.

538
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:09,199
Okay... and grapheme?

539
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,432
Well, it's the most
common type, where letters

540
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,999
or numbers are perceived
as inherently,

541
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,766
uh, colored
or textured.

542
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:17,699
So, like, an A
could be red?

543
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,099
That's right.

544
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,432
Okay, so she could
be writing a name.

545
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:23,298
Yeah, or a place.

546
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:26,899
Teresa, do you mind if
I borrow one of these?

547
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:31,265
Seven letters or...
or numbers.

548
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:36,365
Could be a phone number.

549
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:38,166
It's hard to see
what you're doing

550
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,665
with all the graffiti, Teresa.

551
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:42,133
Graffiti.

552
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,465
No, that's it.

553
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:45,425
She's not writing
around the graffiti.

554
00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:46,487
She's using it.

555
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:47,999
If she's intentionally
incorporating it,

556
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,432
we can use it as a key.

557
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:50,565
That's brilliant.

558
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:52,766
Okay, okay, Teresa,

559
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:56,265
so the first color
in your sequence is...

560
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:57,465
yellow-
what's yellow?

561
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:01,166
I got a four here
that's yellow.

562
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:04,099
There's yellow scribbling
over a four over there, too.

563
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,365
Uh-huh.
Okay.

564
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:07,932
Red's next.

565
00:28:09,112 --> 00:28:10,832
These two Os are red.

566
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,133
It's not a phone number.

567
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:24,766
It's a license plate.

568
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:28,332
<i>I have to be honest with you.</i>

569
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:30,966
The very idea
that you're considering me

570
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:33,099
some kind of suspect is...

571
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:37,133
well, incredibly insulting,
not to mention absurd.

572
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:44,112
This is your
license plate number, isn't it, Miss Bonatelli?

573
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:48,734
<i>And you got it</i> from a girl
who has a severe case of Heller's syndrome.

574
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,678
It may be
a simple coincidence,

575
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,468
or she may actually
remember it

576
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,862
from her earlier visits
to the facility.

577
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,101
When she was five?

578
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:58,285
Do you have any idea how long

579
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:00,834
we've been doing research
on autism here?

580
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,067
Do you?

581
00:29:02,134 --> 00:29:03,500
Over two decades,

582
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,487
and we still don't know
what causes it.

583
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:08,737
Right now, one
out of every 150 children
has autism.

584
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:10,988
That means one and a half
million in America alone,

585
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:12,021
and it's growing.

586
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:13,588
Which means we'll
have four million

587
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:14,789
in one decade.

588
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,889
The research has to continue.

589
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,863
What happened to Scott Butler
isn't research.

590
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:21,221
It's murder.

591
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:28,655
If that's the case...

592
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:31,155
I certainly hope
you capture whoever

593
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:33,155
is responsible for all this.

594
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,021
I can't believe
we just let her go.

595
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:40,422
We don't have
any proof.

596
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,522
Proof?

597
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:42,988
It's obvious.

598
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:44,555
Law is like biology, Hood.

599
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:46,522
You can't just decide
something's true.

600
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:48,321
You got to dig up
some dirt,

601
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:51,555
find a few nasty
little microorganisms
to prove your point.

602
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,555
Good use of a scientific
analogy, Rachel.

603
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:55,954
Hey, speaking of
digging up dirt...

604
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,355
I just got a text.

605
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,688
My friend at the Bureau
who's running

606
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,188
a background
check for me.

607
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:02,488
It seems Miss Bonatelli
did some consulting work

608
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:04,188
for a company
that was a cover.

609
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:05,522
A cover for who?

610
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:07,288
The CIA.

611
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:10,355
You weren't easy to
find, Mr. Whittier.

612
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,988
Means I'm
fairly good at my job,
Agent Young.

613
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:14,954
Means you are, too,
I may say.

614
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,121
Must have friends
in high places.

615
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:17,455
What we have

616
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:19,889
is a dead
19-year-old boy

617
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:22,321
and a 16-year-old
who is missing as we speak.

618
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:24,321
Somebody's operating
on autistic children

619
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:26,659
without their consent.

620
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:29,088
Catherine Bonatelli
did some consulting work

621
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:30,522
for you in '05.

622
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:32,288
I'm assuming it
involved her work

623
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:34,455
at the Autism Institute
of Chicago.

624
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:37,954
If this person in question did
do some contract work for us,

625
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:39,488
those records
would be

626
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:40,988
part of our HCS.

627
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:42,655
Human Control System.

628
00:30:42,722 --> 00:30:47,438
But HCS info is accessible
on a need-to-know basis only.

629
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:50,050
Well, unless
the health and well-being
of innocent teenagers

630
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,984
means nothing to you,

631
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,878
we need to know right now.

632
00:30:56,284 --> 00:30:59,951
If the person in question,
this Catherine Bonatelli,

633
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:02,484
did contract work
in '05,

634
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:04,684
it would have involved
an interest

635
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:08,150
in a common trait of autism:
superior memory.

636
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:10,753
We would have used her
as an easy access route

637
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:12,517
for information, statistics.

638
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:14,350
Possible test subjects?

639
00:31:15,684 --> 00:31:17,517
Never got that far.

640
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,317
People realized
that it would be decades

641
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:22,284
before we got
anywhere useful on this,

642
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,450
not to mention
the potential

643
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:26,999
for a public relations
disaster of epic proportions.

644
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:28,984
So, if this...

645
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,918
theoretical pilot study
ever did exist...

646
00:31:32,984 --> 00:31:34,738
it was shut down.

647
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:36,217
So, basically,
you're telling us nothing.

648
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:39,350
If someone is doing what you say

649
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:42,150
to these children,
I'd like to help.

650
00:31:42,217 --> 00:31:44,284
The Agency
would like to help.

651
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,918
So, prove it.

652
00:31:52,183 --> 00:31:55,584
When it comes to passing
sensitive information,

653
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:58,851
the trick is to make sure
that you didn't leave behind

654
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,450
physical evidence of any kind:

655
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:02,617
notes on paper,
phone records,

656
00:32:02,684 --> 00:32:04,851
voice recordings,
that kind of thing.

657
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:07,717
The best way to leak...

658
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:11,362
is simply lean forward and
whisper in another person's ear.

659
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:29,617
What?

660
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:31,284
What did he say? Catherine Bonatelli's

661
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,581
coded cell phone number-
we can use it
to trace her movements.

662
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:56,443
Stay here.
I'm gonna go check this out.

663
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:17,050
Rachel?!

664
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:22,175
Rachel.

665
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:22,894
Are you okay?

666
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:24,161
I'm okay. I'm okay.

667
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,161
But Miss Bonatelli isn't.

668
00:33:34,232 --> 00:33:37,238
Building was rented
in Miss Bonatelli's name.

669
00:33:37,238 --> 00:33:38,800
Do you think
she's our mad scientist?

670
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,135
No. No, she didn't
even go to med school.

671
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,765
Brain surgery's
not the kind of thing

672
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:45,724
you learn on the internet,
no matter what they say.

673
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:48,765
Probably wasn't her idea
to blow herself up, either.

674
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:51,498
It's pretty clear
there was someone else.

675
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:53,613
Bonatelli provided
the test subjects based

676
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:56,237
on the DTIs from the Institute,
but I don't think

677
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:57,832
she knew the medical details
of what was going on.

678
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:00,132
Or how far they'd go
to cover their tracks.

679
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,598
No.

680
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,738
We've gone over
the whole site.

681
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:04,665
She's definitely
the only casualty.

682
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:19,932
Cameron?

683
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,032
Cameron?

684
00:34:33,932 --> 00:34:36,199
Cameron?

685
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:39,362
What did you find?

686
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:40,765
He's nearby.

687
00:34:44,798 --> 00:34:46,932
They weren't just doing the
surgeries in this building.

688
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,598
They were holding them
in here, too.

689
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:49,865
So, where's Cameron?

690
00:34:49,932 --> 00:34:51,199
If he's
still alive,

691
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:53,299
they've moved
him somewhere.

692
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,112
Hey, Hood.

693
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:15,065
Or maybe he escaped.

694
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,299
I need an immediate
door-to-door search

695
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,498
for a special needs 16-year-old
named Cameron Stewart.

696
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:23,598
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,932
Have you seen this boy?

698
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:32,613
In this place?

699
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:34,050
No.

700
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,498
You're welcome to look
around if you want.

701
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:36,665
We won't be long.

702
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,769
Take your time.

703
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:43,765
Rachel...

704
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:45,865
he was here.

705
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:58,753
<i>Are you sure?</i>

706
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,232
We have no other choice.

707
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:02,199
Are you really going
to do this at the hospital?

708
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:03,659
There's nowhere else left.

709
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,254
I can't believe
we did that at the lab to Catherine.

710
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:08,565
We have to stop.

711
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:09,784
It's too risky.

712
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:11,565
Don't think about the risk.

713
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:13,863
Think about the reward.

714
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,065
Now what?

715
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:37,316
We've got one clue left.

716
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:45,800
It's not here.

717
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,253
What do you mean,
it's not here?

718
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:48,300
How do you lose
a brain?

719
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,628
Well, the brain is here,

720
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:51,800
but the wires-
they were in a specimen cup.

721
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,488
Okay, who has access
to this area?

722
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:57,898
Hospital staff, cleaning crew.

723
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,675
I'm sorry. Somebody must have
made a mistake.

724
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:01,675
It wasn't a mistake.

725
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:03,237
The wires are gone
for the same reason

726
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:03,941
they blew up the building.

727
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:05,742
Whoever's behind this
is getting rid of the evidence.

728
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:06,925
I need to find out what
the wires were made of.

729
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,550
The compound could tell
us where it was made,

730
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,817
and right now,
we have nothing.

731
00:37:09,884 --> 00:37:13,410
No. No, we do
have something.

732
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,737
Or more specifically, someone.

733
00:37:20,393 --> 00:37:21,859
You're doing
great, Teresa.

734
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:23,892
Just remain still.

735
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,059
And thank you for helping us.

736
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:29,359
You're very brave.

737
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,059
<i>The composite of the wires</i>

738
00:37:36,126 --> 00:37:38,113
<i>in Teresa's brain is
primarily platinum.</i>

739
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:38,925
<i>As in wedding bands?</i>

740
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:39,925
<i>As in nerve stimulators.</i>

741
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,253
They're like small
defibrillators

742
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:43,128
that are surgically implanted
in the chest

743
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,596
to shock the vagus nerve
and prevent epileptic seizures.

744
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:48,815
If somebody's dismantling them
to make neuroconductors,

745
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:50,029
they're gonna need
more than a few.

746
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:51,863
We need to find out

747
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:54,581
what local hospital is ordering
an abundance of these things.

748
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:56,316
Hold on. Those
missing wires.

749
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,737
It's not easy to
swipe something

750
00:37:57,737 --> 00:38:00,371
from a hospital morgue
without clearance.

751
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:01,971
You're right.

752
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:04,371
Our doctor must have privileges
at this hospital.

753
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,425
???

754
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:14,112
@@@

755
00:38:29,271 --> 00:38:30,050
I have eight doctors

756
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,771
who requisitioned nerve
stimulators in the last year.

757
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:34,538
No. Hang on. Seven.

758
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,371
Hmm. That's strange.

759
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:37,638
Why?

760
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:38,503
It's okay. It's just,

761
00:38:38,503 --> 00:38:41,071
the stimulators usually go
through the thoracic department,

762
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:44,205
but I've got 25 of them assigned
to a surgeon in neurology.

763
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:47,438
What? Why would a brain surgeon
be implanting nerve stimulators?

764
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:48,737
What's the
surgeon's name?

765
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,238
Dr. Edward Fisher.

766
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:52,605
The doctor who tried
to save Scott Butler?

767
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:57,205
I'll have Chicago PD
pick him up.

768
00:38:57,271 --> 00:38:58,605
Do you have his address?

769
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,104
Don't need one.
He's upstairs.

770
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,605
Scheduled for surgery
about 15 minutes ago.

771
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:28,438
Nobody move.

772
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:30,271
Put that down slowly,
Dr. Fisher,

773
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:31,704
and step back
from the table.

774
00:39:31,771 --> 00:39:33,271
You don't understand.

775
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:34,804
You don't know
what I'm doing.

776
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:37,104
Then tell us.
What are you doing?

777
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:40,138
Trying to save my son.

778
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:43,638
Your son?

779
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:46,605
Noah.

780
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:48,271
He's four.

781
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:50,638
Diagnosed with Heller's syndrome
a year ago.

782
00:39:50,704 --> 00:39:52,205
He's autistic.

783
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:54,071
So you're trying to fix him?

784
00:39:54,138 --> 00:39:56,271
Find some kind
of cure?

785
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:58,171
Who are you to say
he needs fixing?

786
00:39:58,238 --> 00:39:59,904
Just 'cause
someone's mind works

787
00:39:59,971 --> 00:40:02,271
atypically doesn't mean
they can't experience happiness?

788
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:04,572
Or thrive on their own terms?

789
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,004
In fact,

790
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,050
one of those atypical people

791
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,271
helped us find you, Dr. Fisher.

792
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:14,432
You remember your patient 

793
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:16,534
Teresa Kimsey?

794
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:20,237
I'm so close to a breakthrough,
I can't stop now.

795
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:21,315
You don't understand.

796
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:23,175
I understand
you can't conduct

797
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:26,675
deadly experiments
on other peoples' kids
to save your own.

798
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:31,987
Noah deserves...

799
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,054
a normal life.

800
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,922
I have to finish now.

801
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:42,988
Get any closer to
that boy's head,

802
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:44,588
and I'll put a bullet in yours.

803
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:05,388
Why was Fisher
working on teenagers

804
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:06,987
when Noah's only four?

805
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:10,925
Our brain stops maturing
around 15 or 16.

806
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:12,753
If you operated any younger, there'd
be no way of telling

807
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:14,633
if the changes were
due to

808
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:19,050
 the operation,or simple maturation
of the brain.

809
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,840
Poor kid.

810
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:25,628
Let's hope he
has more family.

811
00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:28,425
If they're anything like
Mom and Dad, maybe not.

812
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,133
Any news on Noah?

813
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,699
I wonder if he has
an aunt, an uncle.

814
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:44,766
Actually, I've filed
for a friend-of-the-court
brief for adoption.

815
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:48,362
Not for me.

816
00:41:48,362 --> 00:41:50,050
I love kids.

817
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,599
I'm a big fan, but all
that traveling we do,

818
00:41:53,665 --> 00:41:56,988
along with all the
scientific crimes and crises.

819
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:58,612
Then who?

820
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:01,766
Mr. Butler,
Scott's dad.

821
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:03,899
He has the
experience,

822
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,999
and, uh, I
don't know.

823
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:08,465
It seemed like a good idea.

824
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:10,675
What?

825
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,170
That's very
thoughtful, Hood.

826
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:15,736
Sensitive.

827
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,836
What, scientists
can't be sensitive?

828
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:23,769
She hasn't spoken
in a week now.

829
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,637
I understand why they had
to remove the wires,

830
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:30,870
but I miss her.

831
00:42:30,937 --> 00:42:33,037
She's still in there.

832
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:35,128
We're going
to start therapy at the

833
00:42:35,128 --> 00:42:38,885
 Son Rise Institute
in Massachusetts next week.

834
00:42:39,821 --> 00:42:41,988
Teresa?

835
00:42:48,238 --> 00:42:50,050
We wanted to thank you

836
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:51,909
for your help.

837
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:57,238
Now, we wouldn't have found
the bad doctor

838
00:42:57,238 --> 00:42:59,347
if it hadn't been for you.

839
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:03,815
You're an amazing girl.

840
