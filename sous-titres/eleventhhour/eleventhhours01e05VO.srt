1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,860
Hey, Ned, we're gonna hit the pierogi stand.

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,860
You coming?

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,060
I got to call home first.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,030
Uh...

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,960
Order me a potato and cheese,

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,960
and no skimping on the sour cream.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,460
Got it.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,430
Hello?

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,630
Cath, it's me.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,730
Tell me you got it. 

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,330
Last dancing robot in Pittsburgh.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,260
I had to wrestle it away from a hockey mom.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,700
Those chicks are tough.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,960
We are going to have one very happy birthday boy.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,860
Just don't be late for his party.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,260
I'll be there, I swear.

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,160
Put him on, okay, I want to say hi.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,900
Johnny, Daddy's on the phone.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,300
- Hey, Dad. - Happy birthday, champ.

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,100
You excited?

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,160
Uh-huh.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,560
This is gonna be the best birthday ever.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,000
Lot of pressure on Mom and Dad

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,330
to keep topping ourselves, but we'll give it a shot.

25
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,330
What do you say?

26
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah...

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,460
Buddy, you there?

28
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,600
Johnny.

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,260
Help me.

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,260
Help me.

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,400
Ow.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,900
Damn it.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Rachel Young?

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,230
Walsh.

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,860
- What's it been... three years?  - A-At least.

36
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,060
I haven't seen you since Quantico.

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,430
Well, what are you doing here?

38
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,000
You're looking at the new Special Agent in Charge

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,800
of the WMD directorate.

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,130
I am now one of the movers

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,460
and shakers in the world of nuclear non-proliferation.

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,460
Sounds exciting.

43
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,130
So... where'd you end up?

44
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,700
Finally land that spot you wanted at Counter Terrorism?

45
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,830
Not exactly.

46
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,330
I landed at the Office of the Director.

47
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,460
Top of the food chain.

48
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,530
- Impressive.  - Actually, I'm, I'm more of a handler

49
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,760
for someone at the top of the food chain,

50
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,430
but our, our cases are unique.

51
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,600
Well, like what?

52
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,760
Give me a taste.

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,100
Uh...

54
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,000
Are, are you familiar with the parameters of electroporation?

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,200
Neural implants?

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,300
- How about porphyria enzyme de... - Hey, I got to run.

57
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,460
...ficiency syndrome?

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,600
Gentlemen.

59
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
It was great seeing you, Rachel.

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,360
- Yeah. - We should grab a drink

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,200
sometime, do some more catching up.

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,700
Yeah.

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,930
What?

64
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,930
...oversight at bio-waste facilities.

65
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,700
Now, I admit it's not very sexy... 

66
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,760
Sorry to interrupt.

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,900
Dr. Hood, you have an urgent call

68
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
from the Pennsylvanian State Health Department.

69
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,960
Some guy named Rigdon.

70
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,030
Pittsburgh EMTs responded to a demolition worker

71
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,230
found in advanced respiratory distress

72
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,660
with multiple organ failure

73
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,830
and other anomalous complications.

74
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,260
Anomalous complications?

75
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,100
Ones that suggest he may well have been exposed

76
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,130
to a highly toxic substance, one not commonly seen.

77
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,400
Right now, authorities have it categorized

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,760
as a possible public health concern.

79
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,030
How serious a concern?

80
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,700
It's hard to say till we get the specifics,

81
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,600
but it's definitely something he ate or drank,

82
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,830
something absorbed through the skin,

83
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,100
something airborne.

84
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,760
Best-case scenario, it's an isolated incident...

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,100
one victim, one quickly identifiable cause.

86
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,160
And the worst-case scenario?

87
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,400
Suffice to say, really, really bad.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,030
So tell me about your old buddy Calvert Rigdon.

89
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,730
Cal spent the last eight years

90
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,860
heading up the Pennsylvania Health Department.

91
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,600
Before that, he ran the National Center

92
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,430
for Preparedness, Detection and Control

93
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,160
of Infectious Diseases at the CDC,

94
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,560
and before that, he was fighting typhus and yellow fever

95
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
in Angola and Sierra Leone.

96
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,660
Pretty impressive.

97
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,760
Actually, his most impressive contribution

98
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,530
was when he introduced me to my wife.

99
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,630
Whoa, whoa,

100
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,330
- This is a restricted area. - Don't shoot.

101
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,730
We're the good guys.

102
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm Dr. Hood, Special Science Advisor to the FBI.

103
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,230
Jacob.

104
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,200
Hey.

105
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,900
Cal.

106
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,500
Afraid you're going to need these.

107
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,430
Victim's name

108
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,230
is Christopher Fisher.

109
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,300
A member of the demolition clean-up crew

110
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,530
found him this morning at around 10:00.

111
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,600
He was dead by 11:00.

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,830
What is this place?

113
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,830
Native Americans

114
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,200
used to bury their dead here for centuries.

115
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,030
Early settlers at Fort Pitt did the same.

116
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,800
When the city expanded in the 19th century,

117
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,160
it was buried under new construction.

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,260
The demo team rediscovered it

119
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,560
while clearing debris from the old foundation.

120
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,060
Personnel log says

121
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,000
- Fisher was a licensed mortician?  - Yeah, brought in

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,630
to oversee the proper handling of all human remains.

123
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,330
How long has he been here?

124
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,600
48 hours tops.

125
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
So...

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,260
whatever we're dealing with is aggressive and fast.

127
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,460
Initial contact to full-blown disease

128
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,360
followed by death in a matter of days.

129
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,400
That's the good news.

130
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,830
Take a closer look.

131
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,060
Oh, that's incredible.

132
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,600
It's behaving like a hemorrhagic fever.

133
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Exactly.

134
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
That sounds

135
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,100
really bad.

136
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,460
Well, only if you categorize extensive bleeding

137
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,630
into the skin, mucous membranes,

138
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,160
and gastrointestinal tract,

139
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,300
followed by heart failure, pulmonary edema,

140
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,800
and an agonizingly painful death

141
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,030
as bad...

142
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,400
Definitely bad.

143
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,260
What are you thinking?

144
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,300
Well, if we're knee deep in the Congo rain forest,

145
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,500
I'd posit Shigellosis, Marburg virus, even Ebola,

146
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,530
but Pittsburgh doesn't have the same exotic palette.

147
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,400
It has to be something else.

148
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,500
Like maybe a cave full

149
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,230
of ancient, disease-riddled corpses?

150
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,530
Rachel, you may just have something.

151
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,530
I was sort of kidding.

152
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,130
No, I didn't mean about the corpses.

153
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,760
No biological contagium could survive 200 years

154
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,630
without subzero suspension,

155
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,460
but the cave itself,

156
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,400
- now, that's a different story. - You're saying

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,830
the cave is sick?

158
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,600
Radiation poisoning.

159
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,000
Here? How is that possible?

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,960
In 1984, a worker at the Limerick nuclear power plant

161
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,060
right here in Pennsylvania tested positive

162
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,260
for nuclear exposure,

163
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
but the source wasn't the power plant.

164
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,530
It was his own basement,

165
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,100
where he'd been exposed to very high levels

166
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,160
of radon gas seeping from the natural rock foundation.

167
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,500
The real hazard comes when radon breaks down.

168
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
When inhaled,

169
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,030
the particles get trapped in the lungs

170
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,000
and flood the body with toxic alpha radiations.

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,230
Well, any one of Fisher's coworkers

172
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,660
could become symptomatic.

173
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,330
We need to initiate HazMat protocol,

174
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,900
start looking for air and rock core samples now.

175
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,860
What's going on?

176
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,260
Somebody tell us what's going on.

177
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
I'm going to go introduce myself

178
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,860
to the officer in charge,

179
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,100
get a list of all the quarantined workers.

180
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Top priority.

181
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,400
What's going on?

182
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,660
My people are calibrating the radon sensors right now.

183
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,800
If that cave is contaminated,

184
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,730
we should have confirmation within the hour.

185
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's hope it is radiation.

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,230
At least we'll know what we're dealing with.

187
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,030
Media.

188
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,330
Just what we need.

189
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,500
Oh, great.

190
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,730
The only thing that spreads faster

191
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,100
than a legitimate health crisis

192
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,400
is the panic about one.

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,100
What is the plan for dealing with the media?

194
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,200
Well, lie, of course.

195
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,130
I'm going to let them know

196
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,330
about the emergency preparedness drill

197
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,400
we've been running.

198
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,760
Dr. Hood, radiation levels look normal.

199
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,030
Do you believe this?

200
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,830
Can they even do this?

201
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,100
Is this even legal?

202
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,960
I got to get home.

203
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,860
Ha!

204
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,830
They can't just keep us here all day.

205
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Radon sniffers detected

206
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,630
only minute traces of the gas in the burial cave

207
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,030
but not nearly enough to explain

208
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,830
rapid-onset radiation sickness.

209
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,660
Jacob, did you hear what I said?

210
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,800
We're back to square one.

211
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,030
Deeply embedded pustules...

212
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,430
sharply raised and round in shape.

213
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,960
Extensive blistering, most notably on palms

214
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,330
and soles of feet.

215
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,630
Confluent rash

216
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,800
on face and forearms.

217
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,960
Individually,

218
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,400
those symptomatic manifestations point

219
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,330
to any number of culprits.

220
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,800
But collectively they only point to one.

221
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,660
Smallpox.

222
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,360
Smallpox...

223
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,800
I thought that was wiped out.

224
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,000
The World Health Organization declared

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,800
the disease eradicated in 1979,

226
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,160
but there are still stocks of the virus

227
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,030
the CDC in Atlanta and the, uh...

228
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,000
...State Research Center

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,830
for Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Russia.

230
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,730
How'd it end up in Pittsburgh?

231
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,230
I don't know.

232
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,660
The demolition workers are going to have

233
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,000
to be inoculated,

234
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,400
along with any law enforcement and first responders

235
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,660
who have had direct physical contact.

236
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,160
That includes the three of us.

237
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,100
Is that enough to protect us?

238
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,560
Well, unique strains have,

239
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,060
uh, unpredictable resiliences.

240
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,100
The vaccine has been enhanced

241
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,330
with intranasal boosts

242
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,860
that should protect us from anything airborne,

243
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,500
but direct contact

244
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,260
with infected fluids must be avoided.

245
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,400
Words to live by.

246
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,500
I'm going to notify the hospitals.

247
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,560
It's a waste of time.

248
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,600
There isn't a medical facility

249
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,830
within a hundred miles equipped to deal

250
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,200
with this level of biorisk.

251
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,100
Hemorrhagic smallpox

252
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,360
is the most deadly variation of the virus.

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,800
It's highly infectious

254
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
and efficiently lethal.

255
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,700
So what do we do?

256
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,030
We improvise.

257
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,860
Yo, man, over here!

258
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,700
You got it? Right behind you.

259
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,700
Double the magnification.

260
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
My God... 

261
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,860
The tests were conclusive.

262
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,730
We got ourselves a smallpox outbreak.

263
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,830
A full diagnostic panel's going to take time,

264
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,300
but preliminary mapping indicates genetic materials

265
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,630
from multiple genomes.

266
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,460
A hybrid.

267
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,630
Two viruses mixed together?

268
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,960
Well, the toxin that killed Fisher

269
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,800
was a combination of two distinct

270
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,500
viral strains.

271
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,760
We have to find the source.

272
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,300
Well, the cave is clean.

273
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,560
Wherever Fisher contracted the virus, it wasn't here.

274
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
With every minute that passes,

275
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,330
the likelihood of it spreading...

276
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,000
Have additional victims becoming infected

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
multiplies exponentially.

278
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,700
It's imperative that we determine

279
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,400
exactly where Fisher caught this virus

280
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,830
before this thing

281
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,060
spirals into a full-blown epidemic.

282
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,060
Landlord confirmed our first victim

283
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,460
has rented here for the last five years.

284
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,330
Keep a lookout for calcified scabs

285
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,600
and flakes of skin.

286
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,830
I always do.

287
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
"Christopher Fisher, Christopher Fisher...

288
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,130
Christopher Fisher."

289
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,460
He lived alone.

290
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,200
The only thing his co-workers

291
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
knew was that he was divorced,

292
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,660
and had a daughter in college.

293
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,960
Believe in luck, Rachel?

294
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,360
I'm in Pittsburgh dodging smallpox

295
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,760
for a living.

296
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,400
- How much luckier can a girl get?  - Well...

297
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,930
"Good fortune is the result of careful planning."

298
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,500
It's more of a statement than a karmic prediction.

299
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,000
Whoa.

300
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,130
Can you make this kind of cash

301
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,730
clearing bodies at a demolition site?

302
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,430
I don't know. Maybe he was working two jobs.

303
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,830
He was a mortician.

304
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,360
If he was juggling two jobs,

305
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,960
he might've put the number in speed dial.

306
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,700
Try number four.

307
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,500
Work, ex-wife,

308
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,800
kid's cell, second job.

309
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,130


310
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,630
Jackson and Sons Mortuary.

311
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,930
Your mask.

312
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,800
Hello, Mr. Jackson?

313
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,060
- Yes?  - I'm Jacob Hood.

314
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm part of a team investigating a serious public health matter

315
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
involving your embalmer, Christopher...

316
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,160
- Fisher.  - Fisher.

317
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,430
I'd like you to tell me the names

318
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,800
of everyone he worked with, and every

319
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,100
dead body he worked on.

320
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,530
Today's my son's birthday.

321
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,860
- That's great.  - He's nine-years-old.

322
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,930
We're, you know, throwing him a party.

323
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,700
Check this out.

324
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,330
Look at that.

325
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,030
I am going to destroy you.

326
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,830
You think he'll like it?

327
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,530
Sure, what kid wouldn't?

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,730
I'm not going to make it

329
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,830
to his birthday, am I?

330
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,500
They said we can go home soon.

331
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,900
They're lying.

332
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,630
Keep us under control.

333
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,800
The government's not going to help us.

334
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,730
Even if they try, they'll screw it up.

335
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,660
Oh...

336
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,230
We're on our own here.

337
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,930
Come this way.

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
Just leave all your

339
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
personal belongings right there.

340
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,560
Hazmat's doing a full sweep of the funeral home.

341
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,900
Rigdon's waiting to brief us

342
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,530
on the status here.

343
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,700
What's up?

344
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,530
How many workers do you count?

345
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,460
According to the foreman's report, there should be 21.

346
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,960
I count 20.

347
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,160
Ned?

348
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,300
Cathy!

349
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,660
It's after 3:00. I've been calling

350
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,800
your cell for hours.

351
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,460
- They took it.  - What do you mean?

352
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,160
- Who took it?  - It doesn't matter.

353
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,260
Cathy, just listen to me.

354
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,800
Something happened.

355
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,900
You promised John you would be home for his party.

356
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,530
There isn't going to be a party.

357
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,230
Cancel it and start packing.

358
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,600
We have to get the kids out of here.

359
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,960
What are you talking about?

360
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,700
Ned, you're scaring me.

361
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,830
Please!

362
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,060
Cathy, just do it!

363
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,560
What are you doing?

364
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,900
What?

365
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,330
You...

366
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,830
You can't keep me locked up.

367
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,130
I haven't done anything wrong.

368
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,200
No, but you're about to.

369
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,030
Ned!

370
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,130
You've been exposed

371
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,760
to a very dangerous, highly contagious virus.

372
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,560
I want to see my family.

373
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,030
I want to see my kids.

374
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,660
I know you want to keep your family safe.

375
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,430
You want to protect them from danger.

376
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,600
Ned!

377
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,100
Ned, listen to me.

378
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,660
You are the danger.

379
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,730
Where are you keeping my husband? Explain to me... Ned!

380
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,860
- Ned!  - Daddy!

381
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,960
Hey, John.

382
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Wait, wait! Ned!

383
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,000
Hey, buddy...

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,330
This way, please.

385
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,830
I got something for your birthday.

386
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,630
Daddy.

387
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,830
You go with these people now, son.

388
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,460
I'll catch up with you later.

389
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,200
- No! No!  - It's okay.

390
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,260
Come on, honey.

391
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,530
You'll see your dad later, okay?

392
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,000
They won't even remember me.

393
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
They will, Ned.

394
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,800
I promise. 

395
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,400
We caught a break.

396
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
Ned Warner's rash hasn't progressed

397
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,330
beyond the macule phase.

398
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,530
So it's still in the early stages?

399
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,960
When it's least contagious.

400
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,830
That makes it highly unlikely he infected anyone else

401
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,830
on his way home.

402
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,230
- Records from the funeral parlor.  - We'll find out

403
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,060
which corpse infected Christopher Fisher.

404
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,930
I'll oversee the decontamination

405
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,930
in Ned's apartment.

406
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,030
These are the people

407
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,430
Christopher Fisher embalmed

408
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,430
during the likely period. Susan Crane,

409
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,760
retired civil servant, 72, cause of death, pneumonia.

410
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
Gary Firth, doctor,

411
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,700
45, stomach cancer.

412
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,500
Jack Ruddock, maintenance engineer, 56,

413
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,600
industrial accident in a cold storage facility.

414
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,860
My money's on the doctor.

415
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,100
The man dealt with disease for a living.

416
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,260
You just lost your money.

417
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,030
Domesticated species

418
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,600
lack a certain glycoprotein the virus needs

419
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
- in order to replicate.  - Excuse me?

420
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
The doctor was a veterinarian.

421
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,900
- You could've just said so.  - Even vets

422
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,060
are familiar with medical safety protocol, so let's focus

423
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,760
on the other two candidates.

424
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,230
We need a full background check, dietary history,

425
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,030
family illness, any recent travel out of the country.

426
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,700
Who goes first?

427
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,800
The woman who died of pneumonia, or the guy

428
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,230
who died in the accident at the cold storage facility?

429
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,900
When in doubt, always use the scientific method.

430
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,030
Heads or tails?

431
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,800
Yeah, we can provide pickup service.

432
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,900
Give me your address.

433
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,400
Mr. Pulido?

434
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,660
Can you hold on a sec?

435
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,930
Yeah?

436
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,630
I'm your man.

437
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,530
You looking for some cold storage?

438
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,160
We're here about your dead maintenance man.

439
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,330
Jack Ruddock.

440
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,860
I'm going to have to call you back.

441
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,830
30,000 square feet kept at a constant 25 below.

442
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,660
We're the largest public refrigeration facility

443
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,330
east of the Allegheny.

444
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,360
All the big companies and universities

445
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,160
store their perishables here.

446
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,200
What exactly are they storing?

447
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,300
Ice cream to rocket fuel.

448
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,830
You name it, we got it in popsicle form.

449
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,760
That's giant bluefin from the Gulf of Maine.

450
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,730
Over there, we got CO2 pellets

451
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,560
for industrial blast cleaning.

452
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,360
And those, ice cores from the South Pole.

453
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,100
From Penn's Antarctic survey.

454
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,360
Hey!

455
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,800
You can't be back there!

456
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,660
Is this where Jack Ruddock had his accident?

457
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,360
Yeah. He was fixing

458
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,530
the refrigeration unit and he fell.

459
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,400
OSHA's already cleared us.

460
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,700
Do you know if he'd been out of the country recently?

461
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,860
Jack?

462
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,160
Nah, Jersey was a foreign country

463
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,430
as far as he was concerned.

464
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,360
Look, I've got to take this.

465
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,730
Just stop by my office, let me know when you're done.

466
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,900
Why does it matter

467
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,360
if the victims left the country?

468
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,100
Fisher is patient zero in this country

469
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,460
because of our reporting system,

470
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,530
but some countries don't have one.

471
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,030
And some countries wouldn't even tell us if they did have a case.

472
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,660
Any chance they were in Latin America?

473
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,460
I want to know

474
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,700
the villages in Guatemala they came from

475
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,360
and exactly how long they've been in the country.

476
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,730
How the hell should I know? 

477
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,730
Hood, here. 

478
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,430
Pathology's back on Fisher.

479
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,760
Tests were conclusive.

480
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,260
It's definitely a hybrid form of variola major.

481
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,160
Smallpox mixed with another virus.

482
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,330
I told the CDC this would happen eventually.

483
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,400
That we had to be more aggressive with our research.

484
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,560
But what do they do?

485
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,330
They restrict my work. They slashed my funding!

486
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,500
Cal, I know you're frustrated,

487
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,900
but I need you to concentrate.

488
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,960
We have to establish this strain's origin.

489
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,730
It came from Central America, obviously.

490
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,160
Something new. Something manmade.

491
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,230
What did the lab report say it was mixed with?

492
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,960
An adenovirus, serotype 14.

493
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
That's a respiratory virus.

494
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,760
Is that combination even possible?

495
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,160
In virology, almost anything is possible.

496
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,530


497
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,860
Sorry, I cannot help you translate.

498
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,130
That's not Spanish they're speaking.

499
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,800
Then what is it?

500
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Best guess? Garifuna. 

501
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,060
It's one of at least 20 Mayan dialects

502
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,460
spoken in Guatemala.

503
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,600
Great.

504
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,330
Does anybody understand what I'm saying?

505
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,930
Comprehend?

506
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,200
Your fly is down.

507
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,460
Your coworker Jack had a bad infection when he died.

508
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,400
There's a good chance he picked it up

509
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,560
working here.

510
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,930
We need to know how.

511
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,230
Her brother

512
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,730
arrived in the city last week.

513
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,560
He stayed inside because he was too sick to work.

514
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,430
Says he had a fever and a rash.

515
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,060
What else?

516
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,100
Her village back home.

517
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,430
There were sick people there, too.

518
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,430
How many?

519
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,860
Everybody.

520
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,660
Don't touch anything.

521
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,960
Rachel, don't touch him!

522
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,400
Everyone, stay away from this man and wowon.

523
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,430
Folks, stay back, please.

524
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,460
What?

525
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,860
They may both be very sick.

526
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,330
How much protection does vaccine give Rachel?

527
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,230
Well, hybrid strains are notoriously resilient.

528
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,600
And given so many unknown variables,

529
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,200
timing, antibody count...

530
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
20%, give or take.

531
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,530
What about Xicalal, the Guatemalan village?

532
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,730
Oh, we contacted the Guatemalan Red Cross

533
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,400
and the Pan American Health Organization.

534
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,860
The place is being quarantined,

535
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,700
so, we squashed a bug, Jacob.

536
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,960
- It's over.  - Cal,

537
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,530
as long as Rachel and those people are at risk,

538
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,800
it is far from over.

539
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,930
Rachel's a hero, Jacob.

540
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,160
Whatever happens next, we must never forget that.

541
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,530
I want everybody's name when this is over!

542
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,860
Payback's a bitch!

543
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,800
You looking for something, Professor?

544
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,730
Rachel.

545
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,800
I'm sorry.

546
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
For what?

547
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,300
You did what you had to do.

548
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,500
Is that Ned?

549
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,730
No.

550
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,630
It's one of the other workers.

551
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,660
Ned's hanging on for now.

552
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,160
How many have died?

553
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,100
Hood,

554
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,060
how many?

555
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,660
Six.

556
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,760
We think their viral loads

557
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,430
overwhelmed the vaccine.

558
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,460
Maybe if we got to them

559
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,930
earlier.

560
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,260
Do you have the number?

561
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,600
Rachel.

562
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,060
Do you have it?

563
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,900
Yeah, I have it.

564
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,500
I want you to make the call.

565
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,400
Tell the bureau that your handler's been compromised.

566
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Tell them to send a replacement immediately.

567
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,830
Rachel,

568
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,230
I don't want a replacement.

569
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,800
I don't care what you want. You're my responsibility.

570
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,360
You get some rest.

571
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,230
I got things I need to do.

572
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,400
Hood!

573
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,700
Make the call!

574
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,230
Do you hear me?

575
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,130
Hood, I am serious!

576
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,260
It doesn't add up, Calvert.

577
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,330
What?

578
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,330
That apartment can't be ground zero.

579
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,060
The timing's all wrong.

580
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,230
The Guatemalan patients are only now present in symptoms.

581
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,760
That's a full 12 hours after Christopher Fisher died.

582
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,330
Well, not everyone suffers at the same rate.

583
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,500
Viruses react with their specific variabilities.

584
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,730
Even if the illegals are not showing all the symptoms yet,

585
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,200
they may all be dead by morning.

586
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,430
So, we should write them off?

587
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,100
The way you wrote off the demolition workers?

588
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,460
I was being realistic.

589
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
I want Rachel removed

590
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,800
from general quarantine.

591
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,260
Until we have confirmation

592
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,430
of infection,

593
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,860
protocol dictates she be in private isolation.

594
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,830
We simply don't have another level three facility

595
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,460
available for that approach.

596
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,200
The rules apply to everyone, Jacob.

597
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,460
Even the people we care about most.

598
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,760
It's not fair.

599
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
It's just the way it is.

600
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,130
Until the blood work comes back

601
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,000
on the Guatemalan carrier, Rachel stays where she is.

602
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,230
Cath?

603
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,300
Is that you?

604
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,700
Cathy? Cath...

605
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,030
Cath.

606
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,330
Shh.

607
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,830
Shh.

608
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,230
I'm right here.

609
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,200
Oh.

610
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
I feel bad.

611
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
It's okay.

612
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,800
We all do.

613
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,460
No.

614
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,430
I don't mean that.

615
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,430
I feel bad because I'm leaving it all on you.

616
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,860
I won't be here to help.

617
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,930
You know, with the kids.

618
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,400
Yes, you will... Ned.

619
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,900
You just have to hang in there.

620
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,130
Yeah.

621
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,830
Everything's gonna be okay.

622
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,800
Yeah.

623
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,530
This is the dead Guatemalan's blood sample.

624
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,000
So what we're looking for is the variola virus.

625
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,160
Shaped like a brick

626
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,260
with a surface like a ball of wool.

627
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,260
You've seen it before?

628
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,500
Only in books.

629
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,500
In 1979, when smallpox was eradicated,

630
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,360
the WHO had most of the live lab cultures destroyed.

631
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Since then, scientists have had

632
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,030
to rely on computer simulations only.

633
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,030
You said the smallpox virus was brick-shaped.

634
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,760
That looked spherical.

635
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,930
Wait a minute.

636
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,560
Rachel?!

637
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,100
Get Agent Young out of there now!

638
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,130
- What? What are you doing?  - He was wrong.

639
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,330
- Who?  - Rigdon. The man you touched...

640
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,560
he didn't have smallpox. He had chickenpox.

641
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,100
Chickenpox?

642
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,930
I had chickenpox when I was five years old.

643
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,460
That means you don't have it now.

644
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,560
Somebody get me out of this damn thing now!

645
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,630
I wish I could cheer, but

646
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,760
right now, we're 12 hours into an outbreak

647
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,330
of the variola virus,

648
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,800
and we're no closer to identifying the source.

649
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,160
Excuse me.

650
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,960
Variola means smallpox?

651
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,630
Yeah. Why?

652
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,730
Customers rent the space by the pallet.

653
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,500
Nobody asks any questions as long as the check clears.

654
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,860
Ice cores from the south pole.

655
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,930
Yeah, but ice cores

656
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,230
are only viable in their original virgin state.

657
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,830
These cores have been melted and refrozen.

658
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,360
So, this isn't virgin ice?

659
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,600
Not even close.

660
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
There...

661
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
567 alpha.

662
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,860
Frozen water doesn't lie, Manny.

663
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,860
How about you?

664
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,960
You have any idea

665
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,200
what's at stake here?

666
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,760
Jack screwed up the repairs on the fan.

667
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,930
Fried the motor.

668
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,960
He and Pulido,

669
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,030
they stayed late one night

670
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,530
to move the crates to another area

671
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,560
so everything wouldn't spoil.

672
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,930
Their jobs were on the line.

673
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,830
- You're not gonna open that, are you?  - Don't worry

674
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,860
Anything viral would be benign at this temperature

675
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,960
Don't blame me if something

676
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,230
leaps out and eats your face.

677
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,060
Well, that would have been better than this.

678
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,860
The samples were gone.

679
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Pulido's gone.

680
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,730
He's taken the variola samples

681
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,060
with him.

682
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,400
Police and Hazmat have the city locked down.

683
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,560
They'll find him. The question is,

684
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,800
how many innocent people

685
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,360
will he infect before they do?

686
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,530
What are you doing?

687
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,730
Getting directions.

688
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,400
Pulido searched the 'Net for the quickest route

689
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
from here to the intersection

690
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,230
of Fourth and Grant street

691
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,730
15 minutes ago.

692
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,630
Pull over, sir, so we can search your vehicle.

693
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,760
Turn off your engine.

694
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,300
License and registration, please.

695
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,230
Pulido?

696
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,130
Sorry to disappoint you, Professor.

697
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,630
You knew

698
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,960
that immigrant boy wasn't our source,didn't you?

699
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,130
The virus

700
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,300
couldn't have come from Central America

701
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,400
because it was from your laboratory, wasn't it?

702
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,830
I wasn't sure at first, Jacob

703
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,860
You got to believe me.

704
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,560
But when it turned out to be Adeno 14...

705
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,230
I-I knew it had to be one of mine.

706
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,230
It was an accident.

707
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,630
An accident waiting to happen.

708
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,460
How could you store

709
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,500
a deadly hybrid smallpox virus

710
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,530
in a commercial facility?

711
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,030
If it wasn't my strain that got out

712
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,730
- it would've been someone else's.  - Are you listening

713
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,230
to yourself, Calvert?

714
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,900
You've killed six people.

715
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,260
You put the lives of an entire city at risk.

716
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,600
How dare you try to rationalization that to me!

717
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,430
We live in dangerous times!

718
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,330
And mankind has got to come up with better vaccines,

719
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,460
more powerful treatments.

720
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,860
That can't be accomplished

721
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,530
using computer simulations

722
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,160
and theoretical models alone, you know that!

723
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,500
Who are you trying to convince?

724
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,530
Me?

725
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,000
Or you?

726
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,900
Was it Pulido's idea to move the samples

727
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,560
or yours?

728
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,800
When we rounded up his workers

729
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,230
he realized what was in the cooler.

730
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,400
Demanded $75,000 for it.

731
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,460
I was going to pay him,

732
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,130
and I was going to destroy everything

733
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,660
I made a careless mistake Jacob

734
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,930
Eventually you're going to make one, too.

735
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,460
It happens to everyone

736
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,460
who carries our kind of weight.

737
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,300
You'll understand one day.

738
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,760
Are you going to have her arrest me now?

739
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,000
Not yet.

740
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,960
First you have a job to do.

741
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,660
I want you to call your emergency response team,

742
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,430
get them down here right now

743
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,060
and you'll help clean this up, Calvert.

744
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,630
You'll help clean this up.

745
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,160
I'm sorry Jacob

746
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,700
Hood.

747
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,530
Can't let him get away. I wasn't planning on it.

748
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,900
Pulido!

749
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,800
Stay where you are!

750
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,430
Don't make things worse!

751
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,130
Pulido!

752
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,300
Pulido!

753
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,860
FBI.

754
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,430
- Everyone, stay where you are  - Mr. Pulido,

755
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,300
don't touch anyone.

756
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
You're infected with the virus

757
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,230
Right now, there's a

758
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,460
microscopic army waging war inside of you

759
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,230
It's gonna invade your blood stream

760
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,000
attack your central nervous system

761
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,160
and destroy every healthy cell inside

762
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,130
of you until there's nothing left

763
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,230
No, I got the vaccine

764
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,400
Too late to be effective... you and Jack

765
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,200
were infected the night you moved the boxes

766
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,560
No Jack wasn't sick

767
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,060
He fell and broke his neck

768
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,230
He was the lucky one

769
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,030
On the floor

770
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,960
- Now Mr. Pulido or I'll shoot.  - Hey you stay away from me.

771
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,860
You need medical assistance, Alan.

772
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,230
I need my money.

773
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,560
Listen to yourself.

774
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,730
You're not making sense.

775
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,600
It's the virus... it's affecting your brain.

776
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,660
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna 

777
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,700
ask you to gently, quietly

778
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,800
leave the premises.

779
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,560
No, no,no, no!

780
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,430
Nobody goes anywhere until I get my damn money!

781
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,260
Listen to me. I want my money!

782
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,660
Listen to me, no amount

783
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,100
of money in the world is gonna stop this disease

784
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,430
that's raging inside of you,

785
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,200
but you might be able to stop it

786
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,430
hurting other people.

787
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,730
Now, if you stay here,

788
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,430
you are issuing a death sentence

789
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,060
to every innocent person in this room.

790
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,930
Do you understand that?

791
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,000
I don't care.

792
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,100
I will shoot.

793
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,060
Don't open it.

794
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
There's one al missing.

795
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,460
It's done, Jacob.

796
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,800
Oh, Cal.

797
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,160
I ran into an old colleague the other day.

798
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,500
He's doing really well.

799
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,560
It made me so jealous, I could taste it.

800
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
And then, last night,

801
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,330
sitting in that damn plastic tent, helpless,

802
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,060
I thinking I was gonna die...

803
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,260
made me question this assignment...

804
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,460
what I do for a living...

805
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,560
everything.

806
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
And...?

807
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,230
And...

808
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,900
you're a major pain in the ass.

809
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,560
But you also do a lot of good.

810
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,100
I'm gonna see this through,

811
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,730
make everyone else jealous of me.

812
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,030
Mom, Mom!

813
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,100
That robot was designed by a NASA engineer.

814
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,000
It's got artificial intelligence,

815
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,430
seven servo motors.

816
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,800
It dances, it snores.

817
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,200
It even does little electric farts.

818
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,630
That was a really cool thing you just did

819
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,800
Not really

820
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,900
I also got one for myself

821
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,300
Energy restored
