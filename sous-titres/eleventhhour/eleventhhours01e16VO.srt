1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,300
42-year-old male,
showed up

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,100
at the law office this morning,
fine until he began

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,400
complaining of a foul taste
in his mouth and feeling dizzy.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,000
-Bad taste in his mouth?
-Right before the dizziness.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
So he goes to get a drink
of water, and ten minutes later,

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,500
he's on the floor
of the men's room.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,500
He stopped breathing.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,800
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font> 

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,000
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@´ó±¦
Sync:FRS@33</font>

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Apparently, she started
complaining

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,700
about some sort
of bad taste in her mouth.

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,100
Then she started getting dizzy,
and I'm thinking

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,700
it's maybe some sort of poison?

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,700
This is like classic
"SLUDGE" syndrome.

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,400
Hey, take her back.

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,500
I'll check the
poisons index.

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Checking symptoms
right now.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm connecting
to the poisons index.

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,500
Symptoms include
salivation...

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,400
Lacrimation...

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,000
With loss of bladder and bowel control.

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,600
Hey, we got
a poison cluster here!

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000
No question about it. 

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
  Test came back positive 
  for anthrax. 

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,900
  It's the real thing. 

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,300
An entire school
for rock musicians.

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,200
My dad would
have an aneurysm.

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
He used to yell at
Bon Jovi on the TV.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,200
Well, he'd have
loved Beethoven.

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,900
Long hair, dressed like a tramp.

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,100
Loved to throw food
and trash furniture.

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,400
Has no one been back
here since, uh...

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,900
-since they
evacuated?
-No.

34
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,700
Uh, not here,
not the victim's home,

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,500
his workplace, or the bus

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,600
he rode to work
this morning.

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,700
Yeah, well,
an anthrax scare will do that.

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,300
Well, we're five miles away
from the White House.

39
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,500
You can't blame Homeland
Security for getting jumpy.

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,700
Speaking of which,
shouldn't we have masks on?

41
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,600
If you like.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Hood!

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Look, a friend of mine is
a world expert on the Ebola virus.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,900
And, uh, they
flew in a patient--

45
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,600
chartered aircraft,
private airstrip,

46
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,900
whole runway
under quarantine.

47
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,000
The crew were wearing
full-body spacesuits.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,900
She met them
at the airport,wearing street clothes

49
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,000
and a pair of kitchen gloves.

50
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,000
Disease is not the weapon.

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,500
Fear is the weapon.

52
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,000
You know
there's a band called Anthrax.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,100
I'm more of a Cradle
of Filth man, myself.

54
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,800
You're joking, right?

55
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,700
You see this?

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,600
The students repair
their own instruments.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,500
So...?

58
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
-Dr. Hood?
-Agent Young?

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Special Agent In Charge,
Joe Brennan.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm, uh, leading this case for the Joint
Terrorism Task Force.

61
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm the one who called you in
for the science consult.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,300
Hmm.

63
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
Word at the Bureau
is that, uh,

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
you have yet to be stumped.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, uh, your perfect record going to remain intact?

66
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm not really one
for statistics.

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,000
Can you tell me,

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
is your, um, anthrax victim
a drummer?

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,700
Yeah. Yeah, he was.
Uh, how did you know that?

70
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,700
Well, anthrax is caused by a bacterium
that lives on, uh,

71
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,000
grazing animals,
and these, um...

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
These drums are covered in...

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,100
...goat skin.

74
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,500
You see, if you scrape off an infected skin
to replace it,

75
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,700
chances are, you're going
to inhale some of the spores.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,300
That's why imported skins
are inspected and licensed.

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
I suspect the person
you need to find is the person

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
that made this drum,

79
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
because he used a hide
that was not inspected.

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
So we're safe here?

81
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
As long as you promise me

82
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,500
you're not going
to play the drums.

83
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm sorry, Agent Brennan,
but, uh, I'm going to have

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
to take Dr. Hood
to Philadelphia.

85
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,700
Yeah. No problem.

86
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,700
I'll have the, uh,lab boys remove this drum
right away.

87
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,600
So, what's in
Philadelphia?

88
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,600
Trouble.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You ever hear of the Toxic
Exposure Surillance System?

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah. It's a real-time
database of poison victims.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,300
They keep a
track of events

92
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,600
that cluster in
time and location.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,900
Well, that was Felix
on the phone.

94
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,300
They flagged a pattern
just under two hours ago.

95
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,300
People dropping
all over Philadelphia with identical symptoms.

96
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,600
The mystery lies
in the timing

97
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,300
and the complete absence of any
connection between the victims.

98
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,000
And we don't believe
in coincidences, do we?

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Well, to quote
Mr. Ian Fleming,

100
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,100
"Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

101
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,700
"The third time,
it's enemy action."

102
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Happenstance?
Is that even a word?

103
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,300
@@@You are...

104
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,500
You are a loud one.

105
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,800
Hey, Mrs. Wilson.

106
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,500
Hey, is anything wrong?

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,500
I-I was fine when I left
the house this morning.

108
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,200
I had to stop and sit down.

109
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,300
I've got a taste
like I ate something bad.

110
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,600
Why don't you go home
if you don't feel good?

111
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Oh, no. I'd
rather be here.

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,800
I'm not one of those people who live alone
because they like it.

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,500
Oh, here, let me
take that, honey.

114
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,900
-Oh, you sure?
-Yeah.

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,000
The Sanduskys are
coming into town today,

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
picking up
Otis at 3:00,

117
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,400
so I'm going to get
him ready to go home.

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,700
He's gonna miss Winston
when he leaves.

119
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,300
That's for sure.

120
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,000
You should have seen the
noise these two were making

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,300
this morning when
they were playing.

122
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,100
Yes. Isn't that...

123
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Mrs. Wilson!
Mrs. Wilson!
Mrs. Wilson!Somebody help!

124
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
I'm thinking organophosphate poisoning.

125
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm treating with atropine
and PAM-2 chloride.

126
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,700
Now, my first thought was
it might be some kind

127
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,400
of nerve agent,
but it's way too slow.

128
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,100
Which branch of the military
did you serve in, Dr. Lieber?

129
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,500
The Army. Who told you?

130
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Nerve agent would never be a civilian doctor's
first diagnosis.

131
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,100
Well, I don't know
of any nerve agent that makes a patient explode.

132
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,300
Technically, it was a
fireball, not an explosion.

133
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,100
But you're right.

134
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,600
Five new cases, including
the exploding woman.

135
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
They all live in
different parts of town,

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,700
and they all work in
different parts of town.

137
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
They all dropped in
different parts of town.

138
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,000
If there is a link,
it hasn't shown up yet.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,300
Can we talk to any of them?

140
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, not if they're all
intubated and sedated like mine.

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,300
Okay, let's, uh, put everything
together and see what we've got.

142
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
You-You can't move them.
Not the people.

143
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,000
Just the clothes and effects.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,300
Get a hold of Felix.

145
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,500
Tell him to collect everything,
see if he can find

146
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,300
somewhere close by
where we can work.

147
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,100
Got it.

148
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Who is he?

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Agent Lee, advance
scouting and support.

150
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
No. Him.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You know, there's that moment

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
at the beginning
of every disaster

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,400
when it's like a genie
flying out of a bottle.

154
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,000
You get one chance
to grab it by its neck

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
before it's out of reach
and out of control.

156
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,300
He's the guy who does that.

157
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,500
SLUDGE.

158
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,500
Go ahead and curse
for real, Hood.

159
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,200
It helps.
Just let it out.

160
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,400
I've heard worse.

161
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,200
It's hilarious.

162
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,300
That's an acronym
for the symptoms.

163
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,100
Salivation,

164
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,700
lacrimation,
urination, diarrhea.

165
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,500
Okay, I get it.

166
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,000
All the patients are
affected the same way.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I mean, organophosphate
poisoning's not uncommon.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,100
It comes from exposure
to pesticides or fertilizer.

169
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,000
But it's usually chronic
and low dose.

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's not acute.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
And not five cases all at once.

172
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,300
No. So, the
question is, why

173
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,700
would all these victims
be exposed to a high dose?

174
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,700
Sarin gas, maybe?

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, well, that's the right
kind of thinking,

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,100
'cause it does affect
the, uh, central nervous system,

177
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,100
but I think the doctor's right.

178
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,700
It's too slow-acting
to be a nerve agent.

179
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Maybe there's some other way

180
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,500
the poison could be weaponized.

181
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,800
Or maybe it was just
an accidental release.

182
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,200
We have to get more facts
before we can make a picture.

183
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,300
I was prepping to
work onsite security

184
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,000
for the big G-8
summit in D.C.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
when I got the
call about this.

186
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,100
I was really hoping I
could meet the president.

187
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm sure he'll be disappointed.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,200
The G-8's this week?

189
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,900
Don't you watch the news?

190
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,600
Only when
there's no cartoons on.

191
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,300
All right, then.
Each bag contains

192
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,200
the clothes and effects
of one patient.

193
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
You used gloves to
handle everything?

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, just like you said.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, if it is poison,

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,700
there could be some traces
on the clothes.

197
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,200
If it was poison, shouldn't the
blood tests have picked that up?

198
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,300
You test for specific things.
It's like a Catch 22.

199
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,200
You need to have an idea
of what you're looking for

200
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,500
so you can choose
the right test to find it.

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,400
Yeah, well, in this case,

202
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,800
um, it could be any number
of factors.

203
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,100
Snake venom, uh, pesticides.

204
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,400
Even some of the new,
uh, Alzheimer's drugs,in high enough doses.

205
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,600
Do any of those things ever cause a person to explode?

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, not really.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,500
It could be something new.

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
You need anything else?

209
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,600
yeah, a map.

210
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,000
Of?

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
Philadelphia, suburbs.

212
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm on it.

213
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey, Felix, nice work
collecting up all the evidence

214
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
and improvising a work space
so quickly.

215
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,400
Maybe next time...

216
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,000
Hey, Felix?

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,700
Nice work.

218
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
You know, back
in the '90s,

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I heard of, uh, certain
governments who'd try

220
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,600
to take down their enemies
by using poisoned clothing.

221
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,000
That's one designer label
you'd want to avoid.

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There was one who was
a civil rights worker,European lady.

223
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
Checked into this
big corporate hotel,

224
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,600
and there was this
pretty fancy bathrobe

225
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,300
waiting for her
in her closet.

226
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,500
So, she puts it on, wears
it for about an hour,

227
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,000
and she nearly died.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Did she explode?

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No. Most deaths
from acute O.P. poisoning, um,

230
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,600
happen
through muscle paralysis.

231
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,500
Nice.

232
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,400
Yeah, everything
closes up,

233
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,100
and you end up asphyxiating,
but even

234
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,800
a small amount is
enough to damage you for life.

235
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,300
So even if our victims respond
to treatment,

236
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,600
they could still
wind up damaged?

237
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah. We have to get on top
of this pretty quickly.

238
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The sooner we find
out what's happening,

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,100
the sooner we can help them.

240
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,400
This is Rachel.

241
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,100
Thanks for letting us know.

242
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Mrs. Wilson--
the fireball victim--

243
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,300
she just died.

244
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Well, I hate to say it,
but with 80% burns,

245
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,400
her chances were
never very good.

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,500
Now...

247
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
I guess we better start
looking through their stuff,

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,700
see what kind of
picture emerges.

249
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,900
Who lived where,

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,100
who was married,

251
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,400
who used nicotine gum.

252
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,200
Does leave a bad taste
in your mouth.

253
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,500
Yeah, what we're looking for
really is, uh,

254
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,100
things the victims had
in common.

255
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,400
A place, a habit,
guilty secret.

256
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,700
That's the kind of thing 
that's going to help us find our poison.

257
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,400
Okay.

258
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,200
Mrs. Wilson was a widow on a fixed income.

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Brown eyes, organ donor,

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
member of the
Philadelphia Free Library,

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,100
and she worked part-time
at a doggy day care.

262
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,700
Hood.

263
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,100
It's nothing.

264
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Whatever caused the fireball
was consumed in the flames.

265
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,300
Okay, Ames,
let's go over the agenda.

266
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,300
First we pick up your poor
sick brother from school,

267
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,100
then we get to go to work
with Mommy.

268
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
-Cool.
-And we get to
ride the train.

269
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,400
And guess what?

270
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,200
You might get to watch the movie
with the other kids today.

271
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Awesome.

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,700
I need your cell phones, 

273
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,900
your wallets,

274
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,500
and the Medic Alert bracelet.

275
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,600
Anything they can use to identify you.

276
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,200
Does anyone have
a 20 on Andre?

277
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,700
Okay, if he's not
here in 15 minutes,

278
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,000
we go without him.

279
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,700
You know, what we're
about to do...

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,300
demands absolute
discipline.

281
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,200
Does everyone understand that?

282
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,300
'Cause any deviation
from the plan

283
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,500
will not be tolerated...

284
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,400
and will be dealt with by me...

285
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,900
putting a bullet into your head.

286
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,000
Now, if anyone is feeling nervous,
having second thoughts,

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,800
if anyone wants
to back out...

288
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
sorry, it's too damn late.

289
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Okay, 986 River Street and 74 West Norwich.

290
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,400
Norwich.

291
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,700
856 North
Columbus

292
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,300
and 2843 Eureka Terrace.

293
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Eureka.

294
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Last one
woke up at 8209 Cyers Lane

295
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,700
and went down at 4413
East 61st Street.

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
I love Post-its.

297
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,100
One of the best inventions
of the 20th century.

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,100
What do you
think, Hood?

299
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Yeah, I, I kind of like the fact 
that you can stick them onto anything.

300
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,800
@@@

301
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
About this.

302
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,100
Oh... yeah.

303
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,100
The yellow flags are the victims' homes,
and the red ones show the places wherthey fell.

304
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,600
No pattern.

305
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,600
Exactly.

306
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,200
No pattern
can be, uh...

307
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
quite significant.

308
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,100
Sometimes it's
a matter of...

309
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,100
looking for what isn't there.

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,200
Anyone see any car keys?

311
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,100
-No.
-No.

312
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,700
Me neither.

313
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,700
Everyone here lived on one end
of town and worked on the other.

314
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,700
So if we, uh,
if we just draw a line

315
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,300
from every home
to every workplace...

316
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
...what do we get?

317
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,500
A messed-up map.

318
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,100
I'll buy you an atlas.

319
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Subways.

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There's more
than one subway pass here.

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And tokens.

322
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,800
Well...

323
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,400
I'll bet that everyone here used
the transit system

324
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,500
at some point in the morning.

325
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,800
They would have passed
each other roundabout here in the center of town.

326
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,400
Oh, wow, City Hall station.

327
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,700
That's the busiest stop on the
whole Philly subway system.

328
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,700
We have to speak to someone who
knows about the Philadelphia...

329
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,500
Let me get that
for you, Doc.

330
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,400
No, I got it.

331
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,300
Call the Philadelphia
Police Department.

332
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,900
Have them alert
the SWAT team.

333
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,000
Can I tell them what
they'll be dealing with?

334
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,600
I don't know yet.
Could be a leak or a spill.

335
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,400
Could be snakes on a train.

336
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,300
Okay, baby doll, Mommy's
got one last thing to do.

337
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,400
Hi, if you're calling
about temporary employment,

338
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
I'm sorry, but we
have everyone we need for the next event,

339
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
but please leave
your name and number

340
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,400
and we'll put
you on our list.

341
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,000
Thank you for calling
the Broad Street Theater.

342
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,400
Great! Bingo!
We're done, baby.

343
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,400
You want to read out the signs
as we pass by?

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Remember, we have
to get off at City Hall.

345
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
This is going to be
such a fun day.

346
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,700
Captain Ashton?

347
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, but you can call me Clark.

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
Hi, I'm Special Agent
Rachel Young.

349
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,300
This is my colleague
Dr. Jacob Hood.

350
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,600
-Hi.
-Dr. Hood,Agent Young.

351
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,000
So, what can I help
the FBI with today?

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,500
We're investigating
several cases

353
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,100
of poisoning in the city
in the last 24 hours.

354
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,300
Only connection
we have

355
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,200
between the victims is
this subway station.

356
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,100
We get close to
60,000 people

357
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,200
through this
station every day,

358
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,300
so if all your victims met,
chances are it was here.

359
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,600
Can we narrow it down?

360
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
That's pretty
much impossible

361
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
with all these trains
and so many ways through.

362
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,200
But nothing weird happened here
today, no incidents?

363
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
No, sir, just a normal day.

364
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,000
Still I'm gonna have to ask you
to evacuate the station, please.

365
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,700
Keep the trains running through,
just don't have them stop.

366
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,200
I can't just do that.

367
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Sure, you can.

368
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,800
You're going to have to
give me some grounds here.

369
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,300
Multiple poison victims
on your watch, Captain Ashton,

370
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,100
and whatever happened to them
happened right here,

371
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,100
so lock
everything down and give Dr. Hood
the cooperation he needs.

372
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,700
Okay?

373
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,400
Full station's
gotta be evacuated...

374
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Now what?
Let's get Felix down here.

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
We need another set of
boots on the ground.

376
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,300
Are you going
to watch the movie?

377
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Are you going
to sing along with the songs?

378
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,500
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,200
City Hall!

380
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,800
Goody.

381
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,700
The 15th
Street and City Hall interchange is temporarily closed.

382
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

383
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,200
All clear, platform one.

384
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
Platform four, all clear.

385
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,100
South lobby has been evacuated.

386
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,500
Rachel?

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,600
Rachel?

388
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,700
-This button to talk.
-Oh, I knew that.

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,500
Rachel?

390
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Can you hear me?

391
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,600
Rachel?

392
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Okay, for the purposes of
our little reenactment-- oh.

393
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Rachel? Sorry.

394
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,100
For the purposes
of our little reenactment,

395
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,100
um, you are going to be
our lawyer Philip Roxner.

396
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,600
Philip's wife says
he left home

397
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,400
at 8:10 for the 8:25 train,
which arrived here at...

398
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Um...
8:54.

399
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
8:54.

400
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
So start walking...

401
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,600
now, please.

402
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Rachel, you follow the signs for
the Market-Frankford Westbound.

403
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Felix.

404
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,900
I can see it coming.

405
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,500
You...are Claudia Spinoza,our second victim.

406
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I knew it.

407
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
You'll be headed to Broad Street

408
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,200
via Lombard South.

409
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Start walking...
now, please.

410
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I am Claudia Spinoza,

411
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
headed to Broad Street
via Lombard,

412
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,700
pushing my way through a dense
and reckless crowd.

413
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,000
What are you trying to do?

414
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Well, I'm trying
to recreate two of the victims' journeys
in real time,

415
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,800
so if their paths cross,
we'll see where.

416
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Then what?

417
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Then we'll...

418
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
look at what happened
on that spot.

419
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,800
They're not
going to meet up.

420
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,500
What about there?

421
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
No. She's way ahead of him.

422
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,300
She'll be gone through there.

423
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,800
She's trying to say something.

424
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Rachel, remember,you can hear me,
but I can't hear you.

425
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,500
Hey, voice of God,
you fold a map like a girl.

426
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,100
But I can read your lips.

427
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,600
Felix.

428
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,700
I can see it coming.

429
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,200
You...are Claudia Spinoza,

430
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,800
I knew it.

431
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,000
You'll be headed to Broad Street
via Lombard South.

432
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Start walking...
now, please.

433
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,200
I am Claudia Spinoza, headed to
Broad Street via Lombard,

434
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,500
pushing my way through a dense
and reckless crowd.

435
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,100
What are you trying to do?

436
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,800
Well, I'm trying to recreate two of
the victims' journeys in real time,

437
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,600
so if their paths cross,
we'll see where.

438
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,500
Then what?

439
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Then we'll...look at what
happened on that spot.

440
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,900
They're not going to meet up.

441
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,400
What about there?

442
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,700
No. She's way ahead of him.
She'll be gone through there.

443
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,600
She's trying to say something.

444
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,600
Rachel, remember, you can
hear me, but I can't hear you.

445
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,400
Hey, voice of God,
you fold a map like a girl.

446
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,600
But I can read your lips.

447
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,400
You lip read?

448
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Hold on.

449
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,600
What if they don't follow
the signs?

450
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,100
Say what?

451
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, normal people-- when they
take the same journey every day,

452
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,400
they learn the short cuts, don't they?

453
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,500
I mean, uh, across the wrong platform,
up the down escalator.

454
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,900
The path they take is called
the desire line.

455
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Felix? Change of plan.

456
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,200
Um, how do you feel about backing up and
going down the left, down that corridor?

457
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,800
Ignore that sign. Go up the
escalator. Make a left.

458
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
Okay, I think we wasted
about 20 seconds doing that.

459
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,700
- Think you can make up the time?
- Yeah

460
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,800
Here we go.

461
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,400
Come on.

462
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,800
Got it. There.

463
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,300
So, that spot...

464
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,800
8:57 this morning.

465
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,400
Young guy with the backpack...
rewind that.

466
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,200
Okay, forward.

467
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Slow it.

468
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,200
- Freeze.
- He just bumped into everybody.

469
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,100
They all got sprayed
with something.

470
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,100
Okay, forward.

471
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,800
Philip, the lawyer...
Mike, the meat packer.

472
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Claudia Spinoza.

473
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,900
And there's our Mrs. Wilson.

474
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,600
Bless her soul.

475
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,300
Can you stay with him?
The guy with the backpack.

476
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,500
- Okay, he's trying to make a call.
- Cell service down here is spotty.

477
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,200
Most phones work on the platforms,
but not in the tunnels.

478
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,800
Next.

479
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,700
- Where'd he go?
- He was right behind that ball guy.

480
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,500
He couldn't have
just disappeared.

481
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:22,000
What turns an organophosphate
from a poison into an explosive?

482
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,600
You talking to me?

483
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,700
No. I'm just...

484
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,200
Sulfur.

485
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,000
Where would, uh, our dog owner,
Mrs. Wilson, encounter sulfur?

486
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,700
My mom puts a piece of rock sulfur
in her little Yorkie's water bowl.

487
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,300
People say it keeps
the fleas away.

488
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,200
- Huh.
- Hood, what?

489
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,700
That's interesting.

490
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,700
What is it?

491
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,200
Felix moves out,
his mother gets a Yorkie.

492
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,600
Hey.

493
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,900
Threw up, huh?

494
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,200
Yeah.

495
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,300
- What did you trade your snack for?
- Nothing.

496
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,800
Darren.

497
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,500
Betty Chong asked me
to share her ice cream.

498
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Ah. And tough guys don't
have milk allergies, huh?

499
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,200
No.

500
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,400
That Betty Chong...
she must be really something.

501
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,400
- Come on.
- Trust me. She is.

502
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,400
Okay, now, right here
is about where you saw him last.

503
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,800
Okay, standing by, Doc.

504
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,100
Losing you from camera...now.

505
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,500
Peekaboo, I see you.
Back on camera, Doc.

506
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,000
Rachel

507
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,800
What's through here?

508
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,900
It's an old fallout shelter.

509
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,500
We use them for storage now.

510
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,300
- I can get through there.
- No.

511
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,400
Can you open this for us?

512
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,800
Rachel. What's this?

513
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,900
One of the old
civil defense rooms.

514
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,300
Please.

515
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,200
It's been here since
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

516
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,700
They used it to store
water... medical supplies.

517
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,900
Whoa, Rachel.

518
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,400
What is it?

519
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,300
Nothing good.

520
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
Dr. Hood is with a hazard team
from the fire department.

521
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,600
We alerted Homeland Security.

522
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,200
We closed a tunnel
and two exits

523
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,500
and are rerouting people
to Dilworth Plaza.

524
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,300
As long as we keep the two contaminated
rooms completely separate from the station,

525
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,400
we should be okay
to reopen.

526
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
Okay, sir.

527
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'll keep you posted.

528
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,300
- The director?
- Yep.

529
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,500
He ask about me? How I'm doing
with the job, anything like that?

530
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,900
Oh, yeah... you were
at the top of his agenda.

531
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,300
Excuse me.

532
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,800
Agent Young.

533
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,500
How am I supposed to know if I'm
doing my job well?

534
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,700
You're still here.

535
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,600
In the canisters are the two
precursors of a binary nerve weapon.

536
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,300
One's an ordinary, uh,
sulfur compound.

537
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,000
The other is a phosphonite
called Agent QL.

538
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,300
You mix those two together, they make
a lot of heat, but they also make, uh,

539
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,200
VX nerve gas.

540
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,300
Now, if the reaction goes out of control,
the whole mess turns into a fireball.

541
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,500
Now, VX nerve gas
was outlawed, uh...

542
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,100
international convention
around '93.

543
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,800
So, how does a kid like that
get his hands on the precursors?

544
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,700
Well, after it was outlawed, there was a lot
of it lying around waiting to be destroyed.

545
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,100
Guess it wasn't that difficult to
get a hold of a canister or two.

546
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,100
As to how and why he got hold of it,
that's not really my department.

547
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,900
Found this
in the John Doe's mouth.

548
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,400
He tried to swallow it.

549
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,500
As he was dying?

550
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,200
He really didn't want us
to find it.

551
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,700
It's a phone number.

552
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,300
If you're calling
about temporary employment,

553
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,400
I'm sorry, but we have everyone
we need for the next event.

554
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,800
But please,
leave your name and number,

555
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,500
and we'll put you on our list.

556
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,400
Thank you for calling...

557
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,900
What kind of suicide bomber
worries about his job prospects?

558
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,200
I don't understand, Hood.

559
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,900
I thought the government destroyed
all our chemical weapons.

560
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,400
They're still working on it.

561
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,100
You know what they did
in the 1960s?

562
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,200
They'd take big old freighters, and
they'd fill them up with VX warheads.

563
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,800
They'd sail them out
in the middle of the sea,

564
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,500
and then they'd sink the entire
boat with the weapons on board.

565
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,300
Dumping all that stuff in the sea...
it sounds like a recipe for making Godzilla.

566
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Yeah. Well, Hedorah.

567
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:49,800
What?

568
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,500
Godzilla was, uh, the product
of atomic radiation.

569
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,400
Hedorah is the pollution monster.

570
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,800
Oh.

571
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,300
You know what? "Hedorah" is
Japanese for "sludge."

572
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,600
Same as the syndrome.

573
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,700
- Salivation, lacrimation...
- Got it.

574
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,600
Ooh.

575
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,200
Bingo.

576
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,800
FBI got a fingerprint match
on our John Doe.

577
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,200
Cross-referenced it
with MI6 and Interpol.

578
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,500
He's a Belgian born exchange student
by the name of Andre Balvaux.

579
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,900
Not on any terrorist
watch lists,

580
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,800
but he was in the Belgian army and
he has a history of mental illness.

581
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,800
Couple of violent episodes.
That's why his prints are on file.

582
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,100
Hello, everyone.

583
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,700
Hi, I'm so sorry
to keep you all waiting.

584
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,400
Really, I apologize.

585
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Please don't worry about it.
Just give me two minutes.

586
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,600
I just have to get my kids
situated, so... come on inside.

587
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,700
Why was Mrs. Wilson was
burned rather than poisoned?

588
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,300
'Cause she was wearing gloves.
Took longer to reach her skin.

589
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,100
When the raw sulfate
she was working with

590
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,400
hit the phosphonite on her
clothing, it's flashpoint.

591
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,900
I don't know why I didn't
think of it earlier.

592
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,300
When it's all so obvious.

593
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,500
Uh

594
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Do you mind?

595
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
- Has that been decontaminated?
- Yes, ma'am.

596
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,200
- We'll get it back to you later.
- Alright.

597
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,800
Voicemail.

598
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,000
Where the hell are you?
We're ready to go.

599
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,500
If we screw this up 'cause there's
only five of us, it's your fault.

600
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,100
He's not alone. He's part of a team.

601
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,200
The number he tried to swallow
is for the Broad Street Theater.

602
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,300
It's a movie house three blocks away.
They do events and things.

603
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,200
Anything special on today?

604
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,300
Family sing-along: Wizard Of Oz.

605
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,000
The subway was never the target.
He was on his way to the target.

606
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,500
Okay, guys. You know the rules.

607
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,200
You don't leave this room unless
it's with me or someone you know.

608
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,600
- Got it?
- Got it.

609
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,700
You better open a window.

610
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,000
He's farting.

611
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,400
I need four volunteers to hand out
song sheets at the doors.

612
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,700
Great. The rest of you will
show people to reserved seating.

613
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
Three-quarters of the theater
tickets are

614
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,000
for general admission,
so it shouldn't get too crazy.

615
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And, also, if anybody gives
you any problems--

616
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,700
the children or any
of the adults--

617
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,600
- Don't try to handle it yourself.
- Time is soon

618
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,100
Come to me.
That's why I'm here.

619
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,700
We have preschoolers coming.
The theater is sold out.

620
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,200
It's going to be a lot
of people.

621
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,800
FBI, ma'am.

622
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,500
Please move your kids quickly
and quietly across the street. Let's go.

623
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,900
- So come down and get yourself sheet.
- Ma'am?

624
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,900
Hello?

625
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
- Are you in charge here?
- Yes, I am.

626
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,900
Special Agent Rachel Young,
with the FBI.

627
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Move! Move!

628
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,000
Ma'am get down!

629
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,900
Ashton's been hit.

630
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,500
Stay here. Don't move.

631
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,400
My kids!

632
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,400
- Freeze! Put your weapons down!
- Don't shoot! I surrender!

633
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,800
Put your weapons down
and hands where I can see them.

634
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,600
Hey! Freeze! Freeze!

635
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,300
Hood, are you ok?

636
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,600
Move in and secure
their weapons.

637
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Put your hands behind your back.

638
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,900
It's okay, guys.

639
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,000
See this?

640
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,400
Your mom send me.

641
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,100
- Make it tight.
- You okay?

642
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,700
No sweat.

643
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,400
How you doing, captain?

644
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,300
- I'm all right.
- Rachel?

645
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,000
I found this. I think it's some kind
of statement to the press.

646
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,300
Extremists...

647
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,700
but not from the Middle East.

648
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,200
European and American converts.
Easier to blend in.

649
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,700
I think the plan was to
take these kids hostage

650
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,700
and release a statement
to the G-8 politicians

651
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,900
demanding the release of all
Holy Warriors in Western custody, or else.

652
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,200
Avoid the high security
of the capital,

653
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,300
go for a soft target
in a nearby town.

654
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,200
Let's go, kids. Let's go.

655
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,000
Oh!

656
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,200
Take me instead.

657
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,300
Why should I do that?

658
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,200
Because I can show you
the way out.

659
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,400
You don't recognize
any of them?

660
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,400
- Uh, no.
- ok, these all to take your statements

661
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,300
Rachel...

662
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,300
Excuse me.

663
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,200
- Yeah?
- So we got three people here,

664
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
we got a body inside. He said five.

665
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,500
- Who did?
- The English guy. On the voicemail.

666
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,800
He said, "If we screw this up

667
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,700
'cause we only had five,
it's your fault."

668
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,400
Felix! Emergency exit.

669
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,900
Yeah

670
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,800
- Stay here!
- Don't go anywhere, I'll be back.

671
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
You think that was smart?

672
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,900
You guys okay?

673
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,100
He's got our mom!

674
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,700
You stay here.

675
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,700
There!

676
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,800
Oh, boy. Where the hell
are they?

677
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,900
Hello?

678
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,700
This is Jacob Hood.

679
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,800
Um, I just wanted to tell you--
whoever you are, it's over.

680
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,600
I'm a Holy Warrior.

681
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,200
It's not over yet.

682
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,800
Holy, really?
How do you work that out? Huh?

683
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,800
You were just trying to kill a lot of
innocent people, innocent children--

684
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,300
just to get the attention of
a bunch of G-8 politicians.

685
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,700
How many innocent Muslim
children have been slaughtered

686
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,200
by those same politicians?

687
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,900
I don't want to debate politics
with you. Just let your hostage go.

688
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,100
When I'm free and clear...not before.

689
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,600
I don't believe you.

690
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
Tough.

691
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,400
FBI-- out of the way!

692
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,500
Get out of here! Move! Move!

693
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,600
- It's on me! It's hot!
- Don't touch it! Don't touch it.

694
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,700
- Stay right here.
- Oh, what are you doing?

695
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
Oh!

696
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,800
Get away! FBI, get away!

697
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,400
Move! Move! FBI! Out of the way! Sorry.

698
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,100
Move! Move!

699
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,400
This is chlorine bleach.
Neutralizes the VX.

700
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,000
- What's that?
- VX nerve gas.

701
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,800
- Oh!
- Don't worry! Close your eyes.

702
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
- This needs to come off.
- Okay.

703
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,000
- No, wait.
- Not over the head. Let me do it.

704
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,300
Drop your weapon!

705
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,500
Move! Move! Move! Clear! Clear! Federal agents!

706
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,800
Move! Move! Clear!

707
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,400
Freeze! Federal agents!
Drop your weapon!

708
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,300
There are two of us covering you
with a five-round revolver.

709
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,000
How many bullets
do you think you have left?

710
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,500
I only need one.

711
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,700
Don't touch him.

712
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,700
So, Agent Young, what's
the protocol here?

713
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,600
Am I supposed to turn
in my weapon or...?

714
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,000
You've never done this before.

715
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,400
Before today I never fired
a shot outside of the range.

716
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,800
How do you feel?

717
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,800
Not exactly sure.

718
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,500
No amount of training can prepare
you for pulling the trigger

719
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,000
that first time
in a real situation.

720
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
It's a heavy
responsibility.

721
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,100
But you saved a lot of lives
today, Felix.

722
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,300
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!

723
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,500
Oh, sweeties!
Oh, hey, come here, honey.

724
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,300
- Oh, I love you.
- We missed you.

725
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,200
I missed you, too.

726
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,800
- Brave woman.
- Yep.

727
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,700
Speaking of brave, Agent Lee
did a hell of a job today.

728
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,000
- Yeah, I noticed. Where were you?
- Very funny.

729
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:20,100
