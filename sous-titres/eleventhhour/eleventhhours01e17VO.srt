00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,700
???

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,700
Hailey, Hailey, over here!
Hailey, Hailey, over here!

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,100
- Smile, smile for us.
- Right here! Hailey. Right here!

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,800
Hi, Hailey, over here!

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,400
Hey, hey, wait, what are you doing?

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
She's mine!

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,900
No! Stop it!???

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,800
???

9
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,300
- Help her!
- Help her!

10
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,100
- Oh, my God,
- what did he do?

11
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,300
Hey, welcome to Fashion Week.

12
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,900
You're looking at one of two sudden
and unexplained violent outbursts

13
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
that took place in the last 24 hours.

14
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
NYPD's Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, Nuclear,

15
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,700
and Explosives Division tested
for airborne toxins, but no luck.

16
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,100
Uh, any connection between
the acts of violence?

17
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Not really.

18
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
Model got her spine snapped
by a security guard,

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,000
and here a photographer
was beating her agent to death

20
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
until the agent decided
to stick a pen in his neck.

21
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,600
- Who is she?
- Hailey Vaughn.

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,300
Hailey Vaughn,

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,600
cover of Vogue,Sports
Illustrated Swimsuit Edition.

24
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,100
Okay, that Hailey Vaughn.

25
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay, anyone involved have
a history of any priors?

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,200
No, all upstanding.
law-abiding citizens.

27
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,100
It's like they all just snapped.

28
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,100
???

29
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,800
- Hey.
- If it's not airborne,

30
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,700
what do you think?

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,100
I don'know. As far as toxins go,

32
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,500
around here, my first bet
would be cocaine and appletinis.

33
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,100
We'll check everything from inside and out.

34
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,300
Do our own testing.

35
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,000
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,800
???

37
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,900
Nothing glamorous about this.

38
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
People live for this stuff, huh?

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,600
Bright lights, red carpets.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,900
And I imagine they want to die for it.

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,900
eleventh hour s01ep17

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,300
Anything consistent?

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Nothing yet.

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
The same face powder
in the dressing room of

47
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,700
that designer's party and in the salon,

48
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,100
but not in the red carpet.

49
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,900
And we got the same bottled
water at both incident sites,

50
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,400
but so far, it's tested clean.

51
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,000
So proximity is still our only link.

52
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,200
Okay. Well, designer clothes and
designer drugs are not total strangers.

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
You got anything from the tox reports?

54
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Not yet. They're still working on it.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Going as fast as they can.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Okay, well, let's start with the living.

57
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,500
So, buddy, what happened last night?

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,400
I checked your files.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,400
There's nothing bad in there.

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't get it.

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,700
Me neither.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,700
Seriously, you seem like a standup guy.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,700
They hired you to stop dudes like you.

64
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,500
I blanked. I swear.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,700
Something... something...
something happened.

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, I got that part.

67
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,700
What was it about that model?

68
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
You guys have a little history going on?

69
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,200
Rob and I were just walking into the show,

70
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
and then the next thing you know,
this fight broke out.

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Can I ask you something really personal?

72
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,700
Were you dating either of these guys?

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,100
No, the photographer,

74
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,000
I've never even seen him before,

75
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,300
and Rob, my agent, was...

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,900
always really professional.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,100
I've always been totally professional.

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,300
All right,

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,400
now I tell you something that
stays with you and me, all right?

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,700
'Cause I think I know what went down

81
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,000
because I felt that way before.

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,000
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

83
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,400
I used to be a bouncer at a strip joint.

84
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,400
No kidding?

85
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,100
Yeah, it was just like you said,
always professional.

86
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,700
Always about the work.

87
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,500
And it just creeps up on you

88
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,400
slowly... all that skin.

89
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,600
And all of a sudden,
one day with no warning,

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
you just snap!

91
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,200
That's exactlyhat this was like...

92
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,900
from what I remember.

93
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,200
I wasn't myself.

94
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,000
It's all a blur, but...

95
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,100
I just know, me and that girl--
we had a connection.

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,500
You and that fine model had a connection?

97
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Are you on medication?

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm using new stuff all the time:

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,700
lipsticks, moisturizers, whatever.

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Companies just send me free stuff.

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,700
Lucky you.

102
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
What about food?

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,500
Did you eat or drink anything different?

104
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,200
Champagne on the way over.

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,800
You know, to take the edge off.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Right.

107
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,600
I wish I had taken something.

108
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,600
I mean, I wish I had that excuse.

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,300
I didn't want to hurt that girl.

110
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,600
God... what have I done?

111
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,600
Hey, Rex, hi.

112
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,600
Um£¨ I was just calling to say what's up.

113
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
So, what's up?

114
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,600
Oh, and to say again how much fun
I had at dinner a couple weeks back.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,900
I hope your sudden call wasn't bad news.

116
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,500
Um, maybe next time we can catch a movie.

117
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,300
Rock on.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,900
Oh, I so forgot.
This is Gretchen Morris calling.

119
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,300
Rock on!

120
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,000
Hi.

121
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,100
Am I interrupting something?

122
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Uh, no, I was just lost in thought.

123
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,200
Can I help you?

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,400
Yes, we're investigating
the death of Robert Beltram.

125
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,700
We understand he has a partner?

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,900
He did.

127
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,400
Shall we talk in my office?

128
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
How long were you and
Robert Beltran partners?

129
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,500
Business?

130
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Eight.

131
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
We were married almost six.

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,900
Married?

133
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,100
We didn't know.

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,400
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Different last names.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,800
And in this business, you don'
advertise your personal relationships

137
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,600
unless you crave attention.

138
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,200
Can I ask was your marriage a happy one?

139
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,800
The first couple of years, yes.

140
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,400
But then the agency started doing so well,

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,000
it required so much of our attention.

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Careful what you wish for, right?

143
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,100
One of your models, Hailey Vaughn...

144
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Any idea why he would have gotten
involved in a fistfight over her?

145
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Robert was just being a good agent.

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,400
He is...

147
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,600
was protective of his clients.

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,500
If they think you don't care,
they'll jump ship to someone who does.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But dying for them? No.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,600
Excuse me. I'm sorry to ask
such a mundane question, but, um,

151
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,200
was your husband using anything
unusual, out of the ordinary?

152
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,300
I just mean like different
soap or, uh, medition?

153
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,100
Was he eating anything unusual?

154
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,100
Not that I know of, but, uh,

155
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
fashion week's a crazy time.

156
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,900
We really hadn't seen much
of each other lately.

157
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,200
We had made plans to get away
after the madness was over.

158
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
What are you thinking?

159
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,700
I'm thinking she's hiding something.

160
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,700
Well, if you really
want to know someone...

161
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,100
talk to her assistant.

162
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,500
Oh, rats!

163
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,500
Hi.

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,100
Uh, can I help you?

165
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Miss Vaughn.

166
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,400
I brought you your mail.

167
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,300
Thanks, Tim.

168
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,500
Tom.

169
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,100
Sorry. Tom.

170
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,500
I usually just get it myself.

171
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Not today.

172
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,700
I caught that perfume of
yours when you just come in.

173
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,600
You smell...

174
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
incredible.

175
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,600
Thanks.

176
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,300
Got to go.

177
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,900
What are you doing?

178
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,300
Maybe you should invite me in.

179
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,700
Yeah, no, uh, he was a great boss.

180
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,300
The best.

181
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
And you made all his appointments?

182
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,600
I even scheduled his phone calls to his mom.

183
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,700
Did he change his behavior in any way?

184
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,700
I mean, start going out more, join a gym?

185
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,800
Hmm-mm. No.

186
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,800
Gretchen.

187
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,200
You seem like the kind
of girl who really cares.

188
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,300
So, why don't you tell us
what you've been dying to tell us.

189
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,700
If Miss Delgado finds out,
it'll break her heart.

190
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
She's not going to find out.

191
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
At least, not from us.

192
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:05,000
Robert had a lot of, uh,
meetings lately with one client.

193
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,500
Late-night meetings.

194
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,600
Which client?

195
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,000
Hailey Vaughn.

196
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,900
The model he was with the night he died.

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,300
Nobody leaves their door open in New York.

198
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,100
Hood.

199
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,500
Don't move.

200
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
She was so beautiful.

201
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,900
I don't know why I did it.

202
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,500
I don't know.

203
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Wait a second.

204
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,900
Excuse me.

205
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,700
What's that mark?

206
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,300
It's on both wrists, actually, and her neck.

207
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
We should be able to tell you
what that is after autopsy.

208
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Search turned up no drugs, no paraphernalia.

209
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,500
But I did find a couple items
that look like they've just been opened.

210
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,500
What's that?

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,800
It's a promotional box of perfume.

212
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
It says "Touchant" under the name.

213
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
Touchant's a high-end perfume manufacturer.

214
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,300
Rachel, you wear perfume
sometimes, don't you?

215
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,300
Sometimes.

216
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,700
How do you put it on?

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
Uh... like every other girl.

218
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Here, here, here.

219
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,200
????

220
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,500
???

221
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,000
Agency.

222
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
Rex?!

223
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,600
Hi, hi.

224
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,800
How are you?

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,300
You were in Seattle?

226
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,400
Really? Wow.

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,300
God, I'm sorry.

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
Is he feeling better?

229
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,000
Good.

230
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,900
Yeah... I'm great.

231
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Tomorrow night?

232
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,400
Yeah. Sure.

233
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,800
What time?

234
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay.

235
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,500
All right, I'll see you then.

236
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,700
Bye.

237
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,300
Yes!

238
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,300
Smells like Paris in here, doesn't it?

239
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,200
Yeah...

240
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,700
Definitely.

241
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,900
Of course, perfume is one of
the most ancient of art forms.

242
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,600
The three wise men brought
frankincense and myrrh to Jesus.

243
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
Before that, the Egyptians entombed
their pharaohs with aromatics.

244
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,400
But it was created to
cover bad smells, right?

245
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
It was also created to ward
off things like the plague.

246
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Yes, yes... This is one of our chemists.
This is Renny Boyle.

247
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Uh, yes.

248
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,400
But, of course, today, most
fragrances are used to flavor foods.

249
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,100
60%, actually.

250
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,300
Less than 10% is perfume.

251
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,300
But this, of course, is
where the true art still lies.

252
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,900
And the regulations stop.

253
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,900
Excuse me?

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,600
You don't have to list
ingredients on perfume.

255
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,700
So, you can put anything
you want in there?

256
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Pretty much.

257
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,600
Recently, they found very high
estrogen levels in a body lotion.

258
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,100
They had to take it off the market
because it was causing cancer.

259
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,500
Yes, yes, but here, we use
only the purest of ingredients.

260
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,200
Now, for example,

261
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,000
our newest fragrance has
over 650 different ingredients

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,400
and very few of them are synthetic.

263
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
That would be, uh, "Fervor."

264
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,100
Yes.

265
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,500
Where did you get that?

266
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:06,100
That's the promotional package
that went out to all of Scent 100.

267
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,400
Scent 100?

268
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,100
Uh, yes, I'm sorry.

269
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,100
It's a list of 100 of the
fashion industry's most elite.

270
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,700
We sent out a very limited
release of the fragrance.

271
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,100
It, uh, creates anticipation.

272
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,300
So, um, Hailey Vaughn
would have been on the list.

273
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,800
Yes, that's right, yeah.
She was one of very few,

274
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,300
just a handful omodels on that list.

275
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,200
Very lucky girl.

276
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,300
Hailey Vaughn is dead, sir.

277
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,100
I see.

278
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,400
Well, then, I think that you
better speak to our attorney.

279
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,300
There's nothing dangerous about our perfume.

280
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,700
Oh, well, maybe not
to the person that wears it.

281
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,400
But what about the person that smells it?

282
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
We'll also need the list of 100 people,

283
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,000
so we can recall the boxes
as a safety measure.

284
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,500
Seems a little premature at this point.

285
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,400
We don't want to cause unnecessary panic.

286
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,300
Are you worried about the public
or your company's bottom line?

287
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
We can get a court order if we need to.

288
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,800
I am pretty sure you
don't have enough for that.

289
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,900
I am absolutely certain that this
is an unfortunate misunderstanding.

290
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,000
I am the primary nose here at Touchant.

291
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,700
No ingredient goes into one of
our perfumes without my knowledge.

292
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,100
Okay, it's taken me two years.

293
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,500
It's taken me hundreds of clinical
tests to perfect this scent.

294
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,800
Good. Then you won't mind one more test.

295
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,200
Fine.

296
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,900
I will have Renny draw up
a sample of Fervor.

297
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Is that it?

298
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,000
Almost.

299
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
If we do find anything
dangerous in the sample,

300
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,200
your company will be our primary suspect.

301
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,900
Thanks for your help.

302
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,100
Kristopher.

303
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,600
If there is anything to this,

304
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,300
you will take the fall
and you will take it alone.

305
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,000
Hey, Agent Young's at the coroner's office.

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,900
Extra pair of hands.
Felix, could you do me a favor?

307
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,100
Could you please write down a couple
of things for me on the board,

308
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,300
- Sure.
-if you don't mind? Thanks.

309
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,700
Uh-huh.

310
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,400
Okay.

311
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,100
Vanilla.

312
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,200
- Vanilla.
- Um...

313
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Honeysuckle.

314
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,400
JalapeÒo pepper.

315
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,200
It's a perfume recipe.

316
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,300
Civet musk...

317
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,100
What's that?

318
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Civet? It's kind of,
um, half cat, half fox.

319
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,500
And they use the musk in perfume to make,

320
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
uh, make it evaporate slower.
Makes the odor last longer.

321
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,300
You know, they also use beaver
glands and whale fat in perfume, too.

322
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Not so much. Not anymore.

323
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,200
I mean, aside from the whole
endangered species thing,

324
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,100
there's a fear that if
the animals is diseased,

325
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,200
it could carry on in humans.

326
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,700
So, technically, if diseased
oil is in the perfume,

327
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,400
that could cause people to go nuts.

328
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,000
I mean, that's what I'm thinking, yeah.

329
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll run another test for
contaminants while we, uh,

330
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,500
break down the rest
of the perfume's ingredients.

331
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,600
- How many more we got?
- Uh, 650-something.

332
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,000
I should write these smaller.

333
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,900
You wanted to see me?

334
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,100
Yes, Renny.

335
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,900
The police that were here earlier,

336
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,000
do you have any idea why?

337
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,100
They weren't police. They were FBI.

338
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,000
And they have a crazy idea that
our perfume is making people violent.

339
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,900
Which is completely unfounded, right?

340
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
Right?

341
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,100
All the proper tests
have been run, haven't they?

342
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,700
I have done everything
you have asked me to do.

343
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,300
I always have.

344
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Then there's nothing
to worry about, is there?

345
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,400
If you say so, sir.

346
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
May I go back to work now?

347
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,800
Yes.

348
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,500
It's open.

349
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Good evening.

350
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,000
Evening.

351
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,500
Sit on the bed, please.

352
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,800
I'd like you to indulge me.

353
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,200
That's what I'm here for.

354
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
Put on that perfume, please.

355
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,700
Not bad.

356
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm glad you like it.

357
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,600
All right, let's begin.

358
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,200
Final autopsy reports.

359
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Found the same skin pigmentation
marks on Hailey and the runway model.

360
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,900
It all points to the perfume
being the common denominator.

361
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,000
What are you thinking, Hood?

362
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,000
He's using pheromones.

363
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,700
Pheromones-- that's what gives
people the hots for each other, right?

364
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,500
Well, yeah.

365
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Only a select few.

366
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,300
I mean, pheromones, they use gene typing,

367
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,800
which is like blood typing,

368
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,500
which means only certain
pheromones attract certain people.

369
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa. So I might dig somebody

370
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,200
and you might not based
on the way they smell?

371
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,900
Then there actually is something
to chemistry between people.

372
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,400
Well, that would explain why only
certain people are becoming violent.

373
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
Okay.

374
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,400
But it's more than that.

375
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,100
He's got to be using it in
conjunction with something else.

376
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,800
We just don't know what yet.

377
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,200
I know you want me.

378
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,400
I'm only here for you.

379
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,900
Quiet, please.

380
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,000
Quiet.

381
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,500
Trying to concentrate.

382
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,000
Okay.

383
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,900
I have another appointment, and,
um, this is getting all too weird.

384
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,700
Sit down.

385
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,500
Sit.

386
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,900
Sit down.

387
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,000
- Sit!
- No!

388
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,800
- Get off!
- You are not...

389
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,500
- Get off me.
- going anywhere.

390
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
We'll get the book after they tag it.

391
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,400
Meantime, they can run
ballistics on the bullet.

392
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Looks like she carried
the gun in her purse.

393
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,800
???

394
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,300
Weapon was a.22.

395
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
What's her name?

396
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,200
Lyla.

397
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,700
Thank you.

398
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
Lyla?

399
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,100
Hi, my name's Jacob.

400
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
Jacob Hood. I'm not a cop.

401
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,700
I'm a scientist. And, um...

402
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,400
I think I know what happened.

403
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,300
Listen, I know that he attacked you first.

404
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
Can I ask you a question, please?

405
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,100
Did he make you wear perfume?

406
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,500
Yes.

407
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,600
Can you show me, do you
have marks on your wrists?

408
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,100
Okay.

409
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,400
He was gonna kill me.

410
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,100
I didn't know what else to do.

411
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,600
I understand.

412
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,600
He was just sitting there,
writing all this stuff in a notebook.

413
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,300
And then...

414
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,800
Why did he do this to me?

415
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
He was conducting an experiment,
and it went out of hand.

416
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,200
So I was some kind of guinea pig?

417
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,900
No, he was.

418
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
So what is this?

419
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,200
Um, this is something

420
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I found in the perfume in the
hotel room-- the real perfume.

421
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
All right, bring on the fancy
science, Doc. I can handle it.

422
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,700
It's a neurotransmitter molecule.

423
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,300
Little less fancy.

424
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,300
It's like a, um,

425
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
instant messenger for the brain.

426
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,200
There's about 300 of them.

427
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,800
And they tell us, uh, what to
think and feel and how to act.

428
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,200
We only really know
what about half of them do.

429
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,800
And what do we think this one does?

430
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,700
Well, we think this one makes people crazy.

431
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,400
Okay.

432
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,600
Well, why wasn't this one
in the sample that Merced gave us?

433
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,200
Because the perfume Merced created was clean.

434
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,900
Do we think that someone else
put it in the promotional packages?

435
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,600
That's what I'm getting from his notes.

436
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,900
After we visited him,

437
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,800
he was worried there was
something wrong with his masterpiece,

438
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
so he decided to test it himself.

439
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,100
The hooker?

440
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,100
That's right.

441
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,600
Merced was innocent.

442
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,400
So who put the hots in the perfume?

443
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,900
We did a patent search on the base
elements of your Fervor perfume.

444
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,200
It turns out, there was a patent challenge.

445
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,600
Your chemist Renny Boyle claims to
have invented it in his own time.

446
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,100
Renny's the lab tech
who gave you the sample.

447
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,900
- The clean sample?
- More like a cleaned-up sample.

448
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,100
Think it was fake.

449
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,600
Then he's liable for the violence.

450
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,700
- It's looking that way.
- But why?

451
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,200
It doesn't make sense.

452
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
This is a multimillion-dollar company, isn't it?

453
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,300
$50 million a year, actually.

454
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,400
Well, we need to talk with Renny,

455
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,100
find out how he came up with the formula,
if we want to contain it.

456
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
He's not here; he called in sick.

457
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,000
His computer's been wiped completely clean.

458
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,700
I'll put out an APB on Renny.

459
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,300
The marks.

460
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,600
The marks on the skin--
that must be the key.

461
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,500
Do you run clinical trials here?

462
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,800
Yes. We have a whole line of cosmetics.

463
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
That's what we need to look at right now.

464
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,900
Here's the rest of the results
from the self-tanning lotion trials,

465
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
but the formula is missing.

466
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,200
Okay, okay.

467
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,300
How do you effect a color change,

468
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,700
a pigmentation change in the skin?

469
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,900
One way, the simple way,

470
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,600
is a colorless sugar interacts
withthe dead skin cells.

471
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
But you could...

472
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,900
you could go directly through the brain.

473
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:19,200
Affect the neurons in the body
that tell the skin to get darker.

474
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,900
Like the neurotransmitter
you were talking about.

475
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,100
Exactly.

476
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,900
So this is some kind of side effect

477
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,200
from a self-tanning lotion
Touchant was developing?

478
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Could be.

479
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,900
According to this subject, "Great tan.

480
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,400
But I felt energetic and aroused."

481
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,100
"This isn't suntan lotion.

482
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,400
It's ber-love potion."

483
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Well... okay.

484
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, my guess is
he discovered it by accident,

485
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,200
but mixed it up with pheromones deliberately.

486
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
That would increase
the effect of both of them,

487
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,700
lower the inhibitions,
increase the sex drive.

488
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,500
Which then lead to violent urges.

489
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,600
You know what I think?

490
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,800
This could have been marketed as the
world's first scientifically-proven aphrodisiac

491
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,400
if it hadn't been for the violent side effect.

492
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,100
We need to round up the rest
of the perfume boxes right away.

493
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,200
I need those 100 names.

494
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, NYPD's going house-to-house

495
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,600
and person-to-person going
through that Scent 100 list.

496
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,500
We got almost all the boxes accounted for.

497
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,300
Soon as I'm done here,

498
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,700
I'm jumping on the task force
that's tracking down Renny Boyle.

499
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,600
That's good work, Felix. Thank you.

500
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,500
Listen, you do something else for me?

501
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,100
I want you to get through
to the New York CBRNE,

502
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,000
and ask them to get access to
as much cerulenin as possible.

503
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Serena Williams? What?

504
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,500
Cerulenin.

505
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,900
It's an FAS inhibitor.

506
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,500
It'll block the melanocortin
receptors of the perfume.

507
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,600
An antidote?

508
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,400
Just in case, okay?

509
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,900
I appreciate you coming here yourselves.

510
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,100
- Red box, right?
- That's right.

511
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,800
I haven't been through my mail,

512
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,400
but I think I saw my assistant
with it this morning.

513
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,700
It should be at Gretchen's desk.

514
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
The mail's here.

515
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,400
Not the perfume?

516
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,100
I don't know where it could be.

517
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,100
I'll need your assistant's phone number.

518
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,000
She's not answering.

519
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,700
Aren't you going to answer it?

520
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,800
No.

521
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,900
I don't recognize the number.

522
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,800
Usually someone trying to sell
you something you don't need.

523
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,500
I know exactly what you mean.

524
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,200
These people-- they never give up.

525
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,800
So, uh...

526
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,000
21's a fancy club, huh?

527
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,800
You have a big date, huh?

528
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Sort of.

529
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,600
A pretty girl like you--

530
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,300
I bet you have a lot of dates.

531
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Oh, well, that's nice of
you to say, but, um...

532
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,500
it's kind of personal.

533
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,500
Come on.

534
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,600
I bet your voicemail's overflowing with
guys just dying to get close to you, huh?

535
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,900
Can you just drive, please?

536
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,100
For you, anything.

537
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,100
Where are you going?
Um, the restaurant's not this way.

538
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,000
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I know a shortcut.

539
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,100
Pull over.

540
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,700
Will you pull over, please?

541
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
By the way...

542
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,800
???

543
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,900
Come on. Come on.

544
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,900
She's still not answering.

545
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,500
????

546
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,400
What are we looking for exactly?

547
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,100
Renny calling a taxi.

548
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,700
Renny buying a plane ticket online.

549
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Anything that tells us where he is.

550
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,900
He just came in this office, didn't he?

551
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,000
What is he doing?

552
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,200
Can you find that footage?

553
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,000
Right there. Freeze that.

554
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,600
What is that?

555
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,500
What's he got there?

556
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,600
- "You have been cordially invited..."
- It's an invitation...

557
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,000
to tonight's fashion show.

558
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,800
- Agent Young?
- Yes.

559
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,700
Officer, do you have what we
need to track Gretchen Morris?

560
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,400
Portable GPS is set up.

561
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,700
We have her number.

562
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,400
It's Felix. Hey.

563
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,900
Yes, so I'm headed to the Dior show.

564
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,800
I think Renny's got a grand
finale planned for fashion week.

565
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,100
Did you call for backup?

566
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,300
Yeah, meet me there.

567
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,700
You find Gretchen?

568
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,000
Working on it.

569
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,500
Her signal's stationary.

570
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,200
Just a few blocks from here.

571
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,100
The, uh, designer wanted me to tell you
that you should be wearing this.

572
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,100
What is it?

573
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,800
It's called Fervor by Touchant.

574
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,700
- May I?
- Yeah.

575
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,800
It's going to be the
season's hottest fragrance.

576
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,000
Mm, I like it.

577
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

578
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,700
Wait till you see the reaction
on the crowd when they smell it.

579
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,800
It's going to be like
nothing in this world.

580
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,200
No cab driver. No Gretchen.

581
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,700
Her phone's here, but she's not.

582
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,400
Now how do we find Gretchen?
Dogs. Dogs can track the scent.

583
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,500
Officer, call for a K-9 unit.

584
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
Please... please don't hurt me.

585
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
I would never hurt you.

586
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,000
Shh.

587
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,100
Why would I hurt you?

588
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,500
You smell so good.

589
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,000
Shh.

590
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,300
It's okay.

591
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,500
Gretchen!

592
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,500
???

593
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,000
???

594
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,900
Gretchen! Gretchen!
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

595
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,100
???

596
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,200
What are you doing? She's mine.

597
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,100
Felix.

598
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,200
We found Gretchen.

599
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,300
Yeah, that's great news.

600
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,600
We still haven't found Renny yet.

601
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,700
Man, this place is packed.

602
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,300
Hey, Doc, some of these people
are acting real strange.

603
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,400
I think the models are wearing the perfume!

604
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,900
Do you have the antidote?

605
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,400
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.
- I'll be right there.

606
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,600
????

607
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,900
???

608
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
????

609
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,900
FBI. Get down! Get down on your knees now!

610
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,800
Nine years I have given my life to Touchant

611
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,000
without even so much as a parking space.

612
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,800
I created Fervor.

613
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,000
It should be mine.

614
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,400
Cuff him.

615
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,500
You just try and stop it.

616
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,300
Dr. Hood, should we evacuate this place?

617
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,500
It's too late.

618
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,000
We have to somehow get the
antidote into the atmosphere.

619
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,400
What's wrong with everyone?

620
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,000
Excuse me. Do you know
the source of these smoke jets?

621
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,600
- Around back.
- Thank you.

622
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay, pour it in.

623
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,800
- A lot?
- All of it.????

624
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,600
Okay, Okay.

625
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,400
Okay, turn it on full blast.

626
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,500
It's working, Felix.

627
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,400
I don't know about you, Doc.

628
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,500
I think I'm going to give up
on the cologne for a while.

629
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,300
Is that what you call
that stuff you wear?

630
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,700
Hey, my mama gives me that every birthday.

631
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,400
That's very nice of her.

632
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,300
So what do you think?
It's New York City.

633
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Agent Young's 20 blocks away.

634
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,300
- Cab it? Subway?
- Let's walk.

635
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,600
We could do with the fresh air.

636
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,900
I hear that.

637
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,800
He's not answering.

638
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,700
I don't blame him.

639
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,800
I've been stood up a few times.
It's not a nice feeling.

640
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
What's his name?

641
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,500
Rex.

642
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,700
Can you dial his number again?

643
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,300
???

644
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,700
Hi, Rex. This is Special
Agent Young of the FBI.

645
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,400
The girl you were
meeting tonight-- Gretchen,

646
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,500
she's been helping us with a case.

647
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,500
She'll tell you all about it
when you call her.

648
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Who knows?

649
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,000
Maybe that will do the trick.

650
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,700
I don't know.

651
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm starting to think there's
no such thing as chemistry.

652
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,600
Well... I know for a fact there is.

653
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,600
Thanks for everything.

654
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,800
Take care, Gretchen.

655
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
