1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,568
Okay. So you remember
Jenny Reilly, right?

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:05,934
<i>She found</i>
<i>something interesting,</i>

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,735
<i>frozen hamburgers in the oven.</i>

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,331
<i>Mr. Reilly said</i>
<i>he didn't do it.</i>

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,398
<i>Strange.</i>

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,035
<i>Thanks to Dokey,</i>
<i>people are still losing</i>
<i>their toes.</i>

7
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,137
No!

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,580
<i>Let's hope he finds</i>
<i>his brother's killer soon.</i>

9
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,207
<i>Nicky's looking for power.</i>

10
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,444
<i>He beat up Sean Donnelly,</i>

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,510
<i>which got his boss, Sal,</i>
<i>killed.</i>

12
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,354
<i>And he's been getting closer</i>
<i>to his new boss, Alo.</i>

13
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,052
<i>Smart! Since he's looking</i>
<i>to take his place.</i>

14
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,055
<i>Little Sean's finally</i>
<i>out of the hospital,</i>

15
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,597
<i>but he thinks</i>
<i>he's lost his looks.</i>

16
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,131
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Jimmy found something.</i>

17
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,188
<i>Louie's cell phone</i>

18
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,326
<i>with his entire</i>
<i>bookmaking business.</i>

19
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,768
<i>(CASH REGISTER DINGS)</i>
<i>Jackpot!</i>

20
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,438
<i>Speaking of jackpots,</i>
<i>that bread guy, Samson?</i>

21
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,475
<i>Thought he won big</i>
<i>when he found Jenny.</i>

22
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,566
<i>Boy, was he wrong.</i>

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,507
<i>Jenny knew the whole thing</i>
<i>was a mistake.</i>

24
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:46,943
<i>She tried to fix it.</i>

25
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,378
You could have lied to me.

26
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,815
Me?
I've always believed honesty
is best served cold.

27
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,956
<i>MAN. What are you</i>
<i>being stupid for?</i>

28
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,526
Why can't you get it
through that thick
skull of yours

29
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,288
that we're trying
to help you?

30
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,886
No, no, I got it.

31
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,522
You're just
a couple of good guys.

32
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,726
See, here's the problem.

33
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,737
Always trying to help people,
it'll kill you.

34
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,964
And it's worse than a disease.

35
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,674
<i>Tommy Donnelly was just</i>
<i>beginning to figure that out.</i>

36
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,764
Hey.
Hey.

37
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,030
I figured
you might need this stuff.

38
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,272
It's the trays
from Huey's wake.

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,500
Thanks.

40
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,677
So how long
you been sitting out there?

41
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,114
Not long.

42
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,182
All night?
Pretty much.

43
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,694
On the counter here okay?
Yeah, sure.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,394
Sorry, Jenny.
I'm gonna have to
do this COD.

45
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,831
Excuse me?

46
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,365
Yeah, they told me
to get cash.

47
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:51,968
George, it's obviously
a mistake.

48
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,836
I'll just sign it
like I usually do, okay?

49
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,301
What?

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,979
What's this?

51
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,482
Last three months, overdue.

52
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,546
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,617
Is everything all right?

54
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,451
It's fine.

55
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,193
You need anything?

56
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,421
I'm good, thanks.

57
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,757
Okay.

58
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,901
I'll see you, then?

59
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,025
Yeah.

60
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,909
Been some kind of mistake.

61
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,174
I'm gonna go
call the office.

62
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,381
Meanwhile,
while helping themselves

63
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,476
to Louie Downtown's
bookmaking action,

64
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,714
Jimmy and Kevin ran into
a minor problem.

65
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,790
KEVIN: Jimmy,
it's Eddie Maxwell,
all right?

66
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,017
Please. I don't feel right
about this.

67
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,422
We know this guy
our entire lives.

68
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,482
He owes us money.

69
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,257
He owes Louie money.
Stop saying that, Kevin.

70
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,628
We have a chance to get
a little respect here

71
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,758
and you want to throw it
all away because of Maxwell?

72
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,597
I never liked
the guy anyway.

73
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,035
What if he tells
Louie's people
what we're doing?

74
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,130
Then he'll really
have a problem.

75
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,003
Hey.
Guys, how you doing?

76
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,545
Hey, Eddie, how are you?
Good.

77
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,978
What's up?

78
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,480
Picking up for Louie,
that's all.

79
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,210
Oh, that was you guys
on the phone?

80
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,410
You're working for Louie?
Yeah.

81
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,713
Yeah? Get out of here.

82
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,378
No, no, really.
He didn't tell you?

83
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,716
You're asking me to give you
Louie's money?

84
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,984
The money I bet with Louie?

85
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,389
Five grand,
that's the figure,
right?

86
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,688
You're out of your mind.

87
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,592
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

88
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,891
Eddie.

89
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,125
Your figure for the week's
five large.

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,360
You're really serious?

91
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,901
As a heart attack.

92
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,827
I bet with Louie.

93
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,396
Tell him to stop by
if he wants his money.

94
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,112
Give me the money you owe or
I'm gonna break both your legs

95
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,947
and burn your store down with
you in it, you understand?

96
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,945
Understand this.

97
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,150
My hand is on a.38 automatic
under the counter.

98
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,886
We know each other
a long time.

99
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,287
Don't make me use it.

100
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,742
<i>(GUNSHO TS)</i>

101
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,278
I'd lose my head
if it wasn't attached.

102
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,122
All right, I'll see you
after the dentist.

103
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,424
What are you doing?

104
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,188
Where's all the money, Dad?

105
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,491
What money?

106
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,498
The deposits.
The weekly deposits.

107
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,592
According to these statements,
there's no money
in our accounts.

108
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,862
What are you talking about?

109
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,268
Both accounts are overdrawn,

110
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,670
and we've been
bouncing checks.

111
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,071
Over a dozen
in the last week.

112
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,904
What are you, crazy?

113
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,545
Did you deposit the money?

114
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,241
Of course I did.

115
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,713
Do you have
the deposit slips?

116
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,116
Dad?

117
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,190
What?

118
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,683
Where's the money?

119
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,158
It's in the bank.

120
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,355
I've got the deposit slips
right here.

121
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,165
Right here.
Right next to the stamps.

122
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,561
Where the hell
are the stamps?

123
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,349
It's okay, Dad.

124
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,990
I'll call the bank,
we'll figure out
what happened.

125
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,497
You deposited the money,
I'm sure it's there.

126
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,396
The bank made a mistake.

127
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,607
Thirty years,
I been banking there.

128
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,410
I'll get our money.

129
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,844
They'll cover
the bounced checks.

130
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,546
Don't worry so much.

131
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,469
Hey! Hey, Tommy?
Got a minute?

132
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,334
Hey, Eddie.
What's up?

133
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,599
What's going on
with your brother, Jimmy?

134
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,869
He's trying to
shake me down.

135
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,069
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,578
I lost a couple bets
to Louie Downtown.

137
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,048
Jimmy comes to me,
says I have to pay him
Louie's money.

138
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,744
What do you mean,
he wants you to pay him?

139
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,253
Well, he says
he's collecting for Louie.

140
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,290
Tommy what happens
when Louie shows up?

141
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,950
What do I do then,
pay two people?

142
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,393
And plus, I'm down 500,
he says I owe 5,000.

143
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,056
And, Tommy,
he comes into my store

144
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,362
and makes a punk out of me
in front of my wife.
What the hell is that?

145
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,026
I'm sorry, Eddie.

146
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,831
I'll talk to Jimmy.
We'll straighten it out,
okay?

147
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,532
Look,
I don't want to have
to take this to Dokey,

148
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,201
we know each other too long,
that's why I came to you.

149
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,870
But the truth is
I'm in the right.

150
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,573
I got a legitimate beef here.

151
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,081
Don't do anything
till I talk to Jimmy,
okay?

152
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,449
No, no.
No problem, Tommy.

153
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,919
It's not your fault,

154
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,989
it's just Jimmy. I know.

155
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,521
I appreciate it,
Eddie. Okay?

156
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,652
Okay.

157
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,725
The Donnellys were always
looking to me for help.

158
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:23,962
Where's Jimmy?

159
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,560
I don't know.
<i>JOEY. I did what I could.</i>

160
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,696
Do you want your ass kicked?

161
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,104
He's in the basement
with Kevin.

162
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,235
Where is he?

163
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,779
I wouldn't start anything
if I were you.

164
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,687
Since when are you
collecting bets
for Louie Downtown?

165
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,780
Since I found his phone down
here covered in his brains.

166
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,084
What do you think
the Italians are gonna do

167
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,988
when they find out you're
collecting Louie's bets?

168
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,424
Money that's supposed to be
going to them?

169
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,826
To hell with the Italians.

170
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,564
This is for Eddie Maxwell.

171
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,827
Jimmy! Jimmy!

172
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,999
Hey! You gonna shoot
Eddie Maxwell over
money he owes Louie?

173
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,666
It's my money.
My money.

174
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,074
Come on, Jimmy.

175
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,074
He embarrassed me, Tommy.

176
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,875
He stuck a gun in my face!

177
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,474
Me and Kevin had to
run out of there

178
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,949
with our tails
between our legs.

179
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,883
You think that's okay?

180
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,619
Did he really do that?
What are you asking him for?

181
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,383
He didn't actually
shove it in our faces,

182
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,788
he just kind of
showed it to us.

183
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,258
I mean, he didn't even
show it to us, actually...

184
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,557
You know what, Kevin?
Shut up!

185
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,388
I'm building up business here,
Tommy.

186
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,726
I let Maxwell get away
with that,

187
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,131
don't you think
the next guy's gonna
try the same thing?

188
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,998
You're really gonna
shoot a guy we know
all our lives

189
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,800
over a stinking $500
he doesn't even
really owe you?

190
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,273
He told you that?
That he owes $500?

191
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,536
He's willing to pay, Jimmy,
okay?

192
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,872
Leave it alone.
I'll get you the money.

193
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,105
Five thousand!
Five hundred.

194
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,339
You believe him?

195
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,403
You believe him over me?

196
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,382
He's not a $5,000 bettor,
Jimmy, you know that.

197
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,443
MX is for Maxwell.

198
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,688
426 is the address
of his shop.

199
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,155
You don't believe me?

200
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,191
<i>Maxwell Printing, hello.</i>

201
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,765
Ten bets,
$500 a pop.

202
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,767
Lost every bet.

203
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,068
Guy makes Kevin look lucky!

204
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,074
What do you gotta
say that for?

205
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,111
He knows you and Mary Ann
had a thing,
so he's using you.

206
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,441
He's playing you for a jerk.

207
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,707
Okay.

208
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,245
Maybe he lied to me.
But you still can't kill him.

209
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,917
You want to play
Mother Teresa? Go ahead.

210
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,488
You get me my $5,000.

211
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,648
And maybe the next time
I see him,

212
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,554
I'll just give him
a beating.

213
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,217
Otherwise, I'm gonna do
Mary Ann a favor,

214
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,522
I'm gonna make her a widow.

215
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,655
I'll get you the money.

216
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,174
I think Tommy's right.

217
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,309
We should get rid
of the phone.

218
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,472
You don't like money, Kevin?

219
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,481
Or you just don't want
to make our lives better,
which is it?

220
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,450
Who's to say the Italians
aren't gonna find out, huh?

221
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,750
I mean, who says
Maxwell's not talking
to Nicky right now?

222
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,448
All right,
we ditch the phone.

223
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,286
But first we gotta
get the names and numbers
off of it

224
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,893
so we can set up
our own book.

225
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,827
You know how to do that?

226
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,887
You don't know?

227
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,897
You spend your whole life
losing money

228
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,160
and you don't know
how to make book?

229
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,896
I know how to bet, Jimmy,
it's not the same.

230
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,096
Joey, come here.

231
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,638
Yeah.

232
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,267
You know anything about
setting up book?

233
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,176
About the same as Kevin,
except I won a bet once.

234
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,806
What do you want, a smack?
What? I'm just saying.

235
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,941
Does anybody know anybody?

236
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,575
This guy, Whitey,
I used to bet with.

237
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,085
Whitey's a sleaze bag.

238
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,552
Worse than you?

239
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,221
Maybe.

240
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,226
Kevin introducing Jimmy
to Whitey was gonna result

241
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,559
in one of the most gruesome
and violent deaths

242
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,065
<i>the neighborhood</i>
<i>had ever seen.</i>

243
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,691
(GROANING)

244
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,031
<i>I mean, what did Kevin know?</i>

245
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,066
<i>He was only trying to help.</i>

246
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,670
Jimmy.
Whitey.

247
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,477
<i>Was Whitey gonna kill Jimmy,</i>

248
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,747
<i>or was Jimmy</i>
<i>gonna kill Whitey?</i>

249
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,716
So who killed who?

250
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,791
When?

251
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,152
In the knife fight.

252
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,226
Oh.

253
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,430
That was later.
In the beginning...

254
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,296
<i>In the beginning,</i>
<i>Jimmy and Whitey</i>

255
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,959
<i>looked like a marriage</i>
<i>made in heaven.</i>

256
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,503
What you want to do
is ditch this phone

257
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,129
after you download
the betting codes

258
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,766
and the client numbers
in a laptop.

259
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,037
Then you gotta
record all the bets
in case of a challenge.

260
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,136
That means software
and a USB port.

261
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,305
If you want me
to understand any of that,

262
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,506
you're gonna have to
say it in English.

263
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,571
All right. Bottom line is,

264
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,775
you buy
a couple new cell phones,

265
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,182
transfer everything
to a SIM card.

266
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,311
I could just do it
if you want to make it
worth my while.

267
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,048
KEVIN: That sounds good.
How does that sound good?

268
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,283
He didn't even give us
a price yet.

269
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,618
How much?

270
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,628
To set it up,
or work the action, too?

271
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,062
Everything.

272
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,294
There's three of us,
how about partners?
A third each.

273
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,495
I just met you
five minutes ago,

274
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,628
and you're trying
to hustle me.

275
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,729
I'm not trying
to hustle anybody.

276
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,206
You make me an offer
you think is fair.

277
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,438
Me and my three brothers
are the only partners
I'm ever gonna have.

278
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,606
You want to work with us,
you get 10%.

279
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,308
Otherwise,
take it on the hop.

280
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,710
How do I know
you're not gonna dump me

281
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,015
after I set
the whole thing up?

282
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,252
You don't.

283
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,726
Now that you know that,
what do you wanna do
about it?

284
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,895
Dokey around?

285
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,439
You got a name?

286
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,977
You don't know my name?

287
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,675
That's cute. Nicky.

288
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,611
Cottero.

289
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,124
Hey, Nicky, come on in.

290
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,065
Good to see you.

291
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,127
You're pretty good
with that thing, I hear.

292
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,497
Oh, you know,
lots of practice.

293
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,273
So did you come here
to tell me who killed
my brother?

294
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,778
When I find out,

295
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,906
you're gonna be the first one
I bring it to.

296
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,416
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to that.

297
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,382
So what are you doing here?

298
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,255
There's an offer
on the table.

299
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,014
You mean the one

300
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:25,092
where I pay you guineas
20% of the take
from my own territory?

301
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,563
That offer?

302
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,190
You get our union support,

303
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,997
you get our judges
and our cops for that 20%.

304
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,900
Now, that's the same offer
that Sal had for your brother.

305
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:38,034
Yeah, and look where
that got Huey, huh?

306
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,338
Alo needs an answer.

307
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,977
Me?

308
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,213
I'd like to come back here

309
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,584
and make better use
of that axe.

310
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,323
You're a funny guy.

311
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,456
Tell you what,
you go back and you tell Alo

312
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,361
that I'm giving his offer
all the attention it deserves.
Okay?

313
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,401
But my instincts,

314
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,405
they're telling me, "No."

315
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,538
I guess we're done here.

316
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,074
Hey.

317
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,479
Let me walk you out.

318
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,025
Where is everybody?

319
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,590
You had guys out here?

320
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,833
Doke, they were here
a minute ago.

321
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,369
Tommy!
Hey.

322
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:43,999
Let me help you
out with this.

323
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,703
Yeah, right,
like I don't do this
all day long?

324
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,802
Right.

325
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,608
<i>JOEY.</i>
<i>If there never was a Jenny,</i>

326
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,309
Mary Ann would have been
the one for Tommy.

327
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:55,513
Everybody knew it.
Especially Maxwell.

328
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,119
How you been?

329
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,122
I'm good. Good.
What about you guys?

330
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,852
Thank God,
things are good.

331
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,128
I was looking for Eddie.

332
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,690
He's on a run.

333
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,327
Want me to call him?

334
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,388
No.

335
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,563
No, I'll come back.

336
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,894
How's he doing?

337
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,703
It's all turned around for us,
Tommy.

338
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,376
I'm happy for you.

339
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,742
He just bought the shop,
can you imagine?

340
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,073
Everything's good, right?

341
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,279
Yeah. Yeah, why?

342
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,117
Kevin and Jimmy were
in this morning.

343
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,590
So?
So...

344
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,393
If there was something wrong,
you would tell me, right?

345
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,521
I would,
if there was something wrong.

346
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,056
Anyway,

347
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,261
bunch of guys are going
to the game Sunday.

348
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,395
I thought Eddie
might want to come.

349
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,303
Have him give me a call,
will you?

350
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,705
I'll tell him.

351
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,131
You look good.

352
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,237
I'm jealous.

353
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,142
You had your shot.

354
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,908
Don't remind me.

Hey, Kim, this is Sean,
what's up?

358
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,691
It's, like, the third time
I've called.

359
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:19,067
Call me back, huh?
I wouldn't mind
getting together.

360
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,436
I miss you. I'm lonely.

361
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,135
You're the only one
that can help.

362
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,007
Help. Help.

363
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,103

Hey.
You're awake.
How you feeling?

366
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,545
Good.

367
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,787
Who you talking to?

368
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,388
Kim, I just got busted.

Call me back, huh?

370
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,294
I'm making lunch, honey.
How about a nice bacon
and egg sandwich?

371
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,597
Love it.

could've used
a little help himself.

Hey!

379
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,988
Hey, Joanie?
It's Jimmy.

380
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,788
You want to make
$200 a week?

381
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,494
No, you don't
gotta do nothing.

00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,832
Just let us use

Hey, Tommy.

384
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,715
You lied to me, Eddie.
Hey, Tommy.

385
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,147
No. Don't do it.

386
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,610
Don't lie to me again.

387
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,415
You're down 5,000, not 500.

388
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,752
Okay. I'm down 5,000.

389
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,825
But, Tommy,
you can't blame me
for not giving it to Jimmy.

390
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,360
What do I do
if Louie shows?

391
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,862
Louie's not showing up,
and that's not a guess, Eddie.

392
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,293
Can you pay it?

393
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,632
Five thousand?

394
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,227
Not even close.

395
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,574
Mary Ann said you guys
bought the shop,

396
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,167
that it's going good.

397
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,104
So why you want
to screw that up now?

398
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,510
For three years,
I didn't make a bet.

399
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,316
Wake up one day,
and I can't stop myself.

400
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,618
Hey, will you talk
to Jimmy for me?
I just need a little time.

401
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,693
That would've been
a little easy

402
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,818
if you hadn't pulled
a gun on them...

403
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,090
I never had a gun.
I made him think I had one
under the counter.

404
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,290
I mean,
what was I supposed to do?

405
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,364
Take a beating
in front of my wife?

406
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,425
Don't do that.
Don't hide behind Mary Ann.

All I'm...

408
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,035
All I'm saying is,
I don't want to lose her.

409
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,506
How much can you
put together?

410
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,978
Maybe half.

411
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,452
Go get it.
Not with Mary Ann inside.

412
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,483
I'll meet you
back here, 9:00.

413
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,993
You're not playing me again,
are you?

414
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,964
I wouldn't lie to you, Tommy.

415
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,641
All right.
Plug in Louie's cell phone.

416
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,475
No, no, no,
use the USB cable.

417
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,037
What cable?
The one in your right hand.

418
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,742
Plug it into the data port.

419
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,648
We back up the numbers off
Louie's phone into the...

420
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,811
Who is this guy?

421
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,875
He's one of Kevin's friends.

422
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,751
He's a skell.
I'm changing my mind.

423
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,255
I don't want this guy
in my house.

424
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,121
You can't change your mind.
We already stole everything.

425
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,228
I don't want this guy
in my apartment.

426
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,558
You should have told me
about him before I agreed
to anything.

427
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,360
You want the $200 a week
or not?

428
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,560
Oh, yeah. Like I'm really
gonna see that.

429
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,138
WHITEY: Louie must have
half the city on this thing.

430
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,439
I am so gonna regret this.

431
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,667
We gotta keep
these phones on
at all times.

432
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,473
That means we gotta work them
right out of the chargers.

433
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,739
Hey.

434
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,414
You done with that?

435
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,784
What's up?

436
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,921
You sure this Whitey guy
knows what he's doing?

437
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,590
He talks,
I have no idea
what he's saying.

438
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,261
He used to be
a bookmaker, Jimmy,
that's all I know about him.

439
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,769
If I let you throw this phone
in the river,

440
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,930
and I find out later
we lost all the numbers,

441
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,371
I'm gonna choke you, Kevin,
you understand?

442
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,772
Why do I have to
throw it away?

443
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,104
Because I'm staying
and you're leaving.

444
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,702
Where am I going?
To get rid of the phone.

445
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,516
I don't understand why
I gotta do everything.

446
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,979
Whoa, whoa!
What's going on?

447
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,284
The whole time you're gone,
he won't stop looking down
my shirt!

448
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,621
I wasn't!
You staring at her chest,
buddy?

449
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,218
Jimmy, I never, I swear...
JOANIE: You liar!

450
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,024
I don't know what
she's talking about.
Get out of my house.

451
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,291
You skeeve me,
you son of a bitch!

452
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,957
Joanie, stop hollering.

453
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,933
Are you taking his side?
I'm not taking anyone's side.

454
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,128
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on!

455
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,568
I want him out of my house!

456
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,663
No one's going out anywhere,
just stop!

457
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,764
Everyone quiet.

458
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,866
Now, Whitey,
were you checking her out
or not?

459
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,968
I wasn't.

460
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,340
He says he wasn't staring
at your rack, Joanie.

461
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,506
Maybe you made a mistake.

462
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,482
Yeah. Maybe I made a mistake

463
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,883
when I heard him
call you a gimp.

464
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,310
Did you do that, Whitey?

465
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,617
Come on, Jimmy,
she doesn't like me.

466
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,817
WHITEY: I don't know why.

467
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,722
Sure you didn't say that?

468
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,888
'Cause people say that
behind my back all the time.
It's not a big deal.

469
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,989
He called you a gimp.

470
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,967
Jimmy, I swear...
You are a liar!

471
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,128
Joanie!

472
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,570
No more throwing cups,
no more hollering,
that's it!

473
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,663
You suck.

474
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,902
I can't believe you believe
a skank like this over me.

475
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,102
Joanie.

476
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,111
He's my new
business associate.

477
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,873
If the scumbag was checking
you out inappropriately,

478
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,940
he'd tell me.

479
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,584
Right, Whitey?
Right.

What?

482
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,055
You want me to take $2,500

00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,891
on a $5,000 dollar bet
that Maxwell made?

484
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,525
It wasn't even your bet
to begin with, Jimmy.

485
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,827
It's a good deal.

486
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,959
For you, maybe,
'cause you're the jerk
who believes this guy.

Dad, I don't understand,
just please tell me what...

488
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,199
You want me to take $2,500?
Fine, I'll take $2,500.

489
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,209
You want to know why?
Because Maxwell is a welcher.

490
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,609
He's not even gonna have
half that.

491
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,512
What he is gonna have is that
gun underneath the counter.

492
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,846
If there are
no deposit receipts,

493
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,079
and no ATM records,
then maybe they're right.

494
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,314
Maybe you didn't make
the deposits.

495
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,822
What are you doing, Jenny?

496
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,122
You calling your father
a liar?

497
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,223
No. I'm saying I don't know
how we're gonna pay our bills.

498
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,230
It wasn't just the butcher,
it's every single one
of our vendors.

499
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,066
It's our dairy...

500
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,531
You better take this.

501
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,331
No, I'm not gonna need it.

502
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,900
You will if you want
to get my money.

503
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,407
Don't worry,
I'm gonna get the money.

504
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,047
Get your brother.

505
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,088
Yo, Seanie, dinner!

506
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,623
I could've done that.

507
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,428
What are you so happy about?

508
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,257
Been calling Kim all day.

509
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,968
I can't get her to return
the call.

510
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,937
I don't understand it.

511
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,939
You know what I think it is?

512
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,066
I think that she saw me
get my ass kicked.

513
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,737
Either that or the fact
that Mom threatened to kick
Kim's ass

514
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,280
if she ever
came around here again.

515
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,674
Did you do that, Ma?

516
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,774
You should be grateful
she's out of your life.

00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,549
You're going back to school,
you'll have no time for girls.

518
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,761
I wish you hadn't
done that, Ma.

519
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,525
I wish your father
was still alive
and I lived in the country.

520
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,092
Eat!

521
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,482
JENNY: Dad!

522
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,723
What are you doing?

523
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,990
What?

524
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,067
You're putting the money
in the mailbox.

525
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,866
What are you talking about?
I'm making a deposit.

526
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,902
You're at the mailbox.

527
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,535
Dad, the bank's over there.

528
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,276
Oh!

529
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,282
I guess
I got a little confused.

530
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,222
Thought I was gonna
mail a letter,

531
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,792
but I was going to the bank.

532
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,893
Lucky thing you stopped me.

533
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,129
Yeah.

534
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,766
No big deal.

535
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,070
Okay.

536
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,608
Let's go home.

537
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,771
Okay.

538
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,376
Here. Deposit this.

539
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,807
Hey.
Don't try to be nice, Tommy.

540
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,776
I know why you're here.

541
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,175
Did Eddie send you?
No, he didn't send me, Tommy.

542
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,874
I came on my own.

543
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,844
Eddie's afraid to come.

544
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,779
He thought Jimmy'd be here.

545
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,321
I'm sorry, Mary Ann.

546
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,822
I wish he wouldn't have
told you.

547
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,187
I wish you would've told me.

548
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,748
I'm trying to
take care of it.

549
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,919
He turned his life around,
Tommy.

550
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,357
I know he gambled again.

551
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,298
But he gave up the drink
and all the other stuff.

552
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,358
He turned out to be
a good husband.

553
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,199
I know you never liked him.

554
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,705
But Eddie's
a good guy at heart.

555
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,732
And I'm asking you
to do me a favor.

556
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,801
Don't let Jimmy hurt him.

557
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,750
It's all there.
The whole 500.

558
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,156
Five hundred?

559
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,591
That's what he lost, right?
Five hundred.

560
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,332
I'll give it to Jimmy.

561
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,172
You deserve better.

562
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,235
Maybe.

563
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,306
But he's what I got.

564
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,200
WHITEY: Customer asks
for our betting line,

565
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,895
you give this line,
the one that I make up.

566
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,461
Always make sure
to check the board
before you give the line,

567
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,302
I could've just changed it.

568
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,002
All right,
customer places a bet,
you confirm.

569
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,476
Always make them
repeat the bet

570
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,013
before you turn off
the recorder.

571
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,343
We good?

572
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,404
I like the Jets at
seven and a half.

573
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,677
Whoa! You can't bet.

574
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,480
Why not? I'm good for it.
Jimmy.

575
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,952
If we start taking bets
from ourselves,

576
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,646
the whole business is
gonna go south.

577
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,883
It's like a dealer
doing his own junk,
it just can't happen, okay?

578
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,186
We gotta be clear about this,
Jimmy.

579
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,590
Shut up, Whitey,
he's not gonna bet.

580
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,992
What, you think
he's an idiot?

581
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,394
Kevin,
you're not allowed to bet.

582
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,897
That sucks.

583
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,491
What about customers?

584
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,728
We can't just rely on
Louie's people.

585
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,532
Yeah, I mean,
especially since

586
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:07,866
we haven't been paying off
the winners.

587
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,338
Whoa, whoa,
that's gotta stop.

588
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,102
We have to pay off
the winners.

589
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,201
A book works on
its reputation.

590
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,336
You know what?

591
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,379
Just because you know
a thing or two,
don't get smart with me.

592
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,710
'Cause it'll take me
about a half a minute

593
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,683
to throw you
through the window.

594
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,619
Okay. You don't want
to pay the winners,
don't pay them.

595
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,621
I didn't say
I wasn't gonna pay them.

596
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,624
I'm just telling you
not to tell me to pay them.

597
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,126
Thank you.

598
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,222
Where do we find
new customers?

599
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,267
I know a lot of gamblers,
I'll start passing the word.

600
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,199
You don't want gamblers.

601
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,736
You want losers.

602
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,396
My name is Chris,

603
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,100
I haven't made a bet
in sixteen weeks.

604
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,135
I always felt lucky.

605
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,644
No matter how many times
I lost the rent,

606
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,181
or my kids went hungry,

607
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,241
or how many bets
I lost in a row.

608
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,514
I was always sure...
He remind you of anybody?

609
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,521
...that fortune would
smile down on me...
No.

610
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,716
He doesn't remind you
of anybody?

611
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:00,848
...and that my whole life
would turn around.

612
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,014
But that day never came.

613
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,255
You're making
a point, right?

614
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,294
Hey, Whitey,
how much more
of this crap

615
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,266
we gotta sit through?

616
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,394
WHITEY: So I'm like,
"I don't even watch
the games anymore."

617
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,597
That's how not into betting
I am.
MAN 1: Right.

618
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,764
But this guy,
he don't let up,

619
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,705
he's like, you know...
He gives me his number,

620
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,606
he gives me his card,
he gives me...

621
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,474
He gives me a code.

622
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,138
I'm like,
"I don't bet anymore.

623
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,682
"What part of that
don't you understand?"

624
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,014
Lmagine that? Yeah.

625
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,713
But, okay, I admit,
I gotta admit,

626
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,254
if I ever did get back
into betting,

627
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,846
this is the guy
that I would bet with.

628
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,720
Two-to-one,
his lines are way off.

629
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,761
I'd be hitting middles
left and right with this guy,

630
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,091
you know, making a fortune.

631
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,495
What's his name?
Who?

632
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,830
The guy.
Oh, the guy with the office?

633
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,496
He gave me his card,
I got, like,
a ton of them right here.

634
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,300
Really?
Give me one.

635
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,504
MAN 2: Let me see one.
MAN 3: Can I get one, as well?

636
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,703
Yeah, me too.
You never know, right?

637
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,003
Never know!
WOMAN:
Can I see one of those?

638
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,980
Yes.
All right, thanks.

639
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,915
What the hell
are we doing here?

640
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,827
Don't even think about it,
Vinnie.

641
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,390
(GROANS)

642
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,435
I tell you to start a war?

643
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,601
(GROANS)

644
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,716
Where are you?

645
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,676
Where are you?

646
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,088
(GROANS)

647
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,453
Tell me what this place is.

648
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,992
I don't know!

649
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,460
That's right, you don't know.

650
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,063
I tell you to do something,

651
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,099
I expect you to do it,
you understand?

652
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,326
You understand?

653
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,071
You okay?
Get off me.

654
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,408
Guy had a gun to my head,
what am I gonna do?

655
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,851
You could've died!

656
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,459
What the hell is this place?

657
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,105
<i>JOEY. Tommy hated Jimmy for</i>
<i>getting him into this mess.</i>

658
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,117
<i>He hated Maxwell for</i>
<i>being such a lying scumbag.</i>

659
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,780
<i>He even hated Mary Ann</i>
<i>for being the nice girl</i>
<i>that she was.</i>

660
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,618
<i>There was only one person</i>
<i>he didn't hate.</i>

661
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,852
<i>And even if he couldn't</i>
<i>admit it to himself,</i>

662
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,221
<i>she was the only reason</i>
<i>he went in to get the money.</i>

663
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,164
Hey!
I want the money.

664
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,567
Hey. Take it easy, Tommy,
I can explain.

665
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,604
No, I want the money.

666
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,103
I gave you everything I had.

667
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,005
$500 is all you have?

668
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,173
No, you're a liar.

669
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,506
Know what?

670
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,807
Fine. I'm a liar.

671
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,203
Now what?

672
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,378
Oh, you beat me up, Tommy?

673
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,579
No, I'm sorry, that's not you,
that's your brother Jimmy,
right?

674
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,052
You know what?

675
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,851
Maybe next time
Jimmy comes around,

676
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,221
I'll have a real gun
under the counter.

677
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,066
You're gonna shoot me?

678
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,698
You're gonna shoot me, Eddie?

679
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,797
Where's the safe?
What?

680
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:37,898
Where's the safe
you have all the money...

681
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,466
I don't have a safe, okay?

682
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,202
Where's the safe?
Over there!

683
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,269
(SCREAMING)

684
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,616
Count out 5,000.

685
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,250
<i>JOEY. The thing about</i>
<i>helping people is</i>

686
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,192
<i>you can only take it so far.</i>

687
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,561
<i>And then you start</i>
<i>hurting them.</i>

688
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,395
Oh, my God.
No, I never...

689
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,179
JENNY: Hey.

690
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,287
Hey, how you doing?

691
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,845
This your regular route?

692
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,357
Yeah, why?
Can I help you
with something?

693
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,460
You do all the pickups here?

694
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,018
Yeah, that's right.

695
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,494
It's not there today, huh?

696
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,792
You disappointed?

697
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,165
I don't know what you're
talking about, lady.
Sure you do.

698
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,635
Because every week
for the last six weeks,

699
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,502
you found
a night deposit pouch
in there full of money.

700
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,701
It belonged to my father!

701
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,869
It had his name on it,
it had the bank's name on it.

702
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,674
Now I want it back,
every penny.

703
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,113
Lady, I don't know what
you're talking about.

704
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,844
We both know you do.

705
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,246
It's not your money.
It's our money.

706
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,955
Please, give it back.

707
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,253
Lady, if you lost some mail

708
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,420
then why don't you call
this number?

709
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,722
No, I called
the post office.

710
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:39,888
They said nothing's
been turned in.

711
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,727
That means you found it
and you kept it.

712
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:42,993
Look, you think
I did something wrong,

713
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,125
why don't you file
a complaint?

714
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,670
They got rooms
full of people down there
to handle that kind of stuff.

715
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,365
Now excuse me,
I got a schedule to keep.

716
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,374
How can you live
with yourself?

717
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,411
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

718
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:55,768
(GROANS)

719
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,545
<i>JOEY. Jack Trevor was</i>
<i>a neighborhood guy made good.</i>

720
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,516
<i>He went from union delegate</i>

721
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,919
<i>to district leader</i>
<i>to city councilman</i>

722
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,456
<i>before he was 35.</i>

723
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,252
Best hot dogs in the city
down here.

724
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,089
Better than Frankie Balls
in the neighborhood,
don't you think?

725
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,255
Yeah, it's a great hot dog.

726
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,760
So what's on your mind,
councilman?

727
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,323
Come on, let's walk.

728
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,261
You know what makes them
the best?

729
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,498
The onions.
He puts chili pepper in.

730
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,972
From Paraguay.

731
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,875
I asked him once, every day
for a year I asked him,

732
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,809
he finally gave it up.

733
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,403
So ever since that day,

734
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:34,212
I been exploring buying
chili pepper from Paraguay.

735
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,377
You know why?

736
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,215
I don't know,
'cause you like hot dogs?

737
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,052
I wanted his secret.

738
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,487
You know a man's secrets,
you know him.

739
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,023
You know,
I can smell that you're

740
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,465
trying to make a point,
Jack, so...

741
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,562
I'm sorry about Huey.

742
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,698
But you guys weren't
very close, were you?

743
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,046
We didn't always
see eye-to-eye,

744
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,843
but he was my brother,
you know?

745
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,281
Yeah, but you weren't close,

746
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,681
because if you were,

747
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:12,348
then Jimmy Whalen
and Harry Doyle
and Mike Flynn

748
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,481
would still be alive
and working in your hall,

749
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,753
instead of having
their blood-spattered bodies

750
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,193
all over the front pages
of the city's newspapers.

751
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,730
That doesn't help, Dokey.

752
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,095
That kind of thing
doesn't help.

753
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,031
That's what Huey knew.

754
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,533
Yeah, well, don't worry,
I'm gonna take care of that.

755
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,539
Now that would be a mistake.
But how would you know that?

756
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,440
Because you and your brother
weren't close.

757
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,335
If you were,

758
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,175
he would've told you
the reasons

759
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,841
why he and Sal Minnetta
fought so damn hard

760
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:42,687
to keep the peace between us
and the Italians.

761
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,177
Well, why don't you
give me one?

762
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,880
A secret or a reason?

763
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,421
You pick, Jack.

764
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,621
I'll give you
a hundred million of them.

765
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,156
And then you're gonna
break your ass

766
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,927
to give me back
the peace that your brother
and Sal set up.

767
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,470
Finish your dog and then
we'll stop by my office.

768
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,505
<i>JOEY. People say,</i>
<i>in the old days,</i>

769
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,441
<i>Jack, Bobby Donnelly,</i>

770
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,944
<i>and Huey Farrell</i>
<i>were pretty tight.</i>

771
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:11,315
<i>The fact that Jack Trevor</i>
<i>was the last one standing</i>

772
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,714
<i>surprised nobody.</i>

773
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,495
Maxwell's paid up.

774
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,058
Look at you.

775
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,125
I want a cut.

776
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,671
No problem.

777
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,236
Half.

778
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,332
Oh, Tommy got a taste, huh?

779
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,808
Half, Jimmy.

780
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,414
Dude, what's the deal
with this jerk?

781
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,180
Why are we letting him
get away with this?

782
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,656
You let him
get away with that?

783
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,321
Jeez!

784
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,330
Joey, get me another beer.

785
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,064
Get Whitey a towel, he's
bleeding all over my floor.

786
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,997
<i>JOEY. Me? I wasn't afflicted</i>

787
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,304
<i>with the help disease</i>
<i>like Tommy was,</i>

788
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,867
<i>so I let Whitey stew a bit.</i>

789
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,178
<i>And even though Jenny</i>
<i>had told Tommy</i>

790
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,219
<i>she didn't need his help</i>

791
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,810
<i>when it came to Jenny,</i>

792
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,357
<i>Tommy just didn't know</i>
<i>how not to try.</i>

793
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,553
$8.25.

794
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,163
Hey.

795
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,106
Listen, I found this
in the bathroom.

796
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,367
Weirdest thing.

797
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,969
It fell out from
behind the tank,

798
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,844
like somebody stashed it
back there or something.

799
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,611
Like my dad?
Beats me.

800
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,951
Only if it were my dad,

801
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,489
it would be
in a night deposit pouch.

802
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,355
It's a lot of money.

803
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,821
Yeah.

804
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,327
Where'd you get it?

805
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,298
Like I said,
in the bathroom.

806
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,230
Yeah, sure.
I don't want your money.

807
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,398
It's not my money.

808
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,730
What'd you do?

809
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,209
What did you do
to get that money?

810
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,005
Something terrible, right?

811
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,209
You don't want the money,
Jenny, you can burn it.

812
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,754
So, guys, anything else
I can help you with?

813
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,321
I'm here to serve.

814
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,061
You got that right.
