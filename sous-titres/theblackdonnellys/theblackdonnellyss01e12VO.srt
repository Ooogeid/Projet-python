1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:03,766
How many times
can I tell you this?

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,566
All right, just one more.

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:07,230
<i>I know you remember</i>
<i>Jenny Reilly,</i>

4
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,172
<i>but do you remember</i>
<i>she was a married woman?</i>

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,766
Your husband
was a louse.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,913
<i>Since her husband</i>
<i>robbed drug dealers,</i>
<i>when he disappeared,</i>

7
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:14,902
<i>nobody went looking.</i>

8
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,710
JENNY: Bug off, Joey.
Yeah, you got it!

9
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:17,875
<i>Tommy Donnelly's been looking</i>

10
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,351
<i>for who's been condemning</i>
<i>all the buildings in</i>
<i>the neighborhood.</i>

11
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,750
<i>Especially Reilly's Diner.</i>

12
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,823
Don't let them
take my diner.

13
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,050
<i>But everything's a dead end.</i>

14
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,853
KEVIN: Lambert's office
was here yesterday, right?

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,588
<i>See, nobody wanted</i>
<i>Tommy asking questions.</i>

16
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,822
<i>Especially Dokey.</i>

17
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,990
<i>You remember Tommy and</i>
<i>Dokey were partners now.</i>

18
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,364
<i>So Dokey gave Tommy</i>
<i>a little friendly advice.</i>

19
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,062
You ask too many questions.

20
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,627
You wanna die
like your father?

21
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,229
<i>Helen told the same story,</i>

22
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,773
<i>with illustrations.</i>

23
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,665
<i>But Tommy wouldn't</i>
<i>leave it alone.</i>

24
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,836
<i>He had to know</i>
<i>who killed his father.</i>

25
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:46,879
Who did it?

26
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,969
(GRUNTS)

27
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,946
Some answers are
better left unquestioned.

28
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,217
I got stabbed! Stabbed!

29
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,449
I'm in protective
custody.

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,889
What kind of
protection is that?

31
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,324
Oh, my God,
I hate blood.

32
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,827
Don't be such a baby.

33
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,332
"Baby"? Let's see
how brave you are
when it's your blood!

34
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,163
I wanna be
clear on one thing.
I could have taken him.

35
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,534
But he caught me
in the shower! I mean,
who can fight naked?

36
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,599
I'm gonna stitch
you up now.

37
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,800
Could you put me
to sleep first?

38
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,740
'Cause, uh, I think
that might help.

39
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,177
Talk to me.
Tell me a story.

40
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,584
Nobody has ever
asked me that before.

41
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,052
It will take your mind
off what I'm doing.

42
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,583
Okay.

43
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,320
My friends had
a contract out on me.

44
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,423
They weren't
always like that.

45
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,295
It's something
Tommy Donnelly
had to learn.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,059
Joey, what are you doing?

47
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,902
I'm listening.

48
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,529
To what?
Nothing, I'm on hold.

49
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,938
Trust me,
I'm gonna get this.

50
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,164
(FLOOR CREAKS)

51
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,838
Ah!
Damn it!

52
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,436
Why does it give
you so much pleasure
to do that?

53
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,277
It's the oldest
bit in the world.

54
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,647
It's a good bit,
I like the bit.

55
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,617
So what's the big plan?

56
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,789
We're going after Lino.

57
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,792
Lino? That guy that
condemned Reilly's diner?

58
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,828
Yeah.

59
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,395
Tommy, there's more to life
than Reilly's Diner.

60
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,091
For instance,
I wanna know more
about these corporations.

61
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,634
Now, if Dokey's making
all this money, maybe we
can get some of it.

62
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,136
<i>JOEY. Actually, Tommy was</i>
<i>way past helping Reilly.</i>

63
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,501
He was this close
to finding out who
killed his father.

64
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,098
But he couldn't
tell Jimmy that.

65
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:26,907
Because Jimmy's way of
finding out things often kept
you from finding anything out.

66
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,380
You don't wanna help,
Jimmy, that's okay.

67
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,374
Good. 'Cause I
don't wanna help.

68
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,918
I'll be at the Firecracker.

69
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,010
Good thing, anyways,

70
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,250
'cause me and Mr. Reilly
are going through
a rough patch right now.

71
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,918
Great news.
I know where
this Lino is.

72
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,694
Are you gonna tell us?

73
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,823
Or are you just
gonna keep smiling
like an idiot?

74
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,027
No, I'm...
I'm gonna tell you. I...

75
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,365
Oh, wait.

76
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,304
I just forgot.

77
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,500
No, I'm just kidding!
I'm just kidding! Ow!

78
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,836
(MUFFLED) Come on!
Get off of me!

79
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,369
I don't know why
we're doing this.

80
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,744
It's everything
I learned in high school.

81
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,340
What about the stuff
everybody else learned
after you dropped out?

82
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,443
We're going to spend $23
on a book I don't even need.

83
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,748
$23.90.

84
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,113
What does GED
stand for, anyway?

85
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,693
General Equivalency Diploma.

86
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,020
That's got a nice
ring to it, huh?

87
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,495
They have everything
in here, right?

88
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,294
All the information,
the subjects,

89
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,197
what you need to study,
where you take the test?

90
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,792
All the information,
the particulars?

91
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,303
I can find that out
for myself, Mom.

92
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,965
It's in the book, Seanie,
that's why we're buying it.

93
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,201
Right?

94
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,068
What?

95
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,602
All the information
is in here?

96
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,472
Oh, I don't know.

97
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,543
That's why
he's working in a
bookstore, Seanie.

98
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,610
You want that
to happen to you?

99
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,921
Thank you.

100
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,996
Hey, how's it going?
You sleep good?

101
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,158
Yeah.

102
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,494
So, Jen.

103
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,867
Yeah?

104
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,137
Dad?

105
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,941
Huh?

106
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,886
You were gonna
say something?

107
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,852
About what?

108
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,491
I don't know. You...

109
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,560
You were gonna ask
me something.

110
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,152
Oh. Yeah.

111
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,631
Yeah, right, uh...
Uh, forget it.

112
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,433
Get to work.

113
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,535
Hey, Frankie!
Coffee?

114
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,508
Nah, not today, thanks.

115
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,010
Hey, Jenny?

116
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,871
Everything okay?

117
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,973
Yeah, well,
maybe not.

118
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,245
You might say I got bad news.

119
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,977
Yeah?

120
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,179
What's going
on, Frankie?

121
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,655
All of a sudden you're
sounding like a cop.
I don't like that.

122
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,021
Dad!

123
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,059
Jenny, we found a body.

124
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,220
Body?

125
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,993
And we think it might
be your husband.

126
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,463
Teach?

127
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,933
<i>(GUNSHO TS)</i>

128
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,012
Jenny had heard
the rumors

129
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,714
that some drug dealers
had killed Teach and
stuffed him in an oil drum.

130
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,483
<i>But who wants to</i>
<i>believe in a rumor?</i>

131
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,650
FRANKIE: The remains
were unidentifiable.

132
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,229
It was a male
in his mid-twenties.

133
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:36,264
These belongings were
found on what was
left of his body.

134
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,926
"T.C." is on the money clip.

135
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,063
That could be
for "Tommy Corcoran."

136
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,472
Teach have a
money clip like this?

137
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,701
Yeah, he had
a money clip,

138
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,643
I don't remember
the initials, though.
I don't...

139
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,772
Can she take it
out of the bag?

140
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,577
Uh-uh. No.

141
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,108
What would be good is
if you could tell us if these
other possessions were his.

142
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,378
Uh...

143
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,458
You can pick them up
if it helps.

144
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,059
Yeah, I...
I guess that
could be his belt.

145
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,565
Take your time.

146
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,396
Really look
at these pieces.

147
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,206
(WHISPERING)
I don't know.

148
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,810
I don't know.

149
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,282
Is that his?

150
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,785
It's hard to tell.

151
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,123
It's not like we went
to Tiffany's, you know?

152
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,682
A lot of people
could have that ring.

153
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,954
Yeah.

154
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,893
And it doesn't match yours.

155
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,363
Oh, we didn't have
matching bands.

156
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,024
I used my mom's.

157
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,804
All right. Well, we can
call this inconclusive.

158
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,870
All right. I'll check
our dental records.

159
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,739
What would be better,
is if you had something
we could use

160
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,676
for a DNA comparison.

161
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,780
We threw all
his crap out.

162
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,475
I'll look around.

163
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,812
Thanks.

164
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,914
And you, you're getting
a little too cranky
for your own good.

165
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,730
I'm okay, Dad.

166
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,790
I didn't say
you weren't.

167
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,166
I don't feel bad.

168
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,102
I don't feel anything.

169
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,706
Okay, now I feel bad.

170
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,975

00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,191
In the back.

177
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,191
<i>JOEY. Actually, Janowski</i>
<i>was tied up underneath</i>
<i>the counter.</i>

178
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,392
<i>Which is why Tommy was</i>
<i>able to throw on a smock</i>

179
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,096
<i>and show Lino all the</i>
<i>violations in the back alley.</i>

180
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,364
It's a little
dark back here.

181
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,201
Ah, that's a violation,
too, you know.

182
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,605
You gotta have
brightly lit halls.

183
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,705
Where is he?

184
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,767
(GRUNTS)

185
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,813
Hey! What the
hell's going on?

186
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,296
Hey, Doke!
How are you, partner?

187
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,900
I gotta remember
to lock my doors.

188
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,297
Not really.

189
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,100
Who'd be stupid enough
to get in a car with you?

190
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,141
What do you want, Jimmy?

191
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,771
Listen, I been thinking.

192
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,604
You got a minute?

193
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,906
Sure.

194
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,578
The way I hear it,

195
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,620
things are going a lot
better on your end

196
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,417
than what me and
my brothers thought.

197
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,354
So this 30% deal
that you made with
my brother Tommy...

198
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,725
I'm thinking that was
a bonehead play.

199
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,594
I'm thinking
we can do better.

200
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,767
That's an awful
lot of thinking.

201
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,326
Is this you and your
brother doing all
this thinking?

202
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:02,272
Let's face it, Dokey.
70% on four blocks
is a pretty bad deal.

203
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,239
I say we renegotiate.

204
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,642
Oh, we're gonna
renegotiate something

205
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,703
we just negotiated
a couple days ago?

206
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,113
Like I said,
my brother screwed up.

207
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,651
I'm just trying
to fix things.

208
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,281
Man, you got
a big set of balls
on you, you know that?

209
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,649
If there's one thing
people know about me,

210
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,089
it's I can be trusted.

211
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,652
Ask anybody.

212
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,023
We shake hands on a deal,
the deal's done.

213
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm just asking
for a bigger
piece of the pie.

214
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,730
We're willing
to work for it.

215
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,829
You really wanna
work for it?

216
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,874
Okay.
Okay what?

217
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,035
Okay, I got a job for you.

218
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,136
I got a package that...
You got a problem with drugs?

219
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,371
No.

220
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,279
Good.

221
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,711
You go down to Jimmy Ray's,
you ask for Paddy,

222
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,619
you tell him I sent you,
you get a package,
you deliver the package.

223
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,349
That's the job.

224
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,757
I do this and then what?

225
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,258
You do this,

226
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,962
and then we'll talk
about renegotiating.

227
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,800
You're dead.

228
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,309
I get out of this chair,
I'll knock you runts
ass over teakettle.

229
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,743
What the hell
is this all about?

230
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,246
You're here because
you've been condemning

231
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,509
a lot of buildings
for your friends.

232
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,417
One building in particular,
Reilly's Diner?

233
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,384
You're gonna reverse that.

234
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,753
You dumbbells have
any idea what you've
gotten yourself into?

235
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,825
(GRUNTS)

236
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,222
(COUGHING)

237
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,423
We know who you are.
We know what you do.

238
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,459
Now tell us how to reverse
what you did to Reilly.

239
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,061
Okay, say I take you
seriously for a second.

240
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,662
Good decision.

241
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,139
But what you want,
it can't be done.

242
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,649
It's through
the pipe now!

243
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,447
No, no, come on.

244
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,522
(SCREAMING) No, no!
Come on, stop! All right!
Stop! Come on!

245
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,752
All right! Tell him to stop!
Tell him to stop!

246
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,317
Kevin.
All right! Ow!

247
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,723
Burnt hair stinks.

248
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:05,821
(GASPS)

249
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,993
Whoa, look at that.

250
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,368
It's like a happy face,
Tommy.

251
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,707
Cool.

252
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,799
Let's do it again.
No!

253
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,776
No, don't do it again!
Don't do it again! Okay!

254
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,402
Okay, okay.

255
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,479
It can be done,
but it's crazy difficult.

256
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,141
You have to go
to the Buildings Department,

257
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,377
fill out a request
for reappraisal.

258
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,114
Then you gotta get an
inspector to reevaluate,
one of my guys,

259
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,849
then that paperwork
comes back to me,
I gotta sign,

260
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,117
then my office
has to reissue.

261
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,489
Gonna take a minimum,
minimum, six to nine weeks.

262
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,530
Great. We need it
done today.

263
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,162
It can't be done.

264
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,847
Uptown, downtown,
the Russians
and the Irish.

265
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,885
Plus, I got a nice
surprise for you.

266
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,214
Surprise?

267
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,592
And you say I never
take the initiative!

268
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:12,127
If I wanted you
to do prep work,
I would have asked you.

269
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,959
What? We haven't changed
our minds on this
Alo thing, have we?

270
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,525
Absolutely not.

271
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,699
We're not gonna need this.

272
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,203
We could drown
him in his pool.

273
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,677
I'd rather drown
you in his pool.

274
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,475
Could you explain
to me please why
that's such a bad idea?

275
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,284
What's important here?

276
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,756
To kill Alo
before he kills us.

277
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,257
And after that?

278
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,022
Bury the body.
Which is why I
prepped the trunk!

279
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,756
You missed a step.

280
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,791
Right! Nobody can know
that we did it because
then we'd get whacked.

281
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:50,893
Bingo.

282
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,062
So now what's the plan?

283
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,574
The only thing I know
for sure is that I do not
want Alo in my trunk.

284
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,549
I don't feel so good.

285
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,214
Get up.

286
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,584
Where you been?

287
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,284
I missed you.

288
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,620
Yeah, right.

289
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,861
Come on. Let's go.

290
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,727
I'll take care of you.

291
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,878
Come on! I'm in a hurry!

292
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,310
Gotta go, gotta go!

293
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,045
Hey!
Hey.

294
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,280
Is Ma here?
I wanted her
to meet Nadine.

295
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,549
How about me meeting Nadine?

296
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,919
I'm Jimmy, Sean's brother.

297
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,993
Actually, we met.
I sold you a jukebox.

298
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,924
Oh, you're the jukebox girl!

299
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,962
Nadine.

300
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,088
What, you guys
are hanging out now?

301
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,859
Seanie, are
those books?

302
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,835
You're a bad influence
on my brother!

303
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,336
She's gonna tutor me.

304
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,600
In what, though?
That's the question, huh?

305
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,767
(JIMMY LAUGHING)
What the hell is so funny?

306
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,334
Oh, hey.
Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was here.

307
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,007
Jeez, Joanie!
Seanie, I'm sorry.

308
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,316
Come on,
we're leaving.

309
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,079
What do you mean, leaving?

310
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,280
I didn't even
say hello yet.

311
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,946
Hi, Seanie!

312
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,456
Hey, Joanie.

313
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,582
Hi!

314
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:22,885
Nice to meet you, Joanie.

315
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,054
We should get going,
come back later
when Ma's here?

316
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,622
Sure. It was nice
meeting you again.

317
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,370
Come on.

318
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,561
You're going home.

319
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,834
What...

320
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,068
You're coming
with me, right?

321
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,370
No.

322
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,205
I want you
to take a shower.

323
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,907
Clean your pits,
put some makeup on.

324
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,373
Why?

325
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,713
Just get it together
and meet me at
the Firecracker later.

326
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,447
Are you mad at me?

327
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,260
Joanie, I got
something good going.

328
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,285
And I want you
to be with me.

329
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,058
But you gotta stop acting
like a crack whore.

330
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,430
You talk to anyone?

331
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,236
I haven't gotten
up there yet.

332
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,936
You don't have
to wait in line.
Just go up there

333
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,774
and show them
Lino's business card
like he told us to do.

334
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,438
No. I'm not cutting
the line, Tommy.

335
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,741
I hate people
who cut the line.

336
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,817
Give me the card.

337
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,886
People aren't gonna like it,
that's all I'm saying.

338
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,647
What an ass!

339
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,817
Now, what's this?
The line's back there, buddy.

340
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,656
Anthony Lino asked me
to give that to you.

341
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,128
Just a second.

342
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,227
I don't have a second.

343
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,000
You're gonna have to.

with this rough stuff,
so don't make me nervous.

00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,754
No, now.

349
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,593
It's gotta be done
in one hour,
no longer.

350
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,895
<i>All the people</i>
<i>I got waiting,</i>
<i>one hour? Today?</i>

351
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,334
Yeah, today!
Just do what
I'm telling you!

352
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,551
As I understand it,
a buildings inspector will
be there for a reappraisal?

353
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,121
That's correct.
John Fergus.

354
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,122
He'll be at the diner
at noon.

355
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,452
Give him this.

356
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,406
Hey, how you doing?
Is Paddy here?

357
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,081
Someone here to see you.

358
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,183
What's up?

359
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,552
Jimmy Donnelly.

360
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,121
Dokey sent me.

361
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,586
Nah, he didn't tell me
he was sending somebody new.

362
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,719
Who said I was new?

363
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,626
Oh, hey, take it easy.

364
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,792
We left the war over there
with the Arabs.

365
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,167
Look, can we just
get this done?

366
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,639
You got a package
for me, right?

367
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,040
Yeah, but it's gonna be a bit.

368
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,136
I'll buy you a drink.
Leo, couple of Irish whiskeys.

369
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,373
Nothing for me.

370
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,542
Leo, say hello
to Jimmy Donnelly.
He's with Dokey.

371
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,846
Hey, Jimmy,
nice to meet you.

372
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,977
Hey.

373
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,715
You sure? It's gonna be
20 minutes, half hour.

374
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,159
All right. No problem.

375
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,263
On the house, Jimmy!

376
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,628
<i>JOEY. Funny thing</i>
<i>about Teach's scarf</i>

377
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,137
<i>is that it didn't start out</i>
<i>as his scarf.</i>

378
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,400
It's not too pretty, is it?

379
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,170
No, I can work with this.

380
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,942
Okay, then.

381
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,770
Happy birthday!

382
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,082
It's a great scarf.

383
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,188
Good night.

384
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,887
Get out!

385
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,633
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yup.

386
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,130
<i>JOEY. It was the best</i>
<i>birthday Tommy Donnelly</i>
<i>ever had.</i>

387
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,378
<i>It lasted for all of</i>
<i>17 and a half seconds.</i>

388
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,610
Hey.

389
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,347
I'm freezing my ass off
out here.

390
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,422
Yeah.

391
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,150
So I'm gonna get
right to the point.

392
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,317
Stay away
from my daughter.

393
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,684
Excuse me?

394
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,852
Stay away.

395
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,897
And not a word to Jenny
about this conversation.

396
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,023
Why?

397
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,691
Because I don't like you.

398
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,403
With all due respect,
sir, you can't tell me
what to do.

399
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,732
Here.

400
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,166
What's that?

401
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,609
Your payoff.

402
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,712
You're just like your
old man, so I figure
you'll take it.

403
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,276
I paid your father
so his animals wouldn't
bust up my diner.

404
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,224
Now I'm paying you
to stay away from
my daughter.

405
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,886
My father wouldn't
do anything like that.
Okay?

406
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,955
You think that?
Think it.

407
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,623
But I got the scars
to prove that I'm right.

408
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,928
And I'm gonna show them
to my Jenny.

409
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,070
Who do you think she's
gonna believe, you or me?

410
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,935
She's gonna hate you.

411
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,069
I'll make sure of that.

412
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,408
Why are you doing this?

413
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,236
Because you're his blood.

414
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,837
You're the same as he was.

415
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,542
Reilly was threatening
to make Jenny hate Tommy

416
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,313
the way Reilly
hated Tommy's father.

417
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,115
And Tommy would
never admit it to anyone

418
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,918
but he knew
Reilly could do it.

419
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,754
So this, uh,
"boyfriend" thing

420
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,852
ends now!

421
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,804
They said this wall
was damaged.

422
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,073
Does it look
damaged to you?

423
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,116
Nope. No, it doesn't.
Looks solid as a rock.

424
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,652
The whole building could
have been put up last week.

425
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,744
I've been thinking.

426
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,823
It's probably better
if you leave some
things to me.

427
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,982
What things?

428
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,752
Like the way I
did with Franny.

429
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,818
You don't know
where I put him
and that's a good thing.

430
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,658
This way if anything
happens down the line,

431
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,097
you can honestly
say you don't know.

432
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,258
Kevin...

433
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,527
I'm figuring we should
do the same thing with Lino.

434
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,003
Let's just get what we
need out of Lino.

435
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,164
And worry about
the rest later.

436
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,731
We can't keep him
in the cellar forever.

437
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,472
These sons of bitches
condemn my building without
even inspecting it.

438
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,674
Now they tell me it's okay
without inspecting it.

439
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,240
How do you people
live with yourselves?

440
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,751
Buddy, take it easy
with the insults.

441
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,922
Well, hallelujah,
the bastard looked up
from his clipboard.

442
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,014
Mr. Reilly,

443
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,216
do you want me to
take care of this?

444
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,815
You should go have
a cup of coffee.

445
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,101
Okay, I submit
the papers today,

446
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,467
you got a six-week
turnaround.

447
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,301
Six weeks doesn't work.

448
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,364
We need to get it
through today.

449
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,410
(LAUGHING)
What, are you
all crazy in here?

450
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,242
Something like this,
you gotta go through
the proper channels.

451
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,283
Anthony Lino said you
could get it done today.

452
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,784
Yeah, well, Lino lied.
Take it up with him.

453
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,121
Tommy, should I
take care of this?

454
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,679
No, I got it, Kevin.

455
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,085
How much?

456
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,625
(CHUCKLING)
What, to get it
done today?

457
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,718
Yeah.

458
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,659
(CHUCKLING)

459
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,823
That's a tall order.

460
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,432
Okay.

461
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,572
It's my kid's birthday.

462
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,037
He wants a BMW.

463
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,669
A BMW?

464
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,943
A $60,000 car?

465
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,449
That's why I can't
buy it for him.

466
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,311
You asked me
for the impossible,

467
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,876
I'm asking you
for the impossible.

468
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,728
<i>JOEY. The stupidest people</i>
<i>in the world are rich people.</i>

469
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,034
<i>They'll hand over 20 bucks</i>
<i>and a brand new BMW</i>

470
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,976
<i>to any idiot</i>
<i>with a windbreaker</i>
<i>and a tucked-in shirt.</i>

471
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,241
<i>In this case,</i>
<i>the idiots were</i>
<i>Kevin and Tommy.</i>

472
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,548
(TIRES SQUEALING)

473
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,957
That was gonna
take six weeks?

474
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,689
My end's done.
Rest is up to Lino.

475
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,292
We'll be back.

476
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,070
Who wrote
the <i>Federalist Papers?</i>

477
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,802
That color looks good on you.

478
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,366
(CHUCKLING) Shut up
and answer the question.

479
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,468
I know this.

480
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,480
I'll just put it on the test
when the time comes.

481
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,077
All right, um,
there were 85.

482
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,744
Mmm.
Alexander Hamilton wrote 52,

483
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,914
James Madison wrote 28,
John Jay wrote five.

484
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,490
And who was John Jay?

485
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,081
I have no idea.

486
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,286
Who the hell are you?

487
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,488
Ma, I want you
to meet somebody.

488
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,531
Hi.

489
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,826
Uh, Nadine,
this is my mom.

490
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,834
Mrs. Donnelly,
it's nice to meet you.

491
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,699
What's all the charade about?

492
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,965
I'm studying for the GED.
Nadine's helping me.

493
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,971
Yeah, I'll bet she is.

494
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,575
I should go.

495
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,008
No. Stay.

496
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,782
You know what, Ma?
You're embarrassing me.

497
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,950
What?
Nadine's a nice girl.

498
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,213
You're treating her
like she's not.

499
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,344
She's the reason
I went back to school...

500
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,152
Sean. Obviously there's
something going on here
that I don't know about.

501
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:24,285
The last thing I want is
to come between you and
your mom, so I'm gonna go.

502
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,995
Mrs. Donnelly,
it was nice to meet you.

503
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,467
I hope the next time
we see each other it's under
better circumstances.

504
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,495
I'm sorry.

505
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,403
Hey!
Yes?

506
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,408
Where you going?
Sit down.

507
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,637
I'm making pork chops.

508
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,611
You like pork chops,
don't you?

509
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,187
How'd it go?

510
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,416
Frankie said he's
gonna make it happen
quick, you know?

511
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,291
I brought him Teach's
travel kit, a razor,

512
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,393
brush, some other stuff.

513
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,663
It's good that we put
this damn thing behind us.

514
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,665
I don't know why the hell
you ever married that
guy to begin with.

515
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:08,763
Dad.

516
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,307
What? I'm wrong?

517
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,841
(CHUCKLING)

518
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,314
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you almost just made me laugh.

<i>that started out as Tommy's</i>
<i>birthday present?</i>

520

<i>That's the thing about</i>
<i>birthday presents.</i>

521
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,857
<i>Half the time you end up</i>

522
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,160
What, you didn't like it?

523
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,029
It's not that.

524
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,373
What then?

525
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,540
It just wouldn't be
right to take it.

526
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,276
Why not?

527
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,779
I met somebody
a while back, Jenny.

528
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,112
What?

529
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,521
I should have
told you about her.

530
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,524
A girl from school.

531
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,495
It just wouldn't be right.

532
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,326
You know what I mean?

533
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,133
It's just a scarf.
Don't make a big
deal out of it.

534
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,377
Hey, look.

535
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,041
If you care that much
about the guy,

536
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,483
maybe we'll get lucky
and it won't be him.

537
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,987
No. I'm fine.

538
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,523
I'm off tomorrow.

539
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,699
We can go to that movie.

540
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,198
Movie?

541
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,994
Wow, you must feel
really sorry for me

542
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,538

to go see a movie.

My dad is gonna
lend me the car.

544
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,839
Dad, what are
you talking about?

545
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,975
Now, come on, Meredith,
don't make a fool of me now.

546
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,190
I told everybody you and me
were going to a movie.

547
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,623
Okay,

548
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,653
we can go to the movie
if you want.

549
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,293
What?

550
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,671
You a little tired, Dad?

551
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,232
Little bit.

All I wanna say is this.

00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,014
Very soon we're gonna know

555
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,251
if that rat bastard
husband of yours

556
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,324
is gonna be out of our lives
once and for all.

557
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:45,329
And, uh, we'll...
We'll deal with it then.

558
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,722
Okay.

559
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,297
I, uh...

560
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,426

Now, there you go!
That's the one!

568
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,723
The problem with
the double bubble,

569
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:17,091
is you gotta chase down
every jackass on the street
trying to hone in on you!

from the bureaucrats.

make a deal with me.

aren't getting along so well.

him as much as I hate Dokey.

for the future are.

I'm betting you're
not a part of them.

a talk with Lino,

682
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,864
that would be
a good thing.

00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,697

is to know who
killed my father.

688
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,311
What makes you think
I could tell you that?

689
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,410
Okay.

690
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,614
