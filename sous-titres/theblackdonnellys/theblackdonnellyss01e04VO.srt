Jimmy Donnelly was in jail
for armed robbery.

00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,803
Big shot wants
to take over the family,
he just got us all killed!

172
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,709
If Dokey really thought
you killed his brother,
you'd be dead.

173
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,979
He's asking everybody.
He's fishing, Jimmy.

174
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,346
Yeah, with us
he catches something.
You were in jail.

175
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,351
You got an alibi.
What do you gotta
worry about?

176
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,277
You just gotta get suited up,
go to the funeral,

177
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,946
put a rose
on Huey's casket,

178
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,991
and we're gonna get through
this day together, all right?

179
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,187
Nobody's gonna be suspicious
unless we act suspicious.

180
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,691
Did you go to school
to get that stupid?

181
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,929
You know,
you're right, Jimmy.
Get him a gun.

182
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,595
Why don't you wave it around
at Huey's funeral?
Wave it around at his wake.

183
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,331
That's gonna make us all
look really innocent.

184
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,703
I'm beginning to think
the wake's a really
bad idea, Tommy.

185
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,868
Well, you two idiots aren't
actually thinking about going
to Huey's wake, are you?

186
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,303
It's here.

187
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,204
You're lying.

188
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,048
Kate asked
to throw it here.

189
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,948
I said yes.

190
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,088
You gave away my bar
for Huey's wake?

191
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,919
We don't got a choice.
This is done.

192
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,890
You wanna play big man,
Tommy? You go ahead.

193
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,124
Now you're gonna
get out of my way.

194
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,998
You're leaving, too?

195
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,208
No, I'll help.
Really?

196
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,335
We have no money, no food,
and no booze.

197
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,537
What are you
gonna do, Kevin?

198
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,909
I'll get the booze.

199
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,542
How?
Will you give me
a little credit?

200
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,914
You're not the only one
who can handle things, Tommy.

201
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,484
Okay.

202
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,517
Get the booze, Kevin.

203
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,525
Being in charge of stocking
the bar is no small thing.

204
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,798
Which is why Kevin
came to me for help.

205
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,164
This is crazy.
Do we have credit?
Do we have money?

206
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,971
Do we even have a way
to transport the alcohol if
it were to fall from the sky?

207
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,602
You remember
when we were kids
and had a contest

208
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,976
to see who could
shut up the longest?

209
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,537
No. Who won?

210
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,790
Get the hell out.
Why?

211
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,518
Why don't I shoot you
and then explain it?

212
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,322
Who shoots somebody
with a gun in their pocket?

213
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,156
You're stealing my cab?

214
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,756
I know who you are,
you're a Donnelly!
Yeah?

215
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,099
Then you know that me
and my brothers will beat you
to a pulp if you report this.

216
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,503
6:00, cab will be
on this corner.

out of here, Jimmy!

'cause I'm crazy
about you, baby.
Yeah.

222
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,414
Don't tell me that, Jimmy!

223
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,848
If I was such a bad guy,

224
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,450
would I bring you this?

225
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,023
(LAUGHING) Yeah!
Give it.

226
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,270

Hey, Tommy,
what can I get for you?

229
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,648
I gotta ask you a favor.

230
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,294
I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't some kind
of an emergency.

231
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,329
What is it?

232
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,061
It's about Huey's wake.

233
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,656
It's gonna be
at The Firecracker.

234
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,703
But I only found out about it
this morning and we're
completely out of food.

235
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,399
(STAMMERING)
Wait a minute, you're
throwing Huey's wake?

236
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,462
Yeah.

237
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,636
Please tell me you know
how wrong that is.

00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,304

Could we not talk about
this right here?

feel anything?

240
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,043
Do me a favor, okay?

241
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,918
Don't tell me
what I'm feeling.

242
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,355
I promised to throw the wake,
I can't change that.

243
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,955
So you gonna help me or not?

244
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,122
It's for Huey's family,
how can I say no?

245
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,629
Thanks, Jenny.
Yeah.

Hey, Ma.
Have you seen Jimmy yet?

Not yet.

250
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,477

he won't show up.

but we don't need
his kind of trouble.
Not today.

He knows what it's like.

I understand it was
my sister-in-law who asked
you to hold the wake.

have had it in such a dump.

why you're not living up
to your end.

working with you Italians.

listen to me.

he's in here.

could sit with us.

crying in there, okay?

to walk in there,

your head held high.

would've wanted it.

Do you know
what that means?

329
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,460
It means you don't go
showing the world
how you feel.

330

You keep it locked up
real tight.

00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,860
and it just wasn't
the right time.

342
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,568
Does that mean
there might be
a right time?

343
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,808
I'm gonna turn around now.

344
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,672
(WHISPERING)
Hey, handsome.

345
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,913
I want a word
with you.

346
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,056
Over here.

347
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,829
While the Father's up there,
here's what I want you
to think about.

348
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,427
I know that my brother
came to talk to you
in the hospital.

349
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,039
I know that he sent
his driver home,

350
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,030
that he called a cab,

351
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,272
and then he went
straight to Sal's.
Alone.

352
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,510
And he wouldn't do that,
Tommy.

353
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,111
So that tells me
you know why.

354
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,644
I wish I did.

355
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,523
I wish I could help you.

356
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,723
I don't believe you.

357
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,360
(ORGAN PLAYING)

358
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,275
FATHER DUFELT: Let us stand
and share Christ's welcome
with one another.

359
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,175
You get my money
from the mick?

360
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,841
<i>JOEY. Alo was Nicky's boss.</i>

361
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,852
He was upset
about losing Sal.

362
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,217
But losing the deal
Sal had with Huey,

363
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,120
that upset him
a whole lot more.

364
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,323
I gave him
a little more time.

365
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,886
Considering his brother's
funeral and all.

366
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,089
So you figure all business
stops because of a funeral?

367
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,823
What's this,
a birthday party?

368
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,231
I'll have it tomorrow.

369
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,201
Go talk to them.

370
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,874
Hey! Be a little
careful there,
jerk-off!

371
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,933
All of a sudden
he's cozy
with the Irish?

372
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,602
You're not gonna let up,
are you?

373
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,307
He's a first-class scumbag.

374
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,541
He put Sal in that box.

375
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,379
I don't know how he did it,
but he did it.

376
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,249
Maybe. For now, let's see
what kind of earner he is.

377
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,092
(CHUCKLING)

378
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,995
You know, this never
would've happened

379
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,964
if Tommy didn't
get me thrown in jail.

380
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,796
You come here without my money
and this is all you bring me?

381
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,998
What did he have
to go and kill Huey for?

382
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,596
Tommy killed Huey?

383
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,367
Huey Farrell?
I never would've done
anything that stupid!

384
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,368
It was the Italians
that beat up Sean.

385
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,244
It was the Italians
that were coming after me,
not the Irish!

386
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,216
Then we got Dokey
gunning for our ass!

387
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,843
Would you calm down?

388
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,046
You know, if Tommy
would just listen to me

389
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,851
and stop trying
to run things...

390
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,360
This was between me
and the Italians.

391
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,312
Tommy wants me
to go to a funeral.

392
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,982
You got a nice dress?

393
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,087
(GRUNTS)

394
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,591
I always thought
I'd like to drive a cab.

395
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,757
Are you nuts?
Twenty hours
in a confined space,

396
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,895
being told what to do
by the kind of people
who can't even afford a car?

397
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,330
Here we go.

398
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,046
Where do they
keep the liquor?
I don't know.

399
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,309
I thought you said
you'd waitered here.

400
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,078
No, I applied.
Bastards wouldn't hire me

401
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,643
on account of my sketchy
employment record.

402
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,899
KEVIN: Crap!

403
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,440
All we got here
is Jew wine.

404
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:43,763
Are we allowed
to drink this stuff?

405
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:44,831
Who wouldn't allow you,
Kevin?

406
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,275
I don't know!
It's unholy or something.

407
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,108
It's fine!
And it's alcohol too, right?

408
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,512
Yeah, only it's
rabbi-approved alcohol.

409
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,752
What are you guys doing?

410
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,326

(GRUNTS)

412
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,095
I was gonna jump in,
but I saw that you had him.

413
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:10,859
Let us pray for the peaceful
repose of the soul
of Hugh William Farrell.

414
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,634
For his beloved wife,
Katherine Regina Farrell,

415
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,834
his son Matthew William
Hugh Farrell,

416
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,377
and his brother
Derek Timothy Farrell.

417
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,935
We pray to the Lord.

418
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,715
Lord, hear our prayer.

419
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,175
ALL: Lord hear our prayer.

420
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,513
Put it on!
I'm not wearing a tie!

421
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,885
You need to wear
a tie, Dad's dead!

422
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,615
What's the problem?

423
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,784
Uncle Huey, Jimmy's
not gonna wear a tie.

424
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,384
My dad never wore a tie.

425
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,726
Your dad wore a tie
on days like today.

426
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,958
Put it on.

427
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,529
Your mother's waiting.

428
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,699
Let me see this.

429
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,342
There you go.
Nice suit.

430
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,180
Thanks, Uncle Huey.

431
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,813
You know what?

432
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,315
Maybe it's time
you stopped calling me uncle.

433
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,320
You're a man now,
men call each other
by their first names.

434
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,385
Try it.

435
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,458
What's my name?

436
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,155
Huey.

437
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,359
There you go.

438
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,728
Okay?

439
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,972
You know what else
men do?

440
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,574
They take care of their mom
and their brothers,

441
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,871
no matter what.

<i>that one day that little</i>
<i>bit of advice</i>

443
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,413
<i>would be that thing</i>
<i>that got him killed?</i>

FATHER DUFELT: And now
a member of Hugh's family
would like to say a few words.

445
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,380
I'll do it, sweetheart.

446
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,423
What?
Just let me do it.

447
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,658
Stay here.

448
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,076
(STAMMERING)
Huey and I,

449
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,636
we didn't spend...

450
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,213
We didn't spend as much time
in church as we should have.

451
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,151
But Huey was
a God-fearing man.

452
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,081
He was a good father,

453
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,921
he was a good husband,

454
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,248
he was a damn good boss.

455
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,392
And what happened to him
is a sin.

456
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,125
I'm not gonna forget,

457
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,103
for me or for my brother,

458
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,173
that I have
to make this right.

459
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,104
As God is my witness,

460
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,544
I will make this right.

461
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,425
PRIEST: In the name
of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

462

The Lord is my salvation
and my light.

463
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,104
Of whom shall I be afraid?

464
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,902
The Lord is the stronghold
of my life. Whom shall I fear?

465
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,143
(BOTH GIGGLING)
One thing have I asked
of the Lord,

466
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,202
that will I seek after,

467
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,546
We know him?
That I may dwell
in the house of the Lord

468
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:13,945
all the days of my life.

469
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,486
I think it's Jimmy Donnelly.

470
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,327
That's good
what you're doing
with the Irish.

Yeah, real smart,
Nicky.

474
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,171
Make sure the Feds
get a nice shot of you
doing it, too.

475
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:37,166
Come on!
Clean it up, let's go!

476
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,380
Thanks for doing
this, Jenny.

477
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,721

how you doing?

Thanks for helping us out.

Oh, no, it's my pleasure.

the mustard and the potato
salad, please?

Yeah, all right.

I'm not taking
any more fares.

22 East 24th!

00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,168
What's the matter with you,
you didn't hear me?

492
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,969
Yeah, I heard you.
What kind of retarded cabbie

493
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,703
doesn't wanna take
somebody across town?

494
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,911
I'll show you what kind.

495
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,608
You should treat cab drivers
with more respect.

496
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,121
"Kosher."

497
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,056
Thanks, I'm glad
I trusted you.

498
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,494
It's alcohol and it's free,
what more do you want?

499
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,231
We're gonna need some
scotch. And a lot of it.

500
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,326
But we're not going to be
able to pay for it just yet.

501
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,663
Get out of here.

502
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,137
I think you're gonna
wanna give it to us.

503
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,605
Oh, yeah?

504
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,136
And why is that?

505
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,234
Because your daughter
has a crush on Kevin.

506
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,409
He's gonna date her
if you don't.

507

we got scotch!

we stick with what we agreed.

What's going on?

some things together.

is not helping us.

513
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,370
Where the hell are
the guns, Tommy?

514
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,998
Relax. I'm only telling you
this so we can keep
our stories straight.

515
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,974
You know I have
trouble talking
when I get nervous.

516
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,669
I always think so hard
about what I should say...
Kevin!

517
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,804
And I say the wrong thing.
Stop thinking.
Get a drink, okay?

518
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,141
We're gonna
take care of this.

519
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,116
Huey would have
been happy with this.

520
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,753
Yeah?
Turned out okay, huh?

521
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,625
I can't believe
I'm gonna ask you
for one more thing,

522
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,830
but would you mind saying
a few words later?
About Huey?

523
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,598
I know Dokey spoke in church,
but between you and me...

524
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,533
Yeah. That was
pretty interesting.

525
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,037
I know if you say something,
it'll come from the heart.

526
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,805
Sure. Yeah, sure,
I'll say something
if you want me to.

527
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,424
What are you doing here?

528
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,295
I'm waiting for Sean
to wake up.

529
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,597
Well, thanks for
staying with him,

530
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:54,431
but he shouldn't have more
than one visitor at a time
and I'm here now, so...

531
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,907
Okay, sure.

532
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,810
You'll tell him
I was here?

533
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,175
Of course.

534
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,197
(GROANS)

535
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,531
How you doing?

536
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,271
I'm not gonna cry.

537
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,271
You can cry.

538
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,469
Uncle Dokey said I shouldn't.

539
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,903
Oh.

540
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:38,948
He scared you, huh?

541
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,009
Mmm.

542
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,948
You know how Dokey
got his name, right?

543
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,184
No.

544
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,064
You ever heard of the song,
<i>The Hokey Pokey?</i>

545
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,691
Yeah.

546
00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:00,835
Well, your Uncle Derek was
the king of The Hokey Pokey.

547
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,800
So everybody called him
Hokey Pokey Dokey.

548
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,065
(CHUCKLES)

549
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,041
Why don't you think of that
the next time you see him?

550
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,345
You won't be so scared, huh?

551
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,310
All right.

552
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,152
Jenny.
Yeah?

553
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,022
You got a minute?
Can I talk to you
for one second?

554
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,222
Yeah, sure.

555
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,555
The service
was beautiful.

556
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:30,960
Thank you.

557
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,796
I wanna ask you
about the night
that Huey died.

558
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:38,170
You were at the hospital
with the Donnellys, right?

559
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,802
Yeah.

560
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,672
Were you there
when Huey got there?

561
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,576
Yeah, yeah, I was.

562
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,708
He brought a pie
and took it into
the waiting room.

563
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,377
Always bringing
the pies, right?
(CHUCKLES)

564
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:55,188
Did you hear anything
that Tommy and Huey were
talking about? Anything?

565
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,420
No, no.

566
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,526
How long did you stay
at the hospital?

567
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:00,958
All night.

568
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,731
You know,
Tommy, the family...

569
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,368
Waiting to hear about Sean.

570
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,436
Tommy was there
the whole night?
Mmm-hmm.

571
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,535
What about Kevin?

572
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,206
Kevin? Yeah.

573
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,904
Don't look, but Jenny's
talking to Dokey.

574
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,378
What do you think
she's saying?

575
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,380
Don't look.
You know,
she's probably offering

576
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,917
her condolences, Kevin.

577
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,408
They looked at me.

578
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:26,046
So? Take it easy, Kevin.
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

579
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm just trying to piece
together the last moments,
you know? That's all.

580
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,496
'Cause none of this
seems right. None of it.

581
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,225
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

582
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,896
Sure.
Thanks.

583
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:40,793
(DOOR OPENS)

584
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:50,908
Are you okay?

585
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,049
You need something
to eat.

586
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,049
Why? You saying
I'm drunk?

587
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:00,622
No.

588
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,424
You know,
you're the one person,

589
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,894
the only person I thought
would never make me
feel this bad.

590
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,065
Maybe I can understand

591
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,608
what happened that night

592
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,810
because of Sean,

593
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,212
because you felt
you had no other choice.

594
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,223
But Huey?

595
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,693
Why did you have
to kill Huey?

596
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,736
If you really believe
what you said

597
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,303
about loving me,

598
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,740
you gotta stop asking.

599
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,886
You just trust me.

600
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,683
That night is done.

601
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,177
You said everything
was gonna be okay,

602
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,008
and I wanted to believe it.

603
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,289
But it's not.

604
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,060
So I have to try
wanting something else.

605
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,708
Hey, everybody!

606
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,379
You enjoying my bar?

607
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:14,983
Welcome!

608
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,722
Hey, Dokey!

609
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,193
Your brother, man...

610
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,559
Bummer.

611
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,534
Came to pay our respects.

612
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,338
Condolences.

613
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,476
This isn't gonna
be good.

614
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,448
Three shots!

615
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,683
Right over here.

616
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,393
There are a couple of things
you need to know
about the Irish.

617
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,761
I forget the first.

618
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,000
But the second thing is this.

619
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,002
They don't believe
that death is the end.

620
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,594
They think it's about
resurrection.

621
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,400
And what is more
life-affirming than sex?

622
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,748
Hey, I've been watching
you all night.
I'm not that drunk.

623
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,682
Okay, you're in mourning,
I get that.

624
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,843
Hey, I have been
watching you all night.

625
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,249
How's it going?

626
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,321
(PHONE RINGING)

627
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,254
Firecracker.

628
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,462
Uh...

629
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,621
I don't...

630
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,589
I...

631
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,258
I mean...

632
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,531
Hold on.

633
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,263
Who is it?

634
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,871
Where you going?

635
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,074
Who the hell is this?

636
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,483
TOMMY: Who was that?

637
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,817
It's Dokey.

638
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,355
It's Dokey calling?

639
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,656
He was just here.

640
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,492
He's still here.
He's in the basement.

641
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,594
He's calling us from
our own basement?

642
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,101
He wants us to join him.

643
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,836
Is he out of his mind?

644
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,800
Jenny's down there with him.

645
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,972
<i>JOEY. The only thing worse</i>
<i>than having someone</i>
<i>threaten you</i>

646
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,538
<i>is having them threaten</i>
<i>the person you love most.</i>

647
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,880
<i>How Dokey knew that Jenny</i>
<i>was the one for Tommy,</i>

648
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,342
<i>I don't know.</i>

649
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,216
<i>But he knew.</i>

650
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:31,061
<i>I don't think I've ever</i>
<i>seen Tommy Donnelly</i>
<i>look that scared.</i>

651
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:46,971
What's going on, Dokey?

652
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,568
Thanks, Earl.

653
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,712
Where's your other brother?

654
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,280
He had to run off.

655
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,512
That doesn't look good,
does it?

656
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,015
He's scared.

657
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,220
I guess I can understand
that, you know?

658
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,488
You should go.
Jimmy, take her upstairs.

659
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,692
No, you take her upstairs.

660
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,894
No, no, no one's taking
anybody upstairs.

661
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,665
You wanna tell us
what we're doing down here?

662
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,001
Shut up, Jimmy, okay?

663
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,674
You know what's funny?

664
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,248
There's all these people
right up there.

665
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,050
And we're down in here,
just a few feet away,

666
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,656
something totally different
going on, you know?

667
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,556
And they're none the wiser.

668
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,759
It's funny how that works.

669
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,657
You know, you guys
could wind up dead tonight.

670
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,267
I just say that
I was at a wake.

671
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,528
I mean, it's the truth,
I got witnesses.

672
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,337
You know?

673
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,603
Hey.

674
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,638
You ever find yourself
in a situation, Tommy,
with your brothers,

675
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,675
that people could've swore
you were there,

676
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,453
you know?

677
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,251
And yet you were
doing something else?

678
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,992
I need her to leave, Dokey.

679
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,286
I'm fine right here.

680
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,260
DOKEY: She's good.

681
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,297
I know you killed Huey.

682
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,861
I don't know how you did it,
but I know you killed him.

683
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,296
You were the last one
with him, Tommy.

684
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,277
And you, bigmouth,
shooting your mouth off
in the bar

685
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,308
that your brothers
killed for you.

686
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,277
You got a big mouth,
Jimmy.

687
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,850
You know, I'm not
the smartest guy
in the world.

688
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,252
But I do know

689
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,786
one way to get
to the truth.

690
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,728
Jimmy, would you
do me a favor?
Put your leg up there.

691
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,061
Stop this!

692
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,867
He was in The Tombs
when your brother
was killed, Dokey.

693
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,475
Yeah, I know, that's
really good. I would've
thought of that, too.

694
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,635
Now, would you put
your leg up there, please?

695
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,913
That's your bum leg,
isn't it?

696
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,275
(CHUCKLES)

697
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,952
You better
leave me dead, Doke,

698
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,820
'cause I'm gonna
stick this stump
straight down your throat.

699
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,761
You got it.

700
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,258
It's a promise.

701
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,823
You wanna know
what happened?

702
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,525
Do you?

703
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,027
I want her out of here.

704
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,504
Sure.
Take her upstairs.

705
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:35,567
I leave here,
I call the police.

706
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,204
She's not gonna call
the police with us down here.

707
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,882
Get your hands off me!

708
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,511
Please.

709
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,319
It's okay.

710
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,627
Is someone gonna do something?
'Cause my leg's getting tired.

711
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,065
Shut your mouth, okay?

712
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,194
And you got one chance
to tell me the truth.

713
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,234
We called Huey
'cause we screwed up.

714
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,673
And the Italians were
coming after us.

715
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,272
You screwed up how?
You know,
I'm getting a cramp.

716
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,876
Stay down!

717
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,282
You pull guns on me?

718
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,488
You are dead!

719
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,354
And you were acting
so friendly.

720
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,261
You want a gun?
Take it.

721
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,091
Oh, that's real smart,
Tommy.

722
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,356
I'm cool with my ax, Tommy.

723
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,436
We needed your brother's help
because we killed somebody.

724
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,538
Okay?
You needed
my brother's help.

725
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:38,973
Who did you kill?

726
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,274
An Italian,
you don't need to know who.

727
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:44,508
Tommy, don't tell me
what I need and don't
need to know, okay?

728
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,379
It was someone
who wanted Kevin dead.

729
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,819
He owed this guy money
and he couldn't pay.

730
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,316
It was an accident,
but it doesn't make
him any less dead.

731
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,613
Huey came to the hospital,

732
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,418
he said he had
a connection with Sal
and he'd try and help.

733
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,924
That's the last time
we saw him.

734
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,558
So all right,
you killed somebody,

735
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,255
it just wasn't Huey,
is that what you're saying?

736
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,158
He was standing
right where you are.

737
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,288
What'd you do?

738
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,162
You shoot him?

739
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,025
Yeah.

740
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,162
Well, shooting makes a mess.

741
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,677
Earl, roll over there
and put your fingers
in that drain, please.

742
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,712
Put them into the drain?
Earl, the drain.

743
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,539
<i>JOEY. And this is the way</i>
<i>life works sometimes.</i>

744
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,575
<i>If they hadn't killed</i>
<i>Louie Downtown,</i>

745
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,668
<i>they would've been dead</i>
<i>right then and there.</i>

746
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,178
Put the gun down, Jimmy.

747
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:50,875
Put it down.

748
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,149
Are we good here, Dokey?

749
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:01,089
You ever point
a gun at me again,
and I will hack you in half

750
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,516
while you're screaming.
You got it?

751
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,997
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

752
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,418
I'm sorry.

753
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,336
Hey, Kate.
Hey.

754
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,246
Is everything all right?

755
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,041
Yeah.

756
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,581
Are you still okay
with saying something?

757
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,544
Yeah.

758
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,884
If I could

759
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,327
get your attention?

760
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,494
I wanted to say a few words
about Huey.

761
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,096
I...

762
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,774
I...

763
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,473
I think if you can

764
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,809
remember what a person
meant to you,

765
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,415
and hold onto that feeling,

766
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,057
I think you can survive
a time like this.
