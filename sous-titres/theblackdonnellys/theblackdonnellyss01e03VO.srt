Son, if you did
something like this,

34
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,215
you need to turn
yourself in to the police.

I won't be forgiven?

I'm saying.

Before I can even
think about giving
you absolution,

42
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,815
you have to promise
before God

43
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,845
that you will never do
anything like this again.

44
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,956

The plan?

53
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,834
Tommy's plan was
to make things
right with God

54
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,239
and save what
was left of his soul.

55
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,539
The problem was
he thought he could do that

56
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,580
and still take care
of his brothers.

57
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,114
Which of course
was the same plan

58
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,047
that got him into
all this trouble
to begin with.

59
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,178
Which meant
he had to get Jimmy

You're gonna go away.

67

jail or rehab.

If you had nothing to hide,
why didn't you tell me?

The only way
we get out of this

172
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,547
Do you?

173
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,677
No, I don't.
But I could guess.

174
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,949
Hey. Don't do any guessing,
Vinnie.

175
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,524
Don't mention Sal's action.

176
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,957
When Alo offers,
you kiss the ring
and you say thank you.

177
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,225
Yeah, that's us.
Couple of grateful soldiers.

178
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,529
<i>JOEY. Alo considered himself</i>
<i>something of a ladies' man.</i>

179
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,228
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>being the head of the family,</i>

180
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,668
<i>Alo could consider</i>
<i>himself Pope.</i>

181
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,331
<i>He wasn't gonna get much</i>
<i>argument from anybody.</i>

182
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,104
Hey, guys. Out by the pool,
I'll be there in a minute.

183
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,935
Come on, girls,
have a drink.

184
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,478
You can change
in the other room.

185
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,014
Let's go.

186
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,884
Why didn't you tell me
that yesterday?

187
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,419
They were here all day.

188
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,118
Is there somebody else
I can talk to?

189
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,951
I gotta take off.
Where you going?

190
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,081
Diner.

191
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,384
Hey.

192
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,061
Your Mom's
pretty worried.

193
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,892
I was waiting till
somebody got here.

194
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,099
Thanks for doing that.

195
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,209
See you in a second.

196
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,242
Jenny!

197
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,545
Yeah?

198
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,749
Well, you kind of
threw me for a loop
this morning

199
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,551
with all this
"it's not gonna
happen" stuff.

200
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,787
Can we meet up later,
maybe talk a little bit?

201
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,426
I don't think so.

202
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,454
I gotta get back to work.

203
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,258
Come on, Jenny!

204
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,996
It was hard enough
for me to say it
the first time.

205
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,540
I don't wanna
have to do it again.

206
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,743
HELEN: All I know
is what he looks like,

207
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,648
and it scares the hell
out of me, Tommy.

208
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,619
Ma, if they're moving him
out of the ICU,

209
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,848
isn't that a good thing?

210
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,321
If you ask me,

211
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,190
the doctor only said
he's stable because
they need the bed.

212
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,655
You really think
they would do that?

213
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,722
Yeah. I think they're
moving him too soon.

214
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,859
They're trying to put him
on the fourth floor
with the derelicts

215
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,665
and the homeless 'cause
they're sons of bitches.

216
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,636
It's the ward, Tommy.

217
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:35,899
The ward?

218
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,671
They don't even
have doctors up there.
They got interns up there.

219
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,436
Okay, then it's a mistake.

220
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,640
They killed your
Uncle Harry in a ward.

221
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,239
Sons of bitches!

222
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,773
Ma?

223
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,477
They're not gonna
put Sean in a ward.

224
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,955
I'll take care of it.

225
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,390
I know you will.

226
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,787
Okay?
Okay. Okay.

227
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,366
JOEY: Didn't Tommy say
that bailing Jimmy out
was a bad idea?

228
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,640
You want me to tell
Jimmy you said that?

229
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,073
I'd rather you didn't.

230
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,166
How much we got?

231
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,835
Every nickel my grandmother
had in the house.

232
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,140
$165.

233
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,305
Anybody owe you any money?

234
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,679
Not anybody
that would pay.

235
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,444
Joey, you remember
when I got pinched
last year?

236
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,542
Yeah.

237
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,917
I was looking at
three days in the tombs

238
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,511
if I didn't make bail
before midnight.

239
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,853
I walked out of that
jail at 11:55.

240
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,525
Jimmy did that.

241
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,992
I'm not leaving him
in there.

242
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,828
Okay, I got a plan.
I know a guy.

243
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:31,954
He needs things.

244
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,056
What kind of things?
Plumbing supplies.

245
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,967
His CAT scan
reveals there's no
subdural hematoma.

246
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,266
His chest X-ray
is negative.

247
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,167
He's stable,
or I wouldn't
have authorized

248
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,468
to have him moved
out of ICU.

249
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,338
He's still got a lot
of pain in his head,
you know?

250
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,468
He's not feeling good.

251
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,806
I understand your concern.

252
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,847
And maybe if we weren't
so backed up in the ER,

253
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,040
I might be able
to keep him in ICU

254
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,174
a day or two longer,
but I'm not...

255
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,877
Are you saying
there's no room for him?

256
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,180
Is that why you're
moving him?

257
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,515
I said that your brother
was medically fit

258
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,781
to be transferred,
and he is.

259
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,516
No, you're saying
he's being moved
to a ward

260
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,148
because you're
backed up!

261
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,021
Excuse me.
I didn't say that.

262
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,119
If your brother's
medical condition

263
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,220
warranted him
staying in ICU,

264
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,787
I would keep him there.

265
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,493
No, that's not
what you just said!

266
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,899
I'm sorry.
I've got other patients.

267
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,176
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

268
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,276
Hey, Seanie.

269
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,945
Hey.

270
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,822
How you doing?

271
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,223
Good.
My head's still
killing me.

272
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,817
They gave you
something for it.

273
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,896
Yeah.

274
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,532
Can you give me a cup
of water there, Tommy?

275
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,628
Yeah.

276
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,054
(GRUNTING)

277
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:13,857
Can I make a suggestion?

278
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,059
Shut up and lift.
Okay.

279
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,433
Time to go, Joey.

280
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,779
Dude! Let's use this one!

281
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,841
That's too heavy.

282
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,353
That's the point.

283
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,484
What is?
That it's too heavy.

284
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,817
I knew that.

285
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,194
Okay.

286
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,232
Hi.
Hi. Cash or charge?

287
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,827
Cash.

288
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,137
We're plumbers.

289
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,936
That would explain the tubs.

290
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,408
They're the same, right?

291
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,067
Yeah.
Yeah.

292
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,545
Times two.

293
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:41,450
According to his records,
your brother doesn't
have insurance.

294
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,178
Well, there must
be some mistake.

295
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,450
Look, as much
as I'd like to help,

296
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,854
it costs money
to run a hospital.

297
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,291
People tend to forget that.

298
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,024
I understand.
But my brother
has insurance.

299
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,258
Nope.

300
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,425
According to the union,

301
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,492
your brother hasn't worked
enough days to qualify.

302
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,628
He worked plenty.

303
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,829
I'll get you
the pay stubs.

304
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,429
No, no, no.
Hey, not me!

305
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,065
Take them to the union.

306
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,906
If they confirm coverage,
maybe I can help.

307
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,501
Maybe you can help?

308
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,205
Once the doctor
authorizes a patient
to leave ICU,

309
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,113
I put him
where he can afford.

310
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,618
There's nothing else
I can do.

311
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,218
But you're the one
with the final say, right?

312
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,984
No, the doctors
have the final say.

313
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,956
I'm just the one
who facilitates
the transfers.

314
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,357
Sure, but if you
pick up the phone

315
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,555
and you tell ICU
to keep him there...

316
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,666
Okay. I'll go
to the union.

317
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,026
But can you at least
keep him in ICU
until I take care of it?

318
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,935
Look, I told you
what I can do.

319
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,772
Okay?
The way to help your brother
is to go get the pay stubs.

320
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,479
I'm starting to feel like
an orphan here, Nicky.

321
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,252
NICKY: That's Huey's
brother Dokey, isn't it?

322
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,650
What the hell are
the Irish doing here?

323
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,227
WOMAN: See you later!

324
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,560
Vinnie's question
was answered
earlier that morning.

325
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,858
No! No, no!

326
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,024
(SCREAMING)

327
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,229
Shh!

328
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,868
Now you go tell your boss Alo
this happens once a day

329
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,410
until I find out
who killed my brother,

330
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,911
or you ginzos lose
all your toes.

331
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,105
You understand?

332
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,169
(CRYING)

333
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,715
Shake your head. Good.

334
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,148
Now wrap it up
and get out of here.

335
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,982
You know, you Irish,
you gotta grow up.

336
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,489
There are other ways
to take a meeting.

337
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,682
I mean,
you can use the telephone,

338
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,224
they got something
called e-mail now.

339
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,027
But this kind of garbage,
cutting off toes?

340
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,563
I mean, what are
you looking to do?
Start a war?

341
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,462
No, I'm looking to find out
who killed my brother.

342
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,000
Well, maybe we could
answer that question

343
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,194
if we knew what
your brother was doing

344
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,793
in Sal's basement
in the middle of the night.

345
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,030
He was getting
killed by Italians!

346
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,801
Who are also dead.

347
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,476
Which is
the only reason, Alo,
you're still breathing.

348
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,741
Okay, mick.

349
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,647
It's time for
you to be careful.

350
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,713
You step one way,
you walk out of here.

351
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,778
You step the other way,
and you end up
with your brother.

352
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,254
Or maybe I end up
with Sal,

353
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,053
but is that what you're
looking for, Dokey?

354
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,160
Or are we looking
for something better?

355
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,224
What about him?
He worked for Sal.

356
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,328
How come he's not
on a slab with a
bullet in his brain?

357
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,961
Why don't you shove it
up your ass, Paddy?

358
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,403
Why don't I go
shove it up my ass?

359
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,567
Settle down,
settle down, everybody!

360
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,203
Better rein your
boy in, quick.

361
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,678
You got a point.

362
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,339
Could've been Sal
going after Huey,

363
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,440
although I don't
know why he would.

364
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,883
And it could've been
Huey going after Sal.

365
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,012
But then again,
that don't make no sense.

366
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,590
Or it could've
been the Dominicans,
the Russians, the Asians,

367
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,818
or who the hell
else knows what?

368
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,591
Here's what I gotta say.

369
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,697
We've had nice
business together
the last couple years, huh?

370
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,124
Yeah.

371
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,192
'Cause my brother
Huey made the peace
happen.

372
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,032
Now Huey's gone, Alo.

373
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,073
And until I find out
who killed him,

374
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,507
where we go from here
is nowhere.

375
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,380
No offense,
but I liked your brother
a little bit better than you.

376
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,345
ALO: Get me a drink.

377
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,517
My head hurts.

378
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,017
Line these up here,
will you?

379
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,690
Come on.

I'm a plumber!

What's your point?

385
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,746
These are carpentry tools.

386
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,146
I can't use any of them!

387
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,810
So you don't wanna
buy any of this?

388
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,353
I'm not a carpenter.

389
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,016
You know any carpenters?

390
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,788
Did you ever think
of taking up carpentry?

391
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,862
JIMMY: You gotta get me
out of here.

392
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,992
You gotta do something,
Kevin!

393
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,601
I tried, Jimmy.

394
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,565
All day I tried!

395
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,400
I don't know where
to get 1,800 bucks.

396
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,340
I'm not talking
about the money.

397
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,207
I'm talking
about the witness.

398
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,642
Witness? What witness?

399
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,444
Frankie told Tommy
they got a witness
against me.

400
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:05,774
Yeah?

401
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,182

turning myself in for?

404
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,583

410
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,035
You think?
I know he saw my face

411
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,128
when I yanked him
out of there.

412
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,503
I just didn't think
he'd be so stupid
to identify me.

413
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,299
You gotta find the guy.

414
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,206
How am I gonna
find the guy, Jimmy?

415
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,676
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

416
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,578
He's an old guy,
in his fifties.
Kind of tall.

417
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,377
All you gotta do
is find him,

418
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,613
and you gotta tell him
to forget what I look like.

419
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,949
How am I gonna
do that, Jimmy?

420

we don't have?

Kevin, don't you see?

422
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,794
If they don't have
a witness in court
to identify me,

423
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,559
there'll be no case.

424
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,566
They'll have to throw it out.

425
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,161
I can't go back to that cell.

where to start.

the tip on the truck?

428
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:02,896
Yeah.

She'll get you
to the truck driver.

430
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,440
You have to reason with him.

431
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,037
If he doesn't listen,

432
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,478

you have to do.

Now that Sal is gone,
you know,
God rest his soul,

00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,836
I'm just wondering
how you want me
to handle his action.

<i>Because Nicky beat up</i>

00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,356
<i>And that's what got</i>
<i>Louie Downtown killed.</i>

<i>And that's what got</i>
<i>Sal and Huey killed.</i>

460
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,859
And if Alo knew
about it, the answer

461
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,354
was gonna get Nicky killed.

about Sal's action.

you should mention that.

Sal had with Huey,
he never told me.

weren't supposed to
mention Sal's action?

would have been worse.

00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,842
He's still the same.

693
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,821
I tried, Ma.

694
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,894
There was nothing
I could do.

695
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,452
Tell that to
your brother, Tommy.

696
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,858
<i>JOEY. But making</i>
<i>things right with God</i>
<i>is an iffy proposition.</i>

697
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,569
<i>Sometimes he hears you...</i>

698
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,710
DOCTOR:
He's gonna be all right.

699
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,810
<i>Sometimes he doesn't.</i>

700
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,027
Oh!

701
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,022
How you feeling?

702
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,261
Aside from the fact
that I stink,
I'm starving,

703
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,563
and every bone
in my body hurts?

704
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,591
Yeah.

705
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,604
Thanks for getting me
out of there.

706
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,934
How's Seanie doing?

707
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,132
Let's go see.

708
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,971
I gotta make
a stop first.

709
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,943
Stop?
Yeah!

710
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,670
We're not making
any stops, Jimmy.

711
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,339
Somebody died and
left you in charge,
Kevin?

712
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,747
Come on, Jimmy,
you know what I mean.

713
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,682
Tommy said you
were gonna do this.
We're not stopping anywhere.

714
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,617
All right.
All right, take it easy.

715
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,189
You act like you
just killed a guy
for me or something.

716
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,386
Truck driver do that?

717
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,158
I'm okay.

718
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,393
See you later.

719
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,764
Jimmy.

720
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,234
Come on, Jimmy!
Don't do this.

721
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,741
It's just what Tommy
said you were gonna do!

722
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,167
Jimmy!

723
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,369
Jimmy!

724
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,020
I was pretty scared
for a second there.

725
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,056
You and me both, pal.

726
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,821
You want something
to eat, hon?

727
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,523
I don't think so, Ma.

728
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,225
Hey.

729
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,598
How's he doing?

730
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,831
He's doing great.

731
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,831
What happened to you?

732
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,134
Nothing.

733
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,009
I'm gonna get you
something to eat.

734
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,774
Excuse me.

735
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,715
Hey, Seanie.
SEAN: Hey.

736
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,347
Damn.

737
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,548
You look like you
got hit in the face
with a bat.

738
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,716
You don't look any better.

739
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,555
No. I know, right?

740
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,192
So where's Jimmy?
How come he hasn't come in?

741
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,792
Well, Jimmy's going
to rehab for a while.

742
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,534
Yeah.

743
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,771
I should tell you about that.

744
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,977
Tell me about what, Kevin?

745
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,513
Well, you know the witness
they had against Jimmy?

746
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,878
What'd you do?

747
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,916
I didn't do anything.
Guy got hit by a bus.

748
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,314
Hit by a bus?

749
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,815
Hit by a bus, Kevin?

750
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,355
Are you kidding me?
What, you think I'm...

751
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,721
<i>JOEY. Maybe Jimmy</i>
<i>didn't make it to rehab.</i>

752
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,655
<i>But Tommy's brothers</i>
<i>were okay for the moment.</i>

753
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,865
<i>And let's face it.</i>
<i>That was the plan.</i>

754
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,411
<i>So Tommy's new plan</i>
<i>was to put everything</i>
<i>behind him</i>

755
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,075
<i>and start over.</i>

756
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,241
(TIRES SCREECHING)

757
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,044
<i>Should've known better.</i>

758
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,782
Your penalty for
our loss of business
just went up from a grand

759
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,519
to $2,500.

760
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,892
Now, that's every week
until Louie turns up.

761
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,098
I paid you back 30,000.

762
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,722
That's all you're gonna get.

763
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,290
Yeah, you did.

764
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,132
See, but here's
the thing, Tommy.

765
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,367
If I don't get my money,
I kill you,

766
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,465
and I collect
from your brother.

767
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,705
He don't pay me,
I kill him and I move
on to the next brother.

768
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,371
Lucky the man's
from a large family.

769
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,112
See you Friday, kid.
