1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,026
Everyone knows that

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,037
<i>Kevin Donnelly</i>
<i>has never been lucky.</i>

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,663
Damn.
<i>But as luck would have it,</i>

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,729
<i>after killing him,</i>

5
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:08,831
<i>Jimmy found Louie's cell phone</i>

6
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,103
<i>with his whole</i>
<i>bookmaking business on it.</i>

7
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,407
<i>Then they found Whitey,</i>
<i>who knew how to run the book,</i>

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,745
<i>which left Kevin and Jimmy</i>
<i>to collect the winnings.</i>

9
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,951
<i>Did I mention that</i>
<i>Jenny Reilly's dad's</i>

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,316
<i>been forgetting things?</i>

11
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,617
<i>Like the difference between</i>
<i>a bank and a mailbox?</i>

12
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,656
<i>Now their mortgage payments</i>
<i>are gone.</i>

13
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,090
<i>Okay. Skip to</i>
<i>the Italian mob boss, Alo.</i>

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,458
<i>He wants peace with the Irish.</i>
<i>But Nicky Cottero?</i>

15
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,895
<i>He hates Irishmen,</i>
<i>so he killed a couple.</i>

16
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,399
<i>That was a mistake.</i>

17
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,866
<i>At this point, Sean Donnelly</i>

18
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,527
<i>hates the idea of</i>
<i>going back to school,</i>

19
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,798
<i>but his mom thinks school will</i>

20
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,533
<i>keep him out of trouble.</i>
Hey!

21
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,074
<i>Good luck with that.</i>

22
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,939
<i>And Dokey?</i>
<i>He's much more interested</i>

23
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,604
<i>in the future,</i>
<i>and in particular his nephew.</i>

24
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,203
<i>That little guy's mom,</i>
<i>Kate Farrell, has got</i>

25
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,839
<i>a different future in mind.</i>

26
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,407
<i>Too bad Tommy's</i>
<i>still stuck on Jenny.</i>

27
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,445
McCARTHY: Tell us about
Robert Kelly.

28
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,615
Who?

29
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,590
Bob the Mouth.

30
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,059
Never heard of him.

31
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,824
But I gotta tell you,
you gotta feel for a guy

32
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,957
unlucky enough to get tagged
with a name like that.

33
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,500
You want to know
what unlucky is?

34
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,058
How a guy can fall off
his chair,

35
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,535
like the one
you're sitting in

36
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,333
and break his neck.

37
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,664
You know, I suddenly remember

38
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,402
the fellow
you're talking about.

39
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,034
<i>JOEY. We met him</i>
<i>around the time Jimmy</i>

40
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,635
<i>decided to paint</i>
<i>the Firecracker.</i>

41
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,907
How we gonna pay
for all this?

42
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,408
What's up, guys? How we doing?

43
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,610
JIMMY: Doing real good,
Mel.

44
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,209
Don't worry about
ringing this up.

45
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,618
What do you mean?

46
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,249
I mean, we're good.

47
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,450
Jimmy, don't do this.

48
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,392
Look, I am paying
that bum Dokey

49
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,263
$200 a week
so this kind of thing
doesn't happen.

50
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,459
<i>JOEY. Talk about luck.</i>

51
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,025
If Jimmy doesn't decide
to paint the bar that day,

52
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,230
maybe Mel never mentions

53
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,500
Dokey extorting
200 a week from him.

54
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,202
And maybe we never get into
a whole new business.

55
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,368
You're paying Dokey
$200 a week?

56
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,468
Yeah.

57
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,173
So that Dokey doesn't
do to me
what you're doing!

58
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,738
Here's the deal, Mel.

59
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,008
How much you think
all this stuff costs?

60
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,347
I don't know.

61
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,848
Three hundred, maybe.

62
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,149
Box it up for me,

63
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,724
and I don't come back
for my hundred
for another three weeks.

64
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:06,985
What, your hundred?

65
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,492
It's half what
Dokey's getting,

66
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,222
and he's never even around.

67
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,263
At least I'll be around
to help you

68
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,422

69
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,523
Jimmy, please...

70
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,125
Let's not belabor
the point here, Mel.

71
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,191
The price could go up.

<i>JOEY. Actually</i>

73
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,238
we stumbled into
the extortion business,

74
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,830
<i>because</i>
<i>the bookmaking business</i>

75
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,000

Bob the Mouth.

79
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,443
Yeah.
Oh, well,

80
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,313
all that started
with Kevin.

81
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,477
Kevin? Kevin Donnelly?

82
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,181
Yes, Kevin Donnelly.
Who we talking about here?

83
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,557
Newton. Where are you?

84
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,592
You're making me look bad

85
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,159
in front of
my partners, Newton.

86
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,287
I'm waiting on the corner,
show up or call me.

87

88
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,426
It's not good, Kev.

89
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,728
This guy owes us
10 grand, man,

90
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,826
where do you get off
giving out a ten-grand
bust out?

91
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,132
He'll show.
I know the guy.

92
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,729
Call him again.

93
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:54,864
You're a real hump,
you know that?

94
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,135
I'm a hump.
You know who's a hump?

95
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,301
My Uncle Bob's a hump

96
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,369
because we laid off Newton's
ten-grand bet with him,

97
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,745
and if he doesn't get paid,
one of us is gonna die.

98
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,351
JENNY: He's been
forgetting things,

99
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,051
losing things.
I can't get him to
go see a doctor.

100
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,817
Why not?

101
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,291
He says
there's nothing wrong
with him.

102
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,261
He doesn't even want
to talk about it.

103
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,495
I think he's scared.

104
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,600
Hey.

105
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,340
I just found out that
we are seven months behind

106
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,351
in the mortgage.

107
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,024
We're gonna lose the diner,

108
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,785
we're probably gonna lose
the whole building.

109
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,724
Can't you re-finance,
something like that?

110
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,662
Yeah, we've already
done that too many times.

111
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,790
He's going to sell half
to Dokey.

112
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,890
Dokey?

113
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,162
Dad went to him
for a loan

114
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,601
and Dokey said
he wouldn't give it to him

115
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,399
unless he made him a partner.

116
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,803
So they're gonna sign
the papers tomorrow.

117
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,898
No, don't let him do that.

118
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,509
You know Dokey.

119
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,374
If he gets half of it,
he'll rob the rest.

you need?

121
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,552
$13,000.

122
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,780
$13,000?

123
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,650
Forget it.
I'm sorry,

124
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,749
I don't know
what I was thinking.

00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,885
No,

126
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,261
it's okay.

127
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,658
$13,000 is a lot of money.

128

Use the prime.

Will you shut up a minute
please and let me talk?

00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,823
The white stuff's the prime.
You put it on first.

That's like painting it
twice.

Hey, he said
he'd get the money.

175
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,390
Jimmy, can I have
a minute with you?

176
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,064
You asked me to
go to my uncle
and I did.

177
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,007
And I promised him that
whatever bets we laid off,

178
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,669
the money would be there
when it's supposed to.

179
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,144
Now you're siding
with your brother,

180
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,612
as if somehow
he's right.

181
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,308
How wrong is that, Jimmy?

182
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,508
You met my uncle,
he doesn't have
a lot of patience.

183
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,746
<i>JOEY. And this is where</i>
<i>Bob the Mouth comes in.</i>

184
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,981
<i>Bob was a neighborhood</i>
<i>loan shark and bookie</i>

185
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,354
<i>who would pretty much</i>
<i>take action from anybody.</i>

186
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,518
Okay?

187
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,651
(WHIMPERING)

188
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,197
Tell me again how late
are you going to be
with my money?

189
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,527
(SCREAMING)

190
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,268
I'll say this about
your uncle.

191
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,361
He knows how
to solve a problem.

192
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,367
<i>JOEY. Mainly because</i>
<i>he figured</i>

193
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,341
there was nobody crazy
enough not to pay him.

194
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,706
I think me and you
need to take this

195
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,801
out of Kevin's hands,

196
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,539
find this Newton guy,
throw him a beating.

197
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,138
Do what we gotta do
to get the money.

198
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,382
How long is it gonna
take you to
find this Newton?

199
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,114
Give me till 3:00.

200
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,618
Whitey, go talk to
your uncle.

201
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,248
Tell him the money's
coming by 3:00.

202
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,157
You get back here with
that money by 2:30.

203
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,595
I know he's your brother,
but just for a second,

204
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,261
you should forget about that
and look at him

205
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,736
for the whack job
that he is.

206
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,602
What color is that?
Green.

207
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,266
Jimmy!
We didn't want green.

208
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,707
We wanted clover.

209
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,508
Jimmy, come here.

210
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,778
How am I supposed to
get this place painted

211
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,082
if I keep
getting interrupted?

212
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,779
What?

213
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,621
I need you
to loan me some money.

214
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,717
Sure!
From my bookmaking business,

215
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,260
that you think
I shouldn't be doing!

216
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,025
Don't bust my balls, Jimmy,
I need the money.

217
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,293
Okay. Today's your lucky day.

218
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,864
'Cause I actually need
something from you, too.

219
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,924
What?

220
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,994
I don't know what he did
or how he did it,

221
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,596
but Kevin screwed up.

222
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,104
There's a twist.

223
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,164
I got three bettors

224
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,335
that didn't come up
with what they owe.

225
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,470
You help Kevin collect,
I'll give you 10%.

226
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,241
10% of how much?

227
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,446
First you want nothing to do
with any of it,

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,386
and now you're negotiating
for a better percentage.

229
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,350
Glad to see
you're coming around,
Tommy.

230
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,891
(LAUGHING)

231
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,393
<i>JOEY. Of course, Tommy</i>
<i>hadn't exactly come around.</i>

232
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,930
What he had come to
was a decision.

233
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,965
<i>An old Irish blessing says,</i>

234
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,193
<i>"Wherever you go,</i>

235
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,202
<i>"may the luck of the Irish</i>
<i>go with you. "

236
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,568
<i>Father Dufelt hated</i>
<i>old Irish sayings</i>

237
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,040
<i>almost as much as he hated</i>
<i>people asking him for favors.</i>

238
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,337
Here's all I'm saying,

239
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,072
I can pick up the phone
and make this happen.

240
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,238
But it's a favor,

241
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,874
and there are only
so many of these favors.

242
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,941
He wants to go
back to school.

243
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,179
FATHER DUFELT:
You're a semester and a half

244
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,754
from you
and a high school diploma.

245
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,982
All you had to do
was show up.

246
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,557
You couldn't do it.

247
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,194
Now, don't let me
waste this favor on you

248
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,319
when I could give it to
some other kid

249
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,226
who really wants it.

250
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,128
Put down the cake
and talk to the Father.

251
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,036
If you don't want to
go to school, tell him.

252
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,440
Father, I appreciate
you being here,

253
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,170
and I'm kind of embarrassed

254
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,576
that my Mom
put you in this spot.

255
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,882
Sure. If you think

256
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,953
you can get me
back into school

257
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,043
with my grades being
what they are,

258
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,123
I think it'd be a good thing
for me to try to do.

259
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,055
Get my diploma.

260
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,593
You know, for my future.

261
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,128
You're sure?

262
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,797
Yeah.

263
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,126
<i>JOEY. I'll get back to that.</i>

264
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,226
<i>Because at that moment,</i>

265
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,292
<i>Alo was hard at work</i>

266
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,566
<i>trying to make</i>
<i>a decision of his own.</i>

267
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,972
Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.
What?

268
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,170
How many times
I gotta tell you?

269
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,611
Left arm straight. As in,
keep your left arm straight.

270
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,343
I'm trying!
Hit the ball.

271
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,883
(GROANS)

272
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,977
You're a spastic.

273
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,556
I hate golf.
I'd rather play sports.

274
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,959
Look at the mug on you.

275
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:29,995
Least you could've done

276
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,563
was whack him
on the back of the head.

277
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,326
How you doing,
shovelhead?

278
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,458
I hope you learned
a lesson.

279
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,363
Yeah, tempered steel
to the head

280
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,267
usually does the trick.

281
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,002
Ray wanted to finish the job.
I wouldn't let him.

282
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,838
Any idea why?

283
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,310
Punishment wouldn't
have fit the crime, Alo.

284
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,177
You know, I may be stupid,

285
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,307
I never been
disloyal to you.

286
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,685
And you're an earner.
I don't discount that.

287
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,784
So what did you learn?

288
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,514
You don't want a war.

289
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,553
What about you?

290
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,251
I learn
what he learns.

291
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,363
That's good.
I like that.

292
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,364
So here's what
I need you to do.

293
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,893
Go make peace with the Irish
like I asked

294
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,163
and get the money
they owe me.

295
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,361
You think you can do that?

296
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,735
Maybe I should
just get the shovel.

297
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,296
That's enough.

298
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,133
Well?

299
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,872
I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

300
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,605
I don't know how to make this
Dokey change his mind, though.

301
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,652
Just go talk to him.

302
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,177
I got a feeling he might be
a little more approachable.

303
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,050
All right.

304
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,690
Okay, try it again.

305
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,023
First Jimmy says
he trusts me,

306
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,397
then he sends you
to look over my shoulder?

307
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,163
What kind of trust
is that, huh?

308
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,363
Okay, you got three
collections to make here.

309
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,906
They total 15 grand.

310
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,099
Here's what we're gonna do.

311
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:53,202
I'm keeping $13,000,
you can take the rest.

312
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,678
Excuse me, Tommy?

313
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,510
You telling me you're
gonna rob Jimmy's money?

314
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,742
And this is who he sends to
watch over me?

315
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,841
I'm not telling you
anything, Kevin,

316
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,909
I'm doing it.
You can help me or
you can fight me.

317
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,510
Either way,
I'm doing it.

318
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,488
You're seriously gonna rob
your own brother, Tommy?

319
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,219
That's, like, unethical.

320
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,154
I'm not helping you.
I'm calling Jimmy.

321
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,595
Hey! Put the phone away.

322
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,433
Back off, Tommy.
Put the phone away.

323
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,163
I'm calling Jimmy.

324
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,867
I need this, Kevin.

325
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,040
When was the last time
I asked you for something?

326
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,772
You mean before you just asked
me to help you rob Jimmy? Huh?

327
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,575
I mean ever, Kevin.

328
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,388
Never. I don't remember you
ever asking me for anything.

329
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,185
I'm asking you now.

330
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,337
I'm sorry!
I don't have it.

331
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,099
What would you
like me to do?

332
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,664
I'm gonna ride this thing
to my death

333
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,107
until I have the money
to pay you,

334
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,476
I don't know what else to say,
I don't... Oh! God!

335
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,071
What'd you have to
hit him for, Kevin?

336
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,377
That's the way you do it,
Tommy.

337
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,781
I don't know
what to tell you.

338
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,614
What, you think
he's just gonna
give us the money?

339
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,119
What universe do you live in?

340
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,313
Kevin!

341
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,686
Tommy!
What do you want from me?

342
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,918
See?

343
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,654
It's sweaty!

344
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,665
I told you I've been
working all day.

345
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,757
What do you want?
MAN: What's going on?

346
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,927
What the hell
you looking at?

347
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,796
Come on, Kevin, let's go.

348
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,934
Oh, hey, Kev?
Yeah?

349
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,605
So, my name's good, right?
I can bet this week again?

350
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,307
Yeah, no problem.

351
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,312
Give me the money.

352
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,819
It's sweaty.

353
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,979
Kevin!

354
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,423
You're taking care of this
with Jimmy, all right?

355
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,326
'Cause I'm not lying to him.

356
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,967
What are you doing?

357
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,332
I'm painting the door
like you said.

358
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,394
With a trim brush?

359
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,304
Yeah, these bigger brushes,
they get too heavy.

360
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,442
Hey, Jimmy, you got a minute?

361
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,143
Do the job right
or don't do it at all.

362
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,977
Can I not do it at all?
Is that a real option?

363
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,277
Shut up!

364
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,413
What's the matter?
Everything all right?

365
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,748
Yeah.

366
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,648
Look, I gotta make
some money, fast.

367
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,749
Why?

368
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,056
I'm moving out.

369
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,960
What are you
talking about?
I can't handle
being at home

370
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,020
with Ma anymore.

371
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,067
She keeps bugging me about
going back to school.

372
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,328
No, I quit school
once already,

373
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,426
I don't want to
have to do it again.

374
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,266
Wouldn't it be easier
just to tell Ma
you're not going back?

375
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,069
I tried, you know?
I couldn't do it.

376
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,665
I just don't want
to hurt her.

377
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,268
Plus she scares the hell
out of you.

378
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,445
That, too.

379
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,549
Look, Jimmy,
I know what you been doing

380
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,142
around the neighborhood
and everything.

381
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,311
So?

382
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,751
I want to start
collecting for you.

383
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,614
I'd let you take
Kevin's place,

384
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,918
but he's doing
such a great job.

385
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,515
Come on, Jimmy.

386
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,926
Seanie, what
I'm doing here,

387
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,993
it's not for you.

388
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,265
Mom's right.
Go back to school.

389
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,839
That's okay.
Maybe I'll go to Dokey.

390
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,132
Maybe there's a job for me in
construction or at the union.

391
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,337
I will shoot you before
I let you work for that

392
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,074
donkey-face-looks-like-he's-
from-the-old-country ass!

393
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,939
You want a job?
Yeah.

394
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,175
Okay.

395
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,481
You be
my new beverage manager.

396
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,948
I like that.
I'll be good at that.

397
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,685
Hey, you know
the first thing I'll do?
What?

398
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,021
A jukebox.

399
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,755
Good music always
gets people in.

400
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,024
What does that have to do with
being a beverage manager?

401
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,896
I don't know. No, look,
good music, hot girls.

402
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,163
Makes guys want
to drink more.

403
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:42,298
See, I knew
you'd be good at this.
Come on.

404
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,807
Where you guys going?

405
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,207
To buy a jukebox.

406
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,437
What about me?

407
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,309
You're gonna
keep painting.

408
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,747
Will do!

409
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,713
Can't believe that guy
didn't know him!

410
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,049
He didn't not know him.

411
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,817
He never heard of him.
What's that guy know?

412
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,755
Maybe he just
started working today.
He was the owner, Kevin.

413
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,360
If Newton worked there,
he would've known about it.

414
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,259
Yeah. Maybe if we waited
a few more minutes...

415
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,594
Kevin! Newton
doesn't work there.

416
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,293
He lied to you.
Now, where does he live?

417
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,436
I can't believe
he lied to me!

418
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,336
Where does he live, Kevin?
Who?

419
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,704
Newton!

420
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,565
Uh...

421
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,608
What the hell
am I looking for?

422
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:26,946
The deed.

423
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,982
Oh, yeah.

424
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,987
It's in the file cabinet.

425
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,185
I know
it's in the file cabinet.

426
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,994
I'm tired. People forget
things when they're tired.

427
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,222
But not so tired

428
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,429
that I didn't find
a way out of
our problems, am I?

429
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,299
Oh, yeah, Dokey's gonna be
a big help.

430
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,836
Didn't the bank say
they were gonna foreclose?

431
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,740
That's not gonna happen now.

432
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,006
Give me
a little damn credit,
will you?

433
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,213
I made an appointment
with the doctor.

434
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,185
A consultation.

435
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,424
I'm old, Jenny.

436
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,585
I lost a little memory,
that's all.

437
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,322
You know any old people
that hasn't happened to?

438
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,677
Tell me this is
the right apartment.

439
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,873
I guess
the guy's not home.

440
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,550
He's not home, Tommy!

441
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,522
What the hell's going on?

442
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,424
You're banging on my door,
you're banging on my window?

443
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,484
Come outside right now

444
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,655
and bring the money
with you.

445
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,097
(LAUGHING)
What money?

446
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,227
Kevin, what's going on?

447
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,964
Hi, Brian. I thought
you were down at the shore.

448
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,006
Yeah, I was supposed to be,
but my car's in the shop.

449
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,098
Who is this nutjob?

450
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,370
Kevin,
tell me this is Brian Newton.

451
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,002
KEVIN: Wish I could.

452
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,445
What?

453
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,049
I'm Newton.

454
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,842
You're Newton?

455
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,781
You made the bets?

456
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,214
You lost the money?

457
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,724
The $10,000?

458
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,088
Yes.

459
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,232
Yes to all the above.

460
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm Newton.

461
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,341
KEVIN: I'll tell you
what I was gonna do,

462
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,941
how I was gonna pay
Jimmy back.

463
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,042
I was thinking favorite,

464
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,281
but now,
I'm gonna have to
go with long shot.

465
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,651
A horse?

466
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,392
That's your big idea, Kevin?
After all this?

467
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,964
How can you think
about a horse?

468
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,020
<i>JOEY. Nobody ever understood</i>

469
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,623
<i>why Kevin thought</i>
<i>he was lucky.</i>

470
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,965
I mean, we all just thought
he was crazy!

471
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,027
But like most crazy things,

472
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,264
there was a reason for it.

473
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,536
BOBBY: Kevin, I'm gonna
be late! I need a name.

474
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,042
I don't know.

475
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,275
Okay, let's see.

476
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,274
Who's my lucky charm?

477
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,683
Tommy?
No.

478
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,448
You.
Me?

479
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,286
You.

480
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,557
So pick a horse, lucky.

481
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,961
Come on, trust your gut.

482
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,899
It's a good idea,
Tommy.

483
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,927
I mean, I was gonna take
the money we collect,

484
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,799
put it on this horse to win,

485
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,859
and then
we'd have enough money

486
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,303
to pay Jimmy back
Newton's money.

487
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,601
You want to take
the money we have

488
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,505
and lose it on a horse?

489
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,701
That's where
you're wrong, see,

490
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,007
I wasn't thinking lose,
Tommy.

491
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,377
And plus, this isn't just
any old horse, all right?

492
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,416
I have been waiting weeks
for Butterbro to run again.

493
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,076
I don't want to hear it.

494
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,282
We're gonna take the $3,500
we've already collected

495
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,856
and with this $1,500,

496
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,289
I'll have enough
to try to deal with Dokey.

497
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,253
Dokey?

498
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,629
He's trying to take
Jenny's diner.

499
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,532
I can't find it.

500
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,433
I thought I had it,
but I don't.

501
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,130
I guess my husband
must have taken it.

502
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,934
$1,500?

503
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,839
You guess your husband
took $1,500 to work?

504
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,139
She's lying, Tommy.

505
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,510
It's what gamblers do.
They lie.

506
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,913
Listen, lady,
we know you have the money.

507
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,712
We don't want any problems,

508
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,583
we just want you
to pay back
what you owe.

509
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,214
You're right,
I do have it.

510
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,415
But it's my rent money.

511
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,515
And if I give it to you,

512
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,925
then my husband's gonna know
that I'm gambling again

513
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,964
and he'll take my kids.

514
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,793
And I can't let you
do that to me.

515
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,001
Kevin, will you please
find the money?

516
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,404
No, no, no,
please don't find
the money!

517
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,135
Please, please don't!
Hey, hey, hey, okay.

518
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,336
Don't cry,
that's not fair.

519
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,345
We didn't make the bet.
You did.
Right.

520
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,880
Right.
You're just gonna...

521
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,313
Listen, could you just
give me a second?

522
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,112
Just give me half
a second, listen.

523
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,814
How much could it
mean to you? It's only
money to you.

524
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,514
But this is my life.

525
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,784
I'll do it,
I'll do anything you want.

526
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,789
What?

527
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,586
I'll do anything you want,
please!
KEVIN: I found it!

528
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,563
Please, please, don't! Just...
I got it right here.

529
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,829
Please, don't.

530
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,468
Leave it.
Leave the money?

531
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,661
Yeah.

532
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,432
Let's go.

533
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,707
What the hell
just happened?

534
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,247
Don't talk to me, Kevin.

535
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,249
You go that way,
I'm going this way.

536
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,477
Tommy.

537
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,884
We could still bet the horse
with the money we have!

538
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,013
Hey!

539
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,526
Here's Napoleon, okay?

540
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,127
Now, he's like
this big-time emperor, okay?

541
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,722
That's like a king, right?

542
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,825
Exactly. Just like a king.

543
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,570
Now Napoleon and his army,

544
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,267
they've been on this
major winning streak, okay?

545
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,934
They're taking over
the world.

546
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,740
Napoleon had all
these big guns,

547
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,271
and he's got more men than
your guys, over here, right?

548
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,443
Napoleon,
he's feeling pretty good.

549
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,156
Now, over here you got
the Duke of Wellington,

550
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,021
and he's the underdog.

551
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,948
He's gotta find an angle.

552
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,652
So what happens?

553
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,754
Rain.

554
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:16,996
See, the one thing that
Napoleon did not see coming,

555
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,067
and the one thing that

556
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,037
Wellington over here
was looking for,

557
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,810
was it rained buckets,
Matthew.

558
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,505
Like it never rained before.

559
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,046
All of Napoleon's big guns

560
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,376
and all of his horses, well,

561
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,711
they just weren't
worth anything.

562
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,608
Because they were
all stuck in the mud.

563
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,917
Napoleon lost a whole empire
in one battle

564
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,321
because he didn't see
a rainstorm coming.

565
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:44,419
You always gotta look out
for the thing that
you don't know.

566
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,956
Your father
never taught me that,

567
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,057
but don't hold it against him,
you know?

568
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,864
It doesn't mean
I can't teach you, right?

569
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,263
Now,

570
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,134
hey...

571
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,641
I gotta leave you for a
couple of minutes, all right?

572
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,871
So why don't you
set these guys back up?

573
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,172
When I get back,
I'll tell you

574
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,943
the story of
Richard the Lionhearted.

575
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,246
It's a much better
story, okay?

576
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,581
How you doing, guys?

577
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,679
Good.

578
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,886
So you got
something to say?

579
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,085
Yeah.

580
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,684
I made a mistake.

581
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,091
I should never have talked
about business

582
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,961
the day
you buried your brother.

583
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,763
All right? I was wrong,
and if I insulted you,

584
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,901
I apologize.

585
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,738
I'm just here to
make things right.

586
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,402
Yeah, well, whacking my guys
didn't help too much, did it?

587
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,535
Yeah, well, I already got

588
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,601
straightened out for that,
all right?

589
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,839
Yeah.

590
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,447
So here's what we have
on the table.

591
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,076
Same deal your brother
had with Sal.

592
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,780
No more, no less.

593
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,313
That's fine by me.

594
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,293
Good.

595
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,096
See you next week.

596
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,329
That was easy.

597
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,803
Are you surprised?

598
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,406
Ain't you?
No.

599
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,069
Alo had this set up
long before we got here.

600
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,134
What the hell do
these two guys got going on

601
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,405
that we don't know about?

602
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,468
I don't know.

603
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,037
Yeah, well,
we better find out.

604
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,582
'Cause if we don't,
we're dead.

605
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,515
Just a matter of time.

606
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,683
Look what you've done
to yourself.

607
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,658
You used to be a handsome kid.

608
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,520
You still on the junk?

609
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,962
No.

610
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,556
You're a liar.

611
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:36,169
There was a time
I would've done
anything for you.

612
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,707
Now you... You come to me
with this garbage

613
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,304
who doesn't know
how to pay his debts.

614
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,214
Despite what
your mother thought,

615
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,275
and I always hoped,

616
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,523
you're nothing
but a lying little turd.

617
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,524
I expect to get my $10,000.

618
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,460
You bring this Jimmy
to my place tonight.

619
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,107
And if he doesn't
have my money, well,

620
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,070
while I am reasoning with him,

621
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:18,514
you stick something like this
in his back.

622
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,519
Uncle Bob,

623
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,948
can I say something?

624
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,080
No.

625
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,627
Just do what I say,

626
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,965
or I'll kill you both.

627
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,245
Oh!

628
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,784
Hi.
Hey.

629
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,027
It's good to see you.
Everything all right?

630
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,187
Yeah.

631
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,595
Come in.
No, thanks.

632
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:14,033
I just came by for a favor.
I need to borrow some money.

633
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,035
Oh, okay.

634
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,241
Sure.
I wouldn't say sure

635
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,506
until you know how much it is.

636
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,837
Then maybe you should tell me.

637
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,507
<i>JOEY. Tommy knew</i>
<i>she would give him the money.</i>

638
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,052
<i>That's why he went to her.</i>

639
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,577
How much you need?

640
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,849
<i>JOEY. But it wasn't until</i>
<i>Tommy looked into Kate's eyes</i>

641
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,085
<i>that he knew just how much</i>
<i>of a mistake this was.</i>

642
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,729
DOKEY: Come on, buddy,
let's go.

643
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,690
Let's go see Mommy.

644
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,461
You know what? This is wrong.
DOKEY: You got everything?

645
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,765
I'm sorry I bothered you.
No, it's fine,

646
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,861
he's just dropping
Matthew off.

647
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,907
It's okay. I'm sorry,
I really am.

648
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,702
Dokey.

649
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,944
Hey, Matthew,
how we doing?

650
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,379
Hi!
Hey.

651
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,076
What you doing here, Tommy?

652
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,311
Nothing. I just stopped by
to say hi to Matthew.

653
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,648
Did you come
to play with me?

654
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,856
I did! But I can see
you're here with
your Uncle Dokey,

655
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,757
so maybe we could do it
another time, huh?

656
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,660
I'll see you.

657
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,240
<i>(ANNOUNCER CHATTERING ON TV)</i>

658
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,873
Why do you keep reading
this thing, Kevin?

659
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,005
Butterbro,
that's the horse

660
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,241
you been talking
about all day.

661
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,476
Things change, Tommy.

662
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,608
What things change?

663
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,175
Track conditions,
jockeys change.

664
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,550
Let me take care of this,
Tommy, all right?

665
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,623
I know how to gamble,
you don't.

666
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,016
It's raining,
that's good.

667
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,321
But there are other things
at work here.

668
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,096
What about the...
Tommy! Shh.

669
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,366
Okay. Butterbro,
he's still 13-to-1.

670
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,401
Okay. Butterbro.

671
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,371
It's a lock.
He can't lose.

672
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,237
Wait a minute.
What?

673
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,870
Lester Bangs, he's a mudder,
too. I didn't see that.

674
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,070
So?

675
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,171
Boy, this isn't good.

676
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,272
What?

677
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,146
Butterbro just
went down 5-to-1.

678
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,450
So we still get
$17,500 back.
That's enough.

679
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,783
No, not for
both of us, Tommy.

680
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,050
All right?
Let me handle this.

681
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,921
There's another horse
just as good.

682
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,018
Lester Bangs, 14-to-1.

683
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,791
Forget the odds.
Which horse is gonna
win the race, Kevin?

684
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,026
Lester Bangs.
Put everything on
Lester Bangs.

685
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,898
Not Butterbro?
Lester Bangs.

686
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,164
He can't lose.
It's all right here.

687
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,937
Okay.

688
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,003
But wait, wait, come back.

689
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,103
You're killing me, Kevin.

690
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,474
Pick a horse.

691
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,516
Pick Lester Bangs,
pick Butterbro, just pick one.

692
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,982
I don't know, Tommy.

your decision, little girl.

All right, Jimmy,
I can't lie to you.

866
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,119
We did collect $3,500,

867
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,314
but we put it on a horse,
and Tommy picked the horse,

868
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,015
so I think he should
keep all the money.

869
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,956
Kevin, what is
the matter with you?

870
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,120
What? I'm trying to
help you out, all right?

871
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,720
Besides, I told you,
I'm no good at lying.

872
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,594
Wait a minute!
Let me get this straight.

873
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,395
You collected my $3,500,

874
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,164
you bet it all on a horse,
the horse won,

875
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,932
and now you're telling me
you want to keep it all?

876
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,496
Not Kevin, me.

877
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,641
I told you this morning,
Jimmy,

878
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,143
I need the money.
I'm keeping it.

879
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,308
Really? You're keeping
my money?

880
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,747
It's the way
it's gotta be, Jimmy.

881
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,547
Ooh, I think I missed
a spot over there.

882
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,051
Okay, Tommy, no problem.

883
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,483
But you should know
the money wasn't mine.

884
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,217
It's Bob the Mouth's.

885
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,856
The money you're stealing
belongs to Bob the Mouth.

886
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,129
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

887
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,699
Tommy,
you know how
Bob operates.

888
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,510
I'm gonna have to kill him,
'cause he's gonna wanna
kill me.

889
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,067
<i>JOEY. Jimmy left out the part</i>
<i>about Bob</i>

890
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,943
<i>taking a walk on air.</i>

891
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:41,013
If that's okay with you,
it's okay with me.

892
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,610
<i>JOEY. Now, to anyone else,</i>
<i>this is a simple dilemma.</i>

893
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,814
<i>You save the life of</i>
<i>a despicable human being,</i>

894
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:49,154
<i>or you help the person</i>
<i>you love most in the world.</i>

895
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,750
You know what, Jimmy?

896
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,962
You do whatever
you gotta do.

897
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,442
<i>JOEY. But Tommy always made</i>
<i>things harder on himself</i>

898
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,505
<i>than most guys.</i>

899
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,718
Here you go.

900
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,266
(DOORBELL RINGING)

901
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,790
I'm so sorry to
do this.

902
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,418
Did it ever occur to you
that it feels good for me

903
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,621
to be able to help?

904
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,632
I'm gonna pay you back.
Every cent.

905
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,798
That's not important.

906
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,649
You okay?

907
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,879
Yeah, I'm good.

908
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:44,372
Sean, Bob the Mouth
belongs where he belongs.

909
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,508
He doesn't count.

910
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,374
Now you and me

911
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,748
and Kevin and Tommy?

912
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,382
That's all that counts.

913
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,436
What's that?

914
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,802
You did good today.

915
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,164
It's okay.
