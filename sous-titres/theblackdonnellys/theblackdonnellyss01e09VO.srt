1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,712
Pay attention this time.
I hate repeating myself.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,673
Tommy Donnelly always wanted
to be an artist, right?

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,133
Kate Farrell knew that.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,177
And she had
a famous artist friend.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,887
I think it might be good
for you to meet him.

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,224
Dokey had a friend, too.
Councilman Jack Trevor.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,559
Jack told Dokey
he better start playin' nice

8
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,644
with the Italians.

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,230
Jimmy was all about
playin' nice with others.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,357
Like Whitey's uncle,
Bob the Mouth.

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,192
But Bob wanted the money
Jimmy owed him,

12
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,485
and he wanted Jimmy dead.

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,487
We both know your uncle's
gonna wanna kill me.

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,530
Bye-bye, Bob.

15
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,367
So the bookmaking business
was back to usual.

16
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,327
(GRUNTING)

17
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,371
Except for one tiny detail.

18
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,206
Nicky found out they stole
the book from him

19
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,124
and he wanted
the business back.

20
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,377
Jenny wanted her dad back,
the way he was

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,170
before he started
losin' his marbles.

22
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,005
I lost a little memory,
that's all.

23
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,424
Yeah. And I'm on vacation
in the Bahamas.

24
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,471
Joey, the warden says
you haven't been eating.

25
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,432
Look around.
I mean, this is it, forever.

26
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,352
There's nothin' left
to look forward to,

27
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,854
no hopes, no dreams.

28
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,108
It's a terrible thing
to take away a man's dream.

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,068
Try to sit up.
Eat something.

30
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,320
And we can discuss
these feelings.

31
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,447
That's the thing
about most of us
from the neighborhood,

32
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,699
you know that?

33
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,076
We all reach this point

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,494
where there's nothin' left
to aim for.

35
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,330
But I'm gettin' ahead
of myself.

36
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,504
You know, maybe I will just
have one of those carrots.

37
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,466
See, Tommy Donnelly's dream

38
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,468
was to pursue
all that art crap.

39
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,222
Now, it's a little gay for me,
but for Tommy,

40
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,266
it was the only thing
other than Jenny Reilly

41
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,893
that he ever really wanted.

42
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,396
And he decided to go for it,
once and for all.

43
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,982
Hello?

44
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,400
MUNST: In the back.

45
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,209
You're Kate's friend.

46
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,377
Tommy Donnelly.

47
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,756
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Munst.

48
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,090
Mmm-hmm.

49
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,469
(GROANS)

50
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,312
What are you doing?

51
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,106
I thought
I would show you
some of my...

52
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,566
No, no. Hey! Seriously,

53
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,443
seriously,
put that away.

54
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,529
Kate said you wanted
to see some of my work.

55
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,948
Please! I can't handle
amateur crap

56
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,282
this early
in the morning.

57
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,541
Maybe there's been
some mistake.

58
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,671
Kate said you
wanted this job.

59
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,214
Job?

60
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,716
Are we having
language issues here?

61
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,427
The intern job.
You want it?

62
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,098
Depends. What do I have to do?

63
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,350
Oh, now we got
contingencies, right?

64
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,812
No. I'll take it.

65
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,022
All right.

66
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,860
Get me some coffee,
and here,

67
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,319
some stuff I need done.

68
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,824
There a problem?

69
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,992
No.

70
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,995
I'm on it.
Well, not yet, you're not.

71
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,914
If you was on it,
I would see your
tootsies movin'.

72
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,130
Now, Jimmy
had dreams too.

73
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,090
But he didn't just want
his name in lights,

74
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,217
he wanted
his whole life in lights.

75
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,220
So he started with a new sign
for the Firecracker.

76
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,649
I don't get it.

77
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,776
What's not to get?
There's a flame
and a cracker.

78
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,195
Put it together.

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,821
Flame cracker?

80
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,531
Oh, I get it.
Firecracker.

81
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,158
It's a little
confusing.

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,784
Don't you guys
watch commercials?

83
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,746
The ones you don't understand,
but they make you think?

84
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,830
That's this!

85
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,708
Abstract.
I don't get abstract.

86
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,128
Why didn't you just
print the words,
"The Firecracker"?

87
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,379
'Cause that's what
the old sign said.

88
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,006
We're startin' new here.

89
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,759
Okay, we got a problem.

90
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:19,885
What's this?

91
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,386
Louie Downtown's
cell phone.

92
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,930
The one you were
supposed to throw away?

93
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,015
Yeah, but that's
not the problem.

94
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,522
That's how you get rid
of a cell phone, Kevin!

95
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,689
Guess I should
have done that.

96
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,066
You guess?

97
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,445
Okay, Nicky Cottero
made a bet with you

98
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,613
on Louie's cell phone?

99
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,114
Yeah, on that cell phone
right there.

100
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,241
That's what I'm tellin' you.

101
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,617
And he lost?

102
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,327
A thousand bucks.

103
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,580
And he came to meet you last
night to pay off the bet.

104
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,706
Yeah.

105
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,874
But he didn't pay you?

106
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,918
No, he said
he needed another day.

107
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,587
That doesn't make any sense.
He should have killed you.

108
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,797
Yeah, I know.

109
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,048
But I didn't think
it'd be a good idea

110
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,174
to press the issue.

111
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,301
He's playin'
games with us.

112
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,637
Or he wants to make
a deal with us.

113
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,721
What kind of deal?

114
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,515
I don't know,
but if someone
stole my business,

115
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,558
I'd want to kill them.

116
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,310
Unless I thought that
they could make me money.

117
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,896

Where we goin', Jimmy?

119
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,484
You're not goin' anywhere.
You screwed up enough.

121
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,407

right? That's today.

Hey, listen,
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for,

178
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,283
but whatever it is,

179
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,744
do me a favor
and look for it
somewhere else.

180
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,121
Hey, I told you
not to come back here.
Nicky is not here.

181
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,207
Take another step,
I'll chop your thumbs off!

182
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,587
You do know that Nicky Cottero
owns this bar, right?

183
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,798
The last guy
who didn't pay
his bar tab

184
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,508
got a meat hook
up his ass.

185
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,009
What do you think's
gonna happen to you

186
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,135
if you rob the place?

187
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,137
What's the matter
with this guy?

188
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,305
I can't talk
to him either.

189
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,057
Tell Nicky that
Jimmy Donnelly
stopped by

190
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,767
to pick up
the thousand he owed.

191
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,937
He wants to talk to me,
he can call me
at the Firecracker.

192
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,025
Hit it!

193
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,654
COP: I'll put the word out,
but not much I can
do officially.

194
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,614
He's only missin' for what,
two hours?

195
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,533
I know something's wrong.

196
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,909
Has he gone missing before?

197
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,496
No, but he's been having
some memory problems,

198
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,707
and, I mean,
just once in a while...

199
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,042
So then he has
done this before?

200
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,420
He's never been
missing before.

201
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,756
Did he have any ID on him?
Driver's license, ID bracelet?

202
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,799
No, he left his wallet.

203
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,010
I assume he's not registered?

204
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,052
Registered?

205
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,262
As an Alzheimer's patient?

206
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,556
The Safe Return program,
you know about it?

207
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,057
He doesn't have Alzheimer's.

208
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,434
How do you know that?

209
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,311
You took him to a doctor?

210
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,146
No, he wouldn't go.

211
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,814
So you thought
it'd be better to wait

212
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,025
until he walked out
the front door and got lost.

213
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,404
Can I use your pen?

214
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,493
I'm gonna give you my cell

215
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,412
so if you hear anything
you could call me.

216
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,841
Hi, Vincent.

217
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,219
Why don't you call me Vinnie
like everybody else?

218
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,929
I mean, why does it
have to be Vincent?

219
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,764
I like Vincent.

220
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,641
Anybody can be a Vinnie.

221
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,768
Yeah, well,
I like being Vinnie.

222
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,687
What's up?

223
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,274
Guess I should let
you boys talk.

224
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,193
Oh, no, no, no.
Stay here.

225
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,820
Okay.

226
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,781
Well, we got a response.

227
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,616
From the Donnellys, right?
Yeah.

228
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,535
But it might not be
the one you wanted.

229
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,246
He robbed us for the $1,000
we owe him.

230
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,251
Somebody robbed this bar
and you're laughing?

231
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,336
No, it's all right, baby.

232
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,880
Nothin' I didn't expect.

233
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,509
MUNST: Tommy!

234
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,513
Coming!

235
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,772
JOEY. Sometimes it's a little
late to go for our dreams.

236
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,942
It's then that you realize
it's either give up the dream

237
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,485
or come up with another.

238
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,572
Kate came up with Tommy.

239
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,491
Thought I'd see how
your first day was going.

240
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,910
Thank you for the job.

241
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,745
Don't thank me yet.

242
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,747
Munst is a slave driver.

243
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,209
I see he's got you
doing the easy work.

244
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,337
I'm a mess.
And that wonderful smell?

245
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,006
That's me, too.

246
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,258
No, you look good.

247
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,011
I should let you
get back to work.

248
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,515
We have to set up a time
for Matthew's next
art lesson.

249
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,808
Sure.

250
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,895
Don't be too hard on him.

251
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,188
Mmm.

252
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,154
Good-lookin' widow.

253
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,492
It's okay.
Everybody needs
a benefactor.

254
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,287

I had more than one.

Nicky.

Nicky Cottero.

Oh, Nicky Cottero!
What's up?
How can I help you?

265
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,906
By the way,
thanks for that thousand.

266
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,282
I knew you'd be good for it.

267
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,493
You know what this is about,
right, Jimmy?

268
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,203
Of course I do.

269
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,205
You wanna talk,
you wanna meet,

270
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,250
you wanna be our friend,
our partner.

all of the above, right?

272
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,129
Yeah, that's exactly right.

273
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,298
Tell you what,
put your brother Tommy
on the phone.

274
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,509
What?
Put your brother Tommy
on the phone,

275
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,387
we'll meet, and then
we'll put a deal in place.

Here.

Thought you said
you weren't gonna
shoot anyone.

290
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,605
We're not.
This is just in case.

291
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,356
Just in case what?

292
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,194
Just in case Nicky so much as
puts his hand in his pocket,

293
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,779
I want you to
blow his brains out.

No, I never shot a gun before.

There's, like,
a safety, right?
Like an on-off switch?

00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,997
This is a Walther PPK

Here you go.

Safety on, big trouble.

Safety off,

is point and shoot.

Hey.

303
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,813
When you're done with that,
toilet's backed up.

304
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,038
You done already?

305
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,458
I'm not fixing your toilet.

Michelangelo's
most famous piece.

316
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,691
You know he didn't
wanna paint it?

317
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,402
He was a sculptor,
he wasn't a painter.

318
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,487
As far as he was concerned,

319
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,614
next to sculpting,
painting was crap.

320
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,492
The only reason he did that
was 'cause the Pope wanted it.

321
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,580
When the Pope calls me,
I'll clean his toilet.

322

The point is,
sometimes great work

323
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,711
comes from dealing
with crap.

with the toilet,

00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,386
What?

353
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,470
Nothin'.

354
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,891
What, are you scared?

355
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,226
No.

356
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,271
Don't worry about these guys,
though, Seanie.

357
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,857
I put myself in a position
where they need me.

358
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,859
Why do you think
Nicky called?

359
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,986
You don't think he heard about
what I've been doin'?

360
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,154
Not just the bookmaking,
everything.

361
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,948
They want a piece
of this neighborhood,

362
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,700
they know
they gotta come to me.

363
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,669
Uh-oh.

364
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,722
Has my dad been in today?

365
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:17,890
Today?

366
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,892
Yes, Kevin, today.
Has my dad been in?

367
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,685
No. I haven't seen him.

368
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,146
Do me a favor.
If he comes in,
will you call me?

369
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,231
Sure.
Thanks.

370
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,066
Yo, Jenny.
Yeah?

371
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,694
Is everything okay?

372
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,779
Yeah, yeah, it's just...

373
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,365
I'm sure it's nothing.

374
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,621
Nice if you let us know

375
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,206
who's coming through
the door next time.

376
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,000
I guess I screwed up again.

377
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,261
What's up?

378
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,348
I can't find my dad,
that's all.

379
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,309
He's been sick and...

380
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,353
It's nothing.
I don't need any
help from you, Kevin.

381
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,771
Why are you
just standin' there?

382
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,898
Because I don't
know where to go!
I've been everywhere!

383
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,859
You try the Yoko Club?

384
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:12,819
No.

385
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,865
Where you goin'?

386
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:17,950
With you.

387
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,373
Look, with all due respect,

388
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,916
I pay you for protection.

389
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,125
Give me this.

390
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,294
I shouldn't have to worry
about some kids comin' in here

391
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,380
and playin' Russian roulette
with my face.

392
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:32,840
You're right, and it's not
gonna happen again,

393
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,800
and you don't pay
Jimmy Donnelly another dime.

394
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:35,926
What about the other one?

395
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,970
What are you not
understandin' here,
Christie?

396
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,805
Fine.

397
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,223
But...
But what?

398
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,559
Look, I don't wanna
belabor a point,

399
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,769
but Jimmy took 500 off me.

400
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,899
Earl, give him $500.

401
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,534
Look, I don't know
if it matters to you,

402
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,660
but the kid with Jimmy,

403
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,495
I don't think
he was a Donnelly.

404
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,831
Seemed more like
a crackhead to me.

405
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,791
And Jimmy called
the kid Whitey.

406
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,047
JOEY. Now, for some people,

407
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,717
losin' a dream
can make you dangerous.

408
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,677
'Cause they don't
think long-term.

409
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,180
They just want what they want,
when they want it.

410
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:24,349
Earl, I want you to find out
who this kid Whitey is

411
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,226
and I want you
to bring him to me.

412
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,269
Fast.

413
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,818
I don't think he's comin'.

414
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,111
Shut up!

415
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,364
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

416
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,495
Yeah!

417
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,787
Jimmy Donnelly.

418
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,457
You're late!
Yeah, well...

419
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,334
(CHUCKLES)

420
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,793
I already told ya,

421
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,213
I don't wanna deal with
the hothead junkie brother.

422
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,547
I wanna deal with
the smart brother.

423
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,342
You don't talk to Tommy,
you talk to me.

424
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,010
Have Tommy give me a call.

425
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,346
You do know how to deliver
a message, don't ya?

426
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,934
What happened?

427
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,313
(BOTH LAUGHING)

428
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,106
Come on,
let's call him again.

429
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,706
Hey, fellows.
Get out, Kevin.

430
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,250
You're barred
until you square up.

431
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,376
I'm not here to play.

432
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,544
What'd you bring a girl
in here for?

433
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,212
We haven't had a girl
in here in 50 years.

434
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,922
I didn't think
he had a girl.

435
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:40,425
I have never seen a more
asexual kid in my life.

436
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,636
Three-to-one
she's not his.

437
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,929
Hey, have you guys
seen lan Reilly?

438
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,180
We're looking for him.

439
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,015
Hasn't been in today.

440
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,183
Thanks.

441
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,601
Come on, Kevin.

442
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,439
Hey, Joey. It's Jenny.
Is he back yet?

443
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:55,607
Not yet.

444
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,443
But if he comes in,
I'll give you a call.

445
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,947
By the way,
I love this place.

446
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,534
And don't chisel me
on the tip.

447
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,454
I want you to give me that
thing that Whitey gave ya.

448
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,790
Why?
Just give it to me.

449
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,000
Jimmy, you know
what we should do?

450
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,251
We should just call Tommy.

451
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:15,752
What?

452
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:17,588
Why don't we
just call Tommy?

453
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:18,755
Why?

454
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,966
Forget it.
No!

455
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,302
I wanna know why you think
we should call Tommy.

456
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,553
Jimmy, come on...

457
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:25,888
You said that, right?

458
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,347
We should call Tommy?

459
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,766
I wanna know why
you think that!

460
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,643
I'm not gonna answer you.

461
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:32,769
Then keep your mouth shut

462
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,354
if you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

463
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,909
Jimmy...

464
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,167
Okay, so I got news.

465
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,630
Whitey is that fat-bookie-
out-the-window's nephew.

466
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,382
Nobody could ever
figure out what jerk

467
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,967
told Earl about Whitey.

468
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,010
His name is Whitey.

469
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,179
First name Terrence,
last name Whalen.

470
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,264
I don't know why Jimmy's
hangin' around that guy.

471
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,433
He's a low-life junkie.
More coffee?

472
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,144
Anything else
you wanna know?
I got customers.

473
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,188
I want you to find him.

474
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:17,648
And when you do,
you ask him

475
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,149
when was the last time
he saw his uncle.

476
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:20,734
'Cause I'm thinkin'
it was just before

477
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,736
he took the swan dive,
you know?

478
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,491
All right. Here we go,
set them down.

479
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:31,745
Okay.

480
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,333
Make a little pile,
all right?

481
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,459
Now,

482
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:41,880
you do a little hole,
like so.

483
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,384
It's like a pie crust,
you make a pie crust?

484
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,261
Make a little hole
in the flour.

485
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:51,473
Here we go. Nice.

486
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,560
We add a drop of honey.

487
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,398
Now, here we go.

488
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,073
All right.

489
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,911
What's the worst moment
in your life?

490
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:18,834
Come on, you wanna be part
of this or don't you?

491
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,052
I hurt my brother.

492
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,182
Okay. All right.

493
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,644
That sounds like scarlet
to me.

494
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,064
You.

495
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,400
Grind it.

496
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,361
Go on.

497
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,199
Harder.

498
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,577
Ah, okay, that's good.

499
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,955
That's good, that's good.
Here we go.

500
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:04,713
You got those eggs?

501
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,299
All right, now,
two yolks into this bowl.

502
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,176
All right?

503
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:16,475
Now just the yolk,

504
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,268
little bit of membrane,
all right?

505
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,604
Not too much,
the paint gets greasy.

506
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,441
Nice. Honey.

507
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:29,029
When I add the mix,
it's gonna start to dry quick.

508
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,489
You're gonna have to
keep addin' water

509
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:31,657
or I can't use it.

510
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,492
Got it.
Okay?

511
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:36,078
You gotta go, okay.

512
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,084
Are you ready to go?

513
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,961
I got enough time
to use the bathroom?

514
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,546
Yeah, hurry up, hurry up.

515
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:46,964
All right.

516
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,176
You got five seconds
before I get fired!

517
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,262
Jimmy's on his way
to kill Nicky.

518
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,471
Really?

519
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,099
I thought he was doin' that
this afternoon. I'm goin'.

520
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,142
Tommy, it's for real
this time.

521
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,102
He's goin' down
to Nicky's bar,

522
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,520
he's got a gun.

523
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,604
Why? What happened?

524
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:03,730
Nicky called the bar,

525
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:04,815
said he wanted to make
some kind of a deal.

526
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,109
But he only wanted
to talk to you.

527
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,694
Look, Nicky made a jerk
out of him, Tommy.

528
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:09,903
He said he was comin',

529
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,864
then made him wait
at the bar for two hours.

530
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,615
They laughed at him.

531
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,326
JOEY. Now, Tommy had seen
what Jimmy did to people

532
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,870
who tried to make a jerk
out of him.

533
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,121
Give me your cell phone.

534
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,548
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

535
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,550
Beautiful, isn't she?

536
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,054
Nicky, phone.

537
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,140
A hundred dollars,
who do you think that is?

538
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,725
Tommy or Jimmy?

539
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:40,934
Jimmy.

540
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,270
You're gonna
owe me a hundred.

541
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,694
You look really good.

542
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:53,363
Thanks.
Why don't you go home?

543
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:55,824
I'll see you
back here tonight.

544
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,117
Okay.

545
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,368
All right.

546
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,914
Bye, Vincent.

547
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,041
Yeah.

548
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,585
Yeah?

549
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:07,753
Nicky Cottero?

550
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:09,922
It's Tommy.

551
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,673
Tommy Donnelly.

552
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:15,761
If you wanna talk,
I'm gonna be at Pete's,

553
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:16,887
under the bridge.

554
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,723
Twenty minutes.
Don't be late.

555
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,309
Go to the bar.

556
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:24,561
What are you waitin' for?

557
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:25,604
Okay.

558
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,567
Tommy!

559
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,738
All right.

560
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:37,866
All right.

561
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:40,077
All right,
when I mix this,

562
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,621
it's gonna
start to dry,
all right?

563
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,498
It's gonna dry fast,
so you gotta keep
addin' the water

564
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,707
or I can't use this paint.

565
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,125
I gotta go.

566
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,794
Pardon me?

567
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:49,837
I'm sorry.

568
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,548
You gotta add water to this
or it's gonna dry out.

569
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:53,966
Come on, whatever it is,
it can wait.

570
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,050
It can't.

571
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,802
This came from you.
You don't wanna see it?

572
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:02,641
If you leave now,
you're fired, you know that?

573
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,809
Yeah, I know.
But you're leavin'.

574
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:04,935
Yeah.

575
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,603
Do yourself a favor, kid.

576
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,105
Give it up.

577
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,815
'Cause if there's
somethin' else out there

578
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,025
that's more important
than this,

579
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,027
it always will be.

580
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,291
JOEY. Now, you might think
this is the moment,

581
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,836
the moment when Tommy
walked away from his dream.

582
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,338
But I'm not finished yet.

583
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:38,969
We'll find him.

584
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,389
Thanks. Thanks for coming
with me today.

585

(PHONE RINGING)

586
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,353
Hello?

587
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,606
Yeah, this is Jenny Reilly.

588
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:55,611
Okay.

589
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:57,821
Okay, thank you.

590
00:28:57,863 --> 00:28:58,906
Who was that?

591
00:28:58,989 --> 00:28:59,907
That was the cop
I spoke to earlier.

592
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,617
We need to get a cab.

593
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,952
A man my dad's age
just got hit by a car.

594
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,796
Does your father have any
distinguishing marks?

595
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,590
Scars, tattoos,
anything like that?

596
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:17,674
No, I don't think so.

597
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:18,800
How old is he?

598
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:20,886
My father is, um, 56.

599
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,097
We have someone.
You should make
an identification.

600
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,059
Identification,
what does that mean?

601
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,477
The cops said that
you had someone

602
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,103
that was hit by a car.

603
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,397
That person expired
a couple of minutes ago.

604
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,858
He's been listed
as a John Doe.

605
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,860
I think it would be
a good idea for you

606
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,403
to make an identification.

607
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:42,074
Oh, God.

608
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:55,087
You need me to stay
and pull the sheet back?

609
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:56,964
I'll do it.

610
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,715
You can take your time.

611
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:20,237
Let's get out of here.

612
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,451
It's not him.

613
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,801
Your name Whitey?

614
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:25,969
Who wants to know?

615
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:28,931
Nobody asks
"Who wants to know?"
Unless it's them.

616
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,266
Come on.

617
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,568
The one guy who could
have had his dream,

618
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:44,571
and made it out
of the neighborhood, Whitey.

619
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:47,074
He was so fast,
he could have made
the Olympics

620
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,158
or somethin' like that.

621
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,077
But the idiot
never went out for track.

622
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,224
Where the hell have you been?

623
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,757
Hey, Tommy.
Thanks for comin'.

624
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:48,635
No problem.
How you doin'?

625
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,304
Good.

626
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,641
Want some wine?

627
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:56,768
What's on your mind?

628
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:02,983
You and I both know

629
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,568
that your brothers
killed Louie Downtown.

630
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:08,363
They stole his business,
which is my business.

631
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,115
No, I don't know
anything about that.

632
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,241
It doesn't matter.

633
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,994
It's all history.
I wanna forget
about the whole thing,

634
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,496
we start from scratch.

635
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,290
We start what?

636
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:20,042
What do you think
I'm talkin' about?

637
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:24,505
Talkin' about business.
Dokey Farrell's a dead man.

638
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,175
The only thing left to do
is bury him.

639
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,011
What's that got
to do with me?

640
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:34,473
This. I could bury you
and your brothers
with Dokey,

641
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,308
or we could talk
about your future.

642
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:39,770
Hey, guys!

643
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,734
Sorry I'm late.

644
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:49,822
So,

645
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,242
what we talkin' about?

646
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,037
You're gonna have
to handle this.

647
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,164
What I have to say
is to you.

648
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,375
Can you believe this guy,
Tommy?

649
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,335
Hey, did you order
pizza yet or what?

650
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,336
Jimmy, what are you doin'?

651
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:07,256
I'm listenin'.
I'm on the edge of my seat.

652
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,801
Keep talkin'.
Don't stop 'cause of me.

653
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:12,511
What happened to this kid?

654
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,179
Your mother dropped him
on his head?

655
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,266
Get your hands
off me, Tommy!

656
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,476
Come on,
let's talk outside.

657
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,353
You have somethin' to say,
say it!

658
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,355
This guy wants
to make us a deal.

659
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,315
And I need to hear it.

660
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,693
It's not about you.
It's about all of us.

661
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,403
What makes him think
you're the one

662
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:30,946
he should be talkin' to?

663
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,240
You really want me
to tell you?
Yeah.

664
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,953
'Cause he thinks I'm gonna
get it done and you won't.

665
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:40,831
That what you wanna hear,
Jimmy?

666
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,376
You know what, Tommy?
Party's over.

667
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,837
Please, don't do anything.
He's gonna give me the gun.

668
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,964
The hell I am!
Jimmy, there's no choice here.

669
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,507
Yeah, there is.

670
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,302
He shoots me,
I'm still gonna shoot him.

671
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,513

Tell him to let him go.

Tell him to let him go!

677
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,030
Yeah.

678
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,336
Outside.

679
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,049

680
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:34,259
All right.

681
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:50,651

I could have run you over!

685
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:27,813
Maybe you should have.

686
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,065
So he give you
a good deal?

687
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,903
A very good deal.

688
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,492
You get to keep
Louie Downtown's action.

689

Twenty percent of everything
I got goin' on with Dokey.

690
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:46,790
All of it.
Extortion, prostitution,

691
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,125
loan sharking, everything.

692
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,835
What about Dokey?

693
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,171
He's gonna kill Dokey.

694
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,630
He's lookin' for somebody
in the neighborhood

695
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:54,756
he can work with.

696
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:56,550
He thinks it's us.

697
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,010
You mean you.

698
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:06,643
It is a good deal.
You took it, I hope.

699
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:08,228
After all this?

700
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,106
After all what?
Let bygones be bygones.

701
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:13,692
It's a great thing,
it's what we always wanted.

702
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:17,905
Now, Tommy knew Nicky
was gonna get what he wanted.

703
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:20,449
Dokey was gonna die.

704
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:23,869
And if Nicky had his way,
Jimmy, Sean and Kevin

705
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:24,995
were gonna die, too.

706
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:27,206
It was that simple.

707
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,672
Did you take the deal?

708
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:38,425
Tommy!

709
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,844
Tommy, did you
take the deal?

710
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,889
I hope you weren't
stupid about this.

711
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,601
So what are we gonna do?

712
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:50,145
Kill this kid
and kill his brothers?

713
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,563
What do you wanna
do that for?

714
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:53,023
You wanna ruin everything?

715
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,441
What ruin everything?

716
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:56,026
You told him
that we're gonna kill Dokey.

717
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,528
Don't you think
he's gonna go
tell him that?

718
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,696
I think he likes Dokey
less than we do.

719
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:02,699
Why don't you have
another glass of wine.

720
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:05,869
Be a little patient.
He'll come around.

721
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,379
I guess I'll be goin', then.

722
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,923
Thanks for lookin'
after the place.

723
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,093
It's nothin'.

724
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:23,554
Joey.

725
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,680
Yeah?

726
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:25,806
Keys.

727
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:27,891
Oh.

728
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:29,685
JOEY. Actually,
now that I think about it,

729
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,395
no wonder I'm depressed.

730
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:33,939
That was the day
I lost my dream, too.

731
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,274
Oh?

732
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,067
I always wanted to be
a short-order cook.

733
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,778
So why didn't you ask her
for a job?

734
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:43,782
I never thought of that.

735
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:08,265
Go home, Kevin.
It's been a long day.

736
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:16,106
I'll stay.

737
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,806
It's beautiful,
ain't it?

738
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,892
It's pretty cool.

739
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,854
Seanie, I been takin' care
of ya, haven't I?

740
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,064
Yeah.

741
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,568
I believed in you,
a little bit.

742
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:03,779
Jimmy, I'm sorry
I called Tommy.

743
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,489
Nothin' to be sorry about.

744
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,951
You think what you think.

745
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,037
And it ain't much of me.

746
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:45,779
I fired you.

747
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:48,657
I know.

748
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,623
I just wanted to see it.

749
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,209
How it would look.

750
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,815
JOEY. And that was the moment

751
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,776
Tommy walked away
from his dream.

752
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,908
Hey, I'm feelin'
much better now!

753
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:58,078
(DOOR SLAMS)
You got any more
of that food left?
