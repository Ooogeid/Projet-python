00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:04,969
<i>There were four</i>
<i>Donnelly brothers,</i>

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,903
<i>Sean, Kevin, Jimmy,</i>
<i>and Tommy.</i>

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,873
<i>They had this thing</i>
<i>for always getting</i>
<i>into trouble,</i>

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,409
<i>usually 'cause Jimmy</i>
<i>did something stupid</i>

6
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,411
<i>like stealing a truckload</i>
<i>of Hawaiian shirts,</i>

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,037
<i>leaving Tommy</i>
<i>to clean up the mess.</i>

8
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,413
<i>Did I mention that Tommy had</i>
<i>this thing for Jenny Reilly?</i>

9
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,717
<i>Okay. Skip to a couple</i>
<i>of days ago.</i>

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,549
<i>Kevin had a huge</i>
<i>gambling debt.</i>

11
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:22,621
Damn.

12
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,088
<i>So Jimmy got the idea</i>
<i>to kidnap an Italian.</i>

13
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,489
<i>To get back at the Donnellys,</i>

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,891
<i>the Italians beat up Sean.</i>

15
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,396
<i>To get back at the Italians,</i>
<i>Jimmy killed Louie.</i>

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,163
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>Tommy went to see Huey,</i>
<i>the head of the Irish mob,</i>

17
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,726
<i>to try and fix things,</i>
<i>but that didn't work.</i>

18
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:42,740
<i>So to protect his brother,</i>
<i>Tommy got Jimmy arrested</i>
<i>for the shirt thing,</i>

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,835
<i>then Tommy and Kevin</i>
<i>killed Sal, the head</i>
<i>of the Italian mob,</i>

20
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:49,211
<i>and Huey, the aforementioned</i>
<i>head of the Irish mob,</i>

21
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,046
<i>and hoped that, somehow,</i>
<i>no one would notice.</i>

22
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,948
<i>Me? I always wanted</i>
<i>brothers like that.</i>

Oh, God in heaven.

29
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,864
Like that night for example.
I wasn't there.

30
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,173
So there's no way
I could actually know
what happened.

31
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,607
And that was
Tommy's plan, see?

32
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,475
To keep his brothers safe
by keeping that night
a secret.

33

KEVIN:
Tommy, Tommy, wait.

34
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,514

36
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,743
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.

37
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,113
So we should go back
and be seen in order to
make sure that nobody saw us?

38
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,521
You don't have to use
sarcasm on me.
Kevin, nobody saw us.

39
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,618
What about the
parking lot guy?
We're five blocks away.

40
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:36,990
Yeah, but he nodded at me.

41
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,564
So we should kill him?

42
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,963
No! No, of course not.

43
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,533
I mean, unless
you think we...

44
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,833
Kevin, stop. Breathe.

45
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,634
Tommy, all the breathing
in the world is not gonna
change what we did.

46
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,809
Guns are loud.
People heard us.

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,110
And what if Sal and Huey
told someone that Jimmy
was coming?

48
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,881
They were planning
on killing Jimmy.

49
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,614
That's not something
you tell somebody.

50
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,745
Yeah, but these guys...

51
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,986
Shh. Kevin, no one saw us.
No one knows.

52
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,558
And as long as we keep
what happened between
the two of us, no one's gonna.

53
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,423

<i>is if both of them are dead. "

fallout from this?

175
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,729
I got a couple guys
say they work here.

176
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,091
No kidding?

177
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,070
You ask me, this isn't
the brightest idea
you've come up with.

178
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,362
Really?

179
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,166
What do you think
was my best idea?

180
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,300
The very best?

181
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,401
Best you can think of.

182
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,140
Squeezing Jimmy Donnelly
till he whacked Sal.

183
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,146
That worked out
pretty well, didn't it?

184
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,050
Why don't you
have a little faith?

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,914
Morning, Detective.

186
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,580
Nicky Cottero, right?

187
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,254
That's right,
Detective.

188
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,820
So I was, you know,
wondering if you had
any news.

189
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,552
You're a reporter now,
Nicky?

190
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,697
Well, Sal, you know,
he was a beloved employer.

191
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,267
It's understandable the staff
is gonna be upset.

192
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,303
I was just wondering
if you had something
I could pass on to them.

193
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,203
No. Right now
I just have questions.

194
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,136
Like what was the head
of the Irish mob

195
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,836
doing down here
with all these Italians?

196
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,470
Drinking,

197
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,374
watching porn,
I couldn't tell you.

198
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,749
So what brings you down here
this early in the morning?

199
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,217
Is it a responsibility
to brief the staff?

200
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,977
Well, I'm
the beverage manager.

201
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,679
People are gonna naturally
look to me for answers.

202
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,391
Well, why don't you go
upstairs and think of some,

203
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,258
and then when
I'm finished down here,
you can fill me in, too.

204
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,028
I'm glad to help.

205
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,199
This is
a terrible crime.

206
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,231
Thanks. You guys
are doing a great job.

207
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,974
Cocky son of a bitch
came down here
to plant a flag.

208
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,079
Meanwhile, Huey's brother,
Dokey,

209
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,483
was also curious about
who killed his brother,

210
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,681
<i>and was asking some</i>
<i>questions of his own.</i>

211
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,552
So you don't know
anything, huh?

212
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,124
(GROANING)

213
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,460
You know anything now?

214
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,658
TOMMY: Make sure
the ink part's face down.
KEVIN: Got it.

215
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,258
And you got enough
tin foil around it.
I got it, I got it.

216
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,700
Damn.

217
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,504
I'm telling you, Tommy...

218
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,674
Kevin, will you
stop worrying?

219
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,808
It's gonna be okay.

220
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,545
I can see the ink.

221
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,688
Are you wearing
two jackets?

222
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,383
How do you mean?

223
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,184
You are!

224
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,593
I told you we had to get rid
of what we were wearing.

225
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,631
Yeah, but it's
my favorite one.

226
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,390
Throw it out right now!
Oh, man.

227
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,663
I'm going to class.
You do what you normally do.

228
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,466
We gotta act like
it's a regular day
and nothing happened.

229
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,232
What are you staring at,
Kevin?

230
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,935
Kev!

231
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,214
Damn it, Jimmy.

232
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,279
Here you go, fellas.
Thanks a lot.
Okay.

233
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,558
It's coming right up,
May, okay?
Hey, no problem.

234
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,190
Here you go.

235
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,270
Hey!
Hey, Pop,
who hasn't ordered?

236
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,566
Everybody's good,
I got you covered.

237
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,542
You just coming
from the hospital now?

238
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,737
Yeah.
They kept that boy
in overnight?

239
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,280
Yeah. He's still in ICU.
It's terrible.

240
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,071
Yeah.

241
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,478
"Yeah"?

242
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,915
I hate to see
anyone get hurt.

243
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,421
Pop, just leave it for once.

244
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,185
There's just two sides
to every story.

245
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,693
There's two sides to Sean
being beaten so hard he might
have brain damage?

246
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,354
What's the second side
to that, Dad?

247
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,695
Well, you don't give somebody
a beating like that unless
you got a reason.

248
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,496
Are you good here?
'Cause I'm gonna
take a walk.

249
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,594
Jenny, listen to me, please.

250
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,572
I know you like Tommy.

251
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,067
And I don't think
he's a bad kid.

252
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,671
It's just that...

253
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,338
It's like something
is in their blood.

254
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,979
No matter how hard
they try to do good,

255
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,382
that blood is always
gonna seep through.

256
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,813
And it poisons
whatever it touches.

257
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,552
Gosh, Dad, why didn't
you ever tell me
you felt this way?

258
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,585
Jenny.

259
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,755
Come on, Jenny!

260
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,603
You wonder why
we have to keep
buying new stools.

261
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,037
I should've known Jimmy
was too messed up
to take care of anything.

262
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,574
Now we gotta get rid of a body
in broad daylight?

263
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,236
Okay, so we'll
wait till tonight.
Yeah, you're right, Kevin.

264
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,179
'Cause the smell of a rotting
body is not gonna attract
any attention.

265
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,304
Let's wait.

266
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,476
Again with the sarcasm.
I'm getting sick of it,
Tommy.

267
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,617
I mean, how could
he just dump it there?
What the hell is he thinking?

268
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,418
Come on,
where would you put it?

269
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,220
Not in the dumpster
behind the bar, Kevin!
Okay, so where?

270
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,489
I don't know.
How many bodies
you get rid of before?

271
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,996
Hey, what about
the landfill?

272
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,296
I mean, we could sneak in,
put him under some garbage,
they'd bury him for us.

273
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,393
The landfill on
Staten Island?
Yeah.

274
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,439
So what,
we just take a ferry,
just the three of us?

275
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,210
Okay. We stuff him
in a furnace.
Our furnace?

276
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,472
No, of course not,
somebody else's.

277
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,536
Oh, you know someone
with a furnace large
enough for a body?

278
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,844
Well, I'd have
to think about it.

279
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,111
How about a tub
full of acid?

280
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,747
Kevin,
stop making suggestions.
You're really freaking me out.

281
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,756
Okay, we can bury him.

282
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,951
Oh, you know a place
in the city where
we can bury a body?

283
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,026
Jersey.

284
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,090
(PHONE RINGING)
I know a place.

285
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,027
Hello?
<i>JIMMY. Where the hell</i>
<i>have you been?</i>

286
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,090
Jimmy!
<i>I been calling</i>
<i>since 7.00!</i>

287
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,726
You should be down here
to bail me out!

288
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,803
I don't know,
I guess we're
a little preoccupied,

289
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,896
what with Louie's body
out back in the trash!

290
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,969
What, now it's my fault
that I got arrested?

291
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,532
You told me you
took care of it.

292
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,407
I was going to...

293
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,340
You know, it's real smart,
Tommy, talking about this
on the phone.

294
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,445
Just get down here
and bail me.

295
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,882
Not gonna do it.
What do you mean?

296
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,852
I'm not gonna argue about it.
You wanna talk to somebody,

297
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,012
you can talk to Kevin.

298
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,089
Why me?

299
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,791
Hey, Jimmy.
We're not gonna do it!

300
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,359
<i>JIMMY. Kevin, listen to me.</i>

301
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,391
<i>There's a bag under the bar.</i>
<i>From Sal.</i>

302
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,054
You know what bag
I'm talking about.

303
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,325
Hold on.

304
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,599
Where under the bar?
It's under the taps,
I think.

305
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,934
This place is disgusting.
Sorry.

306
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,166
You know what? Stop looking,
I don't want you to get dirty.

307
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,805
Why is everyone using
sarcasm on me today?

308
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,605
Okay, I got it.

309
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,240
Just get down here
and get me out.

310
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,944
Wait, Jimmy, wait, wait.
What?

311
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,213
If I took this
to the track first,
I could double it.

312
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,051
You gamble a penny of that,
I'm gonna bite
your thumbs off!

313
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,428
You coming?

314
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,853
Where you going?
Nowhere.

315
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,830
What's in that bag?
Nothing.

316
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,765
Hmm?
Hey! Hey.

317
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,499
This is the ransom money!
You think?

318
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,664
Give it back, Tommy.
Hey!

319
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,105
Give it back!
Hey!

320
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,573
What the hell's
wrong with you?

321
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,237
You think you can just
bail Jimmy out and suddenly
he's not gonna be the guy

322
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,574
who got us into
all this crap?

323
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,547
You wanna forget
the fact he shot Louie?
Yeah?

324
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,015
How many people
did we shoot last night?
Because of Jimmy!

325
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,875
I'm not gonna argue
with you, either.

326
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,215
We don't have enough time,
because we gotta go

327
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,754
clean up another one
of Jimmy's messes.

328
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,552
Look, there's 30 grand
in there. We could bail
Jimmy out with five.

329
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,321
You don't get it,
do you?

330
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,191
We're screwed here.

331
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,557
Let's go.

332
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,625
Wait. How do you
know any of this?

333
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,690
Oh.

334
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,430
Well, maybe
that particular time
I was there.

335
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,406
Hey, you guys take off,
I'll watch everything.

336
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,772
Where the hell
did you come from?

337
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,037
What? I been here
the whole time.

338
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,978
Don't worry,
mum's the word,
lips are sealed.

339
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,875
You pay for that beer?

340
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,078
Yeah, probably.

341
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,259
Psst. Tommy.
Pony car?

342
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,191
We're not going
for a joyride, Kevin.

343
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,102
Get in, I'll grab him
on this end.

344
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,574
You get in.

345
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,410
I'm driving.

346
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,542
Yeah, what's that got
to do with anything?

347
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,951
You don't get in,
I don't drive.

348
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,621
Let's go!

349
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,874
Damn, the stench of him.

350
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,849
I feel like it's in my skin.
Drive faster.

351
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,046
And get stopped
for a ticket? Smart.

352
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,013
Did you lock the door
at the back of the bar?

353
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,923
While you were berating me
or while I was digging
a corpse out of the dumpster?

354
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,526
Oh, that's sarcasm,
isn't it?

355
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,088
Don't make me laugh,
I'm pissed at you.

356
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,292
You're pissed at me?

357
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,925
Damn straight.

358
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,461
Are you sure we're going
in the right direction?

359
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,527
I'm sure.

360
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,975
How you know
about this place?

361
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,841
Jake Macey.

362
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,278
Used to steal cars
and drag race out here.

363
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,976
It's right by a swamp,
no one around for miles.

364
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,243
It's perfect.

365
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,094
This is it?

366
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,158
Yeah.

367
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,124
This is the abandoned swamp

368
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,271
with no one around
for miles and miles?

369
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,466
Last time I was here,

370
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,201
yeah.

371
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,544
It's not like you had
a better plan.

372
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,582
Yeah. Now who's stupid, huh?

373
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,127
You couldn't get
a bigger barrel?

374
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,228
They don't make
bigger barrels.

375
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,690
Come on.

376
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,204
(RUMBLING)

377
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,773
What are you doing?

378
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,238
He's alive!

379
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,506
Where did you get that?

380
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,673
How many guns did Jimmy
have at the bar, huh?

381
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,952
Come on.
Grab his legs again.

382
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,190
No, no! Not until
I know he's dead.
He's dead!

383
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,815
That was just gas
escaping from his body.
Then why did you jump?

384
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,951
Because you did!
Yeah.

385
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,959
We need holes
in the barrel, anyway.
Come on.

386
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,701
It's not gonna work.

387
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,938
Stay out of sight.
I'll be right back.

388
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,169
Hey!

389
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,511
Wait. Hey!

390
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,287
Whoa, whoa.
What's that for?

391
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,823
Strip down.

392
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,124
What?

393
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,417
Take off your clothes, Kevin.

394
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,444
Hold his ankles.

395
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,148
Tommy.

396
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,682
Do it, Kevin.

397
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,177
(VOMITING)

398
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,018
Come on, Kevin.

399
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,151
I can't.

400
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:50,962
Hello?

401
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,236
Tommy?

402
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,564
Tommy!

403
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,665
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,435
I'm sorry I couldn't
help over there.

405
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,345
I don't know
what happened to me.

406
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,808
It's just like...

407
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,522
I started shaking
and everything went dark.

408
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,684
Not now, Kevin.
What I'm trying to tell you
is it was just like...

409
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,125
Like I didn't
have any control.

410
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,496
And my hands and my legs...
Kevin,

411
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,331
I'm not really interested
in how you feel about
what happened here.

412
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,999
Please just
shut the hell up.

413
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,293
Did you take anything
out of that bag?

414
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,000
No.

415
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,115
What are you doing?

416
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,476
Counting the money.

417
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,419
We gotta get out of here.

418
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,354
You don't believe me,
why'd you even ask, huh?

419
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,994
I wanna see
if you were lying to me.

420
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,818
All right, fine!
I took some money, okay?

421
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,558
But only enough
to bail Jimmy out.

422
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,423
What a great idea.

423
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,066
I turn myself inside out
to get him into jail,
to rehab,

424
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,697
so that he won't be killed
or kill himself, and you're
gonna bail him out?

425
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,333
We're his brothers.
He's sick, he needs us.

426
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,501
I'm helping him.

427
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,942
No one gets help in there.

428
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,502
If you'd ever been in there
you'd know that.

429
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,988
Give me the money, Kevin.
No, it's not your money,
all right?

430
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,218
It was Jimmy's idea,
you didn't want
any part of it.

431
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,520
Give me the money.

432
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,788
I'm keeping it, all right?
It's my cut, I can do
with it what I want.

433
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,799
There is no cut,
don't you understand that?

434
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,896
This is ransom money,
and the Italians know
who they paid it to.

435
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,972
You want a chance of living,
we gotta give it back.

436
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,008
Give it back, Tommy?

437
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,909
This is part of your big plan
to make everything right?

438
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,041
Tommy, Louie is dead!
If they wanna
kill us for that,

439
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,980
giving back the money is
not gonna change anything.

440
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,109
Nobody knows Louie's dead.

441
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,345
The only people who knew
were Huey and Sal.

442
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,686
So what, they're gonna think
he went on vacation?

443
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,280
He's a low-level bookie.

444
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,121
Nobody cared
about him but Sal,

445
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,287
because he was his nephew.
Nobody's gonna care.

446
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,456
What they're gonna care about
is that money.

447
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,725
And we're giving it back.

448
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,534
You give the money back,
they're gonna blow
your brains out.

449
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,036
Then they're gonna come
looking for the rest of us.

450
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,071
Where is it?
Keep your hands off of me.

451
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,600
Do it again, Tommy,
I swear to God...
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

452
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,205
What are you gonna do? Hmm?

453
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,054
(GROANS)

454
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:39,590
(SHOUTS)

455
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,667
Go ahead, Kevin.

456
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,234
You're right.
I'm the one trying
to hurt Jimmy.

457
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,137
Shoot me.

458
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,075
Pull the trigger.
Come on, Kevin,
pull the trigger.

459
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,858
Get up.

460
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,225
Get out of here, Kevin.

461
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,123
Here?

462
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,135
Yeah. Go home.

463
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,462
You been up for two days.

464
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,336
Get some sleep.
You coming?

465
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,609
Get out, Kevin.

466
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:50,948
Tommy.

467
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,021
Not gonna need it.

468
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,418
Go home.

469
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,388
I'll be there
in a couple hours.

470
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,627
No, you won't.

471
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,220
Thanks, honey.

472
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,262
Sure.

473
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,333
Whenever I watch
my boys sleeping,

474
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,682
I still see them
as five years old
in my head.

475
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,149
Does that sound crazy?

476
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,115
Always five.

477
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,621
And they're not
babies anymore.

478
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,881
But they're not
little men, either.

479
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,192
I'm so sorry
this happened.

480
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,596
Thanks for hanging in
with me.

481
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,764
I know it's not easy
watching people suffer.

482
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,874
No, it's not.

483
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,585
Do you know

484
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,116
what happened last night?

485
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,785
How do you mean?

486
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,222
You know what I mean.

487
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,622
I think

488
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,503
that if you know
someone's good,

489
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,934
you know it in your belly,

490
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,169
then you trust that if
they had to do something,

491
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,642
they had no other choice.

492
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,658
We're closed.

493
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,169
Yeah, I'm here
to see Nicky Cottero.

494
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,611
Someone's here for Nicky.

495
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,178
It's Tommy Donnelly.

496
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,282
Tommy Donnelly.

497
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,006
Okay.

498
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,347
The stairs are
in the back.

499
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,849
This way?
Yeah.

500
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,847
Thanks.

501
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,989
What the hell
are you doing here?

502
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,799
I'm too tired to sleep.

503
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,633
Stay put.

504
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,307
Whatever you say.

505
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,776
I mean it.
I'll be back in a minute.

506
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,312
I'll be here.

507
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,314
Anything happens,

508
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,911
I'll be here.

509
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,495
(KNOCKING)

510
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,525
NICKY: Come in.

511
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,195
Take a seat.

512
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,674
You want a drink?

513
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,773
No.

514
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:20,977
No, thanks.

515
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,984
I heard about Sal.

516
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,786
I'm sorry.

517
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,122
Yeah, it's a real loss.

518
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,124
You here to pay
your respects?

519
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,531
I'm here with some
unfinished business.

520
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,138
My brother Jimmy kidnapped
Louie Downtown.

521
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,476
My brother's a junkie.

522
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,274
Never thinks things through.

523
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,639
So I took him to rehab,

524
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,344
and I let Louie go.

525
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,545
In the hopes
that it would end things.

526
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,879
I don't want
any bad blood.

527
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,920
There's 30,000 in there.

528
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,462
With Sal gone,
I assume it belongs to you.

529
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,497
Where's Louie?

530
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,570
Don't know.

531
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,196
Like I said,
I let him go.

532
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,065
Every day Louie's missing,
I lose money.

533
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,910
Tell you what
I'm gonna do.

534
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,314
I'm gonna accept
this money in good faith.

535
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,681
I appreciate it.

536
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,317
But I need you to pay me
$1,000 a week until
Louie gets back.

537
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,558
For disruption of business.

538
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,617
You understand?

539
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,164
That money makes us even.

540
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,167
You got a lost bookie,
that's your problem.

541
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,667
See you around.

542
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,965
Hey, kid!

543
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,633
Tell your brother Jimmy

544
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,507
I'm gonna be seeing him
real soon.

545
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,976
That'd be great.

546
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,212
He'd enjoy the visitor.

547
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,679
Didn't you hear?

548
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,849
Jimmy was arrested yesterday.

549
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,416
He's been in jail.

550
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,829
And one more time,
you know this because...

551
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:18,924
Oh, yeah.

552
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,136
I was there, too.

553
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,810
How'd it go?
Like it went.

554
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,979
What the hell's
Joey Ice Cream doing here?

555
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,046
I have no idea.

556
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,755
<i>JOEY. We were that tight.</i>
<i>They never took</i>
<i>a step without me.</i>

557
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:06,142
<i>JOEY. Remember when I said</i>
<i>how as a kid Tommy Donnelly</i>
<i>tried to make that deal?</i>

558
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,281
<i>Well, God didn't hear him</i>
<i>right away.</i>

559
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,723
<i>So Tommy kept going back.</i>

560
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,355
<i>Kept trying</i>
<i>to get God's attention.</i>

561
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,222
<i>Until He finally listened.</i>

562
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,829
Your mom's looking for you.

563
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,264
The doctor said
Jimmy's gonna walk.

564
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:38,003
<i>Only thing is, Tommy never</i>
<i>negotiated the price.</i>

565
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,303
I should have
told you last night.

566
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,866
I love you.

567
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,607
You got customers waiting?

568
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,484
Glad you came by.

569
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,225
Yeah. Me, too.

570
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,161
Because I wanted
to tell you that I can't...

571
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,364
Can't what?

572
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,065
Do this.

573
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,173
Be with you.

574
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,745
I really am sorry.

575
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,280
Wait.

576
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,480
Jenny...

577
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,752
If you want breakfast,
come on down.

578
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,663
<i>JOEY. There was no way for him</i>
<i>to know way back then</i>

579
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,539
<i>that God was gonna</i>
<i>take away the one thing</i>
<i>Tommy wanted most.</i>

580
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,582
<i>But that's what life is like,</i>
<i>am I right?</i>

581
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,755
<i>When one door closes,</i>
<i>another window opens.</i>

582
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,019
Tommy. Get in.

583
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,216
If you don't mind,
I'd just like to walk.

584
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,355
Hey, put him in the trunk.

585
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,431
I'm getting in.

586
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,737
I guess you heard,
somebody

587
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,410
shot my brother to death?

588
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,351
Yeah, I heard.
I'm really sorry.

589
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,148
You know, I can understand
somebody wanting to kill Huey.

590
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,057
He had enemies.

591
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:09,824
Who doesn't, right?

592
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,163
I just can't figure out
what he was doing
in Sal Minnetta's basement.

593
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,890
He didn't tell anyone?

594
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:20,396
I mean, the last thing
anybody knows,
he went to visit you

595
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,336
and your brother
at the hospital.

596
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,801
Brought you the pie
his wife made.

597
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,242
Yeah, he came by.

598
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,036
He was checking on Sean.

599
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,478
I heard that Sean took
quite a beating.

600
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,078
Is he okay?

601
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:35,748
He's gonna be okay.

602
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,548
That's good.

603
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,984
That's good you still
got your brother.

604
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,828
Did Huey say anything to you
before he left the hospital?

605
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,362
Where he was going?

606
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,061
Anything?

607
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,601
I wish I could tell you more.

608
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,870
Me, too.

609
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,541
All right,
get out of here.

610
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,711
Hey.

611
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,507
You hear anything,
all right?

612
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,279
I'll let you know.

613
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:15,889
Good.
