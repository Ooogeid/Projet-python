00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,441
<i>somebody stole</i>
<i>the stolen shirts.</i>

167
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:15,542
TOMMY: So, anybody got
any idea how to get $4,000?

168
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,288
KEVIN: You hear
what Bobby O and
J.J. McGrane did?

169
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,757
They stole an Italian.
Held him for ransom.

170
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,124
Where's Bobby O
and J.J. Right now?

171
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,062
I don't know.
Attica, I think.
Right.

172
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,461
I'll see you later.

173
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,396
Now, the bookie
Kevin owed the money to
was named Louie Downtown.

174
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,969
<i>Louie ran the book</i>
<i>for Sal Minnetta.</i>

175
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,013
<i>Sal and his right hand,</i>
<i>Nicky Cottero,</i>
<i>would drop by once a week</i>

176
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,413
<i>just to keep Louie honest,</i>
<i>but they weren't there</i>
<i>right now.</i>

177
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,576
<i>Since Kevin was short,</i>
<i>he had to tell Louie</i>
<i>that he needed more time.</i>

178
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,487
<i>So Sean borrowed</i>
<i>a friend's cab while</i>
<i>the friend wasn't looking,</i>

179
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,459
<i>and they took Jimmy along</i>
<i>in case Louie didn't</i>
<i>take the news too well.</i>

180
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,658
Did I tell you
the second thing you had
to know to understand Jimmy?

181
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,335
<i>Jimmy's father worked for</i>
<i>the Steelworkers' union</i>
<i>which was run by the Irish.</i>

182
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,338
<i>Now, some Italians were</i>
<i>trying to change that.</i>

183
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,770
Hey, Jimmy.

184
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,275
Where's your father?

185
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,843
He's in the coffee shop.

186
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,105
Thanks.

187
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,480
<i>It wasn't his fault.</i>
<i>He didn't know.</i>

188
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,052
<i>But while he was</i>
<i>listening to music,</i>

189
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,784
<i>they were beating his father</i>
<i>to death.</i>

190
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:30,085
<i>He never saw their faces</i>
<i>before or after,</i>
<i>but he knew one thing.</i>

191
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,322
<i>He knew they were Italian.</i>

192
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,957
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>Louie Downtown was.</i>

193
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,866
<i>Italian.</i>

194
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,345
<i>JOEY. For three months now,</i>

195
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,080
<i>Tommy had been working up</i>
<i>to asking out</i>
<i>this photography student.</i>

196
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,348
Uh, <i>Blow-Up.</i>

197
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,447
Your favorite movie?
Yeah.

198
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,321
Oh, my God! Me, too.
You're kidding?

199
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,585
Yeah!
Well, I had a book...

200
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,494
<i>He might've had a shot if</i>
<i>Huey Farrell hadn't shown up.</i>

201
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,531
Will you give me a minute?
Yeah.

202
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,398
<i>Huey took over</i>
<i>the neighborhood</i>
<i>from Old Man Mulligan.</i>

203
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,997
<i>The Irish had run it</i>
<i>since the 1890s.</i>

204
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,973
<i>Huey made sure</i>
<i>it stayed that way.</i>

205
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,341
It's good.

206
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,481
Look, Tommy,
did you hear what happened
to Louie Downtown?

207
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,041
No.
Some guys snatched him
this morning.

208
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,086
No kidding?
Yeah. Three of them.

209
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,988
Stuffed him in the trunk
of a car and then drove off.

210
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,251
Tell me your brothers spent
the day at the tracks
so I can go home happy.

211
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,592
Huey, my brothers
aren't that stupid.

212
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,093
You know who Sal Minnetta is?

213
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,825
Yeah, of course.

214
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,698
Well, it turns out
Louie Downtown is his nephew.

215
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,697
Who knew, right?

216
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,613
Keep working on the art stuff.
Proud of you.

217
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,152
Do you have a car?
Yeah.

218
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,317
Yeah?

219
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,125
Where's Louie?
Louie who?

220
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,703
Stop lying!
And keep an eye on her.

221
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,771
Where's Kevin?
I didn't take anything.

222
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,215
How much did you steal?
Nothing. Not a nickel.

223
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,682
Yeah? Get out of here.
You got it, champ.

224
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,177
TOMMY: Hey!
Oh, man.

225
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,655
Hey, Kevin!

226
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,426
Tommy, me and Jimmy went
downtown with goodness in our
hearts to work out a deal.

227
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,759
But Louie starts
threatening me. I mean,
what was I supposed to do?

228
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,627
Kevin, everybody knows
who did this.

229
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,190
You kidnap somebody,
they're not supposed
to know who you are.

230
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,203
Tommy, you think we're stupid?
We wore masks.

231
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,974
You went own there
with goodness in your hearts,
but you wore masks.

232
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,839
Get out of the way.

233
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,638
(MUFFLED)
Hey, get me out of here!
Please, help me!

234

What are you doing?

237
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,596
I'm getting a knife.
We're cutting him loose.

238
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,864
Tommy, I love you,
but I'd rather fight you
than Jimmy.

239
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,005
He's banged out
of his head.

240
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,508
Where is he?

241
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,006
Hey!

00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,574
Hey, Sean!

What the hell
are you doing?

You guys, like,
seeing each other?
'Cause I didn't know!

245

Go home!
You go back to school!

246
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,957
He's Sal Minnetta's nephew?

247
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,469
Yeah.

248
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,137
So he's worth a lot more.

We've got to give him back.
What "we"?

252
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,373
You walked away.
He's not your Italian,
he's our Italian.

No, we got a thing,
here, Jimmy.
You've got to see that.

You know what I see, Tommy?

255
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,517
We got Louie Downtown.

256
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,114
If we give him back now,
are they going to thank us?

257
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,225
No, they're going to think
we're scared.

258
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,387
Which means they're going
to hunt us down and they're
going to beat us to death.

259
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,760
Is that what you want, Tommy?

260
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,163
Hey, Tommy,
you leave the door open?

261
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,201
Did I leave the door open?
Yeah, 'cause I went
to get a beer,

262
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,260
went right back down there.
He wasn't there.

Oh, hell!

and his wallet.

00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,991
Hey.

334
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,576
I talked to
my detective friend.

335
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,375
They got a witness
for this truck thing.

336
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,011
They're going to put Jimmy
in a lineup.

337
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:19,487
Now, the thing is
the witness said
that Jimmy had a gun.

338
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,360
This was armed robbery.

339
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,592
And I think Kevin and Sean
were with him.

340
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,266
Why do you think that?

341
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,960
There were three of them.

342
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,037
It doesn't take a genius.

343
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,874
Now, look, Tommy,
your father was a good man

344
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:40,035
and, because of that,
I'm doing all I can here.

345
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,272
But Jimmy's out of control.

346
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,375
I think you should
get him some help

347
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,613
before he takes
your other brothers
down with him.

348
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,613
All right, I appreciate it,
Frankie.
All right.

349
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,686
Thanks.

350
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,959
Take care, darling.
Bye.

(SIREN WAILING)

352
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,703
What?

353
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,170
Problems?

354
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,110
No.

355
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,343
Liar.

356
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,615
When are you going to show me
some of your drawings?

357
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,784
You can put some up
around here, you know,
try and sell them.

358
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,391
Yeah? You got a lot of
art patrons coming in here?

359
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,095
You'd be surprised.

360
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,631
Bet I would.

361
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,788
I might have to
buy one myself,
you know,

362
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,062
as an investment,
when you're famous.

363
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:13,962
Yeah.

364
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,932
Hey, be careful.

365
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,234
Why?

366
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,870
I don't know,
just worry about yourself
once in a while.

367
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,978
Thanks.

368
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,518
Hey.

369
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,329
Jimmy, hey.

370
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,661
Hey.

371
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,470
We, uh, gotta talk.

372
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,602
What time is it?

373
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,212
It's 11:30.

374
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,984
We have to be
at the drop at 12:00.
Just give me two seconds.

375
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,041
We gotta talk first,
Jimmy.

376
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,917
Oh, give me a second,
will you?

377
00:22:58,744 --> 00:22:59,711
Jimmy.

378
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,079
Jimmy.
Get out of here, Tommy.

379
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,013
What are you doing?
Ahhh!

380
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,677
Hmm?
Are you crazy? I had
that needle in my arm!

Get out.

385
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,009
Get your money
and get out of here.

386
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,172
And you try to take
Kevin or Sean with you
and I'm gonna kill you.

387
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,275
(CHUCKLING)
You'll kill me?

388
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,760
If you have that much pain,
Jimmy, why don't you just
jump off the roof?

389
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,975
Hey, Sean.

390
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,581
You're Sean Donnelly, right?

391
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,484
It's all right. Go.

392
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,480
Go!

393
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,021
Where you going?

Call an ambulance!

399
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,956
You saw what
they did to Sean.

400
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,235
You know what
that would have
done to Jimmy.

401
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,973
All I can do is talk to Sal
and try and make him see that.

402
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,810
But I need your word
Jimmy isn't planning
anything else.

403
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,137
You got my word.

404
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,442
Tell your mother
Sean's in my prayers.

405
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:09,947
Yeah, I will.

406
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,275
I got one dollar
and this thing's
got to take it.

407
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,753
Sal had no right.

408
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,857
I was giving Louie back.

409
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,621
Nah, he had no right.

410
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,794
You've got to get him, Tommy.
You know that.

411
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,765
You got him, Jimmy.

412
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,596
I sure as hell did.

413
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,010
What did you do
with his body?

414
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,417
You don't need to know.

415
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,653
Did you get rid
of the gun?

416
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,223
As soon as I'm
finished with it.

417
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:01,633
If you get caught with that,
you might as well confess.

418
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,295
How come there's never
anything you want?

419
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,072
You got three
or four more guns
in the bar alone.

420
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,212
Don't be stupid.
Let me get rid of it.

421
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,656
(SIREN WAILING)
You know I got
to do this, right?

422
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,603
You know that,
no matter what you say,
I gotta make this right.

423
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,705
You ask me to say I won't,
I'll just lie.

424
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,206
I did that to him,
Tommy.

425
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,576
I did it again.

426
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,833
Thanks, Nicky.

427
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,937
What about his brothers?
Is that a problem?

428
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,134
Jimmy's the only problem.
He's a punk and a doper.

429
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,110
He'd be more comfort
to his mother
dead than alive.

430
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,704
Tommy's a smart boy.
When Jimmy's gone,

431
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,579
he'll be able to say
he did what he could.

432
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,251
As long as it's only Jimmy,

433
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,984
because anything
other than that,
it'll be me with the problem.

at Saint Margaret's?
No kidding?

436

Someone busted up his bar.

Beggars are our business.

a right hand like Nicky.

and know your business
is in good hands.

Hey.

442
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,617
Thank you for coming.

443
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,924
Where's your mother?

444
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:46,154
She's in the waiting room
just waiting to hear
from the doctor.

445
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,268
I brought some food
from the restaurant,
so I'll go...

446
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,465
Good.
Maybe if we get some more,
we can open up a deli.

447
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,239
You know,
when I heard about it,

448
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,511
the person who told me
thought it was you.

449
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,954
I thought,

450
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:17,085
what if he dies
and he never knows
that I loved him?

451
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,296
Dumb, huh?

452
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,396
I mean, I'm a married woman.
Nothing's ever gonna happen.
I just...

453
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,804
I just couldn't stand the idea
of you dying and not knowing

454
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,437
that.

455
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,617
Hey, Tommy.

456
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,686
Hey, Huey.
How you doing, Jenny?

457
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,384
Hi.
Going in there?

458
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,684
Give that to Helen for me,
from my wife.
Sure. Okay.

459
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,953
I'll be with your mother.

460
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,362
Let's go get a coffee.

461
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,538
Well...

462
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,980
It's gonna be painful,

463
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,981
but it's gonna be okay.

464
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,415
It's gonna be okay?

465
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,153
What, you talked to Sal?

466
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,985
When I walked in the room,
he wanted you all dead.

467
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,092
But I had something to trade.
You don't need to know what.

468
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,561
He wants his money back

469
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,259
and he wants Jimmy
to apologize to him
tonight, in person.

470
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,159
Can you get your brother
to do that?

471
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,702
To apologize?

472
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,733
Jimmy'll have to be
willing to take a beating.

473
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,638
I'm not going to lie to you.

474
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,979
Not as bad as Sean.

475
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,013
But you get your brother
to go down to Sal's tonight
by himself.

476
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,816
He walks in there
with you guys or a weapon,
he's going to get killed.

477
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,623
You get him
to take his beating,
everything will be okay.

478
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,819
Okay?

479
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,726
It was at that moment...

480
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,898
Hey, I can't
thank you enough, Huey.

481
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,629
<i>It was at that moment</i>
<i>that Tommy knew</i>
<i>that Jimmy was dead.</i>

482
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,237
You all right?
Yeah.

483
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,812
<i>Jimmy was the price</i>
<i>they were gonna pay.</i>

484
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,519
Huey had sold them out.

485
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,906
You like that shirt?

486
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,806
Yeah. You want one?

487
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,780
Nah, I'm good.
Don't worry about it.

488
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,038
Jimmy.

489
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,831
Hey, Francis.
How you doing tonight?

490
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,604
Good. How are you?
Oh, same old, same old.

491
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,707
Detective Calero,
I want you to take note

492
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,545
that the suspect is
turning himself in
voluntarily.

493
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,847
Yeah, I see that
very clearly.

494
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,249
Not for nothing,
but what am I turning
myself in for?

495
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:36,191
Jimmy, you boost
a truckload of shirts,
you get seen. That's unlucky.

496
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,591
You walk around all day
wearing the evidence,

497
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,425
I can't feel
too sorry for you.

498
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,326
So, this is
for the truck thing?

499
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,400
You got something else
you want to confess to?

500
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,627
No, I'm good.
All right.

501
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,202
How'd you know
where I was?

502
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:51,071
Jimmy, your little
brother's up there.
Where else you gonna be?

503
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,138
It's raining again.

504
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,941
Jimmy got pinched
for the truck thing.

505
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,472
But he just went down
to get some beers.

506
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,102
Yeah.

507
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,081
That sucks.

508
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,653
I talked to Frankie.
He said he'd get him
into rehab.

509
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,946
So you talked
to Frankie?

510
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,321
I talked to Frankie.

511
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,753
Huh.

512
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,663
So, it's not
a bad thing?

513
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,199
No, it's not.

514
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,164
I'm gonna step out
for a minute.

515
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:58,766
Sure.

516
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,777
Where you going?

517
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,712
Wherever you are.

518
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,954
Hey.

519
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,191
I'm making you
a sandwich.

520
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,562
Well, save it for me.

521
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,400
Tommy, listen to me.

522
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,577
You are not
your brother.

523
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,147
Stay and eat your sandwich.

524
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,076
Please.

525
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,081
I'll be back for it.

526
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,621
(SIGHING)

527
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,626
Yeah?
<i>It's Tommy Donnelly.</i>

528
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,759
Says he needs a word.

529
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,795
Tommy Donnelly wants
to talk to me.

530
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,640
Send him down.

531
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,130
Downstairs.

532
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,653
<i>JOEY. You remember I told you</i>
<i>about the day that changed</i>
<i>Jimmy's life?</i>

533
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,481
<i>I was the only one</i>
<i>who saw him,</i>

534
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,147
<i>the only one who knew</i>
<i>that it was Tommy</i>
<i>driving the car.</i>

535
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,859
To this day,
it's the one thing
I never told anybody.

536
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,698
I'm ashamed to be
telling you now.

537
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,399
<i>Tommy never stole a car again,</i>
<i>never did nothing,</i>

538
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,307
<i>turned his whole life around.</i>
<i>I mean, he could have</i>
<i>made it out,</i>

539
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,643
<i>only he was never</i>
<i>going to let his brother</i>
<i>be hurt again.</i>

540
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,879
<i>And this was the day</i>
<i>that changed Jimmy's life</i>
<i>forever.</i>

541
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,286
<i>'Cause Jimmy went to rehab,</i>

542
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,127
<i>and Tommy...</i>

543
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,000
<i>Tommy became everything</i>
<i>he never wanted.</i>

544
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,136
<i>And whether he realized it</i>
<i>or not, with Huey dead,</i>

545
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,780
<i>Tommy had just taken over</i>
<i>the neighborhood.</i>

546
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,957
<i>And he was going to</i>
<i>have to defend it.</i>

547
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,903
<i>And that's where</i>
<i>we left the bodies,</i>

548
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,601
<i>right where they lay.</i>

549
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,605
And what the Italians did
with them...

550
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,112
I mean, I can't say.

551
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,811
Those aren't the bodies
we were asking about.

552
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:45,844
Oh.
