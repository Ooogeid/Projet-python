that you don't know this?

00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,898
<i>I was the only one</i>
<i>who knew it was Tommy</i>

3
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,462
<i>who ran over Jimmy's leg.</i>

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,974
<i>But Tommy</i>
<i>never let himself forget it.</i>

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,840
<i>And he never stole</i>
<i>a car again.</i>

6
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,674
The doctor said Jimmy's
gonna walk.

7
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,681
<i>Jimmy's limp didn't bring out</i>
<i>the best in him.</i>

8
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,043
<i>But it did get him</i>
<i>a new career as a bookie</i>

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,314
<i>and business was booming.</i>

10
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,020
<i>Of course, his partner Whitey</i>

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,819
<i>did have to call in his uncle,</i>
<i>Bob the Mouth,</i>

12
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,984
<i>to help them cover</i>
<i>a particularly large bet.</i>

13
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,391
<i>When Jimmy couldn't pay,</i>

14
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,987
<i>they decided to give Bob</i>
<i>flying lessons.</i>

15
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,057
<i>You couldn't exactly</i>
<i>call him a natural.</i>

16
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,898
<i>Now Jimmy's expanding</i>
<i>into extortion.</i>

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>But Jenny's dad's business</i>
<i>wasn't doing so good.</i>

18
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,466
<i>He had money problems,</i>

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,201
<i>so he decided to</i>
<i>go to Dokey for help.</i>

20
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,498
<i>Bad idea.</i>

21
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:47,603
<i>So Jenny went to Tommy.</i>
<i>And Tommy went to Kate.</i>

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,444
<i>Trust me,</i>
<i>it was strictly business.</i>

23
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,546
<i>Father, I gotta tell you,</i>

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,815
<i>I'm not really big</i>
<i>on confession.</i>

25

I'm not here to
save your soul.

26

You think I'm an idiot?

27

Or a miracle worker?
Either one, you're wrong.

28
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,490
Then what are you doing here?

29
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,155
I came to visit.

30
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,255
And I brought you
a turkey sandwich.

31
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,836
Look, don't try
to con me, Father.

32
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,373
You people are always
trying to save somebody.

33
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,965
Okay, you're right.

34
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,674
I do want something.

35
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,302
You see? We're all liars.

36
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,511
I want to know what happened.

37
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,980
"Happened"?

38
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,950
The Donnelly brothers,
they were great kids.

39
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,916
Bobby Donnelly was
a neighborhood legend.

40
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,856
And now so many people
are dead.

41
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,323
Friends, family
betraying each other,

42
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,327
killing each other.

43
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:39,159
I need to understand
what happened.

44
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,665
I think everything changed

45
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,065
the day I bought
Seanie that car.

48
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,038

00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,009
Don't get it.
Why not?

53
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,379
'Cause I don't want
to talk to anybody.

54

Suppose it's important.

55
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,653
Then they'll call back.
Tommy, I hate that.

56
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,778
It's gonna drive me crazy
all day

00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:02,946
if I don't know
who that was.

58
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,047
That's 'cause
you're not a normal guy.

59
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,352
You are?

60
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,123
Hello.
<i>Hi, it's Kate.</i>
<i>Can I speak to Tommy?</i>

61
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,262
Yeah, hold on.
I'll see if he's here.

62
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,698
It's Kate.
Want to talk to her?

63
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,193
Nice, Kevin.

64
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,901
Like she doesn't really know
I'm here now.

65
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,031
What do you think she wants?

66
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,267
I don't know.

67
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,445
Maybe she wants the $10,000
I owe her.

68
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,174
Maybe she wants to know
why I robbed her.

69
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,612
Maybe she wants to know
why you killed her husband.

70
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,670
Shut up, Jimmy.

71
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,650
Okay, so do you want me to
tell her that you're not here?

72
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,157
Kate.

73
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,021
No, you didn't wake me up.

74
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:46,395
Sure, yeah. Okay. Okay.

75
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,928
What did she want?

76
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,799
She got a job for me.

77
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,128

91

Forget about Uncle Bob.

All I'm saying
is that maybe

93
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,757
it's not the smartest thing

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,821

We got work to do here.

I'm the beverage manager now,

so if I ask you
to do something,

226
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,226
you're supposed to do it.

00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,223
He paid. He paid.

355
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,698
Oh, jeez.

356
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,134
Tell him we'll see him
next week!

357
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,868
I'm sorry about that, buddy.

358
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,172
We'll see you next week.

359
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,874

no fries,

362

You okay?

363
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,482
What?

364
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,951
What?

365
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,081
You okay?

366
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,556
Yeah.

367
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,217
Why?

368
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,195
Nothing.

369
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,730
Thanks, honey.

370
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,427
Oh, that looks so...

371
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,430
Hi.

372
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,132
Samson, what are you
doing here?

373
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,607
I just wanted to come by
and talk to you about...

374
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,906
Look, you're a really
nice guy, but I...

375
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,241
I can't go out
with you, okay?

376
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,076
Not now, not ever.
And I'm sorry,

377
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,775
I really thought
I made that clear.

378
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,478
What happened between you
and me was a mistake.

379
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:31,254
Yeah. It's just that
I got a new job

380
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,790
delivering for
a different company.

381
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,485
Just wanted to let you know,
that's all.

382
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,261
Guess I caught you
at a bad time, right?

383
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,727
Okay. I feel like an idiot.

384
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,061
Prove it.

385
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,862
Say you'll go out with me.

386
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,107
I'm kidding.

387
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,411
It's okay, I understand.

388
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,608
We're cool.

389
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,880
And you have a good day.

390
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,912
Okay. Thanks.

391
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,336
Wow. Are those mine?

392
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,530
Found them when
I was clearing out

393
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,665
some of Huey's old things.

394
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,174
Put them away, please.

395
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,108
Huey always said
you had talent.

396
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,843
Now I know why.

397
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,280
Anyway, I thought
you'd want them back.

398
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,919
Thanks. So you don't
need help with anything?

399
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,518
Actually,
I did have a reason
for calling you.

400
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,589
Matthew's been spending a lot
of time with his Uncle Dokey.

401
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,596
And I don't like it.

402
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,926
I'd rather he spend time
with you.

403
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,696
Somebody who could teach him
something worthwhile like art.

404
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,528
Kate, I don't know.

405
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,402
I know what I'm asking.

406
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,709
But I don't know
who else to turn to.

407
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,036
I'll pay you.

408
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,207
You'll pay me?
Mmm-hmm.

409
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,147
That's kind of ridiculous,

410
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,342
considering the fact
that I just borrowed

411
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,441
$10,000 from you.

412
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,679
I don't care about that.

413
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,381
All I care about is Matthew.

414
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,653
Sure.

415
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,163
I thought maybe we could
start later today.

Hello, Kevin.

418
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,504
Hi, I was wondering if
my brother Tommy was here.

419
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,441
Hi.

420
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,686
I'll see you.

421
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,626
You need to get
a cell phone, Tommy.

422
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,787
I'm sick of being the one
that has to do everything.

from Sean

00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,666
because Jimmy made him
the beverage manager,

426
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,328
and now I gotta
deliver you a message.

427
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,529
What message?

428
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,430
You gotta stop trying
to help people, Tommy.

429
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,299
It's a bad thing.

430
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,134
Kevin, the message?

431

keeps calling.

432

Every time the phone rings,
it's her.

433
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,009
She says, "They're back."

434
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,313
What the hell does that mean,
"They're back"?

435
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,711
How'd she sound?

436
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,719

437
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,989

she called five times?

Thanks.

four hats here.

for the life of me,

I can't figure out
who else they'd go to,

What I mean is,
this is my nephew.

hanging around

if we could do it
another time,

545

something came up.

546

She was a friend
of dad's, Jimmy.

any drugs from her.

564

'Cause I've only been buying
from her since I was 14.

the same old Mrs. McCready

00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,741
JOEY: Hey, not for nothing.
I like the door,

706
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,180
but what are
we gonna do with it?

707
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,238
SEAN: I can put
some legs on it.

708
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,716
It'll make for
a nice lounge table.

709
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:48,911
It's a door.
They don't come cheap.

710
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,078
We should sell this thing.

711
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,249
Screw that!
This door is a symbol
of our triumph!

712
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,855
Over a skank
drug-dealing bitch!

713
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,628
I'm thinking
we're gonna mount
this baby

714
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,128
somewhere right
above the bar.

715
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,096
Hey, I'm not gonna
have to paint it, am I?

716
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,933
Hey, Jenny.
What's that?

717
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,496
$50. Next week's payment.

718
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,967
I don't need that now.

719
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,170
When next week comes,
it comes.

720
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,009
No. You don't come back
to the diner, ever.

721
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,105
What's going on?

722
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,877
The only protection I need

723
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,613
is you never coming near me
or my father again.

724
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,617
$50 is a cheap
price for that.

725
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,017
I'll bring it to you.

726
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,326
Jenny...
To hell with you, too!

727
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,588
Jenny!

728
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,397
SEAN: Jimmy, what'd you do?

729
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,957
Sean, shut up.

730
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,964
You extort money
from Jenny?

731
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,373
From her father?

732
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,774
It's business, Tommy.

733
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,174
Stay out of it.

734
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,216
Hey, Tommy, Tommy.

735
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,653
Get up.

736
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,854
I would if you let me.

737
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,833
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

738
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,410
How could you do that?
To Jenny.

739
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,880
It was easy!

740
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,348
Don't you care about
anybody anymore?

741
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:30,148
Oh, that's right, Tommy!
I forgot!

742
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,950
You care about everybody!
You're the big savior!

743
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,684
I'm the scumbag!

744
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,719
You keep telling yourself
that, Tommy!

745
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,827
I'm ashamed of you, Jimmy.

746
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,859
Jimmy loved Tommy
more than anybody.

747
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:52,166
But see, once you've been
betrayed by somebody you love,

748
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,635
you're capable of anything.

749
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,277
Maybe it would have
been different

750
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,340
if Jimmy knew
what really happened
on the roof that day.

751
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,215
Why won't you
go out with Jimmy?

752
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,653
It's 'cause of his leg,
isn't it?

753
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:06,745
No.

754
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,724
Then why?

755
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,763
It's because
I like you.

756
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,499
I can't do that
to my brother, Jenny.

757
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,896
Who wants a drink?

758
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,047
How we doing in here?

759
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,684
We're great.

760
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,488
Want to see?
Mmm-hmm.

761
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,753
Wow. That's amazing.

762
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,524
We're gonna color it red.

763
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,793
Oh, it doesn't have to be red,
right, Matthew?

764
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,562
You can make it
any color you want.

765
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,102
I'll have to think about that.

766
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,464
Make sure you sign it.

767
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,881
Hey.

768
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,285
Listen, I been thinking.

769
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,687
There's a friend of mine.
Mine and Huey's.

770
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,224
He owns a studio.

771
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,362
Actually,
he's a famous artist.

772
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,488
Leo Munst. You know him?

773
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,429
Yeah, of course.

774
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,503
I think it might be good
for you to meet him.

775
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,599
That's great. He having
a showing or something?

776
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,301
I mean meet him.

777
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,404
You know,
get his advice
on some things.

778
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,416
He's an amazing artist.
It'd be good for you.

779
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,742
Wow.

780
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,110
I already told you,
I think you have potential.

781
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,145
NICKY: Kevin Donnelly.

782
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,456
You're just the guy
I've been looking for.

783
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,756
Me?

784
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,758
You're not looking for me.

785
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,766
Oh, yeah. I am.

786
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,897
Actually,
I need a favor.

787
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,769
I'm a little short
this week,

788
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,099
so I need you to spot me
another day.

789
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,370
I don't get it.

790
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,849
For the grand I owe you.

791
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,785
You're Cloudy?

792
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,684
Actually,
I'm a lot clearer now.

793
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,955
So we'll square up
tomorrow.
