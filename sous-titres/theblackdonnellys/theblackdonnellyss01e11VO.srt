you kill him?

bring the stuff?

needed something.

from Lambert.

a piece of that because

square with you?

told us you were
gonna burn it down.

know about that, did you?

anything, about real estate...

Good.

261
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,724

to talk to somebody
who works for the city.

the part about not
helping Reilly?

We're helping him.

00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,866
Well, we could
always go to Jonesy.

266
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,532
I mean, he used
to work for the
Buildings Department

267
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,270
before he got caught
glomming stucco
for his new house.

268
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,335
And you're telling
me this now?

269
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,472
I still kind of
owe him some money.

270
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,311
How much?

271
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,916
Two grand.

272
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,143
I mean, you wouldn't believe
how uptight he is about it.

273
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,195
You know, if you had
just talked to me,

274
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,290
it wouldn't have
to be like this.

275
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,336
Samson...
You came into my home,

276
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,529
you kissed me.

277
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,869
You know,
when I kiss somebody,

278
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,063
that means something.

279
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,006
My Dad's inside.
Good!

280
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,068
Let's tell him
what a slut you are, huh?

281
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,908
Tell him what you did
to me that night.

282
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,142
Samson,
I'm gonna go in now.

283
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,877
I trusted you.

284
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,784
And you lied to me.

285
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,577
I didn't lie to you.

286
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:51,951
I told you
it was a mistake.

287
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,456
Mistake?

288
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,495
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

289
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,465
But you better
learn the lesson.

290
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,166
I'll call you later?

291
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,605
And now you're counting it?

292
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,140
You know what?
Give it back to me.
I can't...

293
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,874
I can't wait until
you owe me money

294
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,416
for 11 months
and see how you like it.
Kevin!

295
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,649

296
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,651
The number on here
for the Buildings
Department?

297
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,256
It says call for inquiries.

298
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,349
We called, got a recording.

299
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,222
It's the city,
what do you expect?

300
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,089
So how do we get in to talk
to somebody about this?

301
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,132
JONESY:
Oh, that's a good one.

302
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,733
What? Is it a fake?

303
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,730
Yeah, the notice is real.

304
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,931
The engineer is a fake.

305
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,530
This guy, Anthony Lino,

307
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,403
Got his degree
from Wiseguy U.

308
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,742
He wouldn't know
a blueprint from
a ham sandwich.

309
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:52,306
It's a good bet
that this notice was
bought and paid for.

310
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,380
I'd go see Franny Kenny
down at the Buildings
Department.

311
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,216
He might be able to
tell you what's going on.

Franny Kenny?

313
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,483
He was friends
with your old man.

314
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,854
They told me you were
in the back. I hope
I'm not interrupting.

315
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,056
I don't want to get
you in any trouble.

316
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,122
No, no, no, it's okay.

317
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,725
It's pretty slow
in here today
and even if it wasn't...

318
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,771
And I wanted
to give you this.

319
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,534
It's a mix
of my favorite songs.

in a jukebox store?

323
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,642
You've got
great game.
Thank you.

00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,881

get back to work.

Well, thanks.

hang out sometime?

328
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,054
I'd love that.

329
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,651
I get off early.

330
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,594
Okay.
All right, great.

331
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,160

332
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,297

Do you wanna just
stop by the Firecracker?

333

so that the walk-ups
there now can be turned
into high-rises.

339

That could be
worth millions.

340

348
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,517
Great, now we know
it's about real estate.
Big deal.

349
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,625
Vinnie, if I had to depend
on your nose for the truth,

350
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,191
me and you would be
in a lot of trouble.

351
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,795
Okay, what did I miss?

352
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,390
Whatever Dokey and Alo
got going on together,
it's about more than this.

353
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,900
You understand?

354
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,128
So then she lied to us.

355
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,433
No, no, no, she gave us
everything we needed.

356
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,370
She just doesn't know it.

357
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,665
Bobby Donnelly's boys.

358
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,803
I haven't seen you since
you were still dropping
a load in your diapers.

Which one are you, Jimmy?

361
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,071
No, Tommy.

362
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,776
How about you?
Sean, right?

363
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,148
0-for-2. Kevin.

364
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,355
You're little Kevin.
I bought you
a fire truck when...

365
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,947
No, no, that was you.

366
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,924
You, I bought a little horse
because your father
said you were lucky.

367
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,325
Yeah, I think I still
have that somewhere.

368
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,961
How's your mother?

369
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,021
Good.

370
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,825
Good. That's good.

371
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,633
She had a hard go
there for a while.

372
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,399
What can I do
for you boys?

373
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,079
Anthony Lino was
the engineer.

374
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,117
Let me guess,
somebody's getting screwed.

375
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,649
The past 12 years,
the city's put everything
on computers.

376
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,245
But there's always
a hard copy filed away.

377
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,187
You can't trace a search
on a hard copy.

378
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,755
You never know
who's checking it,
right, boys?

What are you laughing at?

382
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,060
I don't know.
He's laughing,
I'm laughing.

383
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,202
Looks like Lino's condemned
nine other buildings
in the neighborhood

384
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,897
in the past six months.

385
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,929
Nine?

386
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,270
That's what I said.

387
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,905
So how do we find Lino?

388
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,502
Lino can't help you.

389
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,549
He'll just call his buddies
and you'll be into
a whole world of hurt.

390
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,211
No. We gotta go
after the legit guys,

391
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,847
the ones who
have paid Lino off.

392
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:23,360
Now, we have to find
out who really owns
these buildings.

393
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,460
Reilly owns his building.

394
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,193
Whoever holds the mortgage
owns the buildings.

395
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,531
Now, we find out
who they are,

396
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,035
you tell them
you're gonna publicize
the fact

397
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,038
that nine other buildings
in the neighborhood

398
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,142
have received phony
condemnation notices.

399
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,437
You say "newspapers,"
they'll give you
anything you want.

See, okay, Grand Limited.

401
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,546
Now they've been sold to...

00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,623

It's the end of the line.

What about this

Where does that lead?

410

You'd spend months
tracking those guys down.
But I can't help you.

It's French for
"We're screwed."

That's what you're
telling us, right?

416
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,298
Was he better
looking than me?

417
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,212
Only in some places.

Not that, you jerk.

420
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,381
He had nicer teeth than you.

00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,892
Oh, my God,
that's it!

422
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,830
What?

423
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,125
His teeth.

424
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,258
That's how we'll
get rid of him.

425
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,959
You hammer out his teeth,
you cut off his hands,

426
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,767
we could dump him anywhere.
They can't identify him.

427
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,808
"Hammer out his teeth"?

428
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,099
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

429
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,167

just said that.

I got a letter

telling me to pay

Not only is he buying
those two walk-ups,

482
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,436
he's buying the ground
we're standing on.

I know you like the girl,
but what kind of trouble are
you getting yourselves into?

is it's none

a friend of Dad's.

Reilly's building?

511
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,913
Can someone tell me
what's going on?

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,957
Okay.

to go to my room.

so worried about?

And who is
Franny Kenny anyway?

00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,682

he's a hanger-on.

Kissed Huey Farrell's
ass his entire life

521
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,888
till Huey kicked him
out the day after
your father died.

522
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,321
This isn't about him.

523
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:30,155
It's about you and
your brothers stopping
whatever it is you're doing.

524
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,822
We're helping Jenny
and her father.

525
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,598
We're not stopping.

526
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,203
Open it.

527
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,761
There's more.

528
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,797
Look at them all.

529
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,347
I went and got these
so I'd never forget what
they did to your father.

530
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,618
Why'd you show me these?

531
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:36,182
Because I'm so afraid that
the same thing is gonna happen
to you and your brothers

532
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,319
if you don't leave
this thing alone.

533
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,187
Tommy,

534
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,936
do not ask another
question about any of this.

535
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,004
I'm asking you to do that.

536
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,800
I expect it to happen.

537
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,809
What happened?

538
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,255
Where you going?

539
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,548
I'm going to Reilly's.

540
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,648
Dropping this thing.

541
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,494
Franny Kenny?

542
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,161
God, it's been years
since I've heard that name.

543
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,565
TOMMY:
Is he a good guy?

544
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,334
He worked for Huey
at the union.

545
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,398
We'd have dinner
once in a while.

546
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,076
But I never
really knew him.

547
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,270
TOMMY:
What'd he do for Huey?

548
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,836
I don't know what
his official title was.

549
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,777
But whenever
it came to money
or handling money,

550
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:36,483
he was the go-to guy,
or at least that's
what Huey called him.

551
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,456
So they had a falling out?

552
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:43,426
Huey had a falling out
with everybody at
one point or another.

553
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,759
This is after
my dad died,
right?

554
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,661
Yeah, I guess it was
around there.

555
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,757
Why you asking
all these questions?

556
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,793
Kevin and I are
trying to find out

557
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,668
who owns this building
that's being condemned.

558
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,299
Franny said he could help,
but then he said he couldn't.

559
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,174
You're talking
about a building
in the neighborhood.

560
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,506
Yeah.
Well, that's crap.

561
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,379
Pick a building, Franny
could tell you who owns it,
when they bought it,

562
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,581
who they bought it from,
and how much they cheated
the previous owner out of.

563
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,547
At least he could
when I knew him.

564
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,123
What if we made it
look like a suicide?

565
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,329
How we gonna do that?

566
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,795
We slice up his wrists

567
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,901
and when that didn't work,
he started stabbing himself.

568
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,334
I would believe that.

569
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,103
Yeah, but nobody
else would.

570
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,506
Well, we're gonna have
to deal with this.

571
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,237
I am dealing with it.

572
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,903
This is how I do
my best thinking.

573
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,072
<i>Hold on!</i>

574
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,440
You know what
we should do?

575
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,044
We should put him
on the subway. Let him
ride around and...

576
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,181
Take them weeks
before they figure
out who he was.

577
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,724
How we gonna get
him to the subway?

578
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,731
I don't know.
Put a sheet over him
and carry him downstairs.

579
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,927
What if we meet
somebody on the stairs?

580
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,060
Or in the 10 blocks
to get to the subway?

581
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,435
Maybe we could fit him
in the garbage chute.

582
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,303
It's a three-story building.
There's no garbage chute.
Use your head.

583
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,072
Well, I don't see you
coming up with
any suggestions.

584
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,741
Maybe we could use your
old standby and throw
him out the window.

585
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,849
That's not a bad idea.

586
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,716
You might notice
I've never been
arrested for that.

587
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,856
<i>WOMAN ON TV. No!</i>
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

588
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,649
SEAN: So you like working
there? At the store?

589
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,990
I get to listen to
my favorite bands all day.

590
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,360
And it's making me the money
I need to go to music school.

591
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,329
I hate school,
but music school?

592
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,458
That sounds fun,
not like a real school.

593
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,770
Twentieth Century Techniques,
History of Opera,

594
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,941
Equal Interval Orchestration
and Advanced Instrumental
Reading Lab,

595
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,000
and that's just
my first quarter.

596
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,508
That's brutal.

597
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,570
I'd rather go to real school.

598
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,849
My dad taught me
to play guitar
when I was little.

599
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,443
I've been hooked
ever since.

600
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,022
He died about
a year ago.
Heart attack.

601
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

602
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,956
It's okay.

603
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,426
It's a lot harder on
my mom than it is on me.

604
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,520
I loved my dad
more than anything,

605
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,564
but I hate
to see her alone.

606
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,993
I want her
to find someone.

607
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,797
I know, I lost my dad
a long time ago.
It gets easier.

608
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:06,962
Really?

609
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,595
So your mom's okay now?

610
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:09,970
Oh, yeah.

611
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,733
She married again?

612
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:12,832
No.

613
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,435
But she found someone.

614
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,501
No.

615
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,749
What happened to your dad?

616
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,720
My mom told me
he choked on a peanut
butter sandwich.

617
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,219
I wanted to believe her
for a really long time.

618
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,726
I mean, he went
to lunch one day
and never came back.

619
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,093
But I knew it wasn't true.

620
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,600
Come on, what kind of
restaurant sells
peanut butter sandwiches?

621
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,566
He was murdered.

622
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,966
Now, people don't
wanna say what really
happened,

623
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,701
but I believe
my brother Jimmy.

624
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,436
He says that
my dad died because

625
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,869
he wouldn't back down
to a bunch of
greaseball Italians,

626
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,379
so they beat him to death.

627
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,582
I'm Greek.

628
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,545
Oh. Good.

629
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,656
Hey.

630
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,830
Can we talk for a second?

631
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,493
I call you, you hang up on me.

632
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:14,629
I call back, you don't even
have the courtesy to pick
up the phone,

633
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,571
but now you wanna talk?

634
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,639
Samson, I know
I hurt you, okay?

635
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,909
I accept
responsibility for that.

636
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,040
Love is not a one-way street.

637
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,482
Love, Samson?
We had sex.

638
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,990
Once. Okay?
I was drunk.
I'm sorry.

639
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,116
I really am.
I'm sorry I took
advantage of you.

640
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,662
It was wrong,
it was selfish,
and I know that.

To hell with that.

643
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,435
You wanna hurt me?

644
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,701
Try it.

645
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,369
But whatever I need
to do to protect myself,
I'll do it.

646
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,810
I promise you that.

647
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,178
I will hurt you right back.

you were so tough.

will have to be looking
over their shoulder, huh?

Yeah, you.

me do this, huh?

Stop with the smacking!

Look, Ma's been
hiding something
from us, all right?

662
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,997
And it has something
to do with this guy.

How do you know that?

664
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,598
Because I'm a gambler.

I may not be lucky,
but I'm good, all right?

we asked her about him.

She ran her hand
through her hair twice.

669
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,180
Since we were kids
she's been doing that.

670

She doesn't do it
when it's a lie.

671

She does it more
when she's avoiding a lie.

And it has something
to do with this guy.

the crap out of him.

what he lied about.

00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,887

00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,424

gonna hurt you.

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,428
You said it went on and on.

692
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,004
In a circle.

693
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,200
That it doesn't stop.
But it does, doesn't it?

694
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,264
I wanna know where.

695
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,038
It doesn't go on and on.

696
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,545
It stops with
Longdale Properties.

697
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,445
Who's behind Longdale?

698
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,649

699
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,979
The people that we're
gonna threaten with
going to the papers,

700
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,147
that's what you
said, right? Huh?

701
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,615
Wait! Wait.

702
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,161
Wait.

703
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,229
Huey Farrell.

704
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,354
Probably Dokey now,

705
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,825
and Al. Al Onotaro.

706
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:35,297
And me, once upon a time.

707
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,171
That's Longdale Properties.

708
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,400
The Italians
and the Irish together?

709
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,638
Yeah.

710
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,701
Why?

711
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,111
The land,
real estate money...

712
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,348
Everybody forgives
for money.

713
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,813
My father,

714
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,616
was he a part of it?

715
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,491
Was he a part
of this land deal?

716
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,323
Of course he was.

717
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,193
Huey and he were
partners with everything.

718
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,991
But your father was
against this deal.

719
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:08,972
He hated the fact that
the Italians were buying up
land in the neighborhood.

720
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,641
He told Huey he wouldn't
have any part of this.

721
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,644
Is that why my father
was killed?

722
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,135
Yes.

723
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,844
Who did it?

724
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,941
I don't know.

725
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,388
You're a liar!

726
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:26,623
Who did it?

727
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,616
Who did it?

728
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,627
I wanna know
who punched him.

729
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,519
I wanna know
who kicked him.

730

731
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,296
I didn't know.

732
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,469
The only thing I know is
your father asked me to meet
him at the diner that day.

733
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,970
I was late, he was dead
when I got there.

734
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,669
<i>JOEY. Tommy wanted to stop.</i>

735
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,735
He knew whatever
he was gonna find out

736
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,073
was gonna be something
that he couldn't bear.

737
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,208
An unimaginable hurt.

738
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,406
And yet, he didn't stop.

739

(SHOUTS)

740
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,212
You let him go down there
alone 'cause you knew
they were gonna kill him!

741
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,289
I didn't know,
I swear to God
I didn't know!

I don't know!

Who? Come on!

744
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,362
Who did it?

745
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,750
Tommy Donnelly.

746
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,018
Always getting me
out in the night.

747
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,993
This gonna be good?

748
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,462
What's up?

749
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,224
Man-to-man, I wanna know.

750
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,202
Did Huey set up my dad?

751
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,365
Are you hallucinating?

752
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,305
Is Huey the reason
my father's dead?

753
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,002
Tommy, one time,
it's hilarious.

754
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,235
Don't forget I got
an axe in the car, okay?

755
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,508
I know everything.

756
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,810
What do you know?

757
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,748
I know that my dad
and Huey were partners.

758
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,620
And I know Huey was in bed
with the Italians.

759
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,422
I know it was
all about land.

760
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,318
And my father was against it.

761
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,156
And that's why your
son of a bitch brother
let him get killed.

762
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,127
My brother cried
when your father died.

763
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,194
We all did.
We all loved him.

764
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,205
Everyone thought
they knew what happened
to Bobby Donnelly that day.

765
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,934
It had kind of become
neighborhood legend.

766
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,741

767
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:33,341
Thanks for meeting us, Bobby.
We appreciate it. Sit.

768
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,843
I don't need to sit, Sal.

769
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,184
Huey can do
whatever he wants.

770
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,484
This is our neighborhood
and it's our union.

This is wrong.

You do what you want,
but I'm done here.

777
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,229
Unfortunately for Bobby,
Huey saw it coming.

778
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,662
He knew that no amount
of money could make Bobby
betray the neighborhood.

what happened.

You need to think
about who gained

your father
down there.
