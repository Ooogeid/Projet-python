1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,429
You'd better be
sitting down.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,800
This is a good one.

3
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,704
<i>With the Donnelly boys,</i>
<i>it all started out</i>
<i>as good clean fun.</i>

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,673
<i>A little carjacking,</i>
<i>a bit of extortion,</i>

5
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,872
<i>a few fights here and there.</i>

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,941
<i>You know,</i>
<i>what all boys do.</i>

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,376
<i>Even that thing</i>
<i>Jenny had with Samson</i>
<i>started out harmless.</i>

8
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,921
<i>Then things took a turn.</i>

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,750
But there was one moment
when all fun stopped.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,918
DOKEY: Who wants
to shave their head?

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,256
Me, I'll go.

12
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,024
Dokey motor-oiled my ass!

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,127
<i>It broke my heart.</i>

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,498
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>Tommy couldn't let that go.</i>

15
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,094
<i>So he sent Dokey</i>
<i>a thank-you note.</i>

16
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,465
<i>Dokey didn't like that much.</i>

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,007
You're dead!

18
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,407
But like they say,
"All good things
come to a head."

19
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,718
MAN: You lied
to your lawyers,

20
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,085
to the grand jury,
to your priest.

21
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,247
I swear to God...

22
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,587
I think you lied
to him, too.

23
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,388
Now, see,

24
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,686
people like you,

25
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,058
you don't get it.

26
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,757
The Donnellys are like...

27
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,663
Like your brothers,
I know.

28
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,892
Joey, at a certain point,

29
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,027
you're gonna have
to start telling us

30
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,128
a little bit
of the truth.

31
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,229
You don't know anything.

32
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,739
You just look
at what happened,

33
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,106
not why or how it happened.

34
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,241
<i>JOEY.</i>
<i>See, after beating up Dokey,</i>
<i>Tommy'd had enough.</i>

35
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,709
<i>He reached his limit.</i>

36
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,011
He stepped up
to the precipice,

37
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,281
looked over the edge,

38
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,584
<i>saw the face of</i>
<i>the monster below,</i>

39
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,659
<i>and knew it was him.</i>

40
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,026
Put it away.

41
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,621
<i>JOEY. And he decided,</i>
<i>no matter what the stakes,</i>

42
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,029
<i>no matter what it cost,</i>

43
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,496
<i>he was gonna save</i>
<i>himself and his family.</i>

44
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,067
KEVIN: Tommy!

45
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,836
What are we gonna do, Tommy?

46
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,897
I'm working on it, Kevin.

47
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,341
We should've killed Dokey
is what we should have done.

48
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,039
There were like a hundred
people watching us, Kevin.

49
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,411
They were
neighborhood people, Tommy,

50
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,744
they weren't gonna
give us up.

51
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,750
Most of them would like
to kill Dokey themselves.

52
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,445
I don't wanna go to jail for
the rest of my life, Kevin.

53
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,782
I sure as hell don't
wanna go to jail

54
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:02,912
for the rest of my life
with you.

55
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,011
I don't know what
you were thinking,

56
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,524
but it wasn't about
any witnesses.

57
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,261
Get the back door next,
then the cellar.

58
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,422
I don't want to go
in the cellar.

59
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,988
What if they're
down there already?

60
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,826
Then you're gonna need this.

61
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,357
Go.

62
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,301
You know, bullets
do have the ability

63
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,464
to go through
two-by-fours.

64
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,900
What are we gonna do, Tommy?

65
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,070
We can't hide here forever.

66
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,878
Call Sean.

67
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,246
Tell him to get Ma,
take her out to Aunt Kitty's

68
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,375
on Greenwood Lake.

69
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,386
Ma hates Aunt Kitty.

70
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,082
<i>JOEY. Since they were kids,</i>
<i>Helen had promised the boys</i>

71
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,852
<i>they'd go visit</i>
<i>their Aunt Kitty</i>

72
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,358
<i>in Greenwood Lake, New Jersey.</i>

73
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,361
No, you know what, Kitty?
Fine.

74
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,522
Have your own damn barbecue!

75
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,865
She invites us to her house
for the weekend,

76
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,962
asks us to bring the meat!

77
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,410
This mean we're not going
to Greenwood Lake?

78
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,514
TOMMY: Tell Sean to get Ma
and make it happen.

79
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,815
So you do have a plan,
you're just not telling me.

80
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,817
Would you just
do it, Kevin?

81
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,323
And keep an eye
on the windows.
I'll be back.

82
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,416
Tommy, where you going?

83
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,618
You can't go outside.

84
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,524
TOMMY:
Lock the door.

85
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,632
Give your man a kiss, baby.

86
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,263
He's going to work.

87
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,747
Hey, I hope
you got napkins,
'cause we're all out.

88
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,583
Good morning to you, too.

89
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,350
Hi, Jen.

90
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,989
Dad, you okay?

91
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,222
Yeah, I told you I'd be
doing the pickups myself
this morning,

92
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,459
didn't I?

93
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,728
Lucky we ran into each other.

94
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,932
What are the chances, huh?

95
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,700
Just leave that one here,

96
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,207
we'll take the shelves
inside, okay?

97
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,541
Hey, how about a couple
of cups of coffee, huh, Jen?

98
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,043
Hey.

99
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,216
Tommy.
What are you doing here?

100
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,193
You heard what happened
with Dokey?

101
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,694
Yeah, everybody has.

102
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,964
Jenny, you've been right
the whole time.

103
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,297
When I killed Huey and Sal,

104
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,432
I vomited for days.

105
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,807
It was all
I could think about.

106
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,306
But when I was beating
Dokey last night,

107
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,410
nothing.

108
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,152
You know what I was thinking
while I was kicking him?

109
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,250
"Where can I put the body?"

110
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,921
That's what Tommy wanted
to tell Jenny.

111
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,983
<i>But as they say,</i>
<i>"Timing is everything."</i>

112
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,324
IAN: Still waiting on
those coffees, Jen.

113
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,665
What did you want?

114
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,233
Nothing.

115
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,737
Never mind.

116
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,971
Tommy...

117
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,514
IAN: So I figure right there,
where that bulletin board is.

118
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,077
I'll take that down.
I think they'll fit.

119
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,520
I think that'll look
really nice, Mr. Reilly.

120
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,820
I measured it this morning,
so it should be all right.

121
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,093
Yeah, maybe
a little bit over.

122
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,789
Jenny, how about
those coffees, huh?

123
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,628
Little bit over this way,
what do you think?

124
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,892
I think it's gonna be great,
Mr. Reilly.

125
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,232
All right,
I'll get the tools.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

of broken ribs,

00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,866

around too much.

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,237
Just sit tight.

We may have bigger
problems, Doke.

Jackie's the only one
who picked up.

137
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,158
Nobody's calling back.

138
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,389
They're waiting to see
how this thing shakes down.

139
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,659
Really?

140
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,101
Well, you call Jackie

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,137
I want everybody
down at the union hall.

142

wait for me.

143
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,410
Guess who?

144
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,543
What does he want?

145
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,847
He wants to know
why Tommy Donnelly

146
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,321
kicked Dokey's ass up and down
the street last night.

147
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,789
He wants us
to go over there?

148
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,692
Yeah. And like the dogs
we are, we'll go.

149
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,361
Yeah, we'll be there.

150

borrow my car,

That you're not

00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,395
I just never met anyone really
sticking to that before.

178
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,993
I mean, it's cool,
I guess.

179
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,530
Look, I'm dying here, okay?

180
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,938
I'm dying.

181
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,035
But...

182
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,276
No, that's fine.

183
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,213
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

184
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,382
What's wrong with you?

185
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,514
Where have you been?

186
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,785
You know how worried we are?
You could be dead somewhere!

187
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,917
Kevin, stop.

188
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,286
All right,
so I got good news.

189
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,455
You remember Dickie, right?

190
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,624
Hey, Dickie.
What up, Tommy?

191
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,929
Look what Dickie brought us.

192
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,363
What is this?

193
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,168
It's a rocket launcher.

194
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,565
A rocket launcher?

195
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,411
Dickie, where'd you get
a rocket launcher?

196
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,173
From my brother.
He was over there
with the Arabs.

197
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,976
Take it back to your brother.
I think he may still need it.

198
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,017
No, no, no, Tommy,
he's in on this.

199
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,709
We're with you,
me and my brother.

200
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,219
It's cool, huh?

201
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,482
Do you even know how to use
a rocket launcher?

202
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,818
No, but how hard
could it be?

203
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,257
Dickie's brother used it.

204
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,659
Hey, Tommy,
me and my brother,

205
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,321
we're banking on you
against Dokey.

206
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,659
We don't want
nothing for it.

207
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,994
JIMMY: Hey, Tommy!

208
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,896
Good to see you showed up!

209
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,229
You see what Dickie
brought us?

210
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,202
Dickie, tell your brother
we said thanks.

211
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,505
You got it.

212
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,145
We don't need
his help, Jimmy.

213
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,274
Really?

214
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,884
'Cause after
that bonehead play
you made last night,

215
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,282
beating Dokey up
and not killing him,

216
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,355
real smart, Tommy.

217
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,356
I think we need
all the help we could get.

218
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,755
I'm working on
a better idea.

219
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,793
Well, you better
cough it up.

220
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:28,882
Dokey could be here
any minute.

221
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,256
We need to stop this.

222
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,654
Stop the killings.

223
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,460
That's our way out.

224
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,457
How is that an idea?

225
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,537
I'm not gonna let us
turn into Huey and Dokey.

226
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,237
Well, you picked
a hell of a time
to find your conscience.

227
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,500
I don't have a conscience.

228
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,836
Doesn't bother me.

229
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,809
That might be
the problem here, Kevin.

230
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,244
While you're out
saving your soul, Tommy,

231
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,009
I'm gonna go save the family.

232
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,443
Hey, Joey.

233
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,712
Come on, let's go.

234
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,776
JOEY: Where we going?

235
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,048
To blow Dokey's ass up!

236
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,818
But I'm not done
nailing things yet.

237
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,649
That's not funny, Jimmy.

238
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,558
What if it's got
a hair trigger on it
or something?

239
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,893
You gotta pull
the pin out first, dope.

240
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,465
Kevin, where you going?

241
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,662
I'm not leaving Jimmy
alone out there.

242
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,034
Dokey could be anywhere.

243
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,834
He's not alone.
He's with Joey.

244
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,499
And he's got a pocket
full of grenades.

245
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,741
You talk to Sean?

246
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,174
I left him
a message.

247
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,340
But you didn't
talk to him?

248
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,416
You wanna help somebody?

249
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,384
Get Sean
and bring him to Ma's.

250
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,081
That's your choice,
Sean and Ma or Jimmy.

251
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,658
That sucks.

252
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,474
<i>MAN. Twenty-third Precinct.</i>

253
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,516
Detective Stein, please?

254
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,115
I like what you've done
to the place.

255
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,691
Thanks for coming,
Frankie.

256
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,350
I appreciate it.

257
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,286
Gotta tell you, Tommy,

258
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,921
kicking Dokey's ass
and then not killing him?

259
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:13,987
Dumb.

260
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,966
I need a way out
from under.

261
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,130
You mean you want Dokey
off the street?

262
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,635
I'll turn state's evidence,
I'll testify,

263
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,900
whatever it takes.

264
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,532
You got anything
you can testify to

265
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,873
in front of a jury
that I can corroborate?

266
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,303
I know things.

267
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,745
It doesn't matter
what you know.
What can you prove?

268
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,441
Otherwise,
I lock him up today,

269
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,984
he's out tomorrow,
nothing's changed.

270
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,212
I'll get close to him.

271
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,275
I'll wear a wire.

272
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,376
Get you whatever you need.

273
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,956
After last night,
you get close to him?

274
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,456
He shoots you.

275
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,855
Then again,
if that happens,

276
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,894
at least I got
something on him.

277
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,190
I'm in.

278
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,764
Jesus. You got yourself
in the soup.

279
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,134
I need help, Frankie.

280
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,938
I'll put a couple of cops
outside the bar.

281
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,035
Maybe a couple
outside your house.

282
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,341
But for all we know,
they're on Dokey's payroll.

283
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,780
You want my advice?

284
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,444
Get out.

285
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,276
Take your mother,
your brothers,

286
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,945
don't come back.

287
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,686
Your father would
have been disappointed.

288
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,823
<i>JOEY. Bobby Donnelly was</i>
<i>as middle-class as they come.</i>

289
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,195
<i>For him, the American dream</i>
<i>was the family vacation.</i>

290
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,360
<i>This time, they were going</i>
<i>to Niagara Falls.</i>

291
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,902
HELEN: We're taking
these down.

292
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,232
Come on, Bobby,
shake a leg.

293
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,033
We're coming,
we're coming.

294
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,301
Guys, right here, look.

295
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,875
We follow this route,

296
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,377
and we go across
the longest stone bridge

297
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,072
in the whole wide world.
All right?

298
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,377
And we wind up here, lthaca.

299
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,041
Are you ready?

300
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,109
They've got a Jell-O museum.

301
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,545
TOMMY: Mom!

302
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,290
<i>JOEY. Mrs. Donnelly had</i>
<i>just fallen down the stairs.</i>

303
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,590
<i>Nothing serious,</i>

304
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,929
<i>but Jell-O land was definitely</i>
<i>out of the question.</i>

305
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,910
I wanna know what
the hell is going on, Kevin,

306
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,111
and I wanna know it now.

307
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,847
I don't know, Ma.
You're a liar!

308
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,819
You find Sean?
<i>KEVIN. Not yet.</i>

309
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,550
Where are you?
<i>Home.</i>

310
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,647
What are you doing
at home, Kevin?

311
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,192
Who's that?
I looked everywhere,
Sean's not...

312
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,819
Who's on the phone?
Kevin, is that Tommy?

313
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,328
<i>Give me the phone!</i>
<i>KEVIN. Stop hollering at me!</i>

314
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,695
<i>Don't you shout at me!</i>
I'm shouting at Tommy.

315
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,755
There's been
a change of plans.

316
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,131
We're not going
to Aunt Kitty's,
we're just going.

317
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,226
Going where?

318
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,292
What? Somebody's
going somewhere?

319
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,134
Just tell her
to pack her bags
and be ready to go.

320
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm gonna find Seanie.

321
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,702
Tommy, you know Ma hates
leaving the house!

322
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,799
I am not leaving the house!

323
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,242
Give me the phone!
Don't put her on!

324
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,642
Kevin! Kevin!
<i>Ma! Stop!</i>

325
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,340
<i>Tommy, I'm worried</i>
<i>out of my mind.</i>

326
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,679
Where is Sean, where is Jimmy,
and where the hell are you?

327
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,775
Ma.

328
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,342
You gotta trust me on this.

329
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,422
Pack some bags,
just what you need.

330
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,513
When we get to
where we're going,

331
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,216
we're gonna worry
about everything else then.

332
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,383
<i>I'll be home soon</i>
<i>with Seanie.</i>

333
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,517
Tommy.

334
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,229
You're scaring the hell
out of me.

335
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,356
I know.

336
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,592
It'll be okay.
Just do what
I'm asking you.

337
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,336
No, that's good...

338
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,212
TOMMY:
Out of the car, Sean!

339
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,177
Let's go!

340
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,913
Who's that?
That's my brother.

341
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,489
No wonder you won't
answer his calls.

342
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,717
What's going on?

343
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:27,883
Why haven't you gone home?

344
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,551
Kevin's been leaving
messages for you
all day.

345
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,822
I didn't check them yet.

346
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,124
Sean, everything all right?

347
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,222
Can you just excuse us
for a minute?

348
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,426
Yeah.

349
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,430
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

350
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,963
Dokey's coming after us.

351
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,008
Why, what happened?
Doesn't matter.

352
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,099
Say goodbye
to your girlfriend.

353
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,370
We're going home
and getting packed.

354
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,502
Packed?

355
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,977
We're leaving town.

356
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,038
All of us. Ma, too.

357
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,879
No way. All right, look,
no way I'm leaving now, Tommy.

358
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,010
You guys go, I'm staying.

359
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,247
Remember how
you got to ICU?

360
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,188
It's going there
again, Sean.

361
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,224
We can't stop it.

362
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,793
Okay, I don't care, all right?
Dokey don't scare me.

363
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,585
He'll scare her.

364
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,062
You know Dokey.

365
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,928
He won't stop
at anything, Sean.

366
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,731
I love her, Tommy.
I wanna marry this girl.

367
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,303
You love her?

368
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,863
You wanna protect her?

369
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,101
Yeah. Of course.

370
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,268
Say goodbye.

371
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,237
Don't tell her anything,
just say goodbye.

372
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,043
You don't know what
you're asking, Tommy.

373
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,489
She's gonna hate me.

374
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,627
He looks pissed.

375
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,892
You missed a shift
at the bar or something?

376
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,526
Yeah, something like that.

377
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,865
Well, I'm late
for work anyway.

378
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,539
You know, that thing
you told me before,

379
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,634
I think it's really cool.

380
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,839
Thanks.

381
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,954
Seanie...
Don't even say anything.
Let's just go.

382
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,032
Hey, what if
he doesn't ask us
to wait by the pool?

383
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,765
Has he ever not asked us
to wait by the pool?

384
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:27,513
No. But it's never been
cold like it is today.

385
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,243
My gonads feel like
there's only one of them.

386
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,784
That ever happen to you?

387
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,221
By the pool.

389
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,254
NICKY: Hey, be nice, Ray,
I'm a comer.

390
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,422
You're a scumbag.

391
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,693
That's not what
my friends tell me.

392
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,893
You mean that
friend there?

393
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,230
The one that stood by
while I played the bongos

394
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,463
on your head with a shovel?

395
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,539
They did have a gun
to my head.

396
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:00,845
Joey!
What?

397
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,037
Stop with the jumping.

when people are
trying to kill me.

399

I gotta tell you, Jimmy,
I don't know about this plan.

400
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,043
You haven't even
heard it yet.
Yeah.

401
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,111
But anything with grenades
and me is a poor plan.

402
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,747
I mean, inexperience is
bound to be a factor,

403
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,051
mistakes could be made...

Should we throw them now?
What should we do?

407
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,091
What about now?
Should we throw them?

all these guys
in the same room

414
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,204
might not be
the safest idea.

I'm telling you, Jackie's
the only one we can trust.

416

for Jackie, huh?

and if he comes out on top,

I'm telling you,
he's gonna be a lot easier
for us to work with.

I called you, Doke.

524
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,688
When I want him dead,
he'll be dead.

525
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,264
All due respect,
you're making a big mistake.

526
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,831
Now what did I just...

527
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,101
I need to go
to the hospital.

528
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,369
I'm gonna die.

529
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,640
Remember when Nicky told
Vinnie to get that thing?

530
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,204
<i>Well, the thing in question</i>
<i>was a bottle of methanol.</i>

531
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,408
<i>Which happens to be deadly</i>

532
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,714
when ingested
in sufficient quantities.

533
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,380
<i>And Alo was about to get</i>
<i>a sufficient quantity</i>

534
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,649
<i>in his next martini.</i>

535
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,190
Hey. Suppose he offers us
a drink?

536
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,328
He won't.
When has he ever?

537
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,454
Get these guys
a couple of drinks.

538
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,522
<i>JOEY. Now, Nicky having</i>
<i>a drink with Alo</i>

539
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,591
<i>still wasn't the problem</i>
<i>you might expect,</i>

540
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,071
as long as Vinnie got
Nicky to the hospital in time,

541
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,209
<i>something Ray wouldn't</i>
<i>be able to do for Alo.</i>

542
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,774
Just drive the car.

543
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,007
I'm moving!

544
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,811
<i>JOEY. Of course,</i>
<i>with Vinnie behind the wheel,</i>

545
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,908
it was pretty touch and go
for Nicky, too.

546
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,715
Just drive the car!
I'm moving!

547
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,788
I'm driving!
Let go of the wheel!

548
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,055
(TIRES SQUEALING)

549
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,667
Hey.

550
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,865
We're leaving.

551
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,604
Me, my brothers,
Ma, all of us.

552
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,310
I don't think
we're coming back.

553
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,618
This is because of what
happened with Dokey?

554
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,013
Yeah.

555
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,079
But it's more than that.

556
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,157
It's everything
that's been going on.

557
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,883
I'm changing it.

558
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,126
That's good.

559
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,889
I want you to come with me.

560
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,189
Come with you?

561
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,426
Yeah.

562
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,545
Tommy, I can't do that.

563
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,683
Listen,
if this is about Samson,

564
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,776
we'll put it all behind us.

565
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,157
If you're worried
about your dad,
he can come with us.

566
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,789
We can work this out.

567
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,088
No.

568
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,003
I love you.

569
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,302
And if there's any part of you
that still loves me...

570
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,604
Tommy.

571
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,702
Don't answer me now, okay?

572
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,340
I'm gonna go back
and get my mom
and my brothers.

573
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,078
The last thing I'm gonna do
is call you.

574
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,948
Tell me then
if you can come.

575
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,411
Let's go.
Is everybody ready to go?

576
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,112
Sean, get on your feet.

577
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,205
Where's Kevin?

578
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,681
In his room.

579
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,343
Kevin? Come on!

580
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,818
Kevin.

581
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,348
TOMMY: Let's go.
KEVIN: Go down,
I'll be right there.

582
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,446
Come on, Kevin.

583
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,025
Give me two seconds.

584
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,355
Come on!

585
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,792
Ma?
Yeah?

586
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,353
Let's go.
Yeah, yeah.

587
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,493
Come on.

588
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,470
Come on, Kev, let's go.

589
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,207
Okay, I'm ready!

590
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,480
Come on.

591
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,991
Come on.

592
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,801
What the hell is that?
Where's my car?

593
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,404
I sold it.

594
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,632
You're the proud owner
of this van, Seanie.

595
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,802
Are you kidding me?

596
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:37,672
Is this ours?

597
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,547
TOMMY: We needed room
for Ma's essentials.

598
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,586
Road trip, yeah.

599
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,519
Where's Jimmy?
I hate this car.

600
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,591
No, it's not a car,
it's a passenger van.

601
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,217
Kevin, Sean!

602
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,555
Pile in.

603
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,224
Where's your brother Jimmy?
Come on, let's go.

604
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,390
Sean, in the back.

605
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,366
Oh, it's my van?
I'm driving.

606
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,235
Jimmy's not coming.

607
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,869
What are you talking about,
he's not coming?

608
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,379
I tried everything,
he won't come.

609
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,716
You think I'm gonna leave
my son behind?

610
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,947
Okay, we're not going.

611
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,043
Ma.

612
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,010
We gotta go.

613
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,958
You want me to go
through with this?

614
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,720
I leave with
an entire family.

615
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,194
Otherwise,
you can just forget it.

616
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,596
All right, when that guy's
not looking,

617
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,431
we're gonna run
behind the SUV.

618
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,367
You ready?
Not really.

619
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,503
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

620
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,439
Hello?
<i>TOMMY. Where are you?</i>

621
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,376
We're down at the old
warehouse on Gilbert,
Tommy.

622
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,243
<i>Let me talk to Jimmy.</i>

623
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,310
Where you calling from, Tommy?
Oshkosh?

624
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,711
<i>I'm here with Ma.</i>

625
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,351
She won't go without you.

626
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,546
<i>Good, then maybe me calling</i>
<i>you a coward worked.</i>

627
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,315
Can't talk right now, Tommy.

628
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,783
I'm about to go kill Dokey.

629
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:58,885
Okay.

630
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,489
He'll come, we just have
to do him a favor first.

631
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,961
Okay.

632
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,106
We're running from the mob
in a passenger van?

633
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,671
How great is that.

Jimmy, hey! It's Joanie.

635
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,847
I'm with your family.

00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,113
<i>Did Tommy talk you</i>
<i>into this?</i>

637
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,316
No, it...
Jimmy, I think this
is a good idea.

638
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,357
<i>It's a stupid idea, Joanie.</i>

639
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,361
It's what we've
always wanted.

640
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,760
<i>What? Dodging nothing?</i>

641
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,693
<i>Scared of a donkey-face</i>
<i>like Dokey?</i>

642
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,291
We should go,
because if you don't go,
then I can't go.

643
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,802
Jimmy?

644
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,699
Hello?

645
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,966
I'm really gonna miss her.

He's such a jerk.

647
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,350
Hold on.

00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,390
Really?

00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:07,892
Come on.

00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,757
We're still too far away.

652
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,333
Out. Everybody out.

653
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,013
Let's go!
You too, Sean, let's go.

654
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,783
Stay away from the windows.

655
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:27,909
Lock the door,
don't let anybody else in.

656
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,386
I'll be back in 20 minutes
with Jimmy, okay?

657
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,489
KEVIN: Tommy!
What?

658
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,423
I think I should
go with you.

659
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,291
Take care of Ma.
And lock the door, Kevin.

660
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,163
All right,
I'm gonna shoot
that guy.

661
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,329
When I do,
I want you to run
to the dock

662
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,463
and throw the grenade.

663
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,234
You make sure it lands
right next to Dokey.

664
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,639
And that would've
worked out great

665
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,971
except for one
little detail.

666
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,071
Can't I shoot the guy
and you throw the grenade?

667
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,779
Why?
Cause I'm a lefty.

668
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,042
We're gonna be running left,

669
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,777
which means
I'm gonna have to
throw with my right.

670
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,512
I can't do that,
I'll get all twisted.

671
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,812
All right.

672
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,018
You shoot the guy,
I'll throw the grenade.

673
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,782
You ready?
Yeah.

674
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,329
One, two, three, go!

675
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,096
<i>JOEY. And that would have</i>
<i>worked out great, too.</i>

676
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,635
Except some idiot hadn't
realized the grenades

677
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,604
<i>were minus the explosive part.</i>

00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:35,980
Get in!

where the hell did you
get this piece of crap?

TOMMY:
You're welcome, Jimmy.

684
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,523
I'm going upstairs
for a bit, hon.

685
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,528
Gotta take a nap.

686
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,372
Your dad's feeling
a little dizzy.

687
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,778
You know what?

688
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,203
I think I'm gonna go up,

689
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,175
sit with him for a while,

690
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,640
see how he is.

691
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,751
You get the hell
out of here.

692
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,117
Right now.

693
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,916
Oh, I could do that.

694
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,723
Or I could go up
to your room instead,
wait for you.

695
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,198
I'm calling the police.

696
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,763
Go ahead, call the police.

697
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,636
I promise your dad will be

JOANIE:
I don't understand, Jimmy.

699
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,162
What's so great
about this life?

700
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,501
I like the life I got.

701
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,134
Oh, you're so full of it,
you get me sick.

702
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,370
What do you like?

703
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,605
You like being
a junkie, huh?

704
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,277
You like beating people up
and stealing from them?

705
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,009
What's to like about that?

706
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,073
That's a little harsh,
all right?

707
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,449
Would you stop
with the dramatics?

708
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,521
You've got the nicest mom
I ever met.

709
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,184
I hate being
a junkie, man.

710
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,357
I wanna be a part
of a family!

711
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,158
I want a chance
at something!

712
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:35,855
What about my sign?
I just bought that,

713
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:36,957
what am I gonna
do with that?

714
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,729
Your sign?
Who cares about your sign?

715
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,730
You'll get another sign.

716
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,170
Means I have to buy
a whole new bar.

717
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,209
Okay, so we'll get
another bar.

718
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,578
Wherever we're going,
there's gonna be a bar.

719
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,872
There's bars
all over America,
Jimmy!

720
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,376
Come on! Look at me!

721
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,013
I want my pretty hair back.

722
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,881
I want my teeth.

723
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,188
Come on...

724
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,963
You coming?

725
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,400
JOANIE: Please.

726
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,537

00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,066
Yeah.

734
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:04,973
You gonna call
your grandma?

735
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,539
I already did.

736
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,379
Okay.

00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,806
Oh, my God!

00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,367
It's okay, Ma.

739
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,638
Stay in the van.

740
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,608
Tommy, where are you going?

741
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,587
Get back in the van,
I'm going to talk to Dokey.

742
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,160
Yeah, right.

743
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,261
Why don't I
give you my gun

744
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,330
so you can blow
yourself away
right now?

745

I'm just going over
to talk to Dokey.

But it's up to you to get Mom
and everybody out of here.

I don't know how
you're gonna do it,

748
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,371
but I know you will.

749
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,209
Just do whatever
you gotta do.

750
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,309
Okay?

00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,579
Tell me what you want.

756

I'll give it to you.

You name it, I'll do it.

760

Or you can kill me.

I want anything from you, huh?

make sense of this.

Make sense?

Looks to me
like you're running away.

766

But you wanna
save your family, huh?

Let them go
and I'll answer that.

You're not making
the rules, Tommy.

773

Answer the question.
