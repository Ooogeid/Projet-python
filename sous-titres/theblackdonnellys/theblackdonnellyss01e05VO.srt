<i>She asked Tommy to have</i>
<i>his wake at The Firecracker.</i>

5
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,210
<i>A little awkward,</i>
<i>seeing as Tommy did kill Huey.</i>

6
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,768
<i>But Tommy had bigger problems.</i>

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,782
<i>Like Huey's brother, Dokey,</i>
<i>who thought Jimmy killed Huey.</i>

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,580
<i>Actually, Jimmy killed</i>
<i>Louie the bookie.</i>

9
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,654
<i>And since no bookie</i>
<i>means no money</i>
<i>for Louie's boss, Nicky,</i>

10
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,520
<i>Tommy has to make up</i>
<i>the difference every week.</i>

11
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,526
<i>Did I mention Sean was</i>
<i>still in the hospital?</i>

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,255
<i>He was getting a little TLC</i>
<i>from Kim,</i>

13

<i>See, there was nothing</i>
<i>Tommy wanted more than Jenny.</i>

17
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,326
<i>But after what Tommy</i>
<i>did to Huey,</i>

18
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,064
<i>Jenny decided to want</i>
<i>something else</i>

19
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,140

21
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,176
<i>Now that had to hurt.</i>

22

33
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,031
Yes, he was.

34
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,503
Well, see?
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,507
Actually, he was leaving
the hospital.

Kind of a big deal, Sean.

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,487
There's a whole bunch of them
on here.

178
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,484
PA31, JR32,
and it goes on like that.

179
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,719
You think Louie's got
his whole book in there?

180
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,158
I do think that.

181
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,487
I think half the bets on here
gotta be losers.

182
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,792
Probably more.

183
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,163
Too bad Louie's not around
to collect.

184
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,102
Get Kevin down here.

185
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,034
Let's figure this thing out.

186
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,772
(PHONE RINGING)

187
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,736
Hello? What?

188
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,179
No, I can't.

189
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,184
Because I can't.

190
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,148
Look, tell Jimmy
if he needs my help,

191
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,281
he's gotta come over here.

192
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,395
What?

193
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,977
Hey! Hey, Tommy,
how you doing?

194
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,281
I'm great.
How you doing?

195
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,218
Look, Tommy,
I've always liked you.

196
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,484
And I don't want to have
any problems with you,
I just...

197
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,650
I want to let you know
that Jenny and I got
together last night.

198
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,194
Look, I didn't want you
to hear about it
from anybody but me.

199
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,930
What does that mean,
you got together?

200
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,989
Tommy, it ain't right
to ask that.

201
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,227
Okay, I'm trying to do
the right thing here,

202
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,428
I hope you appreciate that.

203
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,504
Like I said,
I'm not looking
for any problems.

204
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,343
No problems.

205
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,346
All right.

206
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,315
Take care, all right?
Yeah.

207
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,197
Okay.

208
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,370
You outlasted me.

209
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,104
You won't come in,
I'll come to you.

210
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,972
Thanks, Father,
but I'm not here
for confession.

211
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,673
You've been on your knees
for 45 minutes.

212
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,876
I know a sin
when I see one.

213
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,050
(SIGHS) I feel terrible.

214
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,893
You look terrible.

215
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,117
Thanks.

216
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,863
Well, tell me about it.

217
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,896
I broke my vows this week.

218
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,209
Okay.

219
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,042
And I did it
again last night.

220
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,142
With someone else.

221
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,647
And you feel bad
about that?

222
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,619
Yes.
Good, you should.

223
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,890
What's worse,
I did it to hurt the person

224
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,516
I'm really in love with.

225
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,456
Who was the first guy.

226
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,327
Who isn't your husband?

227
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:42,923
No.

228
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,669
I don't know what to do,
Father.

229
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,338
I just make one mistake
after another.

230
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,913
It's been over a year now.

231
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,616
Marked a new anniversary
on my calendar.

232
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,450
The day my husband
never came home.

233
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,763
Well, thank God
for small favors.

234
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,631
Your husband was a louse.

235
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:24,031
You should never have
gotten involved with him
in the first place.

236
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,203
Want my advice?

237
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,473
Not if it comes
with penance.

238
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,514
Undo your problems,
one at a time.

239
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,146
Are you telling me
to get a divorce?

240
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,256
Well, the Church
still believes

241
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,989
that divorce is punishable
by the flames of hell.

242
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,629
I'd look into an annulment.

243
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,277
KEVIN:
Fifty X means times five,

244
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,376
so that's $250
on the Colts to win.

245
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,579
This is stupid.

246
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,144
No one's gonna pay you
Louie's money.

247
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,587
JIMMY: What's the B32?

248
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,090
The customers' code names.

249
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,024
The ones that aren't gonna be
giving you any money.

250
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,527
How do you know
it's a code name?

251
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,028
Because I had a code name.

252
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,928
And I wouldn't be giving you
any money, by the way.

253
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,125
What was your code name?

254
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,895
It's not important.

255
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,865
Kevin, I'm gonna beat you up
if you don't tell me.

256
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,797
L21.

257
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,565
What's the L for?

258
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,742
Lucky.
Lucky?

259
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,173
This is why
I don't tell you things.

260
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,383
Wait, 21, what's that?

261
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,918
This is stupid.
It's the number that
Louie would give you.

262
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,787
Try the speed dial.

263
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,350
Lucky 21. Here you are.

264
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,261
You want to know
how much you owe?

265
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,964
Don't! Don't!
All right!

266
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,193
Do not.

267
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,461
Now if you lost,
then what?

268
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,503
Louie or someone
from the office would
call you on payday

269
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,905
and tell you
how much you owe.

270
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,909
All right, this is good.
When's payday?

271
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,171
Today.

272
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,542
Or if you won,

273
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,774
then he'd give you the money
on Tuesday.

274
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,943
We won't be needing Tuesdays.

275
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,609
Give me the phone.

276
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,817
Hey, this is Jimmy.
From the office.

277
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,223
Your number
for the week is 250.

278
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,059
No, no, Louie's out of town.
I'll be making the pickups.

279
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,965
JOEY: See you later, Kev.

280
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,175
KIM: Hey, Tommy?

281
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,045
Tommy!

282
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,582
Tommy, I need to talk to you.
Oh, hey, Kim.

283
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,878
It's about Sean.

284
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,283
What about him?
He's ignoring me.

285
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,443
I'm sure he doesn't mean to.

286
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,988
Yeah, so did you say
anything to him?

287
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,524
About what?
About me being a slut.

288
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,356
What?
I mean, I'm not a slut,

289
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,362
but is that
what you told him?

290
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,560
Why would I do that?

291
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,527
'Cause when we met,
I thought you were gonna
ask me out,

292
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,796
and then I went out
with your little brother.

293
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,201
Kim, I don't care about that.

294
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,001
Then why won't he see me?

295
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,301
I have no clue.

296
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,672
But if I were you,

297
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,404
I'd go stand outside
our front door

298
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,969
and wait
until he gives you an answer.

299
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,481
You would?
Yeah, I'd go right now.

300
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,186
Tommy Donnelly.

301
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,092
I'm dropping out
next semester.

302
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,130
You don't sound so sure
about that.

303
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,092
I'm sure.

304
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,028
I just want my money back.

305
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,602
Well, sorry,
that we can't do.

306
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,864
No, no.

307
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,939
I checked. I got 10 days
to withdraw from classes,

308
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,439
and today's the tenth day.

309
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,066
Yes, but you don't have the...
No, no.

310
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,940
I'm within the deadline.
I need my money back.

311
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,843
Mr. Donnelly,
if you'll just listen
for a second.

312
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:49,972
Okay.

313
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,415
Your tuition wasn't paid
this semester.

314
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,815
What?
Actually,

315
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,745
it was paid
but then it was cancelled.

316
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,488
Cancelled?

317
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,654
Who cancelled it?

318
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,561
<i>JOEY. Huey Farrell had been</i>
<i>paying Tommy's tuition</i>
<i>through the union.</i>

319
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,790
Up until this moment,

320
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,355
Tommy somehow believed
that killing Huey

321
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,425
wasn't gonna change that.

322
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,104
<i>The hardest lies are</i>
<i>the ones we believe ourselves.</i>

323
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,605
<i>Like Jimmy thinking</i>
<i>you could go out</i>

324
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,868
<i>and make a lot of money</i>
<i>and respect would follow.</i>

325
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,102
Jimmy, we're up to six guys.

326
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,974
How many of these collections
are we gonna make?

327
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,741
What's the matter,
you don't like money?

328
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,439
<i>MAN ON PHONE.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

329
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,540
Hey, it's Jimmy
from the office.

330
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,777
<i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

331
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,480
Your number for the week's
$440.

332
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,924
No, no, Louie's out of town.
I'll be making the pickups.

333
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,016
Joey.
Where do you guys
usually meet?

334
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,653
You seen Tommy?
No, I haven't seen him?

335
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,820
Want one?

336
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,364
No, thanks.
6:00, I'll be there.

337
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,592
Jenny!

338
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,261
Yeah, Jimmy?

339
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,694
Good times last night, huh?

340
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,663
Sure, Jimmy, if that's
what you call a good time.

341
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,331
Oh, I don't mean
the part about Dokey

342
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,909
holding us hostage
in the basement and almost
chopping off our toes.

343
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,569
That sucked.

344
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,078
I mean last time I saw you.

345
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,775
You know, it's funny.

346
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,841
I never would have known
you were married.

347
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,811
Does Samson know?

348
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,584
Just tell Tommy I was here,
okay?

349
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,592
I'll be sure to tell Tommy,
I mean Samson, I mean Tommy.

350
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,787
I'm sorry,
I made a mistake.

351
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,022
Anybody could make a mistake,
right?

352
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,195
Did I miss something?

353
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,929
Yeah. How a guy can waste
15 years of his life

354
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,565
on some backstabbing,
open-her-legs-for-any-dumbass
bread man whore.

355
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,740
You're talking about Tommy,
right?

356
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,039
Shut up.

357
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,941
Time to start collecting
the money.

358
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,009
Grab the phone, idiot!
Yeah. I had it.

359
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,783
You made me forget
with all that Jenny stuff.

360
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,349
I told you to shut up
about that.

361
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,915
Yeah. Okay, I'm done.

362
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,017
Shut up.

363
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,857
MAN:
Every month with this guy.

364
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,194
Then do what you feel is best.
It's your business.

365
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,398
Thanks for taking a minute,
Dokey, I appreciate it.

366
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,868
Absolutely.

367
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,199
After last night,
you and I are old friends.

368
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,366
What can I do for you?

369
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,477
I guess you know
I go to art school downtown.

370
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,840
Yeah, I heard.

371
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,539
But art school,

372
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,083
that's not like real school,
right? That's...

373
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,049
The tuition was taken care
of by the union.

374
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,353
Huey said it was covered
under my father's
death benefits.

375
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,225
Yeah, well, it wasn't.
It was a handout.
And you know that.

376
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,430
And that's why
I cancelled it.

377
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,899
Well, we got a problem, Dokey,
'cause I was counting on
that money.

378
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,493
The problem you and I have is
you think I'm stupid enough

379
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,335
to take food
out of the mouths of my men?

380
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,274
That money came from
union coffers, Tommy.

381
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:36,440
My brother, he was a jerk
with a soft heart.

382
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,516
And I'm not.

383
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,919
Last night, when I told you
about kidnapping an Italian

384
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,648
to get out
from under a debt...

385
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,746
Yeah?

386
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,522
Well, we're not quite out
from under.

387
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,788
I'm in the hole to Nicky
for 25 a week.

388
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,264
The first payment's
due tonight.

389
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,561
So?

390
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,363
If I can't get
that tuition money, Dokey,

391
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,994
I'm gonna need
to borrow $2,500.

392
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,974
Tommy, tell me one person

393
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,340
who would loan a kid like you
that kind of money?

394
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,772
I was hoping you would.

395
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:12,146
Well, then I'm afraid
you got your head up your ass.

396
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,811
But I'll tell you
what I will do.

397
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,286
I'll throw you a job.

398
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,349
What kind of a job?

399
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,657
I've noticed that
you've become pretty tight
with my sister-in-law.

400
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,754
Kate?

401
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,730
Not more than anyone else.

402
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,933
Well,

403
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,264
she's got something
inside the house,

404
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,838
and all I want you to do
is get it for me.

405
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,874
You want me to rob
from your sister-in-law?

406
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,273
Huey had an office
in the basement.

407
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,334
There's a large box
in the desk.

408
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,540
Now, I'm not gonna
confuse you by telling you
what's in the box.

409
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,383
All I want you to do,

410
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,714
grab it
and bring it back here.

411
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,851
Forget it.

412
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,911
Hey.

413
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,619
You bring me that box,

414
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,296
and your problem with Nicky

415
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,763
goes away.

416
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,097
I can't rob a widow.

417
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,766
I'll figure it out.

418
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,379
Kevin, you damn dummy.
What?

419
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,473
You didn't pull
the door shut.

420
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,539
Yes, I did.

421
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,880
Not all the way,
it didn't latch.

422
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,944
Ma, let me go ahead of you.

423
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,716
What the hell for?

424
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,655
I don't know.

425
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,721
What are you
all worried about,
Kevin?

426
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,557
You owe people money again?
No.

427
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,824
Then stop acting
like an idiot!

428
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,898
KEVIN: Seanie?
SEAN: Yeah, what?

429
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,630
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

430
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,668
Hello?

00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,576
<i>NICKY. Now you know you</i>
<i>closed that door, right?</i>

432
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,016
<i>But it makes you wonder.</i>
<i>Someone's been inside.</i>

433
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,812
<i>Maybe left something.</i>

434
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,147
Nicky?

435
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,690
<i>Tell your brother</i>
<i>clock's ticking.</i>

436
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,986
Look, you go to hell...

(PHONE DISCONNECTS)

438
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,060
You find him?
No.

439
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,658
Where's he calling from?
I don't know, Tommy,

440
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,896
he scared the hell out of me.

441
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:13,972
Mom know anything?

442
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,972
No. Tommy, let's rob somebody
and give him his money,

443
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,303
but let's kill him.

444
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,105
Kevin, relax.

445
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,576
Where's Mom?

446
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,112
In the kitchen.

447
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,557
Hey, Ma.
Hi.

448
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,950
How we doing?
Good.

449
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,693
Your brother's acting
a little weird.

450
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,028
Yeah. What's that?

451
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,828
Casserole for Seanie.

452
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,580
What are you doing?

453
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,640
I'm taking the casserole.

454
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,047
You keep an eye on Ma?
Yeah.

455
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,558
Tommy.
Hey.

456
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,489
My mother made a casserole.
She asked me to drop it off.

457
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,326
That was nice.
Please thank her for me.

458
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,592
I will.

459
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,365
And you, too.

460
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,732
The wake was
just what I wanted.

461
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,602
And everything you said
was beautiful.

462
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,741
Huey had to be
smiling down.

463
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,641
I hope so.

464
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,383
Is that one of his sweaters?

465
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,282
Oh...

466
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,487
Yeah.

467
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,717
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to...

468
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,295
I should go.
It's ugly, isn't it?

469
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,628
He never wore it.

470
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,227
But it was made in Ireland,
so he'd never get rid of it.

471
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,197
And now I can't seem to,
either.

472
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,508
You cleaning out his closets?

473
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,737
I've been at it two hours,
this is as far as I've gotten.

474
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,880
I could help you.

475
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,616
No, it wouldn't
be a problem.

476
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,583
That would be wonderful.

477
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,779
Yeah.

478
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,626
MAN 1: The soup smells good.
MAN 2: Yeah.

479
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,131
Dad?
Yeah?

480
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,208
The hamburger patties,
they were in the oven.

481
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,267
What?

482
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,438
The patties that were
delivered this morning,

483
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,947
did you put them
in the oven?

484
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,540
You're asking me if I put
the hamburger patties
in the oven?

485
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,313
You think I'm an idiot?

486
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,819
Well, somebody did it.
I didn't.

487
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,287
Well, I didn't do it, either.

488
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,119
Well, one of us did.

489
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,983
I vote for you.

490
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,587
Order another box.
Damn waste of money, Jen.

491
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,511
Hi, Mrs. Donnelly.
Hello.

492
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,947
I was wondering
if Sean was here.

493
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,609
He is, but he's sleeping.

494
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,619
Mom? Who's that? Oh, hey.

495
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,245
What's the matter
with you today, huh?

496
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,119
Nothing, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to see
who it was.

497
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,283
Kevin,
is Sean really sleeping?

498
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,121
I just told you
he was sleeping.

499
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,458
Mrs. Donnelly,
I know Sean's in there,

500
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,497
and I don't think
he's sleeping.

501
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,261
And I'm not gonna leave
without talking to him.

502
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,328
Ma.

503
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,038
Damn!

504
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,841
What do you want
from my Seanie?

505
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,942
Why don't you like me?

506
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,637
If someone's told you
something, tell me.

507
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,111
Nobody has to say anything.

508
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,442
All I have to do
is look at you

509
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,676
and I can tell
you're wrong for my son.

510
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,739
Isn't it bad enough

511
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,343
that he already took
this terrible beating for you?

512
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,581
For me?

513
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,088
What'd you do, huh?

514
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,848
Did you give these fellows
a little smile, a little wave?

515
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,087
Playing the big shot beauty?

516
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,289
God knows what my other sons
had to do to avenge this.

517
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,524
So you just do me a favor

518
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,394
and stay the hell out
of our lives.

519
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,925
Sean'll do just fine
without you.

520
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,994
Hey, how we doing out here?

521
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,402
Shut the door, Kevin,
or I'm gonna hit you in
the head with something.

522
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,872
Okay, okay.

523
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,371
Did Sean say
I did any of that?

524
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,845
Sean's too much of a gentleman
to say anything.

525
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,541
Please don't come back.

526
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,851
Can you give Sean
a message for me?

527
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,019
(STUTTERING)

528
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,598
Not if my Mom
doesn't want me to.

529
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,833
What kind of people are you?

530
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,338
Worst part was going
to the morgue.

531
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,209
Identifying the body.

532
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,607
I can't imagine.

533
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,908
It wasn't the bullet hole.

534
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,754
It was seeing him in
this awful plastic bag.

535
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,888
I'm sorry.

536
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,687
Have you been to a morgue?

537
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,887
No.

538
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,061
Huey loved the cold.

539
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,793
He, he hated the heat.
Irish blood.

540
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,030
That's what I thought about,
looking at him.

541
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,437
That he would have liked
how cold it was.

542
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,873
MATTHEW: Mom?

543
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,538
Honey?

544
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,342
I'm ready for bed.

545
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,042
Oh. Did you brush your teeth?

546
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,743
Yeah.

547
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,584
Come here.

548
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,821
Open your mouth.

549
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,652
Breathe.

550
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,859
You still need to
brush your teeth.

551
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,555
Oh, jeez.

552
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,791
Moms will catch you
every time.

553
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,962
Go on.
I'll be in to kiss you
good night.

554
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,263
I hope he didn't
hear all that.

555
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,705
No, he didn't.

556
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,071
Can I help you guys
with something?

557
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,040
We're from the office.

558
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,715
What office is that?

559
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,277
Louie's office.

560
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,984
I'm Ryan.

561
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,224
That's Steve-O.
How's it going?

562
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,358
Where's Jimmy?

563
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,093
Jimmy? Jimmy who?

564
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,354
Jimmy.

565
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,863
The guy who called me
from the office,

566
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,729
said he was working
for Louie.

567
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,234
Jimmy couldn't come.
He sent me.

568
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,166
You know what?

569
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,241
This whole thing stinks.

570
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,436
You have Jimmy
or Louie call me
from the office.

571
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,536
I'll deal with them.

572
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,176
All right, wait a minute.

573
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,515
I am Jimmy.

574
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,047
He is. He really is Jimmy.

575
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,710
Get the hell out
of my office.

576
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,846
Just pay me the money.

577
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,480
I'm not paying.

578
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,558
Joey, shut the blinds.

579
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,996
Joey?

580
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,433
What happened to Steve-O?

581
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,929
So?

582
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,832
Perfect.
What?

583
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,935
Joey!
Get in here and hit this guy!

584
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,191
(MEN GRUNTING)

585
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,540
Come on, Steve-O, let's go.

586
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,989
Matthew's a good kid.

587
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,625
I always feel bad
he's an only child.

588
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,362
It must be great
having a lot of brothers.

589
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,870
I don't know about great.

590
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,363
I know it's a lot of headache.

591
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,399
I had three brothers
growing up.

592
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,068
They were always hitting
and biting and kicking.

593
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,807
It was ridiculous.

594
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,548
But now I think
it's good for boys.

595
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,880
They need
that physical thing.

596
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,148
Were you guys like that?

597
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,046
A little bit.

598
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,491
My brothers were
so vicious,

599
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:28,157
they would knee each other
in the balls, headlocks.

600
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,067
Except one thing,
they would never punch
in the face.

601
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,128
Is that how you guys were?

602
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,637
No, we punch in the face.

603
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,675
Really?

604
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,505
Yeah. That's the first place
we go.

605
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,241
Our mother taught us that.

606
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,203
I'll tell you what.

607
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,409
You really feel like
Matthew's missing out,

608
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,951
why don't you just send him
over to our house?

609
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,350
We can hold down
one of my brothers,

610
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,945
and we'll let Matthew
kick the crap out of him.

611
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,528
You okay?

612
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,634
I know how close
you were to Huey,

613
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,899
but you barely know me
and Matthew.

614
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,375
Sorry.
Okay.

615
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,587
Ma, turn it off, please.

616
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,490
Sorry, did I wake you?

617
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:10,859
No.

618
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,334
Hungry?

619
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,333
Can you bring it in?

620
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,075
What's the matter?

621
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,181
Nothing.

622
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,648
Look at me.
Would you look at me,
please?

623
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,653
Is that what
you're worried about?

624
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,588
What your face looks like?

625
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,656
It's pretty bad.

626
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,669
What you look like,
your face...

627
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:51,169
I know that's
who you think you are,
but it's not.

628
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,902
It's what's
inside your heart,

629
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,344
that's what makes you
a Donnelly.

630
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:00,147
Your father would be
ashamed of you if you thought
anything else.

631
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,512
Now I'm gonna
put dinner on.

632
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,815
And I'm not
bringing it in here.

633
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,576
<i>JOEY. See, the thing about</i>
<i>telling lies is</i>

634
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,377
if you're good at it,

635
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,246
people don't know
they're being lied to.

636
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,682
<i>So then the question is,</i>

637
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,524
can you live with
the lies you tell?

638
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,708
KATE: Tommy?

639
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,773
Yeah.

640
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,787
You leaving?
Yeah, it's getting late.

641
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,554
What time is it?
It's 9:00.

642
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,117
Oh, okay.

643
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,385
Well...

644
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,394
Sorry about all the crying.

645
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,472
Don't be silly.

646
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,265
Good night.

647
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,199
Good night.

648
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,758
Did you look in it?

649
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,854
No.

650
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,830
If I were you, I would've
at least taken a peek.

651
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,100
I didn't wanna be tempted.

652
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,305
And I figured
you knew exactly how much
was in there.

653
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,435
Smart.

654
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,242
<i>JOEY. Being a thief made</i>
<i>Tommy feel pretty bad.</i>

655
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,548
$2,500.

656
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,347
<i>Getting robbed made him feel</i>
<i>a lot worse.</i>

657
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,518
The deal was you were gonna
make my problem go away.

658
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,286
I will. This week.

659
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,953
That wasn't the deal.

660
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,325
Sure it was, Tommy.

661
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,420
No.

662
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,191
You said you were gonna
talk to Nicky

663
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,427
and make my problem go away.

664
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,295
I held up my end
and you...

665
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,166
Yeah, well,
let me just stop you
right there, okay?

666
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,762
I think maybe
what we have here

667
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,341
is a communication problem
between you and I.

668
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,876
Let's call it that.

669
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,140
Because calling it
anything else

670
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,273
could result in you
losing your toes.

671
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,362
You're right.
It was my mistake.

672
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,418
Next time we do business,

673
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,125
I'll make sure
we understand each other.

674
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,665
By the way,
I need to ask you a favor.

675
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,134
What's that?

676
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,928
I need an address.

677
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,133
Put a plate out
for your brother.

678
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,709
He's not coming out.
Put another plate out.

679
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,803
He doesn't want anybody
seeing him looking
like a Cyclops.

680
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,142
I heard that.

681
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:21,409
I'm just kidding.
You look like half a Cyclops.

682
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,754
What about me?
HELEN:
There's not enough for you.

683
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,661
Have another piece of bread.

684
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:35,994
That's not fair.

685
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,125
You should have thought
about that

686
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,829
when you let Tommy
steal my casserole.

687
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,771
Go out and eat, you haven't
been out of my hair all day.

688
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,740
I don't want to go out.

689
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,209
Have some squash.

690
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,441
I don't like squash.
I don't even like saying it.

691
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,373
This is great, Mom.

692
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,294
It's $2,500.

693
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,299
We're even.

694
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,494
Even?

695
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,539
That's right. I'm done.

696
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,572
I'll tell you why.

697
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,404
One of the last things
Huey Farrell said to me

698
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,743
was my brother Sean wasn't
supposed to get beat up.

699
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,044
I'm thinking you did that
on your own.

700
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,277
I'm thinking that's
a piece of information

701
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,013
that Sal's boss, Alo,
would like to hear.

702
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,389
That's why the $2,500
makes us even.

703
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,051
That pastry for your mother?

704
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,091
Why don't you say hi for me?

705
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,258
She lives upstairs, right?

706
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,313
You find something amusing
about what just happened?

707
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,548
If you had to bet on him
or Dokey,

708
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,224
who would you bet on?

709
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,281
Dokey.

710
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,698
Okay, I missed something,
right?

711
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,007
<i>JOEY. For a moment</i>

712
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,874
<i>Tommy believed that</i>
<i>what he had done</i>

713
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,936
<i>might have been worth it.</i>

714
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,539
(CHATTERING)

715
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,583
Hey.

716
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,588
Jenny.

717
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,027
I was in here earlier
looking for you.

718
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,727
Tommy! Nine ball!

719
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,632
Me and you, partners.
I can't lose again tonight.

720
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,704
Makes one of us, Jimmy.

721
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,272
Maybe want to go outside
and talk.

722
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,735
Didn't we do that last night?

723
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,913
I know I hurt you last night,
I'm sorry.

724
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,877
You wanted something else,
I get it.

725
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,782
JIMMY: Tommy!
Come on, we need a fourth.

726
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,219
Jimmy, shut the hell up,
we're trying to
have a conversation!

727
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,189
I give up, don't shoot.

728
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,324
What?

729
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,498
What I did last night
was mean.

730
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,302
And stupid.

731
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,306
Did you sleep with him?

732
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,315
Yeah.

733
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,682
You could have lied to me.

734
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,227
Tommy.

735
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,730
I don't want to be the person
that I was last night.

736
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,768
I need a fresh start.

737
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,237
I need to not be married,

738
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,665
I need to not be with you,

739
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,342
I need to not be
with another guy
in order to get at you.

740
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,607
Jenny,

741
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,684
I don't want to hear it.

742
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,685
I mean, whatever you gotta do,
you should just do it.

743
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,781
Okay?

744
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,229
Guess I'll go then.

745
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,295
Good.

746
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,439
JIMMY:
You made the balls go back.

747
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,912
KEVIN: That was nice!
Oh! I got it!

748
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,140
(MEN CHEERING)

749
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,241
(PHONE RINGING)

750
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,518
Hey, Firecracker.

751
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,028
<i>Tommy, it's Kate.</i>

752
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,299
<i>I need you to come back.</i>

753
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,903
I came down here
after you left.

754
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,744
I thought maybe
I'd put it someplace else.

755
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,751
I've been in
and out of it so much
with all the arrangements.

756
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,716
Is there anything else
missing?

757
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,847
No.

758
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,449
How much was it?

759
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,126
It's not the money.

760
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,697
See, he can get into my house
any time he wants.

761
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,491
Who?

762
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,897
That bastard brother-in-law
of mine, Dokey.

763
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,435
Oh.
He has Huey's keys.

764
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:40,868
Says he doesn't,
but he does.

765
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,997
The two of them worked
down here.

766
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,269
So what do you
want me to do?

767
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,810
Change the locks.

768
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:48,879
TOMMY: Okay.

769
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,342
Can you do it tonight?
Uh-huh.

770
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,713
Find a place open,
not in the neighborhood.

771
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,184
Dokey owns
all the locksmiths.

772
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,686
Sure.

773
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,185
(CREAKING)

774
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,023
You hear that?

775
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,093
No, what?

776
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,520
Matty's crying.

777
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,172
Hey, it's okay, baby.

778
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,036
It's my fault, I should have
left your light on.

779
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,705
Okay?

780
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,241
Can I have a juice?

781
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,580
Okay.
But then it's back to bed.

782
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,915
You want something, Tommy?

783
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,316
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

784
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,764
Okay. Here you go.

785
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,765
I left the lights on
in the basement.

786
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,710
I saw what you did.

787
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,151
What?

788
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,380
But I won't tell.

789
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,395
<i>JOEY. Like I said,</i>

790
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,764
<i>it all comes down</i>
<i>to what you can live with.</i>

791
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,508
Hey, I could keep going.
