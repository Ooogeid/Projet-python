1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,235
You listenin'? Good.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,232
<i>Know how I told you Jenny's</i>
<i>dad's been actin' strange?</i>

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,397
What the hell
am I lookin' for?

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,601
<i>Well, he went out for a walk</i>
<i>but he never came back.</i>

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,374
<i>And Samson,</i>
<i>Jenny's one-night stand?</i>
<i>He won't get lost.</i>

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,208
<i>Neither will Nicky Cottero.</i>

7
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,375
<i>Nicky wanted to make Tommy</i>
<i>his partner</i>

8
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,385
<i>but then Jimmy showed up.</i>
Sorry I'm late.

9
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,886
<i>That went over well.</i>

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,083
<i>But Jimmy was always</i>
<i>the level-headed one.</i>

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,557
<i>Like with Bob the Mouth.</i>

12
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,923
<i>You know,</i>
<i>the guy with the waffle iron</i>

13
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,256
<i>Jimmy owed money to?</i>

14
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,791
<i>He learned his lesson.</i>

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,991
<i>Speakin' of lessons,</i>

16
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,466
<i>Sean's mom still wanted him</i>
<i>to get an education.</i>

17
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,559
<i>So he took up</i>
<i>the family trade.</i>

18
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,137
(GROANING)

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,298
<i>But what he didn't know was,</i>
<i>in this neighborhood,</i>

20
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,206
<i>the higher you learn,</i>
<i>the harder you fall.</i>

21
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,175
<i>McCARTHY. Sit up.</i>

22
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,314
Sit up!
And uncross your legs.

23
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,409
What? Do I have to?

24
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,250
Only if you don't wanna
get a kick in the balls.

25
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,851
Tell us about that first
meeting with Dokey Farrell.

26
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,084
Well, actually,
that's the only meeting

27
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,458
that they left me out of.

28
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,520
But I was there for
the first official meeting

29
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,155
with the brothers themselves.

30
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,356
Oh.

31
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,129
Yeah. It all started when
I was givin' the brothers

32
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,395
a bit of advice.

33
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,596
The perfect Orgasm is
Bailey's on the bottom,

34
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,866
peppermint schnapps on top.

35
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,811
It's good, right? Huh?

36
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,437
That didn't do
anything for me.

37
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,846
Give us a shot of tequila,
would ya?
All right.

38
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,215
We're all gonna die.

39
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,886
That's not a toast
I'm familiar with,

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,751
but what the hell.

41
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,951
Nicky's gonna kill Dokey.

42
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,818
And because I turned down the
deal he offered us yesterday,

43
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,022
Nicky's gonna kill us
right after that.

44
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,455
You turned it down?

45
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,361
I told him if he couldn't
work with you,

46
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,436
he couldn't work with me.

47
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,731
Okay.

48
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,638
Let Nicky come,
let him try.

49
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,172
No, he's not gonna try,
Jimmy, he's gonna do it.

50
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,276
Unless we make ourselves
a lot stronger

51
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,902
than we are right now.

52
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,570
Nicky's tryin' to kill us?

53
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,907
I say we kill him
and send a message.

54
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,350
What message, Kevin?

55
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,444
That we want the whole
Italian mob after us?

56
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,383
What we need to do
is get Dokey on our side.

57
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,547
Dokey?

58
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,421
So we'll be able
to use his money

59
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,726
and his connections
and his people.

60
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,425
Then, we'll be strong
enough to take on

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,092
the Italians
after they kill him.

62
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,699
I like it.

63
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,799
What I don't like
is you acting like

64
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,874
somebody I should listen to.

65
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,307
You got a better idea,
Jimmy, we'll do that.

66
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,208
When I do, I'll let you know.

67
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,537
Okay.

68
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,809
So we go see Dokey today?

69
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,043
Not you, Sean, you're out.

70
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,209
What?

71
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,813
No way, I'm with you.

72
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,685
Jimmy, if Sean's in,
we're not doin' this.

73
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,517
Sean, you're out.

74
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,857
Yeah, Sean, you're out.

75
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,026
You guys are really
gonna do this without me?

76
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,124
Go home.

77
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,497
You're still
the beverage manager.

78
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,298
I need you here in the morning
to open up the bar.

79
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,838
To hell with you, Jimmy.

80
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,874
If I'm not a part
of everything,

81
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,464
I'm not a part
of anything.

82
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,441
Run your own damn bar.

83
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,013
Joey, get us another round.

84
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,052
That mean I'm stayin'?

85
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,019
Just get the beers.

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,092
It was the high point
of my life.

87
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,218
Excuse me?

88
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,925
You just been invited
to get together with
a lot of people

89
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,058
who are gonna kill a lot
of other people

90
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,728
and that's the high point
of your life?

91
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,464
You haven't seen
the rest of my life.

92
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,807
From now on,

93
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,711
we only trust the people
in this room.

94
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,916
Tell me what else
you've been doin'.

95
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,357
Tell me everything.

97

IAN: Hey.

98
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,177
You done, you guys?
Yeah.

99
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,819
All right.

100
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,013
Dad!

101
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,753
Hey, babe.
What are you talkin' about,
"Hey, babe"?

102
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,226
Where have you been?

103
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,922
What are you,
my mother now?

104
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,295
Dad, you were gone
all day and all night.

105
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,731
Look at you,
you're all sunburned.

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,290
I went to Coney Island.

107
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,427
I'll get the grill,
you grab the counter.

108
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,266
Coney... What were you doing
in Coney Island?

109
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,933
I'm dating the lady
with the beard, okay?

110
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,306
Can we get to work now?
We got mouths to feed.

111
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,778
So we went to deal with Dokey.

112
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,749
And we told him how it was.

113
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,751
I thought you said
you weren't at
that meeting?

114
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,515
Well, no, it was Jimmy,
Tommy and Kevin.

115
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,352
I was doin'
more important things.

116
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,624
You know,
I could use a hand here.

117
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,830
(POURING WATER)

118
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,572
TOMMY: I know Jimmy's
acting crazy.

119
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,701
He's extorting from everybody
in the neighborhood,

120
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,571
and he has no intention
of stopping.

121
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,306
That sound about right, Jimmy?

122
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,613
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

123
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,813
So here's what
I think we're gonna do.

124
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,180
We keep Jimmy's business.

125
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,354
And we carve out
some territory of our own.

126
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,827
Did you bring me down here
to joke with me,

127
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,158
is that what this is?

128
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,630
Only the four blocks
where we live.

129
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,126
Let's face it, we have as
much right to it as you do.

130
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,671
You started doin' dope
like your junkie brother? Huh?

131
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,402
Give us one month.

132
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,935
We'll double the action
you got goin' now,

133
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,946
and kick back 30%.

134
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,203
Thirty percent?

135
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,580
We don't deliver,
you start swingin'.

136
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,219
What about you two idiots?

137
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,057
You gonna stay in line?

138
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,316
Hell, yeah, Doke.

139
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,521
Yeah.

140
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,394
All right.

141
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,558
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you your first job.

142
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,657
Got a friend downtown,
has a building

143
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,757
that needs clearing out.

144
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,860
In your territory.
Yeah.

145
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,868
And you bring me back my 30%,
we'll see how it goes.

146
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,909
All right?

147
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,342
Oh, one last thing.

148
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,016
You guys hear anything
about Bob Kelly?

149
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,608
Bob the Mouth?

150
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,654
I heard someone threw him
off his balcony.

151
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,051
That's what I heard.

152
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,258
If you hear anything else,
you let me know?

153
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,419
Sure.

154
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,688
We'll see how it goes.

155
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,028
EARL: I don't know why
we don't just kill them

156
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,536
and get this over with.

157
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,402
DOKEY: That's right.
We'll whack the four of them,

158
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,471
that'll make our councilman
friend very happy, right?

159
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,601
I'm just thinkin' the gimp.

160
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,645
He's the only one
with any balls.

161
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,944
You know, if you would find
Whitey like I asked you,

162
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,608
that's the way
we'll take care of Jimmy.

163
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,117
Where's Whitey?

164
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,483
We did Bob the Mouth
together, Tommy.

165
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,922
If he hurts me,
he hurts himself.

166
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,219
Give him some money.

167
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,226
Tell him to get out of the
city and never come back.

168
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,352
Whitey's not
gonna do that.

169
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,726
Sure he is.

170
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,698
Jimmy's gonna make him
understand he has to.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,262
I can do that.

172
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,602

Where's Whitey?

175
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,607
He didn't come home
last night, man.
Who are you?

353
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,124
What's Jimmy gonna say
when he finds out

354
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,285
you're givin' away the store?

355
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,727
Maybe I'll get lucky
and he'll fire me.

356
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,788
How you doin', Seanie?
Phenomenal.

357
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,060
Dog bites can
be really bad.

358
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,395
You're supposed
to get that swilled out

359
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,661
with a special
water solution.

360
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,194
You're supposed
to get a rabies shot.

361
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,896
Oh, don't do that.
They hurt.

362
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,665
Five pounds of top round.

363
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,636
Oh, is The Firecracker gonna
start servin' steak now?

364
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,872
It's to get the dog out.

365
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,413
Oh! Like bait.

366
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,914
I get it, you're gonna
put some drugs in it,

367
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,473
knock the dog out.

368
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,542
That'd be a great plan,

369
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,315
if only we had drugs.

370
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,852
How's it gonna work?

371
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,382
Guys?

372
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,848
You ready?

373
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,394
No, we really
ought to rethink this.

374
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,502
Thought Joey was faster
than that.

375
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,208
Okay, buddy.
Time to go.

376
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,849
Okay, I'm going,
get off my neck.

377
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,482
Empty. Joey!

378
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,084
Ground floor's clear.

379
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,355
Second floor's next.

380
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,626
Two more.
Mitchell Carr in 2D
and Beth Davies in 2A.

381
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,996
I'll take Beth.

382
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,592
Kevin, stay with Joey.
I'll get Carr.

383
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,338
What the hell
was that?

384
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,736
Boys better turn around.

385
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,901
Whatever the hell you're
after, it ain't gonna happen.

386
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,376
We're comin' up.

387
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,276
And we're gonna ask you all
to leave peacefully.

388
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,507
You don't have a right
to be here.

389
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,741
The hell we don't!

390
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,183
Oh, my God.

391
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,552
It's piss!

392
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,215
The guy just urinated on me.

393
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,949
You're dead, man!

394
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,188
Go, go, go, go.

395
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,825
Bad idea! Bad idea!

396
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,891
Go!
Bad idea! Bad idea!

397
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,508
We done here?

398
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,302
Any tenderness?

399
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,338
The son of a bitch
was choking me,

400
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,610
you don't think there's gonna
be a little tenderness?

401
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,848
What's your name?

402
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,823
Reilly. What's yours?

403
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:33,915
Mike.

404
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,290
Well, Mike,
I'd like to go
home now, please.

405
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,853
Not quite yet.

406
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,435
How about your daughter?

407
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,970
What about her?

408
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,198
What's her name?

409
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,636
Jenny.
Yeah?

410
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,675
Why?

411
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,038
You took a pretty good
shot to the head.

412
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,874
I just wanna make sure
there's no trauma.

413
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,573
What's your line of work?

414
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,508
I run a diner.

415
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,711
What's your best dish?
Beef stroganoff.

416
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,346
Either that
or the meatloaf.

417
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,055
What year is it?

418
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:11,885
Mr. Reilly?

419
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,993
You know what year it is?

420
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,136
Oh, I get it.

421
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,601
You want me
to say it's 1863

422
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,640
and Lincoln
is president, huh?

423
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,966
IAN: Okay, we're done here.

424
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,374
No, I still need
to do a CAT scan...

425
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,639
The hell you do.

426
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,977
Playing your damn tricks.
Dad.

427
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,380
What?
Nobody's playing any tricks.

428
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,610
There's nothing
wrong with me!

429
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,447
Yes! There is!

430
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,444
And we need to find out
what it is.

431
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,015
Please.

432
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,898
A little honesty
wouldn't hurt, fella.

433
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,012
Hey.

434
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,615
Hey! Samson, hi.

435
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,427
Oh, my God,
I heard what happened.

436
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,053
I went by the diner.

437
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,064
How's he doin'?
He's... He's fine.

438
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,690
It's going to be fine.

439
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,394
They got you waitin', huh?

440
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,436
Yeah, they're just
runnin' some tests.

441
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:26,795
Okay.

442
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,997
Well, I'll stay.

443
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,036
And make sure
you're all right.

444
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,134
No, we're fine.

445
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,769
You should go back to work.
Oh, no, it's okay.

446
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,972
When I heard what happened,

447
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,412
I took the rest
of the day off.

448
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,537
I'm all yours.

449
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,275
Thanks, but it's okay.

450
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,384
Jenny, your dad's hurt.

451
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,053
Where else would
I be but here?

452
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,524
You know, Samson,

453
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,102
I think I'd really rather
be alone with my dad.

454
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,228
Okay,

455
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,670
then I'll check in
with you later.

456
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:27,128
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

457
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,903
Yeah?

458
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,710
Okay.

459
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,174
I'll be right there, babe.

460
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,858
Where'd they all go?

461
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,863
They're all
in their apartments.

462
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,330
This is disgusting!

463
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,732
I don't care if that guy's
in a wheelchair,

464
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,428
I'm breakin' his legs.

465
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,868
You know, I should really be
gettin' back to the bar.

466
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,306
Sean's gonna miss me.

467
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,071
I'll take Carr,
you guys take 2A
down the hall.

468
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,554
Carr?

469
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,296
I'm comin' in, okay?

470
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,832
Let's talk about it.

471
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,099
Carr?

472
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,407
You want me out of here?

473
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,607
Come get me.

474
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,251
Somethin' tells me
that wouldn't be too smart.

475
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,513
Got that right.

476
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,888
Don't forget to put the door
back on your way out.

477
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,017
I didn't say
I was leaving.

478
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,391
Look,

479
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,690
the landlord's given you
enough time

480
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,025
to find a new space.

481
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,990
Plus you took
their money.

482
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,997
You're not here legally.

483
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,563
Guy like you,
that should mean somethin'.

484
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,236
DOKEY: Hey, Whitey.

485
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,370
Whitey! Come on, wake up.

486
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,245
How ya doin', buddy?

487
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,652
Not so good.

488
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,823
I want you to say hello
to Detective Deckle.

489
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,322
Hi.

490
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,192
Bye.

491
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,136
DOKEY: Did you see his face?

492
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,274
Yeah.

493
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,898
I want you to
remember it, okay?

494
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,705
Because he's going
to the 18th right now.

495
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,847
And when you get there...
When I get there?

496
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,644
When you get there,

497
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,880
I want you to tell him
that you saw Jimmy Donnelly

498
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,882
throw Bob Kelly
off the balcony,
all right?

499
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,390
God. I would love to help you,

500
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,790
but that's crazy,
you're talkin' crazy.

501
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,759
Earl, do me a favor
and open up his door.

502
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,160
You know, you can go.

503
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,568
Jimmy Donnelly's
gonna kill you.

504
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,334
What are you
talkin' about, man?

505
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,465
I didn't tell you anything.

506
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,941
What do you think that junkie
broad is doin' right now?

507
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,576
Right now,
she's probably
tellin' Jimmy

508
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,912
how the cops came in
and dragged you out
of her house.

509
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:35,009
And you think
Jimmy Donnelly trusts you

510
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,580
not to say anything?

511
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,691
This is really uncool.
Yeah?

512
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,393
Go on, get out of my car.

513
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,519
Go.

514
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,799
Let's go, Earl!

515
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,633
Sure, I took that check.

516
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,768
Then I saw what they
were movin' me into.

517
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,330
No ramps, no elevator.

518
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,176
They were nice enough
to put in shag carpets.

519
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,736
Try rollin' around
in one of these things
on a shag carpet.

520
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,471
I sent back their check.

521
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,682
It's not my fault
they didn't want it.

522
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,844
You sent back their check?

523
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,786
I look like somebody
who enjoys repeatin' himself?

524
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,958
You see that wheelchair access
out front?

525
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,720
Yeah.
My friend and I built that.

526
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,788
You see that kitchen?
Those appliances?

527
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,592
I custom-fit them myself.

528
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,958
To tell you the truth,
I'm too tired to do it again.

529
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,899
Look, man...
No, no, no,
don't talk to me, okay?

530
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,163
Just get out.

531
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,738
I got my books here.

532
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,296
I got a market a block away,

533
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,672
a park where I play chess.
This is me.

534
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,271
Ain't nobody takin' it away
from me.

535
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,780
After tonight, you're gonna
be the only one in here.

536
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,040
No electricity,
no water, no heat.

537
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,177
It's been like that
for a while.
It's not a problem.

538
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,221
You in the war?

539
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,691
Iraq?

540
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,029
What the hell do you care?

541
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,735
You're a vet.

542
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,136
Just shut up.

543
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,204
Kevin burned his hand
on a bottle rocket.

544
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,076
Tommy, get some ice!

545
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,739
Here we go.
Have a seat, it's okay.

546
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,349
Here, have a seat.

547
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,611
Let's see.

548
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,381
Okay, okay.
It's just a burn.

549
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,510
Tommy!

550
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,884
Here you go.

551
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,549
Now, just take the ice
with the other hand,

552
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,354
rub it around.
Rub, rub, rub.

553
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,753
That a boy.

554
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,456
What the hell were you doin'
with a bottle rocket?

555
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,055
That's what
Fourth of July's for,
isn't it?

556
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,395
What are those nuns
teaching you guys?

557
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,025
All right.
Boys sit down, come on.

558
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,660
Have a seat, everyone.

559
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,106
Keep rubbin', keep rubbin',
you're gonna be fine.

560
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,234
So, people think
the Fourth of July
is about fireworks

561
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,144
and hot dogs
and block parties, huh?

562
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,282
All I'm saying is,

563
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,812
I wanna try
to help you.

564
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,220
What, because I'm a vet?

565
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,686
I should kick your ass
right now.

566
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,419
Don't nobody care about me
bein' no vet.

567
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,018
I parked my Humvee
in the wrong place,

568
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,585
son of a bitch blew up.

569
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,024
Now I'm just another cripple.

570
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,127
Don't give me
no patriotic crap,

571
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,363
'cause I don't
wanna hear it.

572
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,731
If somebody
owed me somethin',

573
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,670
I'd have had it already.

574
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,142
Okay.

575
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,777
If what you're tellin' me
is true,

576
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,475
if they didn't buy
you out already,

577
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,982
then I'll make sure
they leave you alone.

578
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,014
If not,

579
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,680
then I guess I got
a fight on my hands.

580
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,249
Buddy, you try and come back
in here, you're a dead man!

581
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,526
Just understand that!

582
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,535
I was just on
my way to help.

583
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,196
How'd it go with that maniac
in the wheelchair?

584
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,863
Leave him alone.

585
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,099
Tell Kevin to
clear out the rest.

586
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,203
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

587
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,978
What took you so long
to get here?

588
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,746
What did the cops say?

589
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,719
Did you get high?

590
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,282
You bastard.

591
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,618
You got high without me.

592
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,556
Joanie, I'm gonna boot you
all over this apartment

593
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,787
if you don't tell me
what they said.

594
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,988
They didn't say anything.
They just took him!

595
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,155
Where?
I don't know.

596
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,824
Wait, they did
say one thing.

597
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,732
They asked Whitey
about some guy,

598
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,201
Bob something.

599
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,238
Bob Kelly?

600
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,397
Yeah.

601
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,335
Oh, wait, no.

602
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,674
Was that that guy,
Bob the Mouth,
you told me about?

603
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,344
I told you about that?

604
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,244
Yeah, we got high one night

605
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,649
and you did
a whole re-enactment.

606
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,580
I never told you about that.

607
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,381
Maybe Whitey did.

608
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,352
What was he doin' here?

609
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,124
Jimmy, Whitey's
a skeevy little rat.

610
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,391
He's gonna give you up!

611
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,864
What was he doin' here,
Joanie?

612
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,764
He was gettin' high.

613
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,305
And he was nice enough
to give you some?

614
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,671
What are you talkin' about,
Jimmy? I hate Whitey.

615
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,141
Yeah, right.

616
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,242
When he gets back here,
call me.
Jimmy, wait.

617
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,905
You keep him here.
Jimmy, wait.

618
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,610
Jimmy!
You can at least
do that, right?

619
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,752
You told me they were all
scumbags and squatters.

620
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,687
This guy's a war vet
in a wheelchair.

621
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:05,985
He returned the check
you sent him.

622
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,389
I have no idea
if he returned the check.

623
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,688
If he did, I'll find out.

624
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,750
The point is,
you were gonna send him

625
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,057
to a place
where he couldn't live.

626
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,358
Couldn't exist.

627
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,625
He's in a wheelchair.

628
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,291
I didn't know that.

629
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,802
Nobody told me that.

630
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,564
You tell me what the guy needs
and I'll take care of it.

631
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,502
You just get him out.

632
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:27,843
Here's $500.

633
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,706
That'll pay for a hotel
for the night.

634
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:32,943
You give me a list
of the guy's needs,

635
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,076
and I'll take care of it.

636
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,347
I'll get him
whatever he wants.

637
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,391
MAN: That's it.
Now it's gone on too long.

638
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,057
He's owed me this money
over a month,

639
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,794
goin' on, you know,
and every time I see him
on the street,

640
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,336
he acts like I never...
He's been wantin'
to pay me back...

641
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,896
It's crazy,
he's tryin' to make
a jerk out of me.

642
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,511
You know,
I hate to do this over money.
Okay, everybody out.

643
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,672
I'm serious, drink up.
Last call.

644
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,213
Okay, never mind,
don't drink up,
I'm kickin' you out.

645
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,270
What are you
talkin' about?

646
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,338
Last call is, like,
nine hours from now.

647
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,248
No more Firecracker today.
Out.

648
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,317
Thank you.

649
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,313
Bye.

650
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,124
Hi.

651
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,362
Oh, hey.

652
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,440
I know you.
You sold me the jukebox.

653
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,065
I wanted to bring you
another CD package.

654
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,368
Are you closin' up?

655
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,605
No! No, no.

656
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,044
No, come on in.

657
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,881
Matter of fact,
drinks are on
the house today.

658
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,614
Wow!
The place looks great.

659
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,512
Last time I was here,
it didn't look like this.

660
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,022
I did that.

661
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,853
How you doin'?

662
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,661
I'm Nicky Cottero.

663
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,826
This is Vinnie.

664
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,402
Hi.

665
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,768
Give me a second.

666
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,638
Your name
is Trish Hughes.

667
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,337
You're chief of staff
to councilman Jack Trevor.

668
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,507
You live on Greenwich.

669
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,311
Pretty little brownstone,
right?

670
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,580
Where for a month you've had
concrete crews from Local 19

671
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,019
and carpenters
from Local 603 working.

672
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,580
The fact that the city

673
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,989
thinks that these workers

674
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,187
are puttin' up
a local high school

675
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,827
might not be a good thing.

676
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,792
I'm thinkin' five years.

677
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,362
But more importantly
than that,

678
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,602
is all the ambition
that you've got.

679
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,473
That's all gone.

680
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,235
Now, I'm gonna keep
all that to myself,

681
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,404
but I'm gonna need
somethin' from you.

682
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,573
Okay.

683
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,582
Jack Trevor,

684
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,084
Al Onataro,

685
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,350
and Derek Farrell,
they're all doin'
business together.

686
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:54,786
I wanna know
what they're doin',

687
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,759
when it started,
where it's goin'.

688
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,465
Meet me at the 40 Deuce club
tomorrow, noon.

689
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,390
Lunch is on me.

690
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,565
Go to hell.

691
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:09,731
I'm calling Trevor.

692
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,138
Go ahead.
Call him up.

693
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,939
You know what? Invite him
to the club tomorrow.

694
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:17,539
But you better hope
that he loves you
one hell of a lot.

695
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,944
'Cause if he thinks
that for a moment

696
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,949
you're gonna give me
what I want,

697
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,280
you know what he's gonna do?

698
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,478
He's gonna take you

699
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,385
to a nice, romantic dinner
by the seaside,

700
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,515
where there's no sea,

701
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,751
no side,

702
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:32,120
just a hole in the ground
that's waiting for you.

703
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,862
I'm not giving you
any information,

704
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,459
so I've got nothing
to worry about.

705
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,832
Kiss your boyfriend goodbye.

706
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,110

in the can for embezzlement.

707
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,546
That was good.

708
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,953
We'll see.

709
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,723
Will you get out
of here, please?

710
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,856
Why?

711
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,932
I can't go
when you're lookin'.

712
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,296
Tommy said to
leave that guy alone.

713
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,370
Look, I don't care
what Tommy says.

714
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,232
He did it to me,
I'm doin' it to him.

715
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,001
It's the principle
of the thing!

716
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,043
Joey! If you don't
turn around right now,

717
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,475
I'm gonna piss
all over you.

718
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,044
Thank you.

719
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,313
Hey.
IAN: Hear anything yet?

720
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,882
No, I thought the doctor was
still here. I'll go check.

721
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,816
No, no. Don't bother.

722
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:32,787
Come sit with me.

723
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,531
I'm sorry
I scared you yesterday.

724
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,802
Just so you know,
I am not dating
that bearded lady.

725
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,406
Kind of lost it
for a while.

726
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,949
It occurred to me...

727
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,686
I'm on the D train.

728
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,713
How the hell
did that happen?

729
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,051
And I look up
and I'm at Coney Island.

730
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,920
It's all different
out there now

731
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,226
from when your mother and I
used to take you there.

732
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,700
Remember The Twister?

733
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,066
Oh, how you loved that.

734
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,902
And the Cyclone.

735
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,505
I went on that.

736
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,050
And that arcade
where they shoot
the ducks and the...

737
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,856
food emporium where
they made that fudge.

738
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,362

to the doctor,

No.

744
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:00,666
Why?

745
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,375
We both know what it is.

746
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,447
I've got Alzheimer's.

747
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,185
I don't need a doctor
to tell me that.

748
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,658

761
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,159
Yeah.

762
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,705
Yeah.

764
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,743
They didn't get anything.

765
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,510
What'd they ask about?

766
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,980
Well, they asked about us
killin' Bob.

767
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,209
But I didn't say anything.

768
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,682
I don't believe you.
Oh.

769
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,518

been gone already, right?

00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,683

Is this about Joanie?

773
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,091
No. But I'd kill you

I really don't
wanna talk about it.

00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,085
To let me know, you know.

821
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,591
I've been worried.

822
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:26,058
Samson... Thank you.
Thanks for the concern, but...

823
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,173
I really need
to close up now.
So...

824
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,870
Why are you
doing this to me?

825
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,010
What did you say?

826
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,843
Whatever I did,
I'll change.

827
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:43,842
Just tell me what to do.
