1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
Previously on Swingtown:

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,600
Office pool on who'll be the
first to bag the hot new runner.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,700
Which trader
are you married to?

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,400
Uh, Bruce Miller.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,800
He's one of the good ones.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,100
- You're my teacher.
- I'm not your teacher anymore.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,300
Corporate is forcing me
to make cutbacks at every level,

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,800
but I wish you luck
wherever you end up.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,900
I got fired today.

10
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:19,900
Janet doesn't know.

11
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,806
You don't do well alone, Tom.

12
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,505
- Luke?!
- I can't believe it!

13
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:24,707
Tom doesn't have to know.

14
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:27,102
My wife and I are
a package deal, Luke.

15
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:36,203
Now, don't go corrupting
our Oriental friends, Rex.

16
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:39,603
You'll give the old U.S. of A
a bad reputation.

17
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,502
Japanese sure do have
peculiar taste in music,

18
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:00,902
don't you think?

19
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:03,100
Now how's a girl
supposed to dance to this?

20
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,201
Oh, I don't know.

21
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:06,001
I dig a little variety
now and then.

22
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:07,703
Spice of life, right?

23
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:09,403
So tell me,

24
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:11,601
what kind of variety are
you looking for tonight?

25
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,803
Hey, T-bone, pass over
that ice bucket, would you?

26
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:16,503
Oh.

27
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:20,302
I'll just make a little
run to the ice machine.

28
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:23,101
Oh, just when things
were heating up.

29
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:25,500
You hurry back, Captain.

30
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,100
Oh, hey, grab
that, would you?

31
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:30,600
I think the others might
be trying to find the room.

32
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:37,103
Captain Decker's room.

33
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:38,600
Y'all looking
for the party?

34
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:41,700
No, I'looking for my husband.

35
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:42,703
Trina?!

36
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,902
Hi, sweets.
It's Bobbi.

37
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:46,602
I gathered.

38
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,401
Uh, Tom just stepped out
for a teeny weeny moment.

39
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:51,103
May I give
him a message?

40
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,003
No, thanks.

41
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,101
I'll give it to him myself
when he gets home.

42
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:57,600
Okay, hon.
You take care, now.

43
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,302
They're saying
check the fuse box.

44
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:24,302
The fuse is fine.

45
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:25,800
It's this piece of crap
air conditioner

46
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:27,102
that's not working.

47
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:29,503
Can you send someone out?

48
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:33,701
Okay.
Thank you.

49
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,000
They're all backed up
because of the heat wave,

50
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:38,302
and no one's available
for two weeks. 

51
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:39,401
Two weeks?

52
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:40,202
I'll call around,

53
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,103
see if I can get someone
else to come out.

54
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:44,501
Well, if not, I'll pick up
a new one this weekend.

55
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:46,500
God, this weather
is ridiculous.

56
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:50,601
I just got out of the shower,and
I'm already sweating like a pig.

57
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:52,203
At least you'll
smell nice.

58
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,203
Finally opened the Paco Rabane
I gave you last Christmas.

59
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,903
It's a defensive measure.

60
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:58,400
I'm on the trading floor,

61
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:01,302
bumping up against
50 sweaty guys all day.

62
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:02,801
Poor Melinda.

63
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:04,900
I hope you've been
keeping an eye out for her.

64
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:06,000
Uh, yeah,
as a matter of fact.

65
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,003
We've been meeting
before the bell

66
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,803
so I can teach her
how to work the market.

67
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:12,001
Really? That's
nice of you.

68
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:12,803
Well, it's no big deal.

69
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,800
You know, she wants
to step up, asked for my help.

70
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:16,803
A woman trader--
that's rare, isn't it?

71
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:19,003
Well, if any girl's
got a shot, it's Melinda.

72
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:21,603
You know,
she's smart, tough.

73
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:24,001
Pretty, too.

74
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,201
Well, yeah,
that's not gonna hurt her.

75
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,703
You know,she could have a bright future
if she plays her cards right.

76
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:32,101
One of the good ones.

77
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,203
Huh?

78
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,201
That's what she said
about you

79
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:37,000
at the benefit last week.

80
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:38,900
I'm just trying
to help the kid out.

81
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:42,300
Man, I am sweating
right through this thing.

82
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:45,102
I got to change
my shirt.

83
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,901
May I have your attention, please?

84
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:52,802
Where you heading?

85
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,501
To pick up the wallpaper
that I ordered.

86
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:56,701
Thought I'd get started
on the living room.

87
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:58,201
It's gonna be
105 degrees.

88
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,403
Why don't we just hire
a couple of guys to do it?

89
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,502
Because I want
to do it myself.

90
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:04,403
Do you even know how?

91
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:06,402
The only way
to learn is to do it.

92
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:09,103
Suit yourself, but I'm on record
as saying you're crazy.

93
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:10,501
Hey, there, you two.

94
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:12,901
Hey, Rog.

95
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:14,202
- Hot enough for you?
- Uh, Susan,

96
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,200
I'm headed over
to Marshall Fields to cool off

97
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,402
and, uh, pick up Roger
some new work shirts.

98
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:19,800
Oh, I got plenty of shirts.

99
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,602
New job deserves a new look.

100
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,103
Roger got a promotion.

101
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,402
- You don't say?
- Congrats, buddy!

102
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:27,502
It's not that big a deal.

103
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,301
Don't be so modest.

104
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:29,800
He marched right
into Mr. Stone's office

105
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,203
and demanded more money.

106
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:32,301
And got it.

107
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,102
It's pretty gutsy
in this economy.

108
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,503
I'd have shot you down.

109
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:36,300
So, Susan, what do you say--

110
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:37,800
you want to carpool to the mall?

111
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,403
Actually,I have some things I have
to take care of around the house,

112
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,700
but I'll take a rain check.

113
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:42,601
- All right.
- Come on, Rog.

114
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:43,900
- See you tonight.
- Bye.

115
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:51,101
I am so proud of him.

116
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,603
Things are finally
looking up.

117
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:54,302
Who knows?

118
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,301
Maybe we'll be neighbors
again soon.

119
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:58,401
Nothing would
make me happier.

123
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:28,902
Your breakfast, sir.

124
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,500
Now what you want to do is keep
an eye out for repeating trends.

125
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,903
Well-structured companies tend
to perform well over time.

126
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:38,300
- And bad ones?
- Uh, they trend down.

127
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,701
Same applies to people, I guess.

128
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:44,100
Yeah,and I'd say stock in
Melinda,Inc. is on a steady rise.

129
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,700
Maybe the guys will start
another office pool over me.

130
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,402
Oh, they're all morons.

131
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,701
So, what's your story?

132
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,300
How'd a nice guy
like Bruce Miller end up

133
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:53,400
in a racket like this?

134
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:56,402
I got married when I
was still just a kid.

135
00:05:56,407 --> 00:06:01,700
All I had was a diploma
and a job pumping gas.

136
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:04,202
Everybody thought I'd do
that the rest of my life.

137
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,302
It's funny. My mom always said
I'd end up with that guy.

138
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,502
How'd you turn it around?

139
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:13,100
Well, I had this one regular
at the gas station.

140
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,601
He drove this-this
cherried-out Caddy.

141
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,003
He used to tip me five bucks
every time he filled up.

142
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,200
One day, we
got to talking,

143
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,400
and he told me he was
a top dog at the Merc.

144
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:23,206
So next time he came in,

145
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,905
I pulled out all these fives
I'd been saving,

146
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:28,407
and I asked him to invest it
in his favorite stock.

147
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:30,200
And he told me he'd
do me one better,

148
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,801
and he hired me as a
runner on the exchange.

149
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:37,902
You know,I learned the most valuable
lesson right there in that day.

150
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:39,000
What's that?

151
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:42,200
It's all about relationships.

152
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:46,203
Between people,
numbers, the news.

153
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:50,101
All you got to do is figure out
how all the pieces are connected.

154
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:51,500
On the trading floor.

155
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,103
And in life.

156
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:56,002
Uh, the bell
goes off in 20.

157
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:57,202
Think you're ready?

158
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:59,202
- Let's do it.
- Great.

159
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,401
Why are you dressed
like a rodeo clown?

160
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,402
I'm hanging wallpaper.

161
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,801
It's messy.

162
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,000
You have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

163
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,203
Nope.

164
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:16,401
Okay.

165
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,201
Good luck.

166
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:19,701
Laurie?

167
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,103
Congratulations.

168
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,203
You must have really impressed
your philosophy teacher

169
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,203
with your oral report
last week.

170
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:27,702
Your summer school
grades came in.

171
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,401
All As.

172
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,103
I'm really proud of you.

173
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:32,801
Thanks.

174
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:34,702
Off to the beach?

175
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:36,303
Softball, actually.

176
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:37,501
With who?

177
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:38,600
Logan?

178
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,501
Logan's ancient history.

179
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,001
Oh.

180
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,901
Someone else special, then?

181
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,402
Yeah... I think...

182
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:49,000
maybe.

183
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:52,903
You're-You're not going
to tell me who?

184
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:57,801
I don't want to jinx it.

185
00:07:58,606 --> 00:07:59,802
Fair enough.

186
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:01,502
Whoever it is,

187
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:03,202
have a good time.

188
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,303
You worked really hard
all summer.

189
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,700
You deserve to get out there
and enjoy what's left of it.

190
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,203
That my girl?

191
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,001
Hey.

192
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:29,500
How was the trip?

193
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,402
Pretty much the old
in and out.

194
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,803
Chicago, Tokyo,
Tokyo, Chicago.

195
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:35,501
Where have 
you been?

196
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:36,800
I was a little worried
about you.

197
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,301
I went down to the lake,
took some shots of sun came up

198
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:41,803
Decided to stay a while.

199
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,902
Oh, your old Nikon.
You got the itch again, huh?

200
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:48,503
Yeah.After dusting off those old slides
with Luke last week.

201
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,801
Need something to keep me
occupied while you were gone.

202
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,103
A problem you
and I don't seem to share.

203
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:57,003
What is that
supposed to mean?

204
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,603
Hi.

205
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:07,100
Oh, looks like we're both
sliding into some old patterns.

206
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:08,901
O'Hare was 100 degrees,

207
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,700
so I invited the
crew over for a dip.

208
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:11,701
I didn't think
you'd mind.

209
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:15,802
Well, would have been nice
if you'd checked in first.

210
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:17,901
Or do we not
do that anymore?

211
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,101
I called when we landed.

212
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:22,503
What's going on?

213
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,900
Hmm. I rang your room
last night.

214
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:27,301
Bobbi answered.

215
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:30,402
Now she's in my house...
in a bikini.

216
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,202
All right, I
slipped a little.

217
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,800
You slept with her,
didn't you?

218
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,200
Hey, in my defense,
Bobbi's on the list,

219
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:41,201
and very hard
to resist.

220
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:43,500
Remember that
layover in Dallas?

221
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:44,900
That was five years ago.

222
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,901
We were all
on the same crew then.

223
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,201
This is exactly
what I was worried about.

224
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,501
Oh, you can't seriously tell
me you're jealous of Bobbi.

225
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:57,002
You don't get to tell me
how I feel right now.

226
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,702
Uh, I'm sorry.

227
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,400
If you want, I will
ask her to leave.

228
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:06,000
No, don't.

229
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,602
You want to have a pool party?

230
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,701
Let's have a pool party.

231
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:28,502
Nice hit.

232
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,400
Laurie, you made it.

233
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:31,102
What can I say?

234
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:33,503
I'm a sucker for a guy
in a baseball uniform.

235
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:36,101
So why aren't
you in one?

236
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:38,101
Uh, because
this is softball.

237
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:40,301
Disappointing.

238
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:41,702
Well, I'm sorry.

239
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,400
How can I redeem myself?

240
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:46,201
You might have to hit
a homerun next at bat.

241
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:47,602
Or at least a double.

242
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:48,803
Double? I think
I can manage that.

243
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:50,401
Game's just
getting started here.

244
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:56,603
Safe

245
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,600
Thompson residence.

246
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,003
This is she.

247
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:13,100
What kind of problem?

248
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,102
Well, that's impossible.

249
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:17,703
Yeah, I'll call our banker.

250
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,103
I'm sure this is all
just a big misunderstanding.

251
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,702
Okay,
bye-bye.

252
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,501
Uh, hello,
Mr. Talbott?

253
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:32,700
Janet Thompson.

254
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,602
Well, not so good, I'm afraid.

255
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,802
Uh, I just received a most
upsetting phone call from Marshall Fields.

256
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:41,603
Apparently, someone at your bank,
uh,neglected to clear my check.

257
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,800
I don't understand.
My husband should've made a deposit

258
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,602
on Friday, same as always.

259
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:50,201
I see.

260
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:53,903
No, of course, I'll-I'll speak
to him right away.

261
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:56,200
Thank you, bye-bye.

262
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:24,402
- Roger?
- Hey, Susan.

263
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,901
I think we need to talk.

264
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:53,002
You're looking good, Rex.

265
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,003
Back at you, Trina.

266
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:59,003
That a vintage SLR
you got there?

267
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,702
- You're a shutterbug?
- Amateur.

268
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:03,802
My mom used to freelance
for National Geographic 

269
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:04,701
while I was growing up.

270
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:05,701
I never knew that.

271
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,900
Yeah, yeah, she was
a real trailblazer.

272
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:09,502
She used to take me
wither everywhere.

273
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,300
Iceland, the Congo...

274
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:13,803
It's why I
became a pilot.

275
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:16,202
Always looking for the
next great escape.

276
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:16,901
Huh.

277
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:19,803
Keeps life interesting.

278
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:20,602
Sure does.

279
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:26,500
Pour me something tall and cool.

280
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:28,100
Here you go.

281
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,602
Thank you,captain

282
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,400
Trouble in paradise?

283
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:41,502
Oh, well, I think you
know the answer to that.

284
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:44,402
Guess I should've told you Trina
called last night, huh?

285
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,601
Yeah, but it's not your fault--
I'm the one that messed up.

286
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:49,502
I just assumed you and Trina
still have an open relationship

287
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:50,403
We do

288
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,601
Maybe I just don't understand
y'all's rules.

289
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:56,503
And right now,
you're not the only one.

290
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,903
It's been five days, Roger.

291
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:07,501
You're not being fair
to Janet.

292
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:08,303
I know.

293
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,101
Then, why haven't you
told her?

294
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:16,403
Well,I had an old friend pull some strings,
got me an interview over at All-State.

295
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:18,003
That's where I was headed
this morning.

296
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:20,703
Thought if I could
get a job lined up,

297
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:22,703
maybe it'd soften
the blow a little.

298
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:24,100
They didn't offer you the job?

299
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm not even sure I'd want it
if they had.

300
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,102
I mean, it's the same old thing
I was doing,

301
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:31,603
just less money,
at a stuffier company.

302
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:34,103
Why don't you tell Janet
that-that you're looking

303
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,803
for something
more personally satisfying?

304
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:38,103
Janet would get that.

305
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:39,501
I don't think so.

306
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,303
I mean, ever since
you moved away

307
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:44,001
she's had this need to
keep up with the Jones.

308
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,103
That's ridiculous.

309
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,702
That's easy for you to say.

310
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,501
You're the Jones.

311
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:55,402
So what are you gonna do,
you're gonna let her just...

312
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,202
drop you at the train station
every morning

313
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:01,000
and pretend to go to work until
they come and take your house away?

314
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:05,203
That's not a very good plan,
is it?

315
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,703
Janet is not as fragile
as you think.

316
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:12,603
She just might surprise you.

317
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:19,500
Can I use your phone?

318
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:22,002
It's right there.

319
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:44,101
Doesn't look like she's there

320
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,001
But...

321
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:51,402
while I'm coming clean,
I think you should know

322
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:54,402
there is another reason why I walked
all the way over here 

323
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:56,402
to see you
in this heat.

324
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,800
What's that?

325
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:03,803
Well, I could've sworn you guys
had air-conditioning.

326
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:08,902
There's a window unit upstairs,
but it's broken.

327
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:09,700
Want me
to take a look at it?

328
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:11,203
I'm kind of handy that way.

329
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:14,700
You're just procrastinating
talking to Janet, aren't you?

330
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,403
Maybe. Yeah, a little.
Okay, but since she's not home,

331
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:21,200
I might as well make myself
useful somewhere.

332
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:23,002
Come on.

333
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:30,201
So, how many innings do they
play in 16-inch softball?

334
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,501
Uh, full nine.

335
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,900
I thought maybe since the ball
was twice as big,

336
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:35,400
they'd make the game
half as long.

337
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:36,801
Are you bored already?

338
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,602
'Cause I could fake
a sprained ankle, and...

339
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:40,500
we could go to the
Art Institute, if you want.

340
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:41,700
I'm fine.

341
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,400
Hey, Stephens.

342
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:44,300
Want a beer?

343
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:47,000
Um, no, I'm all right,
thank you.

344
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:49,503
- Hey, Doug!
- Yeah, go play, Stephens.

345
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,503
We'll take care
of your girlfriend for you.

346
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,202
Laurie,
this is Liz.

347
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,300
Do not listen to a word
she has to say, all right?

348
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:56,602
Probably
good advice.

349
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:01,403
So, you're the
new girl, huh?

350
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,503
Is that what he told you?

351
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:06,200
When it comes to his love life,
Doug's not much of a talker.

352
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,702
If you want to talk governing
principles of existence,

353
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:09,900
you can't get
him to shut up.

354
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:13,100
I'm sure you've seen his massive
collection of books and essays.

355
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:15,700
Actually, I haven't been
to his apartment yet.

356
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:17,300
It's practically
a library.

357
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,300
So, I'm gonna guess
you two met at school.

358
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,100
Why is that?

359
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,103
Doug only goes for smart girls.

360
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:26,200
Grad or
undergrad?

361
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:28,203
Um... under.

362
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:33,300
- Nice catch, Doug.
- Do you want to grab a seat?

363
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:34,502
Sure.

364
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:48,103
I'm so sorry,
Mrs.Thompson.

365
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:49,803
Mr. Stone is in a
budget meeting.

366
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:51,401
It might go a while.

367
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,403
You can't just tell a person
her husband's been fired

368
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:55,203
without some sort
of explanation.

369
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,803
I have no idea
where Roger is,

370
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:59,303
and I am not leaving here
until I get some answers.

371
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:02,400
Let Mr. Stone know I'll wait
for him until he is available.

372
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:04,201
I'm afraid you
can't do that.

373
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,401
My husband has worked
for this company for 12 years.

374
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:10,203
Was he not punctual?

375
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:11,900
Did-did he not dress
well enough?

376
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:13,601
No, Roger
was a very good salesman.

377
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:15,200
Well, perhaps there
was some kind of scandal, then.

378
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,300
No, of course not.

379
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,203
People don't just get fired
for no reason.

380
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,900
Surely, you must have some idea.

381
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:29,400
Mr. Stone was forced to cut back half
the department in the last six months.

382
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:33,303
As far as I know, Roger
was laid off, plain and simple.

383
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:36,201
Then, why wouldn't he
just tell me that?

384
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:39,901
Don't you think that's a question
for your husband to answer?

385
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:43,500
Evidently not.

386
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:44,502
Thank you, Doreen.

387
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:47,001
Good luck, Mrs. Thompson.

388
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:49,601
I'm sure Roger
will land on his feet.

389
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:57,900
You always close a good day
with a smooth single malt.

390
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:59,000
What about
the bad days?

391
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,400
Try three or four.

392
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,101
Uh, two Glenlivets, neat.

393
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:07,202
You were great this afternoon.

394
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:09,303
Kept a cool head all
the way to close.

395
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:13,702
So, what was the biggest lesson
of today?

396
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:15,300
Always keep your antennae up.

397
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,600
Read the right players,
you'll read the market.

398
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:19,700
So, who'd you have your eye on
in the pit?

399
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:21,201
You, like everybody else.

400
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:22,302
Okay.

401
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:24,702
Who was I watching?

402
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:25,800
Rattigan.

403
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:27,103
Makes the market
for United Airlines.

404
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:28,300
Exactly.

405
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:29,902
Guess what?

406
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:31,803
I'm still
watching him.

407
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,701
Table by the wall, gold jacket.

408
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,900
Who's that with him?

409
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:39,503
Malloy, Boeing specialist
for Waterhouse.

410
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:43,400
What do you think,
happy accident?

411
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:44,700
Think they're making a play?

412
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,903
Bingo.

413
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:49,002
The question is,
what kind of play?

414
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:51,201
Doesn't matter.

415
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,900
Tomorrow at the open,
we'll watch both stocks.

416
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:54,200
If either one breaks up
or down,

417
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:55,700
we'll see it first
and catch the wave.

418
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:58,301
It's always better
to be lucky than smart...

419
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,702
but it is best to be both.

420
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:05,100
Hey, kids, getting a
little poker game going.

421
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,201
Interested?

422
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:10,600
Yeah, sure, Mareno.

423
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,203
Deal us in.

424
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:17,701
No.

425
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:19,703
- Go ahead and sit down.
- Over here?

426
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:22,401
- Yeah.
- Okay, just anywhere?

427
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:25,702
Well, back against the thing,
I think, would be nice.

428
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:27,301
Okay, now behave.

429
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:29,003
Here's your problem.

430
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:31,601
Dirty thermostat--
can't connect to the compressor.

431
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:33,803
Okay, how did you know that?

432
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,601
I spent a year at UIC--
pre-engineering.

433
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:40,202
Hold on, you...
you went to college?

434
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:42,200
Don't act so surprised.

435
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,601
No, I...

436
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,202
You never mentioned it before.

437
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,700
It was before I knew Janet.

438
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:50,501
Anyway,I never finished,so it's not
a whole lot to crow about.

439
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:55,001
Okay.
Here we go.

440
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,603
What happened?

441
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:21,803
Is it a fuse?

442
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:23,103
I don't know,
might be a transformer.

443
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,300
Sometimes they'll blow
from too much strain.

444
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:29,700
The phone's
still working.

445
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:37,101
- Hello?
- Hi, Susan.

446
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:38,601
Hi, Bruce.

447
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,102
The power's out down here.

448
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:41,903
Yeah, the power's out here, too.

449
00:21:41,908 --> 00:21:44,503
Well, it might be a while before
the trains start running again.

450
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:46,301
Uh, you... do you want me
to come get you?

451
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:47,601
No, no.

452
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,300
Yeah,if it's not back on in
a few hours,I'll just grab a cab.

453
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:54,400
You sure?

454
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:55,901
- Yeah, I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

455
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:03,402
The power's out downtown, too.

456
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,200
Something must've tripped
the whole grid.

457
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:09,900
Lots of cars at the Deckers.

458
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:12,802
Maybe Tom and Trina
are having a pool party.

459
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:17,500
You're wasting your time, Tom,
power's out.

460
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

461
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:35,600
Hey, listen, Rex,

462
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:37,402
you, uh, mind if I borrow
my wife for minute?

463
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,203
Only if you bring her back.

464
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:44,001
I'll be back.

465
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:51,902
What's up?

466
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,801
I was just going
to ask you the same thing.

467
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm just enjoying
our guests.

468
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,200
Don't forget
you invited him.

469
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,303
Look, I know
I messed up with Bobbi,

470
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:03,501
but that doesn't bring Rex
into the mix.

471
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:05,702
- Not yet.
- No, not ever.

472
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:07,102
I fly a plane with the guy.

473
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:09,203
Oh, that's rich, Tom.

474
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:12,100
So you can sleep with your
co-workers but I can't?

475
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:13,902
Or are we making up
the rules as we go now?

476
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:16,001
Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

477
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:17,903
I don't remember losing my cool
when you were playing house

478
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,502
with your high school
boyfriend last week.

479
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:21,400
That's because I
cleared it with you.

480
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:25,702
Open and honest at all
times-- that's how it works.

481
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:27,903
That's why it works.

482
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:31,501
Okay... we're being honest here.

483
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:34,203
I wasn't exactly crazy
about you sleeping with the guy.

484
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:36,102
Well, then you should
have pulled the plug.

485
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,000
I asked you
point blank.

486
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:38,500
You could have said
no at any time,

487
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:39,900
which is also what you
should have told Bobbi. 

488
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:41,802
God,could you give it
a rest already, huh?

489
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,100
I made one mistake.

490
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:45,101
Well, maybe I want
to make one, too.

491
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:49,200
Or should we both just agree
not to ball your crew entirely?

492
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:51,002
Hey, guys.

493
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:01,800
What are you two doing
here... together?

494
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,500
Roger stopped by
the house to, uh...

495
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,201
Fix the air-conditioning.

496
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,700
Uh... when the power went out,
we saw all the cars and...

497
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:10,402
heard you in
the pool, and--

498
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:12,702
Oh, I should have called
first, shouldn't I?

499
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:14,602
Oh, no,
don't be ridiculous.

500
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:15,900
You're always
welcome here.

501
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,602
You, too, Roger.

502
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:19,803
You're sure we're
not intruding?

503
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,501
Oh, on the contrary.

504
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,402
The party just started getting
interesting, didn't it, honey?

505
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,601
Tom, will you dig up a
pair of shorts for Roger?

506
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:32,500
There must be one in his size
around here somewhere.

507
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:33,702
I'm not going to stay long.

508
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:34,903
Oh, well.

509
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,700
If you're staying at all,
there's only one other option.

510
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:40,602
It's way too hot out here
for a business suit.

511
00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:44,502
Come on, Rog, see if we can
dig up something for you.

512
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:47,301
Your husband's yummy.

513
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,400
Oh, he's, he's
not my husband.

514
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:51,103
Then he's available?

515
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:53,300
No, he's not that either.

516
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:55,801
I'm down a hundred, Bruce.

517
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,900
- He's bluffing.
- Your call, doll.

518
00:24:58,108 --> 00:24:59,502
It's going to cost you
to see what I got.

519
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,101
Call him.

520
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:03,602
I'll call.

521
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:06,002
Show 'em.

522
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:07,900
All right.

523
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,102
Jacks and tens.

524
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,900
- Three fives.
- Whoa!

525
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:15,901
Read 'em and weep, Mareno.

526
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:18,903
- That's it, I'm out.
- Where's everybody going?

527
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:20,602
- She's just warming up, man.
- Too bad, Moreno.

528
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,002
Take half.

529
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,401
I would have folded like
a tent without you. 

530
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,402
No,keep it, consider
it a bonus.

531
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:27,402
Then, next round's on me.

532
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:28,901
Won't say no to that.

533
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:37,700
Careful, there, boy-o.
You're playing with fire.

534
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:52,700
Beautiful.

535
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:57,603
Trina, are you okay?

536
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:59,402
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

537
00:25:59,405 --> 00:26:00,102
You sure?

538
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:03,502
You and Tom seem
out of sync.

539
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,502
Actually, we're in
a full-on fight.

540
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:10,303
What happened?

541
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,103
Tom had sex
with someone in Tokyo.

542
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:19,603
Yeah, that
someone, actually.

543
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:24,801
I called his hotel,
she answered.

544
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:27,203
Th-That's...cheating,
isn't it?

545
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:30,000
We'll work through it.

546
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:34,903
So where's Bruce?

547
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,501
Stuck downtown.

548
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:38,201
But Roger isn't?

549
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:41,102
Roger... took
the day off.

550
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:44,301
Janet doesn't know
he's here, does she?

551
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,500
Not exactly.

552
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,002
Maybe honesty's overrated.

553
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:53,902
Maybe ignorance is bliss.

554
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:01,701
Well,no wonder Janet keeps Roger
under lock and key.

555
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:08,203
Oh, I'm gonna
need more film.

556
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:17,801
Coming in?
Water's perfect.

557
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:19,702
Sure.

558
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,600
It's why we came, right?

559
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,002
- Whoo!
- Hey, batta, batta.

560
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:32,001
All right,that's enough
out of the peanut gallery.

561
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:33,601
Come on, this is
serious business here.

562
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:35,803
Oh, Nietzsche
would be so proud.

563
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:40,203
Not to be dense, but if
you don't become a teacher,

564
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:43,000
what do you do with a
master's in philosophy?

565
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,301
write a book.

566
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:46,000
Apply to law school.

567
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,803
Smoke a ton of weed
and collect unemployment.

568
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:50,502
You ever want to teach?

569
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:51,301
Sure.

570
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:54,801
I'd glly push Doug do a flight of
stairs for his gig at Lakeview High.

571
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:58,202
Lucky for him,
summer school's over.

572
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,703
They just offered him a
full-time position in the fall.

573
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,203
To be faculty?

574
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,500
It's his dream job--

575
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:08,103
a chance to have a positive impact
on the future thinkers of America.

576
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:11,003
And the weird thing is he hasn't
given them an answer yet.

577
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:14,700
- Did he say why?
- Nope.

578
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,800
Like I said before,
Doug's not much of a talker,

579
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:20,400
but he's definitely stalling
for some reason.

580
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:29,002
Home run!

581
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:31,702
Whoo...!

582
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:46,002
I think I'm done
with all this sun.

583
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:48,103
Might go cool off in the
Deckers' basement a while

584
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:50,001
if y'all want
to find me.

585
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:04,403
So this is what I missed
on the Fourth of July.

586
00:29:04,908 --> 00:29:06,501
And the '60s.

587
00:29:10,908 --> 00:29:13,200
I think I can see
why you and Bruce went for it.

588
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:17,903
We got caught
up in a moment.

589
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:28,302
Truth is...
we hadn't...

590
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:32,503
connected in that way
in a long time.

591
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,803
I read somewhere
that falling in love happens

592
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:43,303
when someone sees you
like you see yourself.

593
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,903
How do you see
yourself, Roger?

594
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:53,002
Ah, well, I don't even...
know anymore.

595
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:56,903
I'll tell you
how I see you.

596
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:02,102
Loyal.

597
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:04,201
Caring.

598
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,400
Smart.

599
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,201
Janet sees
that, too.

600
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:14,502
I'd bet my
life on it.

601
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:28,100
Wow, you, uh,
you got some sun today.

602
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,700
- Did I?
- Yeah.

603
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:31,601
Does that hurt?

604
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:34,401
Not too bad.

605
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:42,802
Well, I better, I better go home
and face the music.

606
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,502
Janet would have a stroke if
she knew I spent the day here.

607
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:49,900
Maybe you should
leave that part out.

608
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:52,502
Yeah, I think
you're right.

609
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:06,003
The lake light's amazing.

610
00:31:06,606 --> 00:31:08,602
I bet you got some
good snaps today.

611
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,002
I hope so.

612
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:12,103
I'm kind of rusty.

613
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,303
It'll come back fast.

614
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,100
I'd love to see
your darkroom.

615
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:17,903
No offense, Rex,

616
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:20,500
but even my husband
doesn't get to see that.

617
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,503
Then how about
your playroom?

618
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:27,300
I'm not sure I'm in the mood
to play right now.

619
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:30,503
- If you change your mind...
- I know where to find you.

620
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,001
Thanks, folks.
Good night.

621
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:00,801
Uh, uh...
Time to go, I guess.

622
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,001
- Bruce...
- Yeah?

623
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:08,703
All day you've been telling me
to keep my antennae up,

624
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:10,703
watch for connections.

625
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:16,000
Can't you see
what's right in front of you?

626
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:23,100
I... I have a wife, Melinda.

627
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,900
And I have an apartment,
right around the corner.

628
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:38,603
Wow.

629
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:41,203
This take you
all day?

630
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:44,201
I... took a few breaks.

631
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:46,102
What do you think?

632
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,503
Looks good.

633
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:51,300
Uh... I'm-I'm sorry
I'm home so late.

634
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:53,302
I- I threw back a few
with the guys after work.

635
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:55,000
Kind of lost
track of time.

636
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:57,403
You want something to eat?

637
00:32:57,406 --> 00:33:00,401
No. I...
I grabbed a burger.

638
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,901
How did Melinda do today?

639
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:06,703
Good.

640
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:08,901
She's a natural.

641
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:11,800
I'm glad it's working out.

642
00:33:13,306 --> 00:33:14,100
Um...

643
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:16,503
I'm going to...
grab a shower.

644
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:20,201
Long day,you know?

645
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:24,902
I don't suppose you found
someone to fix the AC?

646
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:25,803
I did, actually.

647
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:28,103
It had a bad, um,
connection or something.

648
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:29,301
It's as good as new now.

649
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:30,303
Great.

650
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:32,403
- If the power were on,that is.
- Right.

651
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:34,901
I'll... see you up there.

652
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:43,701
Are you hungry?

653
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:45,701
We could stop at that
all-night Chinese place.

654
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,201
Probably not a good idea
in a power outage.

655
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:51,503
Right.

656
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:53,801
Hey, Doug...

657
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,203
Yes, Laurie?

658
00:33:57,406 --> 00:33:59,700
You should take
the job at Lakeview.

659
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:03,403
You heard, huh?

660
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:07,703
Why haven't you
said "yes" yet?

661
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,802
Hmm... just thinking
about it, I guess.

662
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:16,100
Liz told me it's
your dream job.

663
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,300
I don't know.I think...the future
will take care of itself.

664
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm just trying to live life
in the moment right now.

665
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:25,002
Practice what I preach.

666
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:31,401
And in the fall?

667
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:36,103
Fall's... a long way off.

668
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:40,903
So I was thinking...

669
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:52,803
...maybe tonight could be the night
we go back to your place.

670
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:57,602
I don't know. I, uh...

671
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:03,301
I just... I like where
we are right now.

672
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:06,501
You still want to take it slow.

673
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:10,303
Slow and easy.

674
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:36,303
Everybody gone?

675
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:38,301
Well, there's a...

676
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:41,400
few diehards downstairs.

677
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:44,801
Rex is there.

678
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:48,103
You didn't go with him.

679
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:50,701
Too easy.

680
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,600
Might've been fun...

681
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:54,601
but it wouldn't
have helped.

682
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:05,400
Would you have told me
if I hadn't caught you?

683
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:07,900
Honestly?

684
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:10,801
I don't know.

685
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,902
I think we need to revisit
the rules...

686
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:22,201
and be exclusive
for a while.

687
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:24,803
Is that what you want?

688
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:28,103
What I want is... this.

689
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:35,803
I'm tired of the ocean
between us.

690
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:37,703
Me, too.

691
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,002
So, it'll be just
you and me

692
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:43,802
until we figure this out.

693
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:44,801
Yeah.

694
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:53,901
I'm going to stay here for
a while, if you don't mind.

695
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,003
Sure.

696
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:18,902
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

697
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,600
I have something to tell you,
Janet.

698
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:29,800
That you got fired?

699
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,103
I bounced a check today.

700
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:33,500
I've never done that
in my life.

701
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:36,803
The bank said you didn't make
a deposit last week.

702
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:38,003
So I called your office...

703
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:39,901
I found out from a secretary.

704
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:44,601
I'm so sorry, Janet.

705
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,700
I wanted to tell you,
but I thought if I could...

706
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:50,602
find another job first--
something better--

707
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:53,103
it might...
make it easier.

708
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,103
It's not about a job...

709
00:37:57,406 --> 00:37:58,603
Roger, it...

710
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:02,003
I'm your wife.

711
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,401
We took vows--

712
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:08,601
in sicknessand in health,
for richer or poorer.

713
00:38:09,905 --> 00:38:11,501
Did you think
you couldn't trust me?

714
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:12,402
Did you...

715
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:14,600
That I wouldn't get it?

716
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:25,601
I can't sell insurance
anymore, Janet.

717
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,500
I need more.

718
00:38:31,206 --> 00:38:32,500
I want more.

719
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:36,100
From you,
from myself.

720
00:38:41,205 --> 00:38:43,201
I don't even know
what that is yet.

721
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:53,002
You got it.

722
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:56,203
What?

723
00:38:57,907 --> 00:39:00,503
I said...
you got it.

724
00:39:03,205 --> 00:39:05,802
You are my husband,
and I love you...

725
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:10,502
and whatever you need,
that's what I want for you.

726
00:39:20,308 --> 00:39:22,200
Now go outside and fire up
the grill.

727
00:39:30,308 --> 00:39:31,302
T- bones?

728
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,700
I thought you were saving these
for a special occasion.

729
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,401
Well, this food won't keep
overnight.

730
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:38,600
Might as well stay up
and cook it all.

731
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:42,202
I'll work this out, Janet.

732
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:45,500
- I promise.
- I know.

733
00:39:47,505 --> 00:39:49,600
Now get going;
I haven't eaten a thing all day.

734
00:41:45,305 --> 00:42:01,601
