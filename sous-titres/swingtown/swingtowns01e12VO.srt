1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
Usly on swingtown...

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,590
- who are you?
- Janet thompson.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,900
- She's a temp.
- Words per minute?

4
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,000
100

5
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,240
You're hired.

6
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,150
I'm lisa.

7
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,950
you want to go inside?

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,900
Rick,where are you going?

9
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,240
I think you helped us both dodge a bullet.

10
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,660
You were a perfect gentlemen.

11
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,160
Not so perfect.

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,270
- Bruce kissed melinda.
- Oh,susan.

13
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,550
I don't think it's anything more than a work crush.

14
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,480
Tom and I are on the list for the new disco downtown.

15
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,950
Shall we all head back for a dip?

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,850
What would make me happy would be for you to find a good job that makes you happy,

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,310
then we can go back to exactly the way things used to be.

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,480
Don't ever settle,okay?

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,350
Sure,dad.

20
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,930
Roger,what are you doing here?

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,480
oh,babe,you shouldn't have.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,150
It's for janet.

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,290
Tonit's her birthday dinner.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,370
Didn't we just do one of those last year?

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,670
Pretty much every year for the last,oh,decade.

26
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,430
It's a tradition.

27
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,400
I was kind of hoping a new house meant a new tradition.

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,410
Ought to be a barrel of laughs sitting across from roger all night.

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,940
What do you mean?

30
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,940
Ever since roger's been laid off,he's been kind of a sad sack.

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,560
Never know what to say to the guy now that we can't talk shop.

32
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,560
You have plenty to talk about: Bowling,the white sox.

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,850
I'm a cubs fan,honey.

34
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,620
You should probably know that by now.

35
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,720
Oh,ricky!

36
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,950
Thank you.

37
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,850
It looks...

38
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,060
it looks delicious.

39
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,670
Piece of cake.Pancake,to be exact.

40
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,410
Unfortunately,I'll have to wrap up this little work of art.

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,470
It'd take me over an hour to eat it all.

42
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,730
It's your birt ay.

43
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,100
Shouldn't they give you a day off or something?

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,950
Ah-ah-ah-- don't worry about the mess.

45
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,930
- I got it.
- Thank you.

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,190
Might be a few weeks before i can buy you a proper present.

47
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,030
Just land this new job today.That'll be present enough for me.

48
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,730
what new job?

49
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,590
Falstaff properties.It's a commercial real estate firm.

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,680
They build skyscrapers and stuff.

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,920
What do they need an insurance salesman for?

52
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,880
What they need is a safety assessor for a new multimillion-dollar project.

53
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,920
Cool.

54
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,250
Ricky,go make your bed,please.

55
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,940
Thank you.

56
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,460
Honey,how did you get this interview?

57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,360
Larry freed set it up.

58
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,180
He's a foreman at one of falstaff's high-rises downtown.

59
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,510
Oh,larry from your bowling team?

60
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,510
Thinks I'd be a good fit for the company,

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,560
with my background in risk management and my engineering training.

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,110
Roger,I hope you get this job.

63
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,710
I really do.

64
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,600
But if you don'T...

65
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,340
I think it's time to start pursuing work that's a little more...

66
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,530
realistic.

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,550
It's been over a month.

68
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,670
I know how long it's been.

69
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,590
not sure I'll make it home before dinner at susan'S.

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,130
Meet you there?

71
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,000
Honey,good luck today.

72
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,440
Hope you knock their socks off.

73
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,940
Happy birthday.

74
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,230
Oh,uh,don't forget to set those bottles out.

75
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,560
The milk man will be here any minute.

76
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,190
hey,there.

77
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,890
Morning,sunshine.

78
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,130
Is it morning already?

79
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,540
Anything you can do about that?

80
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,270
One too many last night?

81
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,780
Guess so.

82
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,830
I'll put on some coffee.

83
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,730
coming.

84
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,550
Susan.

85
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,660
You're all dressed up.

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,270
Yeah,I got a job interview.

87
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,270
Kind of a dream job,actually.

88
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,110
Oh!Great!

89
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,970
Come on in.

90
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,940
I was hoping to catch janet before she left.

91
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,030
You just missed her.

92
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,570
it's good to see you.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,160
I wanted to call after,but...

94
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,450
roger,I've been thinking.

95
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,950
Me,too.

96
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,540
you know,with everything that happened this summer--

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,340
us moving,and you losing your job,and everything else--

98
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,750
I don't blame you...

99
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,700
for the kiss.

100
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,790
You were confused.We-we both were.

101
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,860
I wasn't confused.

102
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,440
- roger...
- susan,I knew exactly what I was doing.

103
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,130
I-I think we shouldn't see each other for a little while.

104
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,190
Okay.

105
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,990
What about tonight?

106
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,860
Oh,I don't know.

107
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,400
It's going to be horrible.

108
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,140
The four of us chitchatting over janet's birthday cake.

109
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,790
Maybe we should invite other people.

110
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,390
You know,make it more of a party.

111
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,840
I guess that could be okay.

112
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,330
Janet gets the birthday she deserves,and after that,

113
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,590
we won't see each other at all...

114
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,590
if that's what you want.

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,030
Is that what you want?

116
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,570
Yes.

susan,I.

121
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,880
Anthony,michelle,this is our neighbor susan.

122
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,890
- Hello.
- hi

123
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,270
Thanks again,tom.It was unforgettable,as always.

124
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,630
Tell trin,some 7-up and tabasco always works for me.

125
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,690
- Nice to meet you.
- See you,tom.

126
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,270
Trina's not feeling well?

127
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,410
Just a little hangover.

128
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm gonna run out and get her a bottle of alka-seltzer.

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,730
She's out by the pool.

130
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,320
oh,susan.

131
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,510
Tom let me in as he was,uh,letting your guests out.

132
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,220
Are you all right?He said you weren't feeling well.

133
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,990
Oh,I always feel better after a swim.

134
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,280
So,it's janet's birthday,and I'm throwing her a surprise party tonight.

135
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,040
Trina,I could use some help.

136
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,370
Sure,sure.

137
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,280
Let me just put something on,and I'll help you set up.

138
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,030
- It's not that.
- What is it?

139
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,970
Roger kissed me.

140
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,450
We kissed each other,actually.

141
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,610
It-it didn't go any further than that.

142
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,650
- It never will.
- Are you sure?

143
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,890
Yes.

144
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,920
Oh,god,what is wrong with me?

145
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,820
He's my best friend's husband.

146
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,190
That doesn't mean you still can't have feelings for M.

147
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,220
Of course it does.

148
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,660
You know,I'm not like you.

149
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,160
I don't have a switch I can just turn on

150
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,490
and off every time somebody new strolls into my bedroom.

151
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,850
Well,I'd like to think I'm a little more complex than that.

152
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,730
Oh,I'm sorry.

153
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,990
I didn't mean it like that.

154
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,360
If anything,I wish I were more like you.

155
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,350
It would make this whole mess a lot easier to deal with.

156
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,000
think about what we said,all right?

157
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,860
Thank you.

158
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,470
- Okay?
- Thanks very much for lunch,gentleman.

159
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,440
- Oh,sure.
- You boys certainly know how to court a lady.

160
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,010
You've given me a lot to think about.

161
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,130
- You know how to reach us.
- Bye,now.

162
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,180
Tell me you're not getting into bed with those bozos at singer-ross.

163
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,400
Not really your business who I get into bed with,is it?

164
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,750
And by the way,didn't susan forbid you to speak to me?

165
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,360
I will decide who I speak to.

166
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
Tough talk there,bruce.

167
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,410
At least I can still talk the talk,right?

168
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,080
No comment.

169
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,140
No,seriously.You...

170
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,110
you thinking of jumping ship to singer?

171
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,080
It's called the options exchange,bruce.

172
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,200
Just keeping mine open.

173
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,160
Breaker one-nine.

174
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,300
Breaker one-nine.

175
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,810
you got your ears on,lady killer?

176
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,430
- Come back.
- Affirmative,silver bullet.

177
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,510
Got two little honeys knock-knocking at your door in five,four,three...

178
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,130
10-4,lady killer.

179
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,820
Silver bullet,over.

180
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,700
Hey,sam.Lisa.

181
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,340
Silver bullet?

182
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,370
It's my handle.

183
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,870
Rick's "lady killer"?

184
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,340
Guess we barely escaped with our lives the other night,sam.

185
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,100
And our dignity.

186
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,510
Which is more than I can say for a certain lady killer.

187
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,460
Very funny,goldilocks.

188
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,130
Goldilocks?

189
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,410
So those are real cbs?

190
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,170
Rick knows this kid whose dad runs a radio shack.

191
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,820
We've already royally P.O.'D half a dozen truckers.

192
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,090
How far do they reach?

193
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,970
You want to test them out?See how far?

194
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,190
Sure.

195
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,250
Goldilocks,you take silver bullet,and I'll roll the dice with the lady killer.

196
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,160
all right-- volleyball.

197
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,110
Frisbee...

198
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,530
new york review of books.

199
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,030
Dumb jock.

200
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,840
You're lucky you're cute.

201
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,170
Stephens!

202
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,710
We're waiting on you.

203
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,640
Who do we have here?

204
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,930
Speaking of dumb jocks,laurie,this is matt.

205
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,100
So you're the pretty little thing who hijacked spike for the summer.

206
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,520
Spike?

207
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,710
It's a volleyball thing.

208
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,330
You play,laurie?

209
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,750
Uh,sure.

210
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,670
Well,come on,then.There's room on my team.

211
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,410
I thought you were a klutz.

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,230
Only mostly.

213
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,600
Grab me a coke?

214
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,940
All I have is yoo-hoo.

215
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,110
I love you,too.

216
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,230
What'd you say?

217
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,560
What did you say?

218
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,110
All I have is yoo-hoo.

219
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,180
I thought...

220
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,330
never mind.

221
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,490
Stephens!

222
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,120
Serve's up.Let's go!

223
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,640
All right.

224
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,200
I don't care what he says.

225
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,510
For men,there are only two kinds of girls:

226
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,500
The kind you have fun with and the kind you marry.

227
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,500
But bill and I are engaged.

228
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,160
For two years?

229
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,200
Have you ever heard the phrase:

230
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,760
"Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"

231
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,030
All right,ladies.

232
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,500
Less chitchat,more tap-tap.

233
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,260
Lunch ended five minutes ago.

234
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,480
Might be time to close the dairy,sherry.

235
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,410
what is it,henry?

236
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
You're really something.

237
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,520
Telling everyone how to run their lives.

238
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,840
I do not tell everyone how to run their lives-- most people value my opinion.

239
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,870
And the others need my help,whether they know it or not.

240
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,240
I don't suppose you've heard any of the scuttlebutt

241
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,090
about the paper's dear trudy"" and her recent..."

242
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,360
"summer sabbatical?"

243
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,790
I may have heard a whisper or two.

244
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,760
I hear the editor is taking submissions to find her replacement while she dries out.

245
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,080
I think you should apply.

246
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,970
Henry,that is very sweet,but I am not an advice columnist.

247
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,050
I am a wife and mother.

248
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,110
Exactly.

249
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,290
You spend your whole life tending to other people's needs.

250
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,600
When you put it like that...

251
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,560
here,a sample question: Dear trudy:"

252
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,930
Every week I watch my neighbor's husband wax his corvette,and he's driving me wild."

253
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,060
I'd like to polish his hot rod myself.

254
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,840
"Help!Signed,covetous in kenosha."

255
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,900
Sounds like covetous missed sunday school the day they covered the ten commandments.

256
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,470
Oh,let me see that.

257
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,680
Well,after 12 years of selling insurance,

258
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,450
I certainly know a thing or two about risk.

259
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,350
But not quite as much about engineering.

260
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,490
I know how the two are related.

261
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,250
I won't let you down,mr.Sullivan.

262
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,060
I'm your guy.

263
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:18,950
Roger,I've taken my share of risks over the years,and I'm inclined to take one on you.

264
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,350
Congratulations.

265
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,440
When can you start?

266
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,370
How's tomorrow sound?

267
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,040
Well,I like your enthusiasm.

268
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,680
You'll need time to pack up,sell your house,and find a new place.

269
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,920
A new place?

270
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,270
Don't worry,we've got a realtor who handles all of our relocations.

271
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,190
And there are some great deals to be had in cincinnati.

272
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,680
Great town.

273
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,700
Hell of a place to raise a family.

274
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,130
two push-ups.

275
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,300
Silver bullet and goldilocks,over.

276
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,460
- You read me?
- Loud and clear,silver bullet.

277
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,710
What's your 20,over?

278
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,900
Still at the house.

279
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,050
- You at yours?
- Negatory,amigo.

280
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,890
At the beach with kissing cousin.

281
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,440
Over and out.

282
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,280
Thanks.

283
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,680
I kinda owed you,after what happened last week.

284
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,330
Thanks for being cool and not telling anyone about it.

285
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,450
You didn't tell anyone about it...

286
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,490
did you?

287
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,850
No.

288
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,370
but,anyway,about that night...

289
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,860
listen,rick's mic is still on.

290
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,860
Guys don't usually bolt when I take off my top.

291
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,230
It wasn't you.

292
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,050
I mean,you're amazing.

293
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,770
Maybe even too amazing,if that's possible.

294
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,100
I guess I just kinda panicked.

295
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,440
- I knew it!He's scared of girls!
- Turn it off.

296
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,800
Are you kidding me?I wouldn't miss this for the world.

297
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,660
How'd you get to be so much cooler than your cousin?

298
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,590
I don't get why bj's so freakin' in love with her.

299
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,790
- He's in love with her?
- Samantha,give it here.

300
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,870
- no.
- I think they're in love With each other.

301
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,320
Bummer for them.

302
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,760
Keep a secret?

303
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,460
Sam's coming to live with us in naperville next week.

304
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,140
She's moving away?For real?

305
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,030
My aunt gail's such a mess that my mom's gonna try and get legal custody.

306
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,310
Just wait there...

307
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,080
game point!...

308
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,990
Suck on that,spike!

309
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,210
Wait,no,no.Where's everyone going?

310
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,400
Come on,I demand a rematch!

311
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,790
Laurie,back me up here.

312
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,360
Sorry.I think I'm gonna have to sit this one out,spike.

313
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,930
I like this girl,stephens.

314
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,160
Busting your undefeated volleyball record and the milk carton theory,in one fell swoop.

315
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,540
- The "milk carton theory"?
- Okay,matt...

316
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,930
I'm paying her a compliment.

317
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,740
Most girls this guy dates don't last longer than a carton of milk;

318
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,360
I mean hardly any make it past the one-month mark.

319
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,580
So,this guy must really like you,laurie.

320
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,560
Either that or we're about to expire.

321
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,840
There you are.

322
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,830
I'm off to dr.Fraiberg'S.

323
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,530
For a hangover?

324
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,240
Just my regular checkup.

325
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,960
How was susan this morning?

326
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,650
She seemed a little...

327
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,150
uneasy,running into anthony and michelle.

328
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,070
I'm afraid susan and bruce have more to worry about than...

329
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,680
whether or not we're going steady with them.

330
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,390
Because of bruce and that girl from his office,melinda?

331
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,520
Because of susan.And roger.

332
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,720
You're kidding.

333
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,530
So far nothing's happened between them.

334
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,950
Well,nothing much.

335
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,300
- How much?
- A kiss.

336
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,880
Between those two?

337
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,870
A kiss is something.

338
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,930
- I feel responsible.
- For what?

339
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,640
If they hadn't met us; started experimenting...

340
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,630
maybe it was more than they could handle.

341
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,340
I feel like bad parents.

342
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,160
Babe,we're not their parents.

343
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,990
But we are their friends.

344
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,100
And they can use our help.

345
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,340
Dear "wondering in winnetka," stop wondering:

346
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,120
He's cheating on you.

347
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,840
God gave you two eyes; open them.

348
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,060
God gave you two legs; walk away.

349
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,320
Yes,it is that simple.

350
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,150
Oughta be,anyway.

351
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,960
Come on,let's go drop these with the editor.

352
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I don't know,uh,maybe I should sleep on it.

353
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,500
What are you talking about?

354
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,740
Your responses are brilliant and witty,just like you.

355
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,280
Roger will find work soon.

356
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,490
I-I might not need this job for much longer.

357
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,010
Need and want are two different things.

358
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,440
I'll buy you a drink; and we'll talk it over.

359
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,210
That's very nice of you,but I'm due at my friend susan's for dinner.

360
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,430
So you'll be a little late.

361
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,900
More than a little now.

362
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,660
I think she's planning something special,because it'S...

363
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,780
well,um...

364
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,110
it's my birthday.

365
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,640
Happy birthday.

366
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,370
Thank you.

367
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,320
Thank you for your encouragement.

368
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,480
That was the most wonderful birthday gift.

369
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,740
Nonsense,you're the one with the gift.

370
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,250
Henry,do you have plans tonight?

371
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
What did you have in mind?

372
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,590
Saw you double down with a covered call on standard.

373
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,090
Surprising,you're usually such a risk-taker.

374
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,080
Gdp numbers made the market jumpy.

375
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,310
So I hedged my bets; played it safe.

376
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,220
Been playing it safe a lot lately.

377
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,580
Kind of takes the fun out of it,don't you think?

378
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,500
Maybe a little.

379
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,110
You-you know,I gotta admit,

380
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,270
it's-it's really nice talking to a woman who understands the market.

381
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,490
What do you and susan talk about?

382
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,470
When it's just the two of you?

383
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,610
I don't know.Um,our kids.

384
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,030
Lots of things.

385
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,540
Uh,this morning,we-we talked about baseball briefly.

386
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,390
My god,did you see jose cardenal against the giants yesterday?

387
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,020
Six for seven in 14 innings.

388
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,850
A double,a homer and four rbis.

389
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,860
Melinda...

390
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,140
don't do this.

391
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,710
Don't do what?

392
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,240
We're just talking about the cubs.

393
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,190
Don't leave lehman-pierce.

394
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,440
I heard singer-ross made you an offer.

395
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,860
You want to talk me out of it?

396
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,900
Take me to dinner tonight.

397
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,540
I can'T.I-I've got a thing at home.

398
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,610
You remember my first week at lehman-pierce,

399
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,250
when you taught me about windows of opportunity?

400
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,950
Tonight,your window is open.

401
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,480
Tomorrow?

402
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,770
I'm not so sure.

403
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,260
susan,I'm sorry I'm so late.

404
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,810
The interview went longer than I expected.

405
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,330
It's fine.Janet's not here yet.

406
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,820
long interview?Must mean it went well.

407
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,310
It went great.I got the job.

408
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,740
Oh,that's fantastic.

409
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,420
There's a catch.

410
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,850
She's coming.She's here.

411
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,500
What's the catch?

412
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,480
The job's in cincinnati.

413
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,510
Surprise!

414
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,990
Happy birthday!

415
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,380
so this is what you two have been up to,spending all this time together.

416
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,720
Happy birthday.

417
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,240
I am terrible-- arriving late to my own surprise party.

418
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,470
- Better than early,huh?
- Well,that's true.

419
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,740
Oh,I'm sorry,uh,this is henry fisher.We work together at the daily sun.

420
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,210
Uh,this is my best friend susan.

421
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,390
And my husband roger.

422
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,520
It's my fault we're late-- I forced her to stay at the office.

423
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,200
Hardly-- you were doing me a favor.

424
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,330
Well,and don't think that I won't expect you to return it once you're a famous advice columnist.

425
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,540
Advice columnist?

426
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,030
With any luck,you're looking at the new "dear trudy."

427
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,390
What happened to the old one?

428
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,980
A little problem with the bottle.

429
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,670
Yeah,her husband caught her drinking vanilla extract again.

430
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,250
Talk about living in glass houses.

431
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,220
Oh,oh,speaking of houses-- how did your interview go at the construction company?

432
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,840
- It went well.
- Good!

433
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,520
My fingers are crossed.

434
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,490
Oh,no!

435
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,630
Susan,you didn'T...

436
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,290
you made pigs-in-a-pickle?

437
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,710
Thank you!Henry,wait until you try these.

438
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,580
Susan,thank you.

439
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,510
What's going on?What is all this?

440
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,280
Uh,change of plans.

441
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,210
I-I called your office,but they said you'd already left.

442
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,450
Surprise.

443
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,170
- Susan,is there any more ice?
- Okay.

444
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,490
She was gonna find out sooner or later.

445
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,760
I didn't mean for her to hear,I swear.

446
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,390
I must have been sitting on the mic.

447
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,800
Well,she did hear you.

448
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,770
What is the big deal?

449
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,540
We're going to high school in two weeks.

450
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,950
You'll bag plenty of new chicks.

451
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,610
You really don't get it,do you?

452
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,700
Sure,I do.You thought you were gonna nail sam,

453
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,390
and you're pissed you wasted your whole summer.

454
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,220
You don't know a thing about girls.

455
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,490
Like you do?

456
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,180
Guy gets to first base,thinks he's leif garrett.

457
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,310
Well,at least I didn't bolt when sam took her top off.

458
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,330
Yeah,we heard that part,too....

459
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,470
pour me one of those?

460
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,250
You got it.

461
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,400
You sure were busy today.

462
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,160
Who are all these people?

463
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,900
everybody I could find in janet's address book.

464
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,440
I thought you'd prefer it to dinner with the thompsons.

465
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,270
Well,I'm not so sure.

466
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,090
Kind of feel like a stranger in my own home.

467
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,540
Know what you mean.

468
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,590
Jose cardenal.You know who that is?

469
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,440
Why,is he here?

470
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,560
no.

471
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,090
Never mind.

472
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,730
They don't look so good.

473
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,420
I take him,you take her?

474
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,800
susan,when was the last time you were on an airplane?

475
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,020
uh,last year.

476
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,300
We-we went to visit bruce's sister in philadelphia.

477
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,040
Do you remember what they tell you at the beginning of the flight about the oxygen masks?

478
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,320
No,you got me.

479
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,170
If you're traveling with a child or someone that needs assistance,

480
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,300
you're supposed to secure your mask first,

481
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,450
because if you can't breathe,you're no good to anyone else.

482
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,520
I'm not sure I understand.

483
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,210
Just...just...

484
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,090
just breathe.

485
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,160
Take care of yourself first.

486
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,580
you having fun?

487
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,620
ask me after a few more of these.

488
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,160
you okay?

489
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,780
Sure,yeah,I'm okay.

490
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,890
Susan's okay.

491
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,440
We're all okay.

492
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,420
Want to talk about it?

493
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,360
I had plans,you know?

494
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,230
Lots of them.

495
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,980
Five-year plan,ten.

496
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,510
Wife,kids,job,house.

497
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,220
And a better job...

498
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,930
better house.

499
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,220
Perspective's a choice.

500
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,500
Oh,you want perspective?

501
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,690
You try having kids,being the breadwinner,

502
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,790
having people depend on you...

503
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,220
I mean,for everything.

504
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,800
- I'm sorry...
- no,no,I am trying.

505
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,520
I am doing the best I can.

506
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,690
I mean,you're lucky.

507
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,150
Everything is so effortless with you and tom.

508
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,050
God forbid life should throw you a real curve one of these days.

509
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,860
a little early for cake.

510
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,630
This party was a mistake.

511
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,050
I think you were right.

512
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,260
Maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.

513
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,510
Shouldn't be a problem with you in cincinnati.

514
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,180
I didn't say yes.

515
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,550
Before I make this decision...

516
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,490
I need to know how you feel.

517
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,060
I feel...

518
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,290
I feel that you should discuss this with janet.

519
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,180
Susan...

520
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,420
please?

521
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,330
I need to know how you feel about me.

522
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,310
If I'm alone in this,just say so.

523
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,910
I'll take the job,be out of your life.

524
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,050
I don't know,roger,I...

525
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,170
ow,roger,I...

526
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,890
you okay?

527
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,020
I'm fine.

528
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm falling in lovewith you,susan.

529
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,290
Roger...

530
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,030
I can'T.

531
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,530
If you're gonna dump me,just get it over with.

532
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,190
What?

533
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,880
The "milk carton theory."

534
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,380
No,don't listen to what matt says.

535
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,110
He's a blockhead.

536
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,770
It's not just what matt said.

537
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,190
It'S...

538
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,580
what you didn't say.

539
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,030
I know you heard me tell you that I love you in the parking lot today.

540
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,420
It's fine.

541
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,880
I don't want you to say anything you don't mean.

542
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,870
That isn't it.

543
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,310
Laurie...

544
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,740
you start school in two weeks.

545
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,140
I still don't know whether I'm gonna take the faculty job at lakeview.

546
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,920
I don't want us to get ahead of ourselves.

547
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,950
I'm not getting ahead of myself.

548
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,110
I know exactly where I am.

549
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,640
When you figure out where you are,let me know.

550
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,710
How'd it go with susan?

551
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,140
Oh,I did my best.

552
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,370
I think my talents might lie more in the realm of physical therapy.

553
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,830
- how's bruce?
- Confused.

554
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,710
Tom,there's something I want to tell you.

555
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,420
Oh,hey,watch yourself there,kiddo.

556
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,300
Hey,you watch yourself.

557
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,390
Had a few too many tonight,sailor?

558
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,240
I'm not a sailor,I am a freshman.

559
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,900
- Come on...
- no.

560
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,280
What is going on,ricky?

561
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,680
Junior's,uh,been hitting the hard stuff.

562
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,750
Maybe you're next,bud.

563
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,220
Watch your mouth,ricky.

564
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh,hey,hey,hey,take it easy.

565
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,330
He's just a kid.

566
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,770
Yeah,he's my kid,I'll handle it.

567
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,450
No,I will do it.

568
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,340
You're coming with me,young man.

569
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,740
I'm so sorry.

570
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,850
Just a sec.

571
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,210
Hello?

572
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,230
Hey,I was hoping you'd still be there.

573
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,830
Bruce.

574
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,830
What do you want?

575
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,710
I'll tell you what i don't want--

576
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,810
I don't want you to leave lehman-pierce.

577
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,060
I...I don't want you to leave

578
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,830
because I can't stand the thought of not seeing you every day.

579
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,460
Little late for sweet talk,isn't it?

580
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,990
Too late?

581
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,230
Is the window still open?

582
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,240
Just come down here.

583
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,520
I'm on my way.

584
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,940
richard dean thompson,I hope you are proud of yourself.

585
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,660
What is the matter with you,for god's sake?

586
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,110
Start talking,or you are grounded until college.

587
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,050
You know that stupid girl that lives next door?

588
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,570
Bj's in love with her.

589
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,440
That's what this is all about?

590
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,520
You think I'm an idiot,too?

591
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,060
Oh,honey.

592
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,300
No,of course not.

593
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,460
You and bj...

594
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,750
you have a history,just like susan and I do.

595
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,680
You're best friends-- this girl can't take that away from you.

596
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,820
She already has.

597
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,000
You know,you and i are a lot alike.

598
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,680
Oh,great,I feel much better.

599
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,860
No.

600
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,330
I mean,we cover things up.

601
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,070
Our feelings.

602
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,190
Remember when we played that game,um,whac-a-mole,at great america?

603
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,240
Well,feelings are like that.

604
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,490
Push one down,it just pops back up somewhere else.

605
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,550
It makes it harder for people to get where we're coming from.

606
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,800
I guess.

607
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,240
If you want to keep bj's friendship,do something about it.

608
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,030
I'm sorry for ruining your party.

609
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,720
Apology accepted.

610
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,780
Now I want you to go upstairs and lie down.

611
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:04,620
And I don't ever want you drinking like this again,got it?

612
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,460
Thanks,mom.

613
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,250
wish I had a mother like you.

614
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,220
I...

615
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,630
I doubt that.

616
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,120
No,really.

617
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,870
How do you do it?

618
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,490
Oh,you just...

619
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,660
do.You just...

620
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,680
love them.

621
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,610
You want to spare them everything,take every bullet,but...

622
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,180
but how can they learn if you don't let them make their own mistakes?

623
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,940
Exactly.

624
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,060
I'm pregnant.

625
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
You're pre...

626
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,070
Oh,that's wonderful news!

627
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,350
That...tr...oh,trina.

628
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,760
No...

629
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,080
it is,uh,tom's,isn't it?definitely.

630
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,050
I did the math,it seems we...

631
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,560
closed our marriage at just the right time.

632
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,800
I haven't told him yet.

633
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,950
Why not?

634
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,350
Well,we didn't exactly plan.

635
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,380
I mean,it's a bit of a surprise.

636
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,840
I love surprises.

637
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,620
Forgot how much till tonight.

638
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,720
I bet tom does,too.

639
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,750
Susan?

640
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,580
Uh,I'm sorry.

641
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,170
I've-I've got to go back to the office.

642
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,340
At this hour?

643
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,890
I left my briefcase.

644
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,190
It's got all of today's receipts.

645
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,730
I may stay down there a while.

646
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,220
Just...

647
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,630
you know,catch up on some paperwork.

648
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,190
Sure.

649
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,480
There you are.

650
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,480
Yep.Here I am.

651
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,890
Look,I think you're amazing...

652
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,630
So,you are breaking up with me.

653
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,520
Remember what I said about not getting ahead of ourselves?

654
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,020
Sorry.

655
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,420
If I take the job at lakeview,then you and i would have to hide from the...

656
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,440
school board,from the teachers,students.

657
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,080
I don't want to hide what we have,laurie.

658
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm turning down the position.

659
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,810
You could've just said,"I love you." You know?

660
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,380
I thought I just did.

661
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,380
It was a pleasure to meet you.

662
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,440
Thanks.You,too.

663
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,330
Henry.Wait.

664
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,930
you're right.

665
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,220
I can do this "dear trudy" thing.

666
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,900
I-I want to submit my column.

667
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,280
Good.

668
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,130
And happy birthday,janet.

669
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,220
good night.

670
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,770
Tell bruce good night.

671
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,160
We couldn't find him anywhere.

672
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,630
He,uh...

673
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,900
had to go back to the office.

674
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,850
we're across the street if you need us.

675
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,140
Is it true,what lisa said?

676
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,700
I'm leaving next week.

677
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,110
Is it true what rick said?

678
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,540
It's true.

679
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,810
Guy's got it bad.

680
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,260
You're all bj talks about.

681
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,990
Get lost,rick.

682
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,460
I brought this...

683
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,340
for sam.

684
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,540
So you guys can talk.

685
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,110
It should reach naperville,no problem.

686
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,790
Is lisa around?

687
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,330
Up in my room.

688
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,590
I don't want to go.

689
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,790
I don't want you to go,either.

690
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,970
so,you think we closed pandora's box?

691
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,890
Not even an inch.

692
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,430
I guess we really do have to let them make their own mistakes.

693
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,500
You're becoming quite the little den mother,looking out for her cubs.

694
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,400
It makes me wonder,you know?

695
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,230
What'd it be like,being a mother...

696
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,040
for real.

697
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,280
you almost had me there.

698
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,140
Certainly made a mess of things tonight.

699
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,400
I want you to take the job in cincinnati.

700
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,760
It's the best thing...

701
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,410
for everyone.

702
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,590
Is it?

703
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,720
Don't we deserve a chance?

704
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,130
Well,ricky's in the car,but he will be over tomorrow morning,

705
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,850
mop in hand to swab the decks.

706
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,530
He wants to act like a drunken sailor,he can work like one too.

707
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,550
It's fine,janet.It's my mess.

708
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,520
I'll...I'll clean it up.

709
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,610
Okay.

710
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,590
Thank you.

711
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,240
I loved my party.

712
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,770
Happy birthday.

713
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,210
Well,roger,all good things must come to an end.

714
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,770
