1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,620
Pre*******

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,070
********with a psychiatrist.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,110
I lost my job.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,370
You disappointed in him?

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,630
I have a depressed husband who went to susan

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,070
when he should have been coming to me.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,370
I'm goa sign up with an employment agency.

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,970
I think it's time for us to step out of the penalty box.

9
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,200
There's a concert tomorrow night-- it's jackson browne.

10
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:18,970
I'm going with doug.

11
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:20,096
Laurie,no.

12
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:25,375
you have no right lecturing me about anything!

13
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:26,957
I'm going with doug.

14
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:27,862
All right.

15
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,712
Dad,don'T.

16
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:33,423
Uh,well,look,if you-you need something.

17
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:35,082
Thanks.

18
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:36,183
Geror?

19
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:37,090
Hey.

20
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:37,892
You okay?

21
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,640
This trip's not as...

22
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:41,382
fun as the last one.

23
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:42,553
Susan?

24
00:00:42,638 --> 00:00:43,600
Where were you?

25
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,400
Who were you talking to?

26
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:51,603
susan.

27
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:54,611
what?

28
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:56,442
You faked it.

29
00:00:58,735 --> 00:00:59,921
What do you mean?

30
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:01,212
18 years.

31
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,671
what,you think I don't know when.

32
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,360
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,642
It-it wasn't anything you did.

34
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,611
or-or didn't do; I just.

35
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,222
I can't focus.

36
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:16,803
My mind's all over the place.

37
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:18,853
What are you thinking about?

38
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,961
You and laurie.

39
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:23,262
You and me.

40
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,173
Laurie and doug.

41
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:26,572
The fact that summer's almost over

42
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:32,343
and our one family vacation was a total disaster.

43
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:33,570
Hey.

44
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:37,752
we've got a couple of days before I go back to work.

45
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:42,971
So,what do you say we spend that time just enjoying each other again.

46
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,601
Just you and me.

47
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,282
That sounds like a great idea.

48
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:48,620
What do you have in mind?

49
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,071
Just plain old,hands off the wheel fun.

50
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,503
We'll make it up as we go.

51
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:56,190
I can't think of anything I'd rather do.

52
00:01:56,297 --> 00:02:00,873
Well,you see,I already got you to stop thinking.

53
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:04,703
Now,all we got to do.

54
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:06,510
get that focus back.

55
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:09,270
yeah,sure.

56
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:11,721
I can be there in an hour.

57
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,762
All right,well,thanks for making time for me.

58
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:14,682
I'll see you then.

59
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:15,583
Bye-bye.

60
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:17,072
Was that about an interview?

61
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:18,690
Well,just following up on something.

62
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:19,692
You leaving already?

63
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:20,710
Don't want to be late.

64
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:23,383
And if I'm gonna be dressed properly for work this coming week,

65
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,400
I've got to drop these outfits off at the dry cleaner.

66
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:26,793
They smell like mothballs.

67
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,141
Plus.

68
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:30,471
the post office,the bank,the grocery store.

69
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,593
24 four is simply not enough hours in a day.

70
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,030
Hey,I can help out,you know.

71
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,740
Just tell me what needs to be done.

72
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:38,111
Okay,uh.

73
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,561
it's mostly stuff around the house:

74
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,593
There's,uh,laundry,dusting,uh,vacuuming.

75
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,290
The weekly meal plan is below.

76
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:45,891
Tonight is chicken kiev.

77
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,632
Or you can just get some tv dinners,

78
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:50,993
and we can switch tonight's menu with saturday'S.

79
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:52,711
Oh,dear.

80
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:53,992
These pans have been soaking all night.

81
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:55,201
Hey,hey,hey,hey.

82
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:56,183
I can do the dishes.

83
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:57,650
You get going.

84
00:02:58,235 --> 00:02:59,383
Thank you.

85
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:00,820
I should be home on the 6:00.

86
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:04,492
I told the temp agency I needed a strict 9:00 to 5:00 schedule.

87
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:08,660
Sick.

88
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:15,492
Even sicker.

89
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,622
I was surprised to hear from you,bud.

90
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:21,643
Haven't seen you since.

91
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:22,842
your party on the fourth.

92
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,342
Talk about fireworks.

93
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:26,720
I've been in new york the past month doing a little research.

94
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:28,313
Oh,yeah?What kind of research?

95
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:29,680
Nightlife.

96
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,853
I'm putting together my own spot here in chicago.

97
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:33,501
It's gonna be huge.

98
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:34,263
I believe you,bud.

99
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:36,510
Nobody puts together a party quite like you.

100
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm glad you see it that way,tommy,

101
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,520
'cause I'm looking for a few select investors.

102
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:41,911
How would you like to get in on the action?

103
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:42,820
Oh,I.

104
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:43,360
I don't know,bud.

105
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,992
I never really considered getting in on the business side of the club scene.

106
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,981
I'd kinda like to be able to just,you know,come out and play.

107
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:52,573
Imagine how much more fun it is when you own the playground.

108
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:57,031
Trine,talk some sense into your old man,this should be a no-brainer.

109
00:03:58,096 --> 00:03:58,981
Perhaps that's the problem.

110
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:01,683
Bud's looking for investors for his new club.

111
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,743
I'm calling it jet.

112
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:05,322
It's got a nice ring,huh?

113
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,142
Just pay a little buy-in and you get back a percentage of the profit.

114
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,580
How big a buy-in?

115
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,210
Lady's got a head for business.

116
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:13,292
She's seen a portfolio or two.

117
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:14,620
I tell you what.

118
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:17,703
Come in tonight,I'll comp the whole thing.

119
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:20,242
Bring your dancing shoes,your libidos,and your checkbook,

120
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,903
'cause I got a feeling you're gonna love this place.

121
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,641
Roger: Well,I've always been the guy you can count on.

122
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:28,613
Supportive husband.

123
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:31,003
Trustworthy friend.

124
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,692
Solid bowler.

125
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:36,641
that's who I am.

126
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:40,672
But lately.

127
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,482
I don't know.it,um.

128
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,322
just feels like there should be more.

129
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,630
Think I'm having a midlife crisis?

130
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:54,993
I think you're here because there's something that you very much need to talk about,

131
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,782
and I have a strong suspicion it's not your bowling average.

132
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:04,761
The only way to tackle a problem is to give it a name,roger.

133
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,923
susan.

134
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:20,093
Susan.

135
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,801
My wife's best friend.

136
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,930
I think I'm in love with her.

140
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:56,043
san is the friend your wife mentioned in our first session?

141
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,532
Yes.

142
00:05:58,537 --> 00:06:03,661
What is it about this woman that makes you think you love her?

143
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:05,560
I don't know.

144
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,206
It's,uh.

145
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:10,435
it's-it's hard to describe.

146
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,827
I just.

147
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,543
feel alive when I'm around her.

148
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:18,353
She's a great friend.

149
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:19,913
She's open-minded.

150
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:22,352
She's beautiful.

151
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:25,391
And we talk about things.

152
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,773
Real things.

153
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:28,743
She's,uh.

154
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:31,640
you should hear her laugh.

155
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:35,322
And I know that none of this is fair to janet.

156
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:39,541
She's a great woman,too.

157
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:42,793
And I do still love her.

158
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:47,933
It's just different with susan.

159
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:52,871
Friendship and marriage are two very different relationships.

160
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:56,630
They have separate sets of rules and expectations.

161
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,632
Shouldn't you be able to have both in one person?

162
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:05,751
Are you sure janet can't be that person?

163
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:07,833
I don't know.

164
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:12,993
Does susan know how you feel?

165
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:26,371
your old driver's ed book,huh?

166
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:27,673
Yeah.

167
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,912
I'm thinking about finally getting my license.

168
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:33,483
What happened to making a conscious decision to conserve energy?

169
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:36,463
Taking the el down to see doug is becoming a pain.

170
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:39,231
And he said he'd driving to practice,so.

171
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:41,030
I could take you driving.

172
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,610
I think that's a great idea.

173
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:46,811
Aren't you golfing?

174
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:48,363
We could do it after.

175
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:49,953
That's okay.Doug doesn't mind.

176
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:51,670
Neither do I.

177
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:56,211
Thanks,but he's expecting me.

178
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:58,540
Can't cancel at the last minute.

179
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,422
Don't say I didn't try.

180
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,693
Golf,huh?

181
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:10,573
I thought we were spending the next few days together.

182
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:11,951
Well,it's ermore country club.

183
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:16,011
I-I called in three favors to get a tee time.

184
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:25,363
Look,after this,I promise it's just you and me-- all day,all night.

185
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:28,603
There's gotta be a way for you to kill a few hours,right?

186
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:38,000
trina: So,how was your trip?

187
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:40,503
The family trip was a disaster.

188
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:43,423
Bruce and I fought the whole time about laurie and her teacher.

189
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:49,103
***********

190
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,820
Or and how are things now?

191
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:53,671
Laurie seems to really like him.

192
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:56,281
no,I meant how are things with you and bruce?

193
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:59,433
Us.

194
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:01,461
We're fine.

195
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:02,872
Really?

196
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:05,242
I think so.

197
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:15,890
So,we've decided to spend the last few days of bruce's vacation just focusing on each other,

198
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:17,971
trying to make up for lost time at the cabin.

199
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,323
Which is why you're here and he's out golfing.

200
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,320
He had a tee time.

201
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,821
but tonight it'll be just the two of us.

202
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:29,623
Well.

203
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:33,141
tom and I are on the list for the opening of a new disco downtown.

204
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:37,093
If you feel like escaping suburbia for a night.

205
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,753
no,I-I think we're just gonna try a night alone together.

206
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:41,813
Okay.

207
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:45,950
But if you get a wild hair,you know where we'll be.

208
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:48,041
Yeah.

209
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:55,440
you must be from the temp agency.

210
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:56,643
Yes.I'm janet thompson.

211
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,210
Henry fisher.

212
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:57,950
I manage the pool.

213
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:59,211
The girl you're covering's appendix burst,

214
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:00,770
so she's gonna be out at least a week.

215
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:01,580
Bathroom is that way.

216
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:02,430
Kitchen through that door.

217
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:03,270
Lunch is half an hour.

218
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:04,570
Work to be typed: Box on the left.

219
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:05,712
Work typed: Box on the right.

220
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:09,040
Mr.Malone blows a gasket if the girls aren't in their seats by the time he gets in.

221
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:10,271
If you're late,you're fired.

222
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:11,400
Got it?Great.

223
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,862
You sit there.

224
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:13,900
Henry!

225
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:15,393
Yes,mr.Malone.

226
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,580
Typo in the metro section.

227
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,011
Who covers it?

228
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:22,580
Pack it up,blondie.

229
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:23,632
who are you?

230
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:24,533
Uh,janet thompson.

231
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:25,131
She's a temp.

232
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:27,312
She's covering for brenda until she gets out of the hospital.

233
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:28,311
Words per minute?

234
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,363
One hundred.

235
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:30,200
You're hired.

236
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:31,302
Take vicky's seat.

237
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:32,922
Henry,you cover for brenda this week.

238
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,142
Might do you some good to remember where you came from.

239
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,721
Yes,sir.

240
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:44,931
Get used to it.

241
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:48,390
You'll never defeat me!

242
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:51,421
Samantha: Hey,bj!

243
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,931
And friend.

244
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,700
Uh,mind if i borrow your bike?

245
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,110
My cousin's visiting,and we're gonna head down to the beach.

246
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,443
That sounds fun.

247
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,052
If you're deaf.

248
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:03,643
You can come if you want.

249
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:04,831
We can ride dutch.

250
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:06,450
Lisa's really cool.You'll like her.

251
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:07,980
Cool.

252
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:09,351
Uh,hello?

253
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:13,881
I am not wasting a perfectly good summer day at the beach with two lame girls.

254
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:14,781
Well,don't come then.

255
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:17,272
Stay here and play with your little plastic dolls.

256
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:19,733
Sam!Come on!Let's blow this pop stand!

257
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:22,760
Hey!

258
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:24,063
I'm lisa.

259
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:25,312
Uh,bj,you coming?

260
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:26,730
Yes,he is.

261
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,943
I am.Both.w-we are.definitely coming.

262
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:33,860
Both of us.

263
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:45,293
Roger?

264
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:46,651
Susan.

265
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:47,760
Hi.

266
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,693
What are you doing here?

267
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,371
Well,janet started her new job today.

268
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,780
Temping at the daily sun typing pool.

269
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:56,342
She-she didn't mention that.

270
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:57,973
Well,it's just until I find something.

271
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,882
In the meantime,I'm giving her a hand around the house.

272
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,080
Tonight,it is.

273
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,651
chicken kiev.

274
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:04,543
Whatever that is.

275
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:07,920
let me help you.

276
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:10,283
I-I make it all the time.

277
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,413
It's pretty simple.

278
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,042
It really just consists of chicken breast with butter and parsley inside.

279
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:19,310
So,you just lay the chicken breasts out like this,

280
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:23,881
and then you season with salt and pepper.

281
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:25,750
Helps if you rub it in.

282
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:30,281
So,uh,ricky tells me you guys had an interesting time at the cabin last weekend.

283
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,241
Apparently,laurie ran away?

284
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:34,661
Yes,she did.

285
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:37,750
Do you remember,uh,the day of the scavenger hunt,

286
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:41,521
the guy at the grocery store who was collecting signatures with laurie?

287
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:42,443
Her teacher,right?

288
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:45,462
Yeah,and apparently,much more.

289
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:47,520
You're kidding.

290
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:49,531
I miss school.

291
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:53,673
well,bruce didn't take it quite so well.

292
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:57,040
It's not easy for him to see laurie growing up.

293
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:00,722
And it doesn't help that they're both so stubborn.

294
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:03,310
oh,I know all about stubborn.

295
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,043
Yeah.

296
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:09,591
Janet has got herself convinced that I'm smack in the middle of a midlife crisis.

297
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:11,871
Who knows?

298
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:13,980
Maybe she's right.

299
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:17,271
Maybe we're both having one.

300
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:18,461
No,I,uh.I-I...

301
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,861
I think I got you beat.

302
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:22,922
I'm standing in an apron making chicken kiev in the middle of the day 

303
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:26,160
while my wife's out earning a living.

304
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:30,053
well,if it's any consolation,you look very cute in that apron.

305
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:44,413
Susan.

306
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:47,160
why did you,uh,call the other day?

307
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:49,722
From the...from the cabin that afternoon?

308
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:52,901
Were you looking for janet?

309
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,663
No.

310
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:05,503
You know,I called you back later that night,but there was no answer.

311
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:09,321
We were out looking for laurie.

312
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:21,033
When I was skipping rocks-- or trying to-- well,I-I-i brought one back for you.

313
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:23,450
It's at home.

314
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:28,463
Susan,there's something I need to say to you.

315
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:31,512
Janet: Honey,I'm home.

316
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:34,953
What a day I had.

317
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:36,150
Susan!

318
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:36,942
What.

319
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:38,021
what are you doing here?

320
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,211
Oh,janet,I-I was just,um.

321
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:42,532
she came to help me with dinner.

322
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:46,202
That is so sweet.

323
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,052
Oh,roger,I'll take over.

324
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,112
Actually,we're just about finished.

325
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:54,500
the chicken's in the oven,and,uh,I have to run.

326
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,112
Oh,uh,well,um.

327
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:59,643
congratulations on your new job!

328
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,943
Sorry about the fish sticks.

329
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:12,812
I ran out of time running errands today.

330
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,032
No,it's fine.

331
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:16,060
Is it okay if I borrow your poker chips?

332
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,230
What for?

333
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:18,782
We're playing cards with sam.

334
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:21,782
Finally,some kid other than rick.

335
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:24,720
Rick'll be there,too,and sam's cousin.

336
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,080
Oh,who's this boy sam?

337
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:30,733
Sam is actually samantha who lives next door.

338
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,780
Though I-I haven't met her cousin.

339
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:33,840
Her name's lisa.

340
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:35,561
She's our age,too.

341
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:36,542
I think.

342
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:37,810
Double date,huh?

343
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:38,860
That a boy.

344
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,753
Don't lose any chips.

345
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,711
Or anything else.

346
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,632
Do you remember those days?

347
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:51,091
Everything so new and exciting.

348
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:54,653
All those firsts ahead of him.

349
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:59,071
Do you think our firsts are all behind us?

350
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,433
What do you mean?

351
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:06,892
First love,first child,first home.

352
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,763
Our 14-year-old son is on a date tonight,

353
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:14,583
and we're sitting in the kitchen eating fish sticks.

354
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:16,271
What would you like to do?

355
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,060
Maybe a movie?

356
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:21,592
Sitting in a dark theater,not talking?

357
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:23,593
Right.

358
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,792
I guess I could get out the scrabble.

359
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:29,960
Yeah,that sounds like a night with the thompsons.

360
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:40,113
Well,trina invited us to go dancing with them tonight.

361
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,050
Really?

362
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:45,261
Yes,but I told her that tonight was about you and i spending quality time together,so.

363
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:54,212
quality time doesn't necessarily have to mean alone time,does it?

364
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:00,462
hey,hot mama.

365
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,233
You ready to get down tonight?

366
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,041
You know it.

367
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,711
hello?

368
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:10,512
Nope.

369
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,392
Just about.

370
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:14,892
Can you be here in a half hour?

371
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:16,760
Great.

372
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:21,122
You think bud can add two more names to the list?

373
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,491
I like where your mind's at.

374
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,000
Who was that on the phone?

375
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,773
Susan and bruce.

376
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:30,310
They've been,um,having some rough times connecting to each other lately.

377
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,262
Thought it might be nice to take them out and show them a good time.

378
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:34,451
Oh,you did,did you?

379
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:36,310
How good a time are we talking?

380
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:42,593
Do ug: Press down on the clutch and slide the gear shift forward.

381
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:44,712
You mean the toilet plunger.

382
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,953
Okay,gently ease up on the green sponge

383
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:49,472
while simultaneously pressing down on the pink one.

384
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:50,300
Don't be shy.

385
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,890
You're just really gonna.

386
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:52,952
I'm not shy.

387
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,332
I'm humiliated.

388
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:57,272
You just smashed into that rolls royce that's right in front of you.

389
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,683
Fancy neighborhood you live in.

390
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:00,440
Okay,start over.

391
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,513
Turn the car on.

392
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:05,151
No.You forgot toswitch into neutral.

393
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:07,603
Maybe this would be slightly less embarrassing

394
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:09,860
if we were actually practicing in your car?

395
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:13,833
No one gets behind the wheel without passing a few preliminaries.

396
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:15,462
Here.

397
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,691
Right foot on the brake,left foot on the clutch.

398
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:20,593
Okay,slide the gear into first.

399
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:24,723
Okay,now,ease up on the clutch

400
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:29,271
while simultaneously pressing your right foot down on the gas.

401
00:18:30,398 --> 00:18:32,022
Now,uh.

402
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:34,731
or you could slide into second.

403
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,662
I do believe you're getting the hang of it,laurie.

404
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:41,061
You really are a quick learner.

405
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,580
Uh,it helps to have a good teacher.

406
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:04,622
So,how was work today?

407
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,293
Not what I expected.

408
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:08,073
You should see how disorganized the place is.

409
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:11,350
And so far,I can find no redeeming qualities in the head boss,mr.Malone.

410
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,773
Well,first days are never easy.

411
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:14,773
I'm sure you can handle it.

412
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:16,451
I am handling it.

413
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:20,101
As a matter of fact,they offered me a full-time position.

414
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:23,161
Please tell me that doesn't mean dad's cooking dinner from now on.

415
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,683
I can't eat this.

416
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:28,161
Roger,how long did you bake the chicken?

417
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:31,223
I forgot to set the timer.

418
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,273
Are you wearing your father's cologne?

419
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,643
Dad said it was okay.

420
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:40,710
Rick and bj have a double date tonight.

421
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:41,990
With girls?

422
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,101
We're just playing cards.

423
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:44,240
No,no.No.

424
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:45,773
I don't want you gambling.

425
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,510
I already told him he could go.

426
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:49,081
Well,now I'm telling him he can'T.

427
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:51,712
Well,so who wears the pants in this family anyway?

428
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,391
'Cause I know who wears the apron.

429
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:54,000
Rick!

430
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,561
How long are we going to live in this bizzaro world?

431
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:59,550
Just go,rick.

432
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:01,522
Took you long enough.

433
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:09,070
I'm gonna make us something edible.

434
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:17,982
I was trying to help,janet.

435
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:19,520
If you want to do something for this family,

436
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:23,701
you can start by making a real effort to try and find a new job.

437
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:25,380
I have been.

438
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:26,612
How?

439
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:29,541
By sitting around dreaming up the perfect career?

440
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:35,992
There comes a point when you have to stop wishing and start doing,roger.

441
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:37,511
go watch tv.

442
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:40,180
I'll call you when dinner's ready.

443
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:43,931
Tom,get over here.

444
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,303
Hold on,don't start without me.

445
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,143
okay,it's called "the new yorker.

446
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:51,440
" Now,it looks a lot more complicated than it really is,

447
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:52,821
so just follow us.

448
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:55,532
Okay,five,six,seven,eight.

449
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,912
********

450
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:08,182
Well,if I can do it,you can do it,come on.

451
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:09,760
Come on,bruce,at least give it a try.

452
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:11,941
Trina,help the poor guy out.

453
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:12,910
Come here,handsome.

454
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:13,653
Ready?

455
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:16,081
All right.

456
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:18,063
One,two,three.Okay.

457
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,311
not bad,right?

458
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:21,323
You're great.

459
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:24,150
Four,five,six,seven.

460
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:29,970
Right this way,mama.

461
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:30,610
Thank you.

462
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,611
Decker,party of four.

463
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:32,630
We know the owner.

464
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:34,270
Tommy d,you made it.

465
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:36,312
How about this,huh?Come on in.

466
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:37,653
Step aside,pal.

467
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,460
No,man.

468
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,442
Larry,get this guy out of here.

469
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,123
Uh,you think that's good for business?

470
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:45,823
Come on in.

471
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:47,370
You tell me.

472
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,503
Hey,bud,let me in.

473
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:06,803
drinks are on the house.

474
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:07,993
Tell them you're with me.

475
00:22:08,048 --> 00:22:10,962
Ladies,allow me to show you around.

476
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:13,393
We'll catch up with you boys later.

477
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,323
Hello,bruce.

478
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:19,261
Let's get a drink.

479
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:27,080
no offense,but I don't think I'm ever going to pass my driving test this way.

480
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:29,621
You're probably right.

481
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:34,342
Unfortunately,the only other option is getting in the car with my dad.

482
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:37,002
What's wrong with that?

483
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:40,312
Are you serious?

484
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,350
You met my father.

485
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:43,972
I didn't think he was all that bad.

486
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:47,432
Everything always has to be his way,and if it's not,it's wrong.

487
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:51,070
He's totally unreasonable.

488
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:56,131
He didn't seem so unreasonable when he let you go with me last weekend.

489
00:22:56,215 --> 00:22:58,943
He's strong-willed.

490
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,813
I can think of someone else I know who's like that.

491
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,453
I'm not like my fath.

492
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:07,830
I'm not saying there aren't differences,believe me,but.

493
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:15,133
one of the things I first noticed about you was how willing you were to learn.

494
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:18,283
So,maybe you should think of this as an opportunity

495
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:21,212
to learn a little more about your dad.

496
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:28,160
Disguised as a driving lesson?

497
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,503
it's a win-win.

498
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,730
It's good to see you and susan out and about again.

499
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:49,910
Yeah,it is good to be out and about.

500
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:58,472
Man.

501
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:01,512
Every night is an adventure with you two.

502
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,892
Tom: I'm glad you appreciate it.

503
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,180
Hey,pretty lady.

504
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:12,353
Uh,I better go and take care of this.

505
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:13,300
Relax.

506
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,180
Look how sexy our wives are.

507
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:17,901
Every guy on the dance floor wants to be with them.

508
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:21,271
Wait,except the ones who want to be with each other.

509
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:23,611
Right.

510
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:32,542
Excuse us,gentlemen,but I think I'd like her all to myself.

511
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:34,610
Lucky you.

512
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:37,122
It's best to browse before you buy.

513
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:39,450
Oh,I'm not shopping.

514
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,630
Well,they don't know that.

515
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:52,710
This is lame.

516
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:54,630
Let's make it more interesting.

517
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:56,480
You want to up the ante?

518
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,880
So to speak.

519
00:25:00,577 --> 00:25:01,903
Strip poker.

520
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:03,131
- Yes!
- I don't know.

521
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:07,810
Samantha?

522
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:10,102
Why not?

523
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:12,780
All right,ladies.

524
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:17,040
Get ready to get naked.

525
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:23,541
now,that's a party I can get down with.

526
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:25,812
Who wants a bump?

527
00:25:29,347 --> 00:25:31,032
Yeah,I think we're good.

528
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:32,741
You sure?

529
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:35,421
We're sure.

530
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,810
Trina.

531
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:43,551
you don't happen to have anything,uh,else,do you?

532
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:46,273
Perhaps something a little smoother?

533
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:56,231
quaalude,anyone?

534
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:03,560
Yeah,why not?

535
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:06,882
To enjoying each other.

536
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:21,110
Yep.

537
00:26:23,837 --> 00:26:26,090
I call.

538
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:34,993
Flush.

539
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,621
Full house.

540
00:26:42,315 --> 00:26:44,350
Take it off.

541
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:45,103
No way!

542
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:45,761
You cheated!

543
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:46,591
I didn't cheat.

544
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:49,481
She just didn't tell you her brother plays tournaments in vegas.

545
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,292
He taught me the basics.

546
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:54,131
what,what's the matter,rick?

547
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:58,002
You got something to hide,or is it that you have nothing to hide?

548
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,401
no way,I won these fair and square.

549
00:27:04,616 --> 00:27:06,080
Come on,rick,it's a joke.

550
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:07,423
Yeah.

551
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:10,730
Can I have my pants back now,please?

552
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,161
You're kind of cute when you're mad.

553
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,980
Aughs? you want to go inside?

554
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,582
may I?

555
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,433
roger.

556
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:37,550
I'm sorry I jumped all over you.

557
00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:41,113
I know you tried with dinner.

558
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,481
It's okay.

559
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,960
You had a long day.

560
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,393
Yeah.I did.

561
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,641
janet.

562
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:08,822
Are you happy?

563
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:11,370
What do you mean?

564
00:29:11,438 --> 00:29:14,073
It's not a trick question.

565
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:17,251
We're going through a rough patch.

566
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:19,410
It'll pass.

567
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,230
And what would it take to make you happy?

568
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:27,162
Today,right now.

569
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:36,390
What would make me happy would be for you to find a good job that makes you happy.

570
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:42,183
That's it?

571
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:47,262
Once that happens,everything will fall back into place,

572
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:51,012
and we can go back to exactly the way things used to be.

573
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:54,161
You'll see.

574
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:01,230
uh,I'm going up to bed.

575
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:03,243
You coming?

576
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:06,291
You go ahead.

577
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:07,412
I'm,uh.

578
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:10,033
I'm gonna finish the show.

579
00:30:43,495 --> 00:30:46,191
my god,it's so hot.

580
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:52,030
we do have a pool.

581
00:30:52,137 --> 00:30:55,313
Shall we all head back for a dip?

582
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:30,370
Show me what you got.

583
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,630
No,you show me.

584
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:34,510
I win.

585
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:39,811
rick,where are you going?

586
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:42,133
What happened?

587
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:44,112
Absolutely nothing.

588
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:47,180
What a blowhard.

589
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:54,151
Sam.

590
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:55,611
don'T.

591
00:31:55,676 --> 00:31:57,963
It's okay,I lost.

592
00:31:58,037 --> 00:32:01,432
I don't want you to.

593
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:18,210
Susan,wait.

594
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:20,893
You forgot these.again.

595
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:28,791
thanks so much for tonight.

596
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,331
We had a really good time.

597
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:32,750
It was our pleasure.

598
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:46,642
that was fun,right?

599
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,611
Yeah.

600
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:53,061
Let's go home.

601
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,242
Q good morning.

602
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:12,533
Good morning,henry.

603
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,781
Where are your to-dos?

604
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:17,311
- Done.
- Henry.

605
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:20,231
What's going on?

606
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:21,092
What do you mean?

607
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:22,031
This coffee.

608
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:23,313
W-what's wrong with it,sir?

609
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:24,413
It's good.

610
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:26,402
Henry told me exactly how you like it,mr.Malone.

611
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,822
You're all caught up,I see.

612
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:31,820
Yes,sir,henry stressed how important it is to stay on top of things at the daily sun.

613
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,780
Well.

614
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:35,043
keep up the good work.

615
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:37,572
With a ll due respect,if you touch my rear one more time,

616
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:40,580
my husband will come down here and kick yours.

617
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:42,202
Right.

618
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:43,853
Well.

619
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:46,643
get back at it.

620
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:50,062
Some people need to be reminded of their manners.

621
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:52,181
Look at you.

622
00:33:52,257 --> 00:33:55,993
Up and at 'em and ready to go,even after a wild night.

623
00:33:56,048 --> 00:33:57,613
you are so good.

624
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:01,030
I was just about to pay you the same compliment.

625
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:05,433
bud called.

626
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:08,670
He wants to know if we're investing in the club.

627
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:14,161
Tom decker-- jet pilot by day,jet club owner by night.

628
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,330
little on the nose,don't you think?

629
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,823
Yeah,but if this place takes off.

630
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:24,002
it might open up some new doors for us.

631
00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:25,100
How so?

632
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:27,983
Well,I never said I wanted to be a pilot forever,

633
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:31,150
and you know how much I hate leaving you.

634
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:34,480
I like that this gives us some options for the future,

635
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:36,991
but it's your call.

636
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:38,633
and technically it's your money.

637
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:42,671
babe,what's mine is yours,you know that,

638
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:45,873
and I like the idea of diversifying.

639
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:47,803
You're the boss.

640
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:49,883
You can order me around anytime you want.

641
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:54,520
Well,in that case.

642
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:08,751
I brought you and lisa some pop-tarts.

643
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,431
Oh,she's still asleep.

644
00:35:10,468 --> 00:35:12,693
I guess rick really wore her out.

645
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,262
Gross.

646
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:16,151
Did you see his face when he came out of your house?

647
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,812
Yeah,it was pretty red.

648
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:18,932
Did you talk to him?

649
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:22,912
Not yet,but,um,i had fun last night.

650
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:23,960
Thanks.

651
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:26,241
Me,too.

652
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:35,981
Susan,laurie and I are going out for a driving lesson.

653
00:35:36,026 --> 00:35:37,090
We'll be back in a few hours.

654
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:39,001
That's great.

655
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:40,390
Good luck.

656
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:11,332
So how was your card game last night?

657
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,710
Dumb.

658
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,183
Girls ruin everything.

659
00:36:16,897 --> 00:36:19,551
well,not the right girl.

660
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,832
Like who,mom?

661
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:25,032
What's that supposed to mean?

662
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:26,201
Nothing.

663
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:28,720
You're the one who married her.

664
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:33,652
That's right,I did.

665
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:41,001
You know,you,uh,you don't have to rush into anything,rick.

666
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:43,481
Don't worry about finding a girl yet.

667
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:45,650
Take your time and.

668
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:48,701
and be selective.

669
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:51,280
And,hey.

670
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:57,412
don't ever settle.

671
00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:59,541
Okay?

672
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:03,073
Yeah.

673
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:05,013
Sure,dad.

674
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:12,481
Hands at ten and two.

675
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:14,162
All right,what comes next?

676
00:37:14,348 --> 00:37:15,813
I check my mirrors and my blind spots.

677
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:16,802
No,no,n-no.

678
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:19,262
You signal that you're pulling out.

679
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:22,301
Good.

680
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:25,820
Now you check your mirrors and your blind spot.

681
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:31,250
and if there's a big enough opening,slowly pull into traffic.

682
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,422
- Stop!
- What?

683
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:37,382
What's wrong?

684
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:40,223
You almost pulled right out in front of that car.

685
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:42,281
Dad,that's like a mile back there.

686
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:44,273
I have been driving longer than you've been breathing.

687
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:47,130
I think I know a little more about it.

688
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,290
why do you think I'm always wrong?

689
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:57,962
You think I'm wrong about doug,you discount my political views,

690
00:37:57,996 --> 00:38:01,831
you won't even let me pull out into traffic.

691
00:38:01,918 --> 00:38:03,892
We both know that you don't have all the answers.

692
00:38:03,957 --> 00:38:06,911
Just look at you and mom.

693
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:10,212
Okay,no matter what you think you've seen,

694
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:15,551
you do not know everything that goes on between your mother and me.

695
00:38:15,617 --> 00:38:20,160
I'm not sure you do either,dad.

696
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,693
You don't have to worry about me.

697
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:30,782
I can take care of myself.

698
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:33,531
I know you can.

699
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:43,483
Do you know how proud I am of you?

700
00:38:43,577 --> 00:38:49,533
You are smart a-a-and beautiful and.

701
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:53,863
funny.

702
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,762
no.

703
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:01,652
dad,I didn't know.

704
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,033
then that is my fault.

705
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:10,592
and I am sorry.

706
00:39:16,115 --> 00:39:17,602
me,too.

707
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:24,201
Come on.

708
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:28,513
I think it's time you got that license.

709
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:38,103
roger.

710
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:41,000
What are you doing here?

711
00:39:41,398 --> 00:39:44,283
is anyone home?

712
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:46,500
No.

713
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,802
Come on in.

714
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:57,040
yesterday in the kitchen,I was trying to tell you something.

715
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:08,991
what is it?
