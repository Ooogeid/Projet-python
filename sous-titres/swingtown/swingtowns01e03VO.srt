1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,430
Previously on.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,140
why don't the four of us go someplace a little quieter?

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,500
Let's promise that it'll only be that one time.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,380
You got it.

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,170
We should have left the party with you and roger.

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,300
Why didn't you?

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,070
I'm so happy I met you,trina.

8
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,010
Me,too.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,080
Your dad's a perv.

10
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,450
He'll also be a murderer if he finds out we swiped these.

11
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,820
We can help you set up the tent.

12
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,780
Just leave it.

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,370
- It's a walkie-talkie.
- Thanks.

14
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,070
If you write a brief,honest review,I will bump up that grade on your essays.

15
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,860
Raise your hand if you think you might be able to come.

16
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,270
Great.

17
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,970
Anane,this.is laurie miller.

18
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,750
Anane directed the play.

19
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,920
Susan,bruce.

20
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,890
Sylvia and brad davis.

21
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,450
I miss susan.

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Then do something about it.

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,140
Janet.

24
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,600
What are you guys doing here?

25
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,410
Your pie is on the stoop.

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,620
hey,you're up early.

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,150
I rolled over and you were gone.I hate that.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,540
Sorry.

29
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,180
Sunday morning.

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,070
Thought we could.

31
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,740
sleep in a little.

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,430
Bruce,can you get the kids down here,please?

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,150
Kids,get down here.

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,130
you sleep okay?

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,920
Not particularly.

36
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,320
- Morning,bj.
- Morning.

37
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,740
Laurie.

38
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,150
What's going on?

39
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,440
Breakfast with your family.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,890
Sit.

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,360
Great.

42
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,910
Bruce,could you say grace,please?

43
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,160
uh,dear god.

44
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,930
thanks for the food.

45
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,080
And our family and friends,

46
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,850
and we ask that you bless this very big,

47
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,660
expensive house that we now live in.

48
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,880
Amen.

49
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,530
Amen.

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,660
Dad,I need you to take me to the bike shop today.

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
I think I bent the frame on my front wheel.

52
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,260
Uh,next weekend.

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,270
Your mother and i have been invited to a pool party across the street.

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,660
How am I supposed to get around without a bike?

55
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,860
Borrow your sister'S.

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,150
Sorry,I'm going to the library after this.

57
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,840
Actually,you're not.

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,370
You're coming to church with the rest of us.

59
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,610
Church?

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,830
When was the last time we did that?

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,210
Far too long.

62
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,590
Finish your breakfast and get changed.

63
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,240
and in genesis 2:23,pay attention to adam's words.

64
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,260
"You are the flesh of my flesh,bone of my bone.

65
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,360
" Notice there is no talk of the heart.

66
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,820
Love was not born in the garden,

67
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,570
but rather through the ordeal which followed.

68
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,220
By casting out adam and eve,god put the burden.of love 

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,470
squarely on the shoulders of man and woman.

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:08,270
Love is a journey,and we must follow where it leads,hand in hand.

71
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,620
Morning,janet.

72
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,810
Susan.

73
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,810
Been a while since we saw you here.

74
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,990
- Rog,how you doing?
- Hey,bruce.

75
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,160
Laurie,you look beautiful.

76
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,530
Thanks.

77
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,260
I'll be at the car.

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,400
Okay.

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,010
Come on,roger.

80
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,200
The lawn won't mow itself.

81
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,010
Ja-janet.

82
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,670
We're having a housewarming next weekend.

83
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,640
That's not much notice.

84
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,130
Which,which is why I-I need your help planning it.

85
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,050
I am lost.

86
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,730
A-and you made our first one so special.

87
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,300
Feels like a hundred years ago.

88
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,600
You really need my help?

89
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,540
More than you know.

90
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,230
Okay.Call me.

91
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,670
Bye.

92
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,460
Housewarming?

93
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,730
Ah,yes.

94
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,240
Shot of whiskey in the rib sauce.

95
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,410
- That is the secret.
- That's tequila,dear.

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,900
Ay,caramba.

97
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,660
- Here,you direct.
- All right.

98
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,680
I'm on grill duty.

99
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,100
john and cherie hyatt.

100
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,690
We spent new year's in rio together.

101
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,250
Thyou inwek 're wild?

102
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,760
Try spending a weekend with the two of them.

103
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,350
Boys and their toys,hmm?

104
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,470
Coming in?

105
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,880
I think I'll just dip my toes.

106
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,190
What kind of party is this housewarming tonight?

107
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,370
Yeah,I'm not exactly on the planning committee.

108
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,320
Janet and susan are kind of running the show.

109
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,980
Janet,mostly.

110
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,040
Janet?

111
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,310
Yeah.

112
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,310
You need us to,uh,pad the guest list a little?

113
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,750
Oh,there's brad and sylvia.

114
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,930
You remember them from the playboy club.

115
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,540
Sure do.

116
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,800
hey,hey.

117
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,160
oh,no.

118
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,780
- Not on camera.
- *****

119
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,410
She needs no encouragement.

120
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,050
Watch w here youpoint that thing.

121
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,910
I just might sue for invasion of privacy.

122
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,330
It's true; my wife's quite litigious.

123
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,060
Bruce,can I talk to you for a minute?

124
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,660
Someone's a little camera-shy.

125
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,300
That goes away.

126
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,210
Tom,how about a batch of margaritas?

127
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,070
What do you say,hon,a little hair of the dog?

128
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,800
- woof,woof.
- Susan?

129
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,140
Actually,I have a headache.

130
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,230
I think I might go home.

131
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,050
What's the matter-- too much sun?

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,680
just give me a minute; I'll get our stuff.

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,330
You know what,bruce?Why don't you stay?

134
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,820
It's a beautiful day.

135
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,220
No sense in both of us being miserable.

Honey.

140
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,870
God,i hate this wallpaper.

141
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,300
You mind telling me what just happened back there?

142
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,240
Who would put this in their home?

143
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,570
I'm going to call janet and cancel this housewarming.

144
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,770
The party was your idea,remember?

145
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,440
Besides,I already told tom and trina they could bring a few friends.

146
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Let me guess.

147
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,260
Brad and sylvia?

148
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,320
Okay.

149
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,640
uh,what's going on?

150
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,640
I found her card,bruce.

151
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,210
I know she slipped you her number at the playboy club.

152
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
- sylvia.
- Nobody slipped... 

153
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,110
anyone anything.We had fun with them.

154
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,590
I thought we might get together again sometime.

155
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,360
Get together and do what?

156
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,810
they're friends with tom and trina.

157
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,260
Not every friend of the deckers is a swinger.

158
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,180
Mom.Mrs.Thompson's on the phone.

159
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,510
Could you tell her I'll call her back,please?

160
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,770
She said it's important.

161
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,710
You know,whatever you're fighting about,mom's usually right.

162
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,880
Yeah,well,not always.

163
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,520
But usually.

164
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,430
I'M.

165
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,310
going to go return some books.

166
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,560
Susan,there you are.

167
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,870
I'm afraid we've hit a snag on the deviled eggs.

168
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,170
Apparently,meg walter's great aunt had a stroke,

169
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,080
so she has to go to milwaukee to place her in a home.

170
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,240
That's terrible.

171
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,880
On the bright side,I was never crazy about meg's eggs anyway,so.

172
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,240
I am nominating a new appetizer.

173
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,080
roger,could you turn that down?

174
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,280
Pigs in a pickle.

175
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,900
Pickles,rolled in philly cheese,wrapped in thinly sliced deli meat.

176
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,470
According to good housekeeping,it's all the rage,

177
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,240
but I wouldn't want to offend your fancy neighbors' palates.

178
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,840
It would take a lot more than pigs in a pickle to offend my neighbors.

179
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,340
Good,because I'm also making enough rosy perfection salad to feed an army.

180
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
Janet.

181
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,110
susan,are you there?

182
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,790
Thanks.

183
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,130
None of this would be happening without you.

184
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,110
You've been in that house two weeks.

185
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,530
I'd say it's time to warm it.

186
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,470
Okay,I'll talk to you later.

187
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,600
So.

188
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,160
I guess the party's still on.

189
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,420
Like a freight train.

190
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,100
Honey,I'm sorry I didn't tell you about sylvia's card,but.

191
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,070
I didn't think it was a big deal.

192
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,190
I mean,there's nothing going on,I promise.

193
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,130
Do you realize.

194
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,360
the first time we had sex I got pregnant?

195
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,310
we were kids.

196
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,480
We didn't know any better.

197
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,740
We do now.

198
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,500
Not sure I follow.

199
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,500
Sex has consequences.

200
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,340
Seeing you with another woman wasn't easy for me.

201
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,610
But you like trina.

202
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,090
I like her a lot,but ever since that night,

203
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,810
I can't help wondering what other women you want to be with.

204
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,020
I guess I just zeroed in on sylvia.

205
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,820
We made a promise to each other,susan.

206
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,450
The only woman I want.

207
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,210
is you.

208
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,630
what's wrong with your bike?

209
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,560
Oh,um,the chain came off and the gear crank is cracked.

210
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,680
The bike shop guy said it'd be 20 bucks to fix,so.

211
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,880
you're not running away again,are you?

212
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,240
Not today,anyway.

213
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,700
My parents are having this really lame party tomorrow.

214
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,310
Kind of a meet the neighbors thing.

215
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,940
I know; my mom's going.

216
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,750
Maybe if you're not doing anything,you could come,too.

217
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,490
do you want some help with that?

218
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,780
Yeah.

219
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,820
Here,take this end.

220
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,150
Oh,I can take those.Thank you.

221
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,780
Hey,laurie.

222
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,090
Mr.Stephens.

223
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,750
Oh,please,call me doug when we're not in school.

224
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,890
What's with the box?

225
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,250
I guess I could have read it.

226
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,880
Recidivism rates are double for inmates with low reading skills.

227
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,010
How about you?You must have a few books that have done something wrong.

228
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,330
Prison books,they're books for prison,so.

229
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,310
they do something wrong.

230
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,870
No,I get it.

231
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,140
And yeah,I've got books.

232
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,150
Lots of them.

233
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,800
Well,great.I'll be here all weekend.

234
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,670
Great.

235
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,580
Laurie?

236
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,410
Why didn't you hand in a review for waiting for godot?

237
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,150
I mean,you went all the way downtown to see it last week.

238
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm just curious why you never wrote the review.

239
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,930
I liked the play,but anane's production was a little overdone.

240
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,250
And I didn't see how slamming the teacher's girlfriend was going to get me extra credit.

241
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,540
Anane's not my girlfriend.

242
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,740
We dated for a little while in grad school,

243
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,250
but she's just a friend now.So.

244
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,290
we can both handle the truth.

245
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,140
So please.

246
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,980
feel free to write the negative review,all right?

247
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,520
Yeah,baby.

248
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,690
Show me those dishpan hands.

249
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,170
Would you put that thing away,already?

250
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,200
I thought maybe tonight could be.

251
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,270
movie night,if you're in the mood.

252
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,240
Something wrong?

253
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,950
I was just thinking about susan.

254
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,180
Yeah,she seemed a little off today.

255
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,960
Didn't she?

256
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,330
Remember what it was like our first time?

257
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,370
Oh,yeah.

258
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,450
really shook up the snow globe.

259
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,420
Took a little getting used to,seeing you with someone else.

260
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,750
Susan told me they madea pact to stay exclusive.

261
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,050
Bruce still seems kind of into it.

262
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,360
Well,there's a recipe for disaster.

263
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,280
Maybe they need a little friendly nudge back in the right direction.

264
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,740
Are you sure that will hold?

265
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,410
Well,if it doesn't,our next stage is a blowtorch.

266
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,630
Don't tempt me.

267
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,000
happy housewarming! 

268
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,300
- Hey.
- A fondue set.

269
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,160
Here you go,buddy.

270
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,370
Fondue makes a great centerpiece,and a terrific way to get people to gather.

271
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,480
The wine and cheese is cooking at my place as we speak.

272
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,150
You didn't have to do this,trina.

273
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,150
Well,I wanted to.

274
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,910
Honey,come in here.You have to see this.

275
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Look,they bought us a home movie camera.

276
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,380
Can you believe that?

277
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,520
No,I can'T.

278
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,160
You're gonna love it.

279
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,470
We have footage of every trip we've ever been on,every party.

280
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,480
Not to mention other more private moments.

281
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,610
Bruce,we can't accept this.

282
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,780
Oh,of course you can.

283
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,500
All we ask is that you put it to good use.

284
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,900
Come on,tom,they have a party to get ready for,

285
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,970
and I only have three hours to look fabulous.

286
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,080
Call if you need anything: Ice,booze,tripod,whatever.

287
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,270
ooh,now that's rosy perfection.

288
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,570
World-famous recipe.

289
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,900
I was talking about you.

290
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,660
Did you get the folding chairs?

291
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,480
In the car.

292
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,130
- Sterno?
- In the basement.

293
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,210
Okay,guys,september 1974,college coed issue.

294
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,590
I have personally inspected every girl in this pictorial.

295
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:29,390
I assure you,the student body is worth every penny you can cough up.

296
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,560
A dollar?

297
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,540
That's what it costs at the newsstand.

298
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,070
You stole it from bj's dad.

299
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,390
Not the point.

300
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,620
This is the last of the playboys.

301
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,070
We're not letting it go for less than five.

302
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,680
What's the grand total so far?

303
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,960
18 bucks.

304
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,180
What are you doing,rick?

305
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,910
I think the sterno cans are in the thanksgiving box.

306
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,470
Has ricky turned this basement into the bermuda triangle?

307
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,690
What is going on down here?

308
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,170
hi,guys.

309
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,530
You're early.

310
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,800
Could you get bruce,please?

311
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,120
There's something we need to discuss.

312
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,610
What's in the box?

313
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,370
First off,you are to apologize to mrs.Thompson right now.

314
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,950
Sorry,mrs.Thompson.

315
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,720
Rick.

316
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,230
after you've finished helping set up the party,

317
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,830
you are going immediately to the basement and cleaning it from top to bottom,

318
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,740
seeing as how much you like filth.

319
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,010
And you're grounded,young man.

320
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,320
You're not to leave this house for a week.

321
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,920
Is that clear?

322
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,080
We'll be in the kitchen.

323
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,780
I think now would be a good time for you to have that "talk" with your son.

324
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,580
Guys,you messed up,big time.

325
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,060
You stole something that didn't belong to you.

326
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,220
Something that,in fact,belonged to me.

327
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,950
A-and got caught.

328
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,400
Which is all bad,but it's what you stole that's the problem.

329
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,300
What's wrong with your husband

330
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,580
that he would even need that collection of smut?

331
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,080
Must be a nightmare for you.

332
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,020
There's nothing wrong with bruce.

333
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,390
Men are just different animals.

334
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,370
Roger would never bring that muck into our house.

335
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,860
Really?Janet,do you look in every drawer?

336
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,300
Of course.

337
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,130
So privacy doesn't matter at all?

338
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,980
Why would roger need privacy?We're married.

339
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,570
Boys your age are very impressionable.

340
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,520
Yeah,I mean,yeah,you shouldt n'be looking at girlie magazines.

341
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,070
You could be scarred for life.

342
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,790
"Scarred"?

343
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,840
Yeah,you see,these girls,uh,you know,

344
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,560
while fun to look at in the pages of a magazine.

345
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,940
they're not,they're not exactly.

346
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,350
real.

347
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,840
they call it "airbrushing.

348
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
" For all we know,I mean,

349
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,810
this centerfold could have a giant mole here or a tuft of hair or.

350
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,650
but the point is,some day you are going to meet and fall in love with a real woman.

351
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,480
And as a gentleman,it'll be your job to treat her with respect.

352
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,180
You see,real women.

353
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,320
laugh,and cry and,and grow old.

354
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,630
And have families.

355
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,150
The girls in these photographs are just a fantasy.

356
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,870
Right.

357
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,450
Hey,mrs.Thompson.

358
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,910
Bye,mom.

359
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,370
Laurie,where are you off to?

360
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,510
Book drive.

361
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,700
Why couldn't I have had a girl?

362
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,920
May I see?

363
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,320
Your nancy drews?

364
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,370
We read these together when you had the chicken pox.

365
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,240
Got to make room on the shelf somehow.

366
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,770
Time to move on.

367
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,670
Are you coming back for the party?

368
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,100
Onion dip and small talk?

369
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,910
It's not really my scene.

370
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,470
You guys have fun.

371
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,670
What exactly is laurie's scene?

372
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,010
I'm not sure I know.

373
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,150
You better start getting ready.

374
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,500
I told everyone 7:00 sharp.

375
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,950
here are my books.

376
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,580
Hey.

377
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,360
See what you got.

378
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,690
Black beauty and kerouac.

379
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,340
I was going for a theme of freedom.

380
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,030
You know,prison literacy and all.

381
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
Imprsiesve.

382
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,020
The library will be closing in five minutes.

383
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,640
Looks like I got here just in time.

384
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,750
Looks like they're about to close up.

385
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,490
Well,I'm going to be here all night.

386
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,650
The library gave me free reign to pull out any books

387
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,890
that haven't been checked out in five years.

388
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,440
I'm only up to the "bs.

389
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,130
want some help?

390
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,230
oh,yeah,sure.Why not?

391
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,920
sorry that took so long.

392
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,120
I was about to send up a flare.

393
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,110
Janet has a vise grip on this party.

394
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,940
There you are!

395
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,610
Um,everyone!

396
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,230
The guest of honor,my dear friend and co-host,susan,has finally joined us.

397
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,270
And I thought we would kick off this party with a little name game.

398
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,720
It's called "who am I?

399
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,940
" Everyone has the name of a famous person taped to their back.

400
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,670
And then you mix and mingle and ask people "yes" or "no" questions and learn who you are.

401
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,130
At the same time,you learn who they are.

402
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,930
Yoo-hoo?

403
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,620
Hey,everybody.

404
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,080
The cavalry has arrived.

405
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,420
Fondue,anyone?

406
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,250
Hi.

407
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,700
Good to see you,bruce.

408
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,590
Careful with this.

409
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,180
- It's the good stuff.
- Thank you.

410
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,660
Thanks for inviting us,susan.

411
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm so glad you could make it,sylvia.

412
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,180
Bruce.um,the music?

413
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,580
It's not my call.

414
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,990
Point me to the hi-fi.

415
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,250
That way.

416
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,020
Who wants to play a game?

417
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,680
it's called "forfeit.

418
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,510
" If a woman drops a cube of bread into the fondue,

419
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,990
she has to kiss someone other than her husband.

420
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,930
Oops.

421
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,230
uh,what if a man drops his bread?

422
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,440
Then he has to take a drink.

423
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,330
I think your dad's got a big one for your neighbor.

424
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,850
Ricky,it's time for you to go clean the basement.

425
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,820
Get your things.

426
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,870
I'll have your father get the car.

427
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,980
Look what crawled out of the woods.

428
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,860
Hey.

429
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,760
Hey.

430
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,760
Excuse me,little lady.

431
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,770
Bru!

432
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,400
Nice digs,miller.

433
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,220
What kind of salary you pulling down at the exchange?

434
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,300
Not nearly enough,mareno.

435
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,980
Come on,I'll set you up with a drink.

436
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,150
Hey,man.Who's the,uh...

437
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,660
who's the hot blonde?

438
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,180
She lives next door.

439
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,170
Hear she's a bit of a wild ride.

440
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,270
Well,hey.

441
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,710
love thy neighbor,right?

442
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,110
Right.Come on.

443
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,340
Stay out of trouble.

444
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,790
You look nice.

445
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,080
Thanks.

446
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,610
- There you go.
- Thanks,janet.

447
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,390
Oh,susan!

448
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,690
I picked the perfect person for you to be tonight.

449
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,170
Turn around.No peaking.

450
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,720
Do you think people are getting it?

451
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,900
I-I don't want to force people to play games.

452
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,920
Well,that's the whole point.

453
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,680
We make people socialize.

454
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,030
Otherwise,the evening gets too cliquey-cliquey.

455
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,220
There.

456
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,910
Emily post says cold hors d'oeuvres must be served two hours before serving hot ones.

457
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,160
Otherwise,they go to waste.

458
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,050
Swedish meatballs.

459
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,200
It's delicious,susan.

460
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,510
And they still will be half an hour from now.

461
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,680
It's a party,janet.Let people eat.

462
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,080
They are eating.

463
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,480
Pigs in a pickle.

464
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,240
And fondue,which goes great with swedish meatballs.

465
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,300
Know what?

466
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,380
They're just meatballs.

467
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,070
Put them out,or don't put them out.

468
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,940
You two fight it out.

469
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,580
It's 20 bucks.

470
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,950
You can use it to get your bike fixed.

471
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,930
Did you steal it?

472
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,340
Not exactly.

473
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,210
Why are you being so nice to me?

474
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,600
Dude,what are you doing?

475
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,100
Half that money is mine.

476
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,600
Itno,'s not.The magazines were my dad's,not yours.

477
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,110
And now I have to clean the whole basement because of it.

478
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,610
It's not my fault.

479
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,100
So,what,is she your girlfriend now?

480
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,200
What do you get for 20 bucks anyway?

481
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,980
Screw you!

482
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,790
get out of my room.

483
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,960
Get out of my room!

484
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,450
I hope she gives you crabs.

485
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,590
A princess and a movie star.

486
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,780
Grace kelly.

487
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,290
No wonder I had no idea who I was supposed to be.

488
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,450
Sorry.

489
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,110
Sometimes if you give janet an inch,she takes the whole nine yar .

490
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,630
Ds it's my fault.

491
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,990
I wasn't ready to throw a party.

492
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,600
I've barely even accepted that we've moved.

493
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,370
That makes two of us.

494
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
Well,I got to drive ricky back to our house,so,um.

495
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,850
hurry back.You're one of the few people I even know here.

496
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,850
Susan,I found six "who am I?" Signs on the floor.

497
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,090
She has completely taken over.

498
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,210
There's a way to bring energy to a party,janet,and there's a way to suck it out.

499
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,560
You would know all about that,wouldn't you?

500
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,610
The sucking part.

501
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,860
I can't help it if no one wants to play your silly game,janet.

502
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,390
Susan,she's out of control.

503
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,750
I'm just trying to have fun.

504
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,960
I don't like your definition of fun.

505
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,880
Calm down,janet.

506
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,040
Susan,she's ruining your party.

507
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,090
It's not my party,janet,and you know what?

508
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,000
It's not yours,either,or yours.

509
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,950
And that is not my wallpaper.

510
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,630
You might want to get your camera for this.

511
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,280
there.

512
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,680
anyone care to join me?

513
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,130
Hey,rog.

514
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,930
What the heck happened here?

515
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,350
Susan had what we would call a breakthrough.

516
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,650
hey,so I understand you live nearby.

517
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,530
Mm,right next door.

518
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,460
You got a husband?

519
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,590
what are you,a detective?

520
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,660
So,you like skiing?

521
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,610
In july?

522
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,220
Got a little bag of powder in my pocket.

523
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,910
Not here.

524
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,560
Follow me.

525
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,450
You are my only love.

526
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,200
"You have me completely in your power.

527
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,070
"I know and feel that if I am to write anything fine and noble in the future,

528
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,240
I shall do so only.

529
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,360
" well,I know it's james joyce.

530
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,800
Yeah.

531
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,580
Can you finish it?

532
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:30,200
Anything fine and noble in the future,I shall do so only by listening.

533
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,550
at the doors of your heart.

534
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,000
" I can't believe no one's checked it out in five years.

535
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,210
That is the world we live in.

536
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,780
Okay,I've got an easy one for you.

537
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,180
Okay.

538
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,100
"Go away from my window.

539
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,150
" That's charity,and you know it.

540
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,200
You have to finish it.

541
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,700
What's the rest?

542
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,660
"Go away from my window.

543
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,200
"Leave out your old shoes and spades.

544
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,430
What?

545
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,280
That's the worst dylan ever,and you messed up his lyrics.

546
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,480
You're wrong on both counts.

547
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,120
Lucky for you,there's no way to prove who's right.

548
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,100
Oh,but there is.

549
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,540
I want you to take this back.

550
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,330
Is it broken?

551
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,410
No.I just don't want it.

552
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,040
Why?

553
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,620
Because I never asked for it.

554
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,320
And because I don't need you looking out for me.

555
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,620
And.

556
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,070
because I'm not your girlfriend.

557
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,960
I never said that.

558
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,980
That was rick.

559
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,240
You should give him half the money.

560
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,290
No way.

561
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,350
I'm grounded because of him.He's being an ass.

562
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,300
It's because he's scared.

563
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,290
Of what?

564
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,670
it sucks when you're the one who's left behind.

565
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,530
well,I like that.

566
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,710
Janet?

567
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,610
I need to apologize to you.

568
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,780
I-I know how much work you put into this party.

569
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,620
Maybe next time.

570
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,660
you should call a caterer.

571
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,900
Clearly,you can afford one.

572
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,380
Do you remember our first housewarming?

573
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,450
We didn't even own a table.

574
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,610
Bruce and roger had to make one out of plywood.

575
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,350
And you and I sewed those old drapes into a tablecloth.

576
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,140
times sure have changed.

577
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,120
Not for me and roger.

578
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,580
I want you to write something on the wall in the living room.

579
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,770
I have nothing to say.

580
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,310
Since when?

581
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,680
It doesn't have to be nice.

582
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,430
It's all gonna get covered up with wallpaper anyway.

583
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,210
It would really mean a lot to me.

584
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,850
Susan?

585
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,680
What is this I'm eating?

586
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,940
Rosy perfection salad.

587
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,130
One of janet's specialties.

588
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,290
It's delicious.

589
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,360
Maybe we could exchange recipes.

590
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,260
five bucks.

591
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,140
I'm a schoolteacher.

592
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,030
I don't make that kind of money,so.

593
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,100
pay up,sucker.

594
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,330
I have a scar in the same place-- roller skating.

595
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,930
This is actually a burn.

596
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,690
I spilled hot lead,uh,from a fishing lure I was making.

597
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,650
It went right through the jacket.

598
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,930
I broke my thumb twice.

599
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,310
Now it clicks.

600
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,410
I'm a klutz.

601
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,200
that's not how I see you at all.

602
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,670
how do you see me?

603
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,260
I think.I think you.

604
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,490
windows show possibilities.

605
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,990
So,are we facing out,or looking in?

606
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,290
- Haven't decided yet.
- Careful.

607
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,560
Brad is rabid to psychoanalyze you.

608
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,900
So,what do you see?

609
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,200
May I?

610
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,260
The fondue game sure made a splash.

611
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,790
I'm pretty sure that's not what this party will be remembered for.

612
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,270
Well,susan kind of stole your thunder tonight.

613
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,220
As it should be.

614
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,500
How is everything between you two?

615
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,090
Eh,we're still feeling our way through it.

616
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,930
Everything shifted a little,you know,

617
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,300
since that night,but we're just holding on till it all settles.

618
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,850
Just don't hold on too tight.

619
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,250
Let me ask you something.

620
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,500
How many women have you been with?

621
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,110
Uh,truth?

622
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,560
Uh,two.

623
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,250
That's what I thought.

624
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,000
Was it that obvious?

625
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,900
Susan's one of a kind,bruce.

626
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,130
Make sure you always let her be that,and you'll be just fine.

627
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,880
Sorry.

628
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,430
****what it looked like.

629
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,580
Hey,it's none of my business.

630
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,680
S-susan and I have been.

631
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,200
experimenting.

632
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,480
- You mean you've been cheating.
- No.

633
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,510
Me and susan,and tom and trina.

634
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,680
on the fourth of july.

635
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,620
oh,come.

636
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,110
geez,rog,do I really have to spell this out for you?

637
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,420
How does an attorney sleep at night?

638
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
I don't know.How?

639
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,700
First she lies on one side,and then she lies on the other.

640
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,280
He can go on all night.

641
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,650
It's not fair-- there are more lawyer jokes than there are therapist jokes.

642
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,290
I'm not joking.I'm speaking from experience.

643
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,100
Have you ever been in a courtroom,susan?

644
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,450
Well,then,let me buy you lunch next week.

645
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,500
I'm in the middle of this knock-down,drag-out civil rights trial.

646
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,160
I know I already gave one to bruce,

647
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,610
but something tells me you're the organized one.

648
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,980
Maybe we could all have dinner.

649
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,130
******

650
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,600
Roger,there you are.

651
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,880
I've been looking all over for you.

652
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,140
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

653
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,470
Let me just say good-bye to susan.

654
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,090
I already said our good-byes.

655
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,660
any magazines for sale?

656
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,730
I got 18 bucks.

657
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,910
It's just like you,miller.

658
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,730
Showing up when the work's all done.

659
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,970
You're throwing away all our little league trophies?

660
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,400
They're just plastic.

661
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,700
It's not like they're worth anything.

662
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,960
Wanna see something?

663
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,180
our old fort making stuff.

664
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,770
Remember the one we made in fourth grade?

665
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,190
Took up the whole basement.

666
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,710
We spent the whole weekend down here.

667
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,570
You want to?

668
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,270
Nah.

669
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,880
We're too old.

670
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,240
Who cares?

671
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,870
No one's watching.

672
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,350
bruce.

673
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:25,660
I want us to be completely open with each other from now on.

674
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,540
Open,how?

675
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,210
All options on the table.

676
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,860
If you feel something,I want to know about it.

677
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,580
Good or bad.

678
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,820
That goes both ways,right?

679
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,270
*******

680
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,230
You put your finger on the trigger.

681
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,380
Like this?

682
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,480
like this?
