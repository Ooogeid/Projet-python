1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,190
Previously on swingtown:

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,030
You told him that rather than go home

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,840
and discuss the fact that he got fired with his wife,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,130
he should head over here and have a field day with the swingers.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,620
It wasn't like that.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,820
Susan,bruce.

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,090
sylvia and brad davis.

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,040
Brad is rabid to psychoanalyze you.

9
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,330
So what do you see?

10
00:00:17,398 --> 00:00:18,520
about the other night.

11
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:19,696
you were a perfect gentleman.

12
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,655
Not so perfect.

13
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,537
Mom,mr.Thompson,this is mr.Stevens.

14
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,600
doug.

15
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:28,973
He was my teacher over the summer.

16
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:31,053
What do you want to do next?

17
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,410
You slept with her,didn't you?

18
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:36,512
Oh,you can't seriously tell me you're jealous of bobbi.

19
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:39,680
You don't get to tell me how I feel right now.

20
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:44,842
I think we need to revisit the rules and be exclusive for a while.

21
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:48,940
Susan,what's the difference between richard nixon and gerald ford?

22
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,043
I don't know,brad,what?

23
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:51,460
Nixon couldn't tell the truth.

24
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:53,413
Ford can't tell the difference.

25
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,260
you think carter's any better?

26
00:00:55,318 --> 00:00:57,290
He's just plain nuts.

27
00:00:58,228 --> 00:00:59,751
- Nuts.- you know,peanut farmer?

28
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:01,773
- Oh,god.- Oh come on,that's funny!

29
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:04,141
Neither one of you should quit your day jobs.

30
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:05,613
But I will agree with one thing.

31
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:08,540
This country's two-party system is a total joke.

32
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:09,843
By this time tomorrow,

33
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:12,213
we'll know who the republican presidential nominee will be.

34
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:13,663
God help us.

35
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,161
If sylvia's gonna start stumping,I'm pouring another round.

36
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:18,200
Make mine a double.

37
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:21,372
everyone getting famished?

38
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:25,310
Bruce is on his second drink,and sylvia's starting to talk politics.

39
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:27,501
Oh,well,I better hurry this up.

40
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:30,463
You know,speaking of uncomfortable conversations,

41
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:33,031
have you spoken to janet since the party last weekend?

42
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:34,930
We had lunch.

43
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,340
I'm back to square one with her,aren't I?

44
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:38,281
Well,I wouldn't say square one.

45
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:40,433
I am the one who brought roger to the pool party.

46
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,071
You did nothing wrong.

47
00:01:42,128 --> 00:01:45,141
She still doesn't think I set out to seduce him,does she?

48
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:46,691
I'm not sure she ever really believed that.

49
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,521
I-I think that she.

50
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,891
felt more excluded than betrayed.

51
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:54,231
Might take her longer to forgive me than you.

52
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:58,380
You know,I might want to try to do something to smooth it over.

53
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:02,241
Maybe a pedicure or a shopping spree.

54
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:05,291
that's a great idea.

55
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:07,602
but you-you might want to.

56
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:10,003
think of something a little more janet.

57
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:11,593
Right.

58
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,622
I'll think of something.

59
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:32,740
can't remember the last time I saw you at the typewriter.

60
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,042
Must be serious business.

61
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,361
Just nailing down my options.

62
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:39,542
You know,I can still do 100 words a minute,

63
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,212
if you'd let me help.

64
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:45,402
At this stage,I'm really just brainstorming.

65
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:46,881
Roger,it's my future,too.

66
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:49,192
I-I-I want to help.

67
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,092
Firefighter... really?

68
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,741
did you ever look into any of those engineering schools?

69
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:02,773
I did.

70
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:04,963
There's a program at devry.

71
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:05,932
I applied for the fall.

72
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:06,933
You did?

73
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:09,122
In the meantime,I need to pay the bills.

74
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,532
Um,stockbroker.

75
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,002
now,there's a career.

76
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:15,651
have you mentioned it to bruce?

77
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,651
I'm meeting him downtown tomorrow to pick his brain a little bit.

78
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,282
Got anything else up your sleeve?

79
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:23,763
How about.

80
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:29,832
gravedigger?

81
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,340
It's almost time for barney miller.

82
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,222
I'm gonna get a beer.

83
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:42,020
"Sexual revolution in modern marriage" by brad davis.

84
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,711
"While long popular in urban circles,

85
00:03:45,798 --> 00:03:47,331
"a growing number of middle americans "

86

87
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,822
" Now,wherever did you get that idea?

88
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:58,003
I may have stumbled into your basement once or twice.

89
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:02,193
simon & schuster just optioned this article for a book.

90
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:05,202
- Congratulations.- Thank you.

91
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,550
Should make for some interesting research.

92
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:11,990
brad has an all-access pass to the pendulum club tomorrow night,

93
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,853
if anyone's up for an adventure.

94
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,193
The pendulum club?

95
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:16,120
That's the,uh.

96
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:18,582
the sex club on-on dearborn?

97
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:19,753
Sex club?

98
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,373
More like an erotic cabaret.

99
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,963
Tom and I sure picked the wrong month to close our marriage.

100
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:26,141
Wait,you mean you two aren'T.

101
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:29,810
turns out there are worse things out there than monogamy.

102
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:31,680
- Like what?
- Infidelity.

103
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:36,072
Seems that it comes down to the difference between swinging and cheating.

104
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:38,110
you know,I would like to interview you all for the book.

105
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:39,593
- Uh,no.
- I,uh.

106
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,662
no,uh,thanks.

107
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:47,291
Why don't we crack openthat bottle of brandy you brought,bruce?

108
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:48,913
Uh,yeah,great.

109
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,631
I'll go get it.

110
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,651
a toast.

111
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:56,561
To brad.

112
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:57,630
To brad.

113
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,080
To brad.

114
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:12,990
Bruce,you awake?

115
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,703
Yeah.

116
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,161
Do we need to talk?

117
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:25,461
Yeah,I-I think we do.

118
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:37,411
Look,I've been debating about telling you this,

119
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:40,323
'cause it's-it's not that big a deal.

120
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:43,460
I-I mean.or it shouldn't be.

121
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:46,470
I mean,we both slept with another couple this summer,

122
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:49,850
so it's-it's not like it's unprecedented.

123
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:54,101
Bruce,what are you talking about?

124
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:59,503
Remember the night of the blackout?

125
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:05,962
I-I wasn't out.

126
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:08,660
with the guys all night.

127
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:12,291
Where were you?

128
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,241
I went over to melinda'S.

00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:47,262
Susan,I'm really sorry.

133
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:49,041
You already said that.

134
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:50,772
All we did was kiss.

135
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,812
Already said that,too.

136
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:55,712
It was just that one time at her apartment.

137
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:58,422
And the train station.

138
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,701
right.

139
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:06,502
You know,I think I'd feel better if you'd just yell at me.

140
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:10,112
Bruce,am I glad you told me?Yes.

141
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,042
Do I wish it had never happened?

142
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:12,930
Oh,yes.

143
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,310
I'll talk to melinda today.

144
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:17,436
I will let her know in no uncertain terms that.

145
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:21,645
no.I don't want you to talk to her at all.

146
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:24,537
if you think you can manage that.

147
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,380
Okay,if that's what you want.

148
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,990
I'm meeting roger for a drink after work.

149
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:32,501
He asked to talk to me.

150
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,220
About what?

151
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:39,290
A job at the exchange.

152
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:46,113
It's just roger,I promise,and then I'm coming straight home.

153
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,492
Bruce.

154
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:02,222
I have a wild idea.

155
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:08,553
Why don't we meet brad and sylvia at the pendulum club afterward?

156
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:12,322
what,are you kidding?

157
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:17,331
I don't want this... whatever this is.sex... 

158
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:18,711
to control our marriage.

159
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:21,332
I want us to control it.together.

160
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:24,572
Just like that first night at tom and trina's house.

161
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,240
Tom and-and trina put the brakes on that-that.

162
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:30,521
I'm not saying we actually have to do anything with anyone.

163
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:33,031
I just.

164
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:37,051
I think it would be good for us.

165
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:43,010
okay.

166
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:50,481
Laurie,you're in charge of dinner tonight.

167
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm spending the night at rick's,remember?

168
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:53,570
And I'm staying at stacy'S.

169
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:55,392
I haven't heard stacy's name all summer.

170
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:57,993
Which is why we're getting together.

171
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,750
Where are you guys going?

172
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:01,653
Downtown.

173
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:06,590
was that dad?

174
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,111
Clean this up when you're done,please.

175
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:18,351
Trina.

176
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:19,051
I hope you don't mind.

177
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:21,253
I got your address from susan.

178
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:22,721
Well,it's a shame you didn't get my phone number.

179
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,691
Would've saved you a trip.

180
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:25,502
I made muffins.

181
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,251
Congratulations.

182
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:28,122
Janet.

183
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:32,372
I know you're upset,but if I can just talk to you for five minutes.

184
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:36,470
I haven't baked anything since high school home ec.

185
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:38,343
Pleae?

186
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:44,100
those suckers aren't coming out,are they?

187
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,523
I don't know what I did.

188
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,763
Well,usually.

189
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:50,000
there's,uh,these liners.

190
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:53,791
uh,or-or even just a shot of pam will do it,but.

191
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,552
here we go.

192
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,243
Oh,god.

193
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,120
You know,the tops are the best part anyway.

194
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,360
janet.

195
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:11,873
I'm sorry about that whole misunderstanding with roger.

196
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:15,121
That photograph you saw... all he did that day was swim and have fun.

197
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,133
Without me.

198
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:20,033
Well,losing your job is pretty major.

199
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:22,302
He was just blowing off steam.

200
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:23,713
I'm sure he wished you were there.

201
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,220
I'm not so sure.

202
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:31,213
I feel like roger's changing,and I'm not just talking about the job.

203
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:33,671
Well,people change.

204
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:34,651
They're supposed to.

205
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:36,001
Maybe people like you and tom.

206
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:38,512
And susan,but.

207
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:43,123
I'm not the kind of person who can find herself

208
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:46,452
by losing an earring in someone else's bedroom.

209
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:51,810
and trying something new shouldn't mean losing anything.

210
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:54,893
Susan and bruce have been in a moment of transition,

211
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,490
and sharing a new experience brought them closer together.

212
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:00,570
Same could be true for you and roger.

213
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:07,621
if you're suggesting roger and I,uh,then you've forgotten who you're talking to.

214
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:10,471
I'm talking to the woman who let loose up at susan's cabin,

215
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,482
and who watched deep throat with a bunch of strangers at our house.

216
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:17,172
Can't smoke pot and watch porno movies every night.

217
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:20,332
Besides,those weekends,that.

218
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,121
they weren't really me.

219
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:27,760
I think we all underestimate who the real janet is.

220
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,250
Thanks for meeting me,bruce.

221
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:35,213
You know,I never got the detail about what happened over at mutual.

222
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:37,671
Why'd they let you go after 12 years?

223
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,993
Guess I,uh,asked for a promotion on the wrong day.

224
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:43,180
Bastards.

225
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,093
How's all this sitting with janet?

226
00:11:46,177 --> 00:11:48,333
Actually,she's taking it pretty well.

227
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:49,961
Just wish I'd told her sooner.

228
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:51,340
You know what's funny?

229
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:55,462
Sometimes,you know,it's never as bad as you think it's gonna be with women.

230
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:56,282
What do you mean?

231
00:11:56,366 --> 00:12:00,672
I had this little indiscretion,uh,with a girl from the firm,melinda.

232
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:01,961
the one from the scavenger hunt.

233
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:03,723
nothing happened.

234
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:05,411
Nothing much.

235
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:10,302
But I felt so guilty about it,I ended up telling susan last night.

236
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:12,042
How'd she take it?

237
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,541
Really well.

238
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:17,062
So well we're going to the-the pendulum club.

239
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,652
You know that place?

240
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:21,112
We got invited by some friends of the deckers.

241
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:22,030
Oh,so it'S.

242
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,701
it's like A.

243
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,511
and susan wants to go?

244
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:26,220
Yeah.

245
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:28,992
I don't know if I'm being set up or what,but.

246
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:34,501
anyway,uh,what is it that can I tell you about the options exchange?

247
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:39,972
Oh,um,I guess just what kind of job opportunities there might be.

248
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:42,592
Now,I'm not looking for any special favors.

249
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,413
I got no problem starting at the bottom.

250
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:47,872
You telling me you want to be a trader?

251
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,151
Well.

252
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:51,341
I'm open to it.

253
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:55,551
All right,I-I-I can put in a word,but,um.

254
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:59,101
uh,can I be honest?

255
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,461
You're not exactly a born risk-taker,rog.You know?

256
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:05,570
Some guys are.Some aren'T.

257
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:10,093
But-but working on that floor,a guy can lose your shirt in an afternoon.

258
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:13,661
I'd hate to think I was setting you up for a fall.

259
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:17,143
Yeah,no,I,I hear what you're saying.

260
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,100
Probably not that guy,am I?

261
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,723
I'll grab us a couple more drinks.

262
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,182
Pete,two more.

263
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:31,851
You realize you have more john denver albums than my mother.

264
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,570
I knew I liked her.

265
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:36,071
How does she feel about roxy music?

266
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:38,382
I think you might have her there.

267
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:49,291
Ugh,the republicans are choosing their nominee tonight.

268
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:52,993
I know,that convention ought to be fascinating.

269
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:54,930
I say this with confidence:

270
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:59,342
There is nothing fascinating about gerald ford or ronald reagan.

271
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,543
Morbidly fascinating.

272
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:05,163
I thought weyou re a conscientious objector to television.

273
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:08,653
This is a rare exception.

274
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:11,161
So let's do it.

275
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,841
We could watch it at my place.

276
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,490
My parents are downtown for the night,

277
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,840
and my brother is staying at a friend'S.

278
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,492
I don't think so.

279
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:23,553
Come on,what better place to watch the republican national convention

280
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:27,361
than in an actual republican living room?

281
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:33,413
ah,susan!

282
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:36,853
You look great.

283
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,760
Bruce and I are going to the pendulum club tonight.

284
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,171
You are?

285
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:41,921
What brought that on?

286
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,753
Bruce kissed melinda.

287
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:47,412
Twice,actually.

288
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:52,831
And I guess he's been to her apartment,too,so.

289
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:56,143
oh,susan,I'm so sorry.

290
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:00,042
He said nothing more happene,and I believe him.

291
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:02,690
I don't think it's anything more serious than A.

292
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,581
work crush.

293
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:06,342
Like tom and that stewardess bobbi.

294
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:08,333
If bobbi had a brain.

295
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:11,603
Are you sure going to the pendulum club is the right move?

296
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:17,263
Not at all,which is why I was hoping you and tom might join us.

297
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:19,452
Uh,susan,tom and I are.

298
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:20,971
taking break for a while.

299
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:23,872
I could really use you tonight for moral support,

300
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:26,561
just like a tour guide.

301
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:29,610
If bruce is feeling tempted,

302
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:34,163
it's something I want him to share with me,not hide from me.

303
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:35,141
Well,in that case,

304
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:38,682
the pendulum club might be the perfect place for you and bruce to shake this off.

305
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,423
I'll call tom.

306
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:47,330
janet!Hi!

307
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,390
Susan.

308
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:50,831
hello.

309
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,661
Trina brought me muffins this morning.

310
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:55,820
Your tin.

311
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:57,582
Plus some liners for your next batch.

312
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:59,281
I wrote down a few of my favorite recipes,

313
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:01,543
and if could offer a tip?

314
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,003
Apple sauce.

315
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:04,323
Makes them unspeakably moist.

316
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:05,693
Apple sauce?

317
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:08,031
I'll be sure to remember that.

318
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,770
Well,don't you look nice.

319
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:17,843
Oh,well,we're heading downtown to meet tom and bruce.

320
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:21,572
Oh,well,uh,don't let me stop you.

321
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:25,941
No,janet,I would have invited you,but this club we're going to.

322
00:16:25,997 --> 00:16:28,233
wouldn't want someone like me for a member?

323
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:32,913
Maybe you shouldn't underestimate me,susan.

324
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,343
If roger's still with bruce,

325
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:38,632
we could call and they could meet us at this club.

326
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,030
I-I mean unless there's a dress code.

327
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,802
oh,there's a dress code.

328
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:48,273
Why don't we pick something for you out of my closet.

329
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:49,423
Really?

330
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,901
Well,if we're going to do this,let's do it.

331
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:56,240
There's a few things you need to know about the pendulum club.

332
00:16:58,148 --> 00:16:59,743
Pendulum club?

333
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,442
Don't worry.

334
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,191
Just stick close to us.

335
00:17:15,257 --> 00:17:16,341
well.

336
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:19,173
this ought to be one for the scrapbook.

337
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:25,502
Trina,how nice to see you.

338
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:26,743
Good evening.

339
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:29,873
I can't believe I told roger to meet us here.

340
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,220
Susan,trina.

341
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,402
Sylvia.

342
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:38,243
Isn't this place a scream?

343
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:39,321
I could scream.

344
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:40,911
Sylvia,you remember janet.

345
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:42,720
Of course,from the deep throat party.

346
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,450
Harry reems absolutely adored you.

347
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:47,603
Well,uh,please tell him I said hello.

348
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:59,391
I do believe there's a unicorn on your tail,my friend.

349
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,222
In this place?You shouldn't joke.

350
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:04,732
I'm talking about that smoking hot single woman who comes out of nowhere,

351
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:08,491
looking to play,and trots off just as fast.

352
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:11,062
Aren't you a doll.

353
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,813
Good luck,pal.

354
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:16,340
Where's brad?

355
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,930
Oh,he's over there,interviewing couples.

356
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,702
I see you don't wear a wedding ring.

357
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:22,783
I'm going to go find my husband.

358
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:34,750
so,here we are.

359
00:18:34,837 --> 00:18:36,852
This is a little out there,isn't it?

360
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:38,550
A little?

361
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:40,001
Come on.

362
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,223
Never a dull moment,huh,babe?

363
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,972
I feel like a kid in a candy store.

364
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,412
In andcuffs.

365
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:48,352
Yeah,and not the fun,fuzzy kind.

366
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:49,761
Hi,tom.

367
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:54,702
I'm digging this whole fish-out-of-water vibe.

368
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:55,660
Very sexy.

369
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,650
I,uh,I actually.

370
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,982
I really haven't ever been here before.

371
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,601
Neither has my wife.

372
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,943
Which one is she?

373
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:04,191
The brunette headed this way.

374
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:06,400
First-timers.

375
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,110
I'm janet,roger's wife.

376
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:11,830
Lucky girl.

377
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:15,860
How about a tour of the back room?

378
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:22,381
Miller.

379
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,190
It's about time you showed up.

380
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:25,982
Oh,samantha and I were just hanging out.

381
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:26,951
Hope it's okay.

382
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:28,503
Yeah,yeah,it's cool.

383
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,421
You see guys I told you there'd be chicks here.

384
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:31,593
This is samantha.

385
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:34,450
Samantha,this is a bunch of nimrods.

386
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,203
You ever played pong?

387
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:39,010
Yeah.

388
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:41,422
Dollar says samantha kicks your butt.

389
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,691
Reset the game,losers.

390
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,312
We.have another sucker.

391
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,272
that's it.

392
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:57,731
Ford versus carter in november.

393
00:19:58,305 --> 00:19:59,913
Are those people faking it?

394
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,650
No one could get this riled up about gerald ford,

395
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:04,821
I mean,in a good way.

396
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:05,620
I'm riled up.

397
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:07,443
Democrats just dodged a bullet.

398
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,843
Reagan would have been a far better candidate.

399
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:11,800
You like reagan?

400
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,361
He's a born politician.

401
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,742
Had this gone the other way,

402
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:17,502
reagan might have been the new leader of the free world.

403
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:20,951
Why are we always calling our president the "leader of the free world"?

404
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:23,843
Did anybody ever check with the president of france about that?

405
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:25,671
Do you even know who the president of france is?

406
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:27,041
Giscard d'estaing.

407
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:29,273
That is so hot.

408
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,693
it's pretty fascinating,isn't it?

409
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:44,870
Makes our night at the playboy club seem like a girl scout meeting.

410
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:46,492
Call me anytime if you want to talk some more.

411
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,351
My service will track me down.

412
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,511
Hey,thanks.

413
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:50,312
Nice!

414
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,102
You getting what you came for,hon?

415
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:53,771
Best-seller material.

416
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,331
You catch the guy in the judge's robes walking around?

417
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:58,933
He actually has a seat on the illinois state supreme court.

418
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:00,920
His wife is a stenographer.

419
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:02,881
You never can tell with people,can you?

420
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,503
That's what keeps me employed.

421
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:05,602
Yeah,I'm gonna go to the men's room.

422
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,823
If I'm not back in five,you send out a search party.

423
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:14,560
Bruce is adorable,you know.

424
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:17,121
Brad's pretty charming himself.

425
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,593
Do what I can with what I got.

426
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:22,671
You're quite something,too,susan.

427
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:24,221
Oh,I don't know.

428
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:25,633
Compared to these people,I.

429
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:27,173
Are you kidding?

430
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:31,471
Brad couldn't stop talking about you and bruce for weeks after we met.

431
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,070
We both did.

432
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:35,843
I think you two are the interesting ones.

433
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,570
You lead such.

434
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:40,781
glamorous lives.

435
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:43,813
Well,it's nice to know we're all mutually intrigued.

436
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:46,901
Game point!

437
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:00,091
Pleasure doing business with you.

438
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,080
Come on,jimmy connors.

439
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,291
One more?

440
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,523
Forget it.

441
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:05,922
That's all my money.

442
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,533
I should probably get home anyway.

443
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,513
It's early.

444
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:14,081
There are plenty of other games we can play.

445
00:22:14,177 --> 00:22:16,233
Like what?

446
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,981
Spin the bottle.

447
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:30,732
uh,no unescorted males allowed.

448
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:31,641
Sorry,daphne.

449
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:33,943
Our friend bruce doesn't know all the rules.

450
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:36,481
Well,hello,strangers.

451
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:37,983
We haven't seen you here in forever.

452
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:39,682
Tom and I are laying low for a while.

453
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:42,241
We're,um,not participating.

454
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:43,362
Pity.

455
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,431
Look,I suppose a quick peak is out of the question?

456
00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:47,882
Right.Okay.

457
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,113
you want to take him back with you?

458
00:22:58,297 --> 00:22:59,740
it's your chance,pal.

459
00:22:59,807 --> 00:23:01,230
Actually.

460
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:05,401
I've invited brad and sylvia to come home with us.

461
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,712
Brad really wants to interview us,

462
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,912
and I told him if they came back to our place for a drink,

463
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:10,881
we'd see how it goes.

464
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:12,642
What?

465
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:15,110
You-you mean that-that.

466
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,672
Okay.

467
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:24,042
Trina,have you seen janet and roger?

468
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:26,440
Uh,no,come to think of it.

469
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,872
I'm sure they probably left.

470
00:23:28,936 --> 00:23:31,591
Why don't you two catch a ride with brad and sylvia,

471
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:34,670
and we'll make sure roger and janet get home?

472
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:37,910
Thanks,trina.

473
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:44,502
Kind of makes you feel like a parent on prom night.

474
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:47,163
we have to get out of tore,hem.I'm dying.

475
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:49,630
Bye.

476
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,811
I just gave the virgins a tour.

477
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:56,101
Oh,roger,there you are.

478
00:23:57,155 --> 00:23:58,273
Where's janet?

479
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:00,120
My god.

480
00:24:00,657 --> 00:24:02,233
Why don't we get you two home?

481
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:02,831
That's okay.

482
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,003
We have our car.

483
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,792
We must go forth from here united,determined.

484
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,221
You're right.

485
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:14,910
Reagan is way better than ford.

486
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,303
Yeah,but now carter has a shot at it.

487
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,751
oh,my god,my parents are home!

488
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:30,442
What?

489
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:32,211
Holy cow.

490
00:24:32,276 --> 00:24:33,333
Get th tv!

491
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,613
I thought you said they weren't coming back until late.

492
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:40,982
The kids are out for the night,so we have.

493
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:42,661
we have the place to ourselves.

494
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:47,492
oh,my god,they're not alone.

495
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:52,653
Com look at the new wallpaper.

496
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:55,883
Not that your caricature of me went unappreciated.

497
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:57,172
That's not a caricature at all.

498
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:59,150
It's a significant piece of art.

499
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:02,092
I hate to think of you all covered up under there.

500
00:25:02,156 --> 00:25:03,550
Who's up for a drink?

501
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:04,420
What do you got?

502
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:07,272
Uh,I could whip up some gin and tonics?

503
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:08,271
The bar's in here.

504
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:09,372
I'm a little ginned out.

505
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,372
Do you have any,um.

506
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:12,221
- crap!
- White wine or.

507
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:14,313
In the kitchen refrigerator,bruce.

508
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:16,060
I don't believe this.

509
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:18,081
Uh,right this way.

510
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:20,792
Looks like a bomb went off in here.

511
00:25:20,858 --> 00:25:22,363
Kids.I'm sorry about the mess.

512
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:23,631
Just don't let brad see.

513
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:25,473
He's a bit of an obsessive-compulsive.

514
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:26,361
A what?

515
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:28,351
He likes things neat.

516
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:33,321
I,on the other hand,don't mind a little mess.

517
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,363
What the hell is going on?

518
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:43,991
oh,god,what a fantastic song.

519
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,950
reminds me of this time brad

520
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:50,092
and I were in the haight at some completely out-of-control shrink party

521
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,733
where everybody was taking lsd.

522
00:25:53,357 --> 00:25:56,523
I had an out-of-body experience listening to this song.

523
00:25:56,586 --> 00:25:58,992
The lawyer lady took lsd?

524
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:02,282
Tell me you don't think of me as the lawyer lady.

525
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,151
I'm getting past it.

526
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:05,570
Cheers.

527
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:14,910
Don't mean to interrupt.

528
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,101
Oh,no,no,no,that's fine.

529
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:18,362
Apparently we're entertaining.

530
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:19,740
Come on in.

531
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,671
I just,uh,wanted to get my dress and return yours.

532
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:25,232
Roger!You're here.

533
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:27,933
excuse me.

534
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:30,430
uh,actually,we're-we're not staying.

535
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,802
One dance.

536
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:34,261
You won't even have to do anything.

537
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:41,443
So,tell me,what does modern marriage mean to a woman like you?

538
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:44,780
I don't know.

539
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:48,813
I guess a modern marriage is one that is.

540
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:52,492
equal,and open to change.

541
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:54,370
Interesting.

542
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:56,371
Is it passionate?

543
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,581
Yes.

544
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:00,830
How passionate?

545
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:07,621
are you asking me.

546
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,623
how often or how intense?

547
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:13,582
We have to get out of here,or I'm going to scream.

548
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:15,290
Please,don't scream.

549
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,440
I'm in hell.

550
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:26,493
Trina,uh,there's some sort of.

551
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,773
stain on your dress?

552
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,430
Don't worry about it.

553
00:27:32,405 --> 00:27:34,110
Did you take all these?

554
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:37,050
A while ago,most of them.

555
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:39,593
This one's recent.

556
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:44,040
I took it the day tom and i decided to close our marriage.

557
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:46,122
You mean,not,uh.

558
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:47,391
not be with other people?

559
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:48,720
For now.

560
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:50,521
This picture reminds me why.

561
00:27:50,645 --> 00:27:53,033
Have you always had this honesty compulsion?

562
00:27:53,145 --> 00:27:55,672
I used to love dissecting stuff in school...

563
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:59,111
pulling all the layers apart and seeing what's underneath...

564
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:01,042
so,yeah,I guess.

565
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:02,873
You know,I think I had you all wrong.

566
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,781
You seem like you want to be the center of attention,but.

567
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:08,783
you're an observer.

568
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,780
I guess I underestimated you,too.

569
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:20,580
People are always more interesting when they think no one's looking.

570
00:28:20,926 --> 00:28:23,712
You should be proud of yourself for going to that club tonight.

571
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,702
It was a big step.

572
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:28,073
I-I only did it for roger.

573
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:31,283
Here goes nothing.

574
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:36,083
Sorry.

575
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:39,330
I'm not spending two minutes in the closet with a dude.

576
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:52,631
whatever.

577
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,160
Let's go.

578
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:59,291
Ain't no better way don't start the timer until the door shuts.

579
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:12,373
don't think I'm kissing you.

580
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:14,350
Who says I even want to?

581
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:16,210
Good,'cause I'm not.

582
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:18,252
Why'd you even come here?

583
00:29:18,328 --> 00:29:20,273
Because bj asked me to.

584
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:23,983
oh,bj.

585
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:25,480
What's that supposed to mean?

586
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:27,830
He's ust got a thing for strays.

587
00:29:27,947 --> 00:29:31,741
Lame dogs,abandoned cats,broken birds.

588
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:33,103
He can't help himself.

589
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:33,853
I should know.

590
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:36,112
He's been my friend my entire life.

591
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:42,210
Yeah,well,it's pretty obvious how you feel about him.

592
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,891
At least to me,and that's fine.

593
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:47,420
Nobody's trying to take him away from you.

594
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:52,051
Whoa,sam.

595
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:53,521
Where you going?

596
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:56,581
Dude,what the hell did you do?

597
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:57,422
Nothing,man.

598
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:58,381
She tongued me.

599
00:29:58,515 --> 00:30:00,332
And then punched you?

600
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:02,051
Sam?

601
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,072
I did this on the door.

602
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:11,613
So what's with this whole season of passion theory?

603
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:12,742
What's that about?

604
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,441
Brad thinks that human sexuality is perennial.

605
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:17,022
Like flowers.

606
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,323
I like to categorize my wife as a hothouse orchid.

607
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:23,272
she's always in bloom.

608
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:26,573
what about you,brad?

609
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:28,623
Do you have a season of passion?

610
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,583
He's deciduous.

611
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:36,550
this is ridiculous.

612
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:37,671
Let's just walk out there.

613
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:39,031
We'll deal with this like adults.

614
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:40,533
Are you insane?

615
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:42,841
we'll say I was helping you.

616
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:43,722
With what?

617
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:47,401
Some kind of philosophy emergency?

618
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:49,943
okay,what about the truth?

619
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:52,560
We came to watch the gop nomination,all right?

620
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,882
Maybe your dad would be cool with that.

621
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,932
- oh,my god.
- What?

622
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:59,902
Are they smoking pot?

623
00:31:05,978 --> 00:31:07,763
what do you think?

624
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:12,330
I think we should go for it.

625
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:13,661
Yeah?

626
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:16,883
Don't you?

627
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:33,183
what?Go!

628
00:31:33,645 --> 00:31:35,350
Just-just hang on.

629
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:37,563
Let's take this in the other room.

630
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:43,842
why?

631
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:46,132
What's going on?

632
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:35,041
everything okay out here?

633
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:37,123
Uh,fine.

634
00:32:37,677 --> 00:32:39,780
It's just getting a little.

635
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:41,010
close in there.

636
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:43,791
Roger's just having a good time.

637
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:47,223
Don't make this something bigger than it is.

638
00:32:48,478 --> 00:32:51,402
I used to think I knew what he needed,but.

639
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:54,163
if what's happening in there is what he needs.

640
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:58,783
whatever's going on with him can include you,and it's better if it does.

641
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:01,532
that'S.

642
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:06,841
people might see roger that way.

643
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:12,852
I,on the other hand,am not the kind of person any one of your friends would.

644
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,412
want like that.

645
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:23,711
You are a beautiful woman,janet.

646
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:25,430
Don't you ever forget that.

647
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:29,730
Roger is a very lucky man and he would be a fool not to know that.

648
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:35,111
A little attention from someone else is only going to bring it all back to you.

649
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:36,943
All right.

650
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:39,101
I'll see you back in there.

651
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,001
Uh,roger,could I,uh.

652
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:02,090
Uh,yes,yes,you may,definitely.

653
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:02,972
Can.

654
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:04,453
um,excuse me.

655
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:10,602
Um,I'm,uh,going to go home,so,um,

656
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:13,370
I'll need the keys if you're going to stay.

657
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:15,682
You mean without you?

658
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:19,732
I don't think I can follow you into this,roger.

659
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:22,223
I tried,but,um.

660
00:34:22,288 --> 00:34:24,182
whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,janet.

661
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:26,212
I don't know what it is you think I'm interested in here,

662
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:28,910
but this whole night was your idea.

663
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,540
Well,what do you want?

664
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:35,743
Well,it isn't a damn unicorn,that's for sure.

665
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:38,911
What?

666
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,292
Janet.

667
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:50,093
let's go home.

668
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:55,162
Okay.

669
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:56,621
Bye.

670
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:07,920
so bruce and I.

671
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:11,010
we were thinking that.

672
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,863
maybe if you and sylvia.

673
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:20,090
We actually haven't done this a lot.

674
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:24,470
You know what I could really go for right now?

675
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:28,360
What?

676
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:32,180
An omelet.

677
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:36,160
How's it going in here,kids?

678
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:40,903
***making an omelet

679
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:42,252
You guys want cheese?

680
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:44,290
Cheese sounds great.

681
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:47,131
He mostly likes to watch.

682
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:50,202
Brad is what you would call an "emotional voyeur.

683
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:52,180
" Come on,bruce.

684
00:35:54,316 --> 00:35:58,352
yeah,um,uh,c-could we just,uh.

685
00:35:58,415 --> 00:35:59,391
whoa,uh.

686
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:03,131
h-hold on a second.

687
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:05,931
You like the light on,huh?

688
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:08,382
Give brad a better view,is that what you like?

689
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,150
Laurie?

690
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:15,112
uh,what is going on here?

691
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:17,221
Who is this lady?

692
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:19,890
This is sylvia davis... a friend of mine and your mother'S.

693
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:21,361
Who is this?

694
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:22,753
Uh,doug stephens.

695
00:36:22,836 --> 00:36:24,100
I'm sorry.Doug who?

696
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:26,310
Doug stephens.

697
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:27,672
We were watching the convention.

698
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:29,752
How old are you?

699
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:30,852
Honey.

700
00:36:30,926 --> 00:36:33,562
right,um,susan,bruce,we'll call you.

701
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:35,452
Uh,yeah,I should,uh,get going,too.

702
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:37,772
Uh,laurie,mr.And mrs.Miller.

703
00:36:37,797 --> 00:36:39,991
Where is my jumpsuit?

704
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:47,413
Sam,hold up.

705
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:49,430
Leave me alone.

706
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,493
Whatever rick said,he's an ass.

707
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:52,281
I swear.

708
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:53,440
I don't need your pity.

709
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:56,353
Okay?I'm not some stray animal you need to take care of.

710
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:58,931
What did he say to you?

711
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,413
I don't go to parties.

712
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:01,773
I don't drink.

713
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,861
And I don't play stupid kissing games.

714
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:04,960
Good.

715
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,731
Me neither.

716
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:15,323
Come on!Hurry,hurry,let's go!

717
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:17,060
Right behind you.

718
00:37:33,008 --> 00:37:35,091
I think that's everybody.

719
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:37,943
Everybody that's fit to drive anyway.

720
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:43,110
I guess she wiped herself out with all that dancing.

721
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:45,973
Looks like she scared roger and ayt awjane.

722
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:49,523
Oh,I think I might've had something to do with that.

723
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:52,233
Never mind.

724
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:55,633
such a waste,huh?

725
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:57,671
Perfect unicorn.

726
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:04,370
There's only one unicorn in my book,baby.

727
00:38:20,146 --> 00:38:21,393
you can't ground me.

728
00:38:21,486 --> 00:38:23,102
I'm practically an adult.

729
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:27,131
"Practically" and "actually" are two very different things.

730
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:28,341
How old is he anyway?

731
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,681
What's the difference?

732
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:33,200
Do I need to remind you what you two were doing at my age?

733
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:33,881
Laurie.

734
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,952
he's making doug sound like some sort of creep.

735
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,820
He is a philosophy professor.

736
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:42,203
And where the hell did you meet a philosophy professor?

737
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:47,552
Oh,no.

738
00:38:47,638 --> 00:38:48,311
Wait.

739
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:49,800
He's your teacher?

740
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,572
Not anymore.

741
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:53,561
It was summer school.

742
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:54,672
Oh,that is it.

743
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:56,650
What is that,some kind of threat?

744
00:38:56,705 --> 00:38:58,160
What about what you two were doing?

745
00:38:58,237 --> 00:39:00,381
Getting stoned with those freaks,about to.

746
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:01,353
watch it!

747
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,933
No,she's right,bruce.

748
00:39:08,165 --> 00:39:11,801
What,what has happened to this family?

749
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:13,803
Ever since we moved into this house...

750
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:16,423
I mean,no wonder our kids are off the rails.

751
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:20,900
All right,the buck.

752
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:22,743
stops here.

753
00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:24,913
We are taking back control of this family.

754
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,001
there's going to be a lot of changes around here.

755
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:31,273
What is that supposed to mean?

756
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:36,870
I don't know yet.

757
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,782
I have to think on it.

758
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:44,471
Mom?

759
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,931
We'll talk about this in t morning.
