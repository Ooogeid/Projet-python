00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,130
Previously on Swingtown...

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,440
- I'm pregnant.
- you're....

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,520
Haven't told him yet.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,680
I don't want to hide what we have,Laurie.

5
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,020
I'm turning down the position.

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,680
Sam's coming to live with us in Naperville next week.

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,640
She's moving away?

8
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,580
My mom's gonna try to get legal custody.

9
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,670
I got the job.

10
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,920
That's fantastic.

11
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,640
I need to know how you feel about me.

12
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,130
I want you to take the job in Cincinnati.

13
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,680
I can't stand the thought of not seeing you every day.

14
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,080
Is the window still open?

15
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,800
I've got to go back to the office-- I left my briefcase.

16
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,480
It's got all of today's receipts.

17
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,800
You are one sexy little lady.

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,770
Some hot water,a little butter...

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,060
and I will gobble you right up.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,850
Are you flirting with a lobster?

21
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,510
Who says I'm talking to the lobster?

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,640
Here's the next batch,Captain.

23
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,800
Is that the rest of the clams?

24
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,770
Yep,right off the plane,100 pounds of them.

25
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,970
Where do you want them,Captain Decker?

26
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,320
Right where you're at's fine.

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,940
I still got ten boxes of seaweed in the truck.

28
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,050
Well,you can't have a clam bake without seaweed-- bring it on in.

29
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,980
Littlenecks,cherrystones,quahog.

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,150
How long were those sitting on the tarmac?

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,550
Since when did you get so squeamish?

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,960
That's the aroma of fresh Bar Harbor,Maine,baby.

33
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,970
Smells more like Davy Jones' locker.

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,560
Glad Susan agreed to store some of those at her house.

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,830
I can't believe it's already Labor Day weekend.

36
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,720
Have to say I'm kind of looking forward to the change of seasons.

37
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,950
Really?

38
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,030
I kind of like the idea of an endless summer.

39
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,170
Just you and me,the sunshine and all that beautiful tan skin of yours.

40
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,240
Clam hands,dear.

41
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,660
Excuse me.

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,180
What's that smell?

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,050
Mothballs.

44
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,460
I'm pulling our winter clothes out of storage.

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,050
It's a little early for that,isn't it?

46
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,220
You know how quickly the weather can turn.

47
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,270
One day,it's warm and sunny,next thing you know,you're freezing to death.

48
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,110
Did you get all your work done last night?

49
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,200
Last time I looked at the clock,it was past midnight,and you still weren't home.

50
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,350
Yeah,I'm sorry.

51
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,160
Uh,I guess I lost track of time.

52
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,410
Guess so.

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,800
Yeah,and I'm running late again.

54
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,350
Could you drop me at the train?

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,550
Just take the car.

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,460
Don't forget your briefcase-- it's right there.

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
Pack your bags,I want you out of this house immediately.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,020
Those are the only words a four-time philanderer like your husband might actually hear.

59
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,680
It's time to grow a spine and toss the swine.

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,190
Would you believe the original response advised this poor woman to hang in there with that creep?

61
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,190
I was up half the night rummaging through old Dear Trudys

62
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,770
and found at least a dozen reckless replies to women like "Weeping in Wheeling."

63
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,610
Is that the same phone call from before I got in the shower?

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,690
Henry,I have to go.

65
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,270
I'll see you at the office.Bye.

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,800
Oh,dear,look at the time.

67
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,540
Henry and I got carried away on Dear Trudy.

68
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,600
Don't worry,you have absolutely nothing to be jealous of.

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm not jealous of Henry.

70
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,880
I was just expecting a phone call.

71
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,080
Falstaff Properties?

72
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,020
Roger,have you ever heard the old saying,No news is news?

73
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,510
I've heard,"No news is good news." 

74
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,620
I just want you to be prepared in case it isn't.

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,790
Actually,they already offered it to me.

76
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,710
Oh,my goodness,that...

77
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,460
that is terrific.

78
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,090
Why on earth didn't you say something?

79
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,650
I wanted to sleep on it,make sure it's what I wanted.

80
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,710
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,720
I thought this job is exactly what you wanted.

82
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,020
It is.

83
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,530
And I'm going to accept it.

84
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,940
- But there is one thing.
- What?

85
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,660
We're moving to Cincinnati.

89
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,160
That bad?

90
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,330
I think an actual hair of the dog is the only thing

91
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,790
that could make that drink look more disgusng.

92
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,960
It's a Prairie Oyster.

93
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,210
Real breakfast of champions.

94
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,950
Someone should inform Bruce Jenner.

95
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,560
How'd it go when you got home last night?

96
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,440
Any trouble with Susan?

97
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,670
Uh,she was already asleep.

98
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,850
I think.

99
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,530
Well,that's good-- at least you didn't have to make up a story.

100
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,080
I did that when I left in the first place.

101
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,250
And not a very good one.

102
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,160
She's not stupid,Melinda.

103
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,360
Can't imagine you would have married her if she were.

104
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,320
Still,I'm glad you called.

105
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,220
It was nice just talking to you.

106
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,370
Yeah.

107
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,220
But next time we get together,maybe we should find somewhere a little more private.

108
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,790
Uh,the bell's about to go off.

109
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,740
You need another Prairie Oyster to get you going?

110
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,940
I think I'm good to go.

111
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,080
So am I.

112
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,280
Janet,there you are.

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,490
Sorry,I'm...I'm a little late.

114
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,730
Ten minutes early is only late for people like you and me.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,370
Ah,not so fast.

116
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,710
Life and Style editor asked to see you the minute you walked in,

117
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,010
which is already one minute ago.

118
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,890
He did?

119
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,280
I gave him your writing sample.

120
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,440
Oh,Henry,I...

121
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,940
I wish you hadn't done that.

122
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,820
Well,if wishes were fishes,then beggars would ride.

123
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,230
Horses.

124
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,120
If wishes were horses,then beggars would ride.

125
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,400
Fishes makes no sense.

126
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,320
But it rhymes with wishes.

127
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,680
This is why you're the writer.

128
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,730
Go,go,go,you don't want to keep Mr.McColl waiting.

129
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,080
"Once again,Mayor Daley is facing...

130
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,760
questions of ethics versus efficacy.

131
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,040
" Mind your Ps and Qs,Lorraine.

132
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,530
Well?

133
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,230
Mr.McColl loved it,didn't he?

134
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,150
Actually,he didn't.

135
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,940
- He didn't?
- No.

136
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,180
But,apparently,Mrs.McColl did.

137
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,350
And?

138
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,460
He wants to publish it.

139
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,670
He offered me the column-- on a trial basis.

140
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,240
I knew it.

141
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,150
Way to go,Janet.

142
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,590
I turned him down,enry.

143
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,580
I suppose physics could be interesting,

144
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,340
but do I really want to take advanced calculus my senior year?

145
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,440
Do you need it to graduate?Well...

146
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,890
I don't need any of this to graduate.

147
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,460
I finished my requirements this summer.

148
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,760
I could take nothing but PE and study hall and still go to Northwestern.

149
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,860
But you wouldn't do that.

150
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,140
You're brilliant,and you like a challenge.

151
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,610
Well,that's why I have you.

152
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,220
So,have you figured out what you're gonna be doing while I'm slaving away in advanced calc?

153
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,880
Nope,and I have to say it feels good.

154
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,230
At this moment,I can do anything.

155
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,010
I could...

156
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,570
I could find another teaching job,I could write a book,I could learn a craft.

157
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,450
What,like making furniture?

158
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,940
I would love to make furniture.

159
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,700
I had an idea once for this really cool chair.

160
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm serious.

161
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,360
No,it had a headrest so I could...

162
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,130
I could lean back and think,and then it would swivel.

163
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,260
Hey,Liz,what's up?

164
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,920
There was an earthquake in Guatemala City.

165
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,890
20,000 people are dead.

166
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,300
That's terrible.

167
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,650
Has anyone heard from Dave?

168
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,580
Who's Dave?

169
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,530
He's my roommate from grad school.

170
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,870
He's in the Peace Corps.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,620
I'm sorry,Doug.

172
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,250
Well,that ought to do it.

173
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,930
Iced tea?

174
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,310
Don't mind if I do.

175
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,420
Susan,thanks for letting us keep some of these little monsters at your house.

176
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,220
I'm sorry about the smell-- blech.

177
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,070
If you don't like seafood,why are you having a clam bake?

178
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,480
Tom's been closing out the summer with this party since he was a little boy.

179
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,640
My dad used to fly puddle jumpers full of Maine lobster up and down the coast.

180
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,240
It's a Decker family tradition.

181
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,790
Well,I better get down to the beach and start digging that fire pit.

182
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm trying to imagine Tom as a little boy.

183
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,230
He's really just a big kid anyway.

184
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,810
He sure is.

185
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,130
So...

186
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,370
how did everything go between you and Roger at Janet's birthday?

187
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,160
Fine.

188
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,940
We're never seeing each other again.

189
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,700
- Susan...
- Oh,it gets better.

190
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,020
I think that Bruce is officially having an affair with Melinda from his office.

191
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,470
Well,why would you think that?

192
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,520
I caught him on the phone asking someone if "the window was still open,"

193
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,230
and a few minutes later,he was headed downtown to pick up his briefcase,

194
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,320
and he didn't get home till after midnight.

195
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,130
Oh,it could just be a misunderstanding.

196
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,340
Bruce is a terrible liar.

197
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,820
His briefcase was sitting in our hallway the entire time.

198
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,430
Have you confronted him?

199
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,920
No.

200
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,110
What if he says yes?

201
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,180
Then you'll both deal with it.

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,740
Trust me,the longer you wait,the worse this will get.

203
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,170
You should have a garage sale.

204
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
We could really cash out on all this crap.

205
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,980
I'm leaving tomorrow,so...

206
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,910
We could do it when you get back.

207
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,340
The last guy my mom was with...

208
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,930
he was really into tropical fish.

209
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,150
I'm pretty sure it still works,if you want it.

210
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,810
Lisa,check it out.

211
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,810
Is Lisa gonna do me before she leaves?

212
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,150
Does it have a message that says,"You wish"?

213
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,100
Things are looking up.

214
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,890
Here,give it a try.

215
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,690
Ah,I hate these things.

216
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,070
Come on.Just one question?

217
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,280
Don't bet on it.

218
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,110
You didn't even ask it anything.

219
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,980
Yeah,I-I did.

220
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,370
It's our moms.

221
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,040
This ought to be good.

222
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,480
- Hi,Mom.
- Hi,kids.

223
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,930
Having fun?

224
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,220
Laugh a minute.

225
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,200
We're just helping Samantha find her suitcases.

226
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,850
I hate you,Maggie!

227
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,300
Sam,look...

228
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,040
I know this is hard,but we found a fantastic facility to help your mom with her...

229
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,900
problems.

230
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,380
I spent some time there myself,didn't I,sweetie?

231
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,300
Look at me now.

232
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,920
You'll have her back in no time.

233
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,640
You'll see.

234
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,700
Gail!

235
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,490
Heard that before.

236
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,950
After my dad left.

237
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,470
Mom!

238
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,640
Melinda.

239
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,000
Susan.

240
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,330
I was looking for my husband.His office said I could find him here.

241
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,740
You just missed him.

242
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,780
See you,Melinda.

243
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,580
Maybe it's just as well.

244
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,900
Maybe you're the one I should be talking to.

245
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,460
Why don't I get us a drink.

246
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,530
Thanks so much.

247
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,890
- How do you know that?!
- It's confidence,all right?

248
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,920
Vodka soda okay?

249
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,310
It's a different world down here,isn't it?

250
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,630
All this...

251
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,930
testosterone and bravado.

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,790
Takes a certain kind,I guess.

253
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,650
Not many women get to see men the way you see them,in their element,

254
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,190
like this,away from their families.

255
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,790
I suppose you're right.

256
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,950
Do you remember the night we met?

257
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,780
You called my husband one of the good ones.

258
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,180
I meant it.

259
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,940
You also told me that you didn't mind doing certain things to get ahead.

260
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,670
Is that what you're doing with my husband,using him to get ahead?

261
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,120
Bruce is a smart guy.

262
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,280
If that was the case,he'd see right through me.

263
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,720
So is it just something you're doing for fun?

264
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,720
We haven't slept together,if that's what you're asking.

265
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,700
Then what are you doing?

266
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,370
We're a lot alike,Bruce and I.

267
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,300
We're both ambitious,analytical.

268
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,450
We like a quick read.

269
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,850
Like to take risks.

270
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,930
With one key difference: Bruce is married.

271
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,730
We have children.

272
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,560
We have history.

273
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,480
I know.

274
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,200
Do you?

275
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,360
Maybe not fully.

276
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,090
I hope you do one day.

277
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,930
I hope you know exactly.

278
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,130
Are you in love with him?

279
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,850
In love,no.

280
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,040
But we definitely have a connection.

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,860
Do you?

282
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,250
Do I what?

283
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,380
Do you feel connected to Bruce?

284
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,200
That is none of your business.

285
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,920
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,640
It's just that Bruce told me that he doesn't feel like you get him lately.

287
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,370
I have to go home.

288
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,750
You don't have any right to do this!

289
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,660
It's the only way.

290
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,860
You're not my mother!

291
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,350
Yeah,that's right; Mom's six feet under.

292
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,100
Which is exactly where you're headed,Gail.

293
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,980
No!

294
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,040
That's your stash?

295
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,790
Give me that!

296
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,980
Look at yourself,Gail.

297
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,670
This is no way to live.

298
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,460
I've been there.

299
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,660
Do you want Samantha to end up the same way we did?

300
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,430
Fine.

301
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,560
Take everything!

302
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,400
Dump it all!

303
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,430
But you're not taking my daughter.

304
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,100
Oh,and then who's gonna take care of her these next six weeks while you dry out-- Stu?

305
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,230
Jesus,you can't even take care of yourself,let alone a teenage daughter.

306
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,330
You need the program!

307
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,670
Why?!

308
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,020
Because I like to have a good time?!

309
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,310
All right,so did you,before you became a righteous bitch!

310
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,180
You just think you're so much better than everyone else.

311
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,530
Oh,that's ridiculous.

312
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,650
You know what?!You can go to hell!Leave me alone!

313
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,270
4:00 train arriving from Chicago on track two.

314
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,280
Susan.

315
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,070
Did you,uh,get a job,too?

316
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,590
Lot of that going around.

317
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,570
No.

318
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,770
I,uh,I had an appointment.

319
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,110
Don't suppose Janet was on the train?

320
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,640
Is she usually on the 4:00?

321
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,700
The office said she left work early today.

322
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,640
So I figured I'd come down here and try and meet her,make sure she's all right.

323
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,910
Why,uh,why wouldn't she be?

324
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,610
I accepted the job in Cincinnati.

325
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,080
Good for you.

326
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,530
Janet didn't take it so well?

327
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,440
Uh,you know,we've lived here our whole lives.

328
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,380
It's not an easy thing to wrap your head around over breakfast.

329
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,500
No.I suppose not.

330
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:10,200
Uh,do you,do you think you might make it to the Labor Day party tomorrow?

331
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,350
We'll try to stop by,but I'm,uh,

332
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,420
I'm actually flying out tomorrow night to start house hunting.

333
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,330
Well,this is all really good news.

334
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,700
She's bound to see that.

335
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,020
I'm proud of you,Roger.

336
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,370
Tell Janet to call me,okay?

337
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,130
Yeah.

338
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,040
Janet.

339
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,740
Sorry to drop by unannounced.Yet again.

340
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,780
this is for you.

341
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,880
What is it?

342
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,800
I saw it in a window on my way home from work and thought of you.

343
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,460
Come on in.

344
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,640
I wish someone had given me a copy when I was raising Ricky.

345
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,730
Course,at the time,I was bound and determined to do it all on my own.

346
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,960
Under normal circumstances,I would simply march over here

347
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,370
and show you how it's done,but seems I won't be around nine months from now.

348
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,070
Uh,perhaps even one month,so...

349
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,850
What are you talking about?

350
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,030
Uh,Roger took a job in Ohio.

351
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,600
You're kidding me.

352
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,610
Wish I were.

353
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,360
He's flying down to look for a place for us tomorrow.

354
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,870
Never mind that my entire life is here-- my home,everyone I care about.

355
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,680
Janet.

356
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,360
What am I going to do?

357
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,780
Tell Roger you don't want to go.

358
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,390
I can't do that.

359
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,140
I'm his wife,and I took vows to support him.

360
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,160
What do you see?

361
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,080
A Convair 880 twin jet?

362
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,070
What year does it say?

363
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,930
- 1976
- Right.

364
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,100
Not 1954.

365
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,970
Father doesn't necessarily know best anymore.

366
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,230
You have a say in this,Janet.

367
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,190
We're trying to figure out what's going on in Guatemala,

368
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,220
and I figured you're a newspaper,so you might be getting information.

369
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,370
Yes,I'll hold.

370
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,120
What are these?

371
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,220
 Lobsters.

372
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,150
I mean,what are they doing here?

373
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,260
Waiting to be boiled.They're for the Decker's party tomorrow.

374
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,570
They're gonna kill them?

375
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,420
Then eat them.

376
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,500
BJ,could you go someplace else,please?

377
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,060
Yes,I'm still here.

378
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,550
Is there anything you can tell me?

379
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,640
Okay.

380
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,250
I will.Thank you.

381
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,570
They're trying to confirm details over the AP wire.

382
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,510
She said to call back in an hour.

383
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,880
20,000 people are dead,all I can find are stupid game shows.

384
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,480
The hell's the matter with this country?!

385
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,060
Laurie,what's going on?

386
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,400
Mom,Doug's friend teaches English in Guatemala.

387
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,090
There was an earthquake this morning.

388
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,720
I'm sorry for barging in,Mrs.Miller.

389
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,720
I don't have a TV.

390
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,780
No,it's all right.Is your friend okay?

391
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,710
Nobody knows.

392
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,860
I've called everywhere I can thinof,and no one seems to know anything.

393
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,480
I need to go.

394
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,290
Where?

395
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,770
- I don't know,but I have to do something.
- I'll go with you.

396
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,160
No,you stay here.The news should be coming on soon.

397
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,700
I'll call you later,all right?

398
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,980
Okay.

399
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,500
Man,you wouldn't believe the holiday traffic on Lake Shore Drive.

400
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,010
It took me nearly two hours to get home.

401
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,060
Laurie,go find BJ and tell him to get ready for dinner.

402
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,530
I'm not hungry.

403
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,860
Uh,yeah,that makes two of us.

404
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,100
We are having dinner together,as a family.

405
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,820
I guess I'll,uh,go wash up then.

406
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,230
Okay.

407
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,210
Hello.

408
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,860
Susan,hi.

409
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,990
Roger.

410
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,910
Look,I'm sorry to bother you,but I was wondering if you've spoken to Janet since I saw you.

411
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,030
She isn't home yet?

412
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,160
She hasn't called either.

413
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,490
That's not like her.

414
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,480
Yeah,I'm not sure what to do.

415
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,060
I'm right here,Roger.

416
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,240
Oh,never mind.She just walked in.

417
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,990
Janet,where the heck have you been?

418
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,050
I was about ready to call the police.

419
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,600
I don't want to move.

420
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,450
What?

421
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,100
My life is here.

422
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,250
My work is here.

423
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,290
It's a temp job.

424
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,730
I was offered the advice column.

425
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,450
I don't want to leave my friends.

426
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,390
Who?Henry?

427
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,890
Susan.

428
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,930
We'll make new friends.

429
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,240
I don't want to make new friends.

430
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,120
I know you wanted this job.

431
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,530
I know I promised to stand by you,

432
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,450
but I don't think this move is the right thing for our family.

433
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,740
Well,that's my decision to make.

434
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,320
No,it is our decision.

435
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,360
Look,you might be the heart of this family,Janet,but I'm the head.

436
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,510
And if I say we're moving to Cincinnati,then we're moving to Cincinnati and that's it.

437
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,680
End of discussion.

438
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,210
Man,it's a hot one.

439
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,660
Here you are,dear.

440
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,620
Susan!Bruce!

441
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,900
Wow,you guys really went all out for this.

442
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,220
Only good way to close out the summer is with a bang.

443
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,870
Speaking of which,gonna need your house keys.

444
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,640
Our house keys?

445
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,570
Oh,yeah,I-I don't,uh...

446
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,210
Yeah,I think we're just here for the seafood.

447
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,860
Seafood is a powerful aphrodisiac.

448
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,490
Mmm,ain't that right,honey?

449
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,540
Not for everyone,dear.

450
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,800
It's open.

451
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,170
Your phone's been busy all day.

452
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,310
We finally got in touch with someone from Peace Corps-- Dave's okay.

453
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,190
Thank God.

454
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,500
But it's a mess down there,and they need help.

455
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,620
And there's rea flight that leaves at 11:00 tonight.

456
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,420
You're going to Guatemala?

457
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,510
Yeah.

458
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,800
I want to go,too.

459
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,080
No,Laurie,you can't.

460
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,310
You have to go back to school.

461
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,380
I can miss a week of school or two weeks.

462
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,350
Even with an international effort,it will take months to clean up,

463
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,760
and even longer than that to rebuild.

464
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,800
So,I'll take the semester.

465
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,590
This is important.

466
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,290
Or is there some other reason you don't want me to go?

467
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,500
No,of course not.

468
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,950
Th...This isn't about you and me.

469
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,910
Right.

470
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,670
This is about a humanitarian crisis in need of volunteers.

471
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,880
I want to help.

472
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,690
Okay.

473
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,940
Talk to your parents.

474
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,670
You're gonna need a birth certificate to travel.

475
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,220
Okay.

476
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,160
Laurie...

477
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,360
I love you.

478
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,750
I love you,too.

479
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,200
Here I go.

480
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,420
One,two,three!

481
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,210
You talk to Bruce about Melinda?

482
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,880
No.

483
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,120
But I talked to Melinda about Bruce.

484
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,550
How did that go?

485
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:23,850
Apparently,he told her he feels like I don't "get" him anymore.

486
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,060
Want to?

487
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,430
- Oh,I missed it.
- Oh no!

488
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,620
I'm not sure I disagree.

489
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,980
Hey,give me that!

490
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,080
Oh,you were absolutely right.

491
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,780
What you said about Tom yesterday.

492
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,270
He really is just a big kid.

493
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,420
I-I didn't mean it in a bad way.

494
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,030
Oh,neither do I.

495
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,980
But it's...

496
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,730
one of the reasons we chose not to have kids of our own.

497
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,490
Children shouldn't raise children,isn't that what they say?

498
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,050
I think you'd make a great mother.

499
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,790
How do you know for sure?

500
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,730
There's so many ways to screw it up.

501
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,950
Are you pregnant?

502
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,540
Oh,I'm...

503
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,360
I'm not gonna keep it.

504
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,290
It wouldn't be fair.

505
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,750
To whom?

506
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,070
The baby.

507
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,750
What does Tom think?

508
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,620
He doesn't know.

509
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,200
My body,my decision.

510
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:42,920
Trina,all summer you have been espousing the virtues of openness and honesty in marriage.

511
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,850
Explain to me how that doesn't apply here.

512
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,080
 Trina,Susan!

513
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,850
I made Rosy Perfection Salad.

514
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,000
My favorite.

515
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,440
I'll put it out.

516
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,710
Janet,why haven't you called me?

517
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,340
Trina told you about Roger's job,didn't she?

518
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm sorry,I should have been the one.

519
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,980
I guess I thought,maybe I could talk him out of it.

520
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,210
But...

521
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,950
It seems like a great opportunity.

522
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,360
It is.

523
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,460
For him.

524
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,150
For both of you.

525
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,790
It's funny,I...

526
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,490
I just always assumed we'd grow old together.

527
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,120
You will.

528
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,360
I'm talking about you and me.

529
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,990
If Roger chooses this,I'm not sure I'll be able to go with him.

530
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,710
Sure am happy for you,Roge.

531
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,060
We are sorry to see you leave.

532
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,100
Don't be a stranger,okay?

533
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,350
Come on,boys,it's your toss!

534
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,040
Bye,guys.

535
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,830
Can't keep a lady waiting.

536
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,120
- Be right there.
- We're coming.

537
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,420
Janet,you ready?

538
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,230
Let's go,if we're going.

539
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,550
Wouldn't want you to miss your flight.

540
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,630
*****mate for life.

541
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Also says lobsters grow a pound a year.

542
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,150
And they can live to be 40.

543
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,760
So which one's you and which one's Samantha?

544
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,030
Don't be a doof.

545
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,850
We're gonna be leaving soon.

546
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,180
Come on,Rick,I'll let you French me good-bye.

547
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,620
Awesome!

548
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,500
I...see ya.

549
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,910
See ya.

550
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,140
Where'd you get those guys?

551
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,690
They were supposed to get boiled at the beach.

552
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,490
I rescued them.

553
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,040
You know,you can't save everything.

554
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,720
I know.

555
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,720
- Is your mom...
- Gone.

556
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,110
My Aunt Maggie took her to that place.

557
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,620
Here.

558
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,820
This belonged to your Dad.

559
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,070
Well,now it's yours.

560
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,520
SamaI can't.

561
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,230
I...

562
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,560
I want you to have it.

563
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,310
Please.

564
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,810
As long as you promise to come back for it.

565
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,480
Thank you.

566
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:10,990
Thank you,everyone,for joining us in sending the summer of '76 off to the history books.

567
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,550
Speaking for myself and my lovely wife,

568
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,930
I can safely say that this has been one unforgettable summer.

569
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:29,490
A lot of laughs,a lot of parties; new adventures,and some new friends.

570
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,730
And in keeping with the adventurous spirit of '76,

571
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:39,020
it is now time for the men bold enough to have thrown their keys into the fishbowl

572
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,980
to find out who their wives will be going home with this evening.

573
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,450
So,who's gonna be first?

574
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,340
Let's see.

575
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,540
- Michelle,will you do us the honors?
- Susan. 

576
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,450
Pick me.Pick me.

577
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,020
Mine!

578
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,740
Susan,wait!

579
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,610
Hold up,Susan.

580
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,960
I know you lied to me.

581
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,440
I know you went to meet Melinda after Janet's party.

582
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,700
You spoke to Melinda?

583
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,400
Actualwent to see her.

584
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,030
At least she had enough respect to tell me the truth.

585
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,520
Nothing happened.

586
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,920
We talked,that's all...

587
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,760
That's all?!God,Bruce...

588
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,190
I am just saying,it's not like we slept together.

589
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,350
That is not the point!

590
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,010
You lied right to my face!

591
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,460
Maybe I should remind you that you're the one that opened this door in the first place.

592
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,560
Opened what door?

593
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,120
The one to our bedroom.

594
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,070
I was perfectly happy the way things were.

595
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,510
Really,Bruce?

596
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,240
Is that why you needed the new job?

597
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,260
And the new house?

598
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,980
You wanted those things just as much as I did.

599
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,440
No,none of that mattered to me.

600
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,600
You're gonna stand there and tell me that you preferred the other side of the tracks?

601
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,690
You're no Janet,Susan.

602
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,150
And I am certainly no Roger.

603
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,220
You got that right.

604
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,740
I need to get out of here.

605
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,490
Fine.Let's go.

606
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,900
No.Not with you.

607
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,900
Those are mine.

608
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,170
Whose keys are these?

609
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,590
Hi,I'm Tim.

610
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,140
Great.

611
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,340
Let's go.

612
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,480
Henry.

613
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,340
I know.Me.In the suburbs.

614
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,470
It's as weird for me as it is for you.

615
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,250
Oh,come in.

616
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,260
What are you doing here?

617
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,710
Home delivery.

618
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,350
Congratulations.

619
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,720
I don't understand.

620
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,110
Well,Dear Janet would understand.

621
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,960
Dear Janet?

622
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,170
You're published,baby.

623
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,290
It's an advance copy.

624
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,750
This time tomorrow,everyone in Chicago is gonna know your name.

625
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,900
But...

626
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,510
But I...I don't understand.

627
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,930
I-I turned Mr.McColl down.

628
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
And I un-turned him down.

629
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:46,320
Listen,if you quit,who's gonna help Needy in Naperville pull herself together?

630
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,750
What happened today?

631
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,720
It's a long story.

632
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,740
Well,you were born to do this,Janet.

633
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,920
- I don't know what to say.
- Well,don't say anything.

634
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,710
Pour yourself a glass of champagne and celebrate with your husband.

635
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,810
Oh,Roger's in Cincinnati.

636
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,850
But-But if you want to stay,I-I can put this on ice.

637
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,110
Uh,I-I wish I could.

638
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,570
Um,but I have a date tonight.

639
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,770
Is it,um,anyone I know?

640
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,250
Jenny from accounting?

641
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,240
Mark from shipping.

642
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,920
Right,uh...

643
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,790
of course.Uh,Mark from...

644
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,430
shipping.

645
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,240
Well,uh...

646
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,650
good for you.

647
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,560
Remember to wear something nice on Tuesday.

648
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,310
They're taking your picture for the column.

649
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,030
That's me.

650
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,450
Go this way?

651
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,910
Yeah,sure.

652
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,710
You lose something?

653
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,380
Why,yes,it appears I have.

654
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,090
Disappointed?

655
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,780
Confused.

656
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,190
Kind of messing with tradition here.

657
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,230
Sit down.

658
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,710
I'm pregnant.

659
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,780
And I-I know we decided that this...

660
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,470
children...

661
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,750
is not what we want.

662
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,810
So I already know what I need to do.

663
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,610
But I feel like something has been changing inside me.

664
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:57,890
Just thought you should know this time,just in case we felt different somehow.

665
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,110
No.

666
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,340
No?

667
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,330
Maybe we don't have to make that choice.

668
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,360
Tom,you understand this would change our lives forever.

669
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,670
What do you want to do?

670
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,520
I want to think about it.

671
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,700
You know,if we decide to do this,I want to know exactly what it means.

672
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,940
Then we'll think about it.

673
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,790
I'm telling you with total certainty I have never loved you more than I do right now in this moment.

674
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,730
That has to count for something.

675
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,400
Laurie?

676
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,050
Mom.

677
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,610
You're home early.

678
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,730
Yeah.

679
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,100
Any word on Doug's friend?

680
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,340
Yeah.He's okay.

681
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,280
Oh,I'm glad.

682
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,230
Are you going somewhere?

683
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,660
Just to Doug's.

684
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,510
He's leaving for Guatemala to help with the cleanup from the earthquake.

685
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,970
Are you okay?

686
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,180
He won't be gone forever.

687
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,610
These people need help.

688
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:36,630
Please tell him our thoughts are with him,and,uh,to travel safely.

689
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,000
I will.

690
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,590
Don't be gone too long.

691
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,400
I'll be back before you know it.

692
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,160
Hello?

693
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,130
Hello?

694
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,200
Roger?

695
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,020
Yes.

696
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,050
Are you okay?

697
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,050
I couldn't get on the plane.

698
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,040
I know I shouldn't be calling.

699
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,880
I just...

700
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,450
I had to.

701
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,530
Where are you?

702
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,580
At a hotel...

703
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,930
by the airport.

704
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,420
Will you meet me?

705
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,700
Samantha?

706
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,770
Where are you now?

707
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,330
We're on the expressway.

708
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,960
We're passing a bunch buildings.

709
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,820
I see Stuckey's.

710
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,820
Samantha,can you hear me?

711
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,100
BJ?

712
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,640
Hello?

713
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,980
I can't hear you.

714
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,540
Samantha?

715
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,810
Hello,Samantha?

716
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,050
She'll be back.

717
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,050
It's only six weeks.

718
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,240
Get over here.

719

He asked me to give you this.

726
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,440
Whatever's in there,you should know,he was ripped up before he left.

727
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,540
Can you go,please?

728

00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,670
I'm one floor up if you need me.

731
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,000
Okay?

* All alone at the end of the evening... *

734
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,600
"I know it's hard to understand why I had to leave like this.

735
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,960
"Without you.

736
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,130
But you have one more year of school,"

737
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,990
"one more year of living in your parents' hous

738
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,800
before you launch into college and the rest of your life."

739
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,860
"I don't want you to rush that,

740
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,850
not because of me.

741
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,740
I will miss your voice," "your smile,your kiss.

742
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,010
I love you,Laurie Miller.

"And I know you know that.Doug

744
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,480
" P.S.Look under my pillow.

745
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:18,120
" And it's so hard to change Can't seem to settle down...

746
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,890
"You already have the key to my heart,	 and now you have the key to my apartment.

747
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,840
"If you need a place to escape,it's yours,	

748
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,830
and since all my stuff is there," maybe you'll think of me.

749
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:40,090
*  And burning out and turning out the same So put me on a highway *

750
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:50,770
* And show me a sign And take it to the limit one more time *

751
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:10,410
* You can spend all your time making money *

752
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:26,140
* You can spend all your love making time If it all fell to pieces tomorrow *

753
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,990
* Would you still be mine? *

754
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,690
*And when you're looking for your freedom *

755
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:49,750
* Nobody seems to care And you can't find the door Can't find it anywhere *

756
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:55,010
* When there's nothing to believe in Ah,ah,ah *
