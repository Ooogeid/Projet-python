1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Provisely on swingtown:

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,560
- We are not swingers.
- Don't forget.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,350
Janet and roger are the ones who left.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,680
Let's promise that it will only be that one time.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,970
Susan told me they made a pact to stay exclusive.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,590
Maybe they need a little friendly nudge back in the right direction.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,990
Welcome back,everyone.

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,340
Today marks the official midway point for our summer session.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,650
How do you see me?

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,140
I think.

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,060
we're having a housewarming next weekend.

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,160
You look nice.

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,890
Thanks.

14
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,520
So,what,is she your girlfriend now?

15
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,300
It's a party,janet.Let people eat.

16
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,580
Susan,she's ruining your party.

17
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,770
It's not my party.

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,410
And that is not my wallpaper.

19
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,710
Sorry.

20
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,070
- You've been cheating?
- No.

21
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,650
Me and susan and tom and trina on the fourth of july.

22
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,940
Geez,rog,do I really have to spell this out for you?

23
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,450
I want us to be completely open from now on.

24
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,450
Open how?

25
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,820
All options on the table.

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,860
You want to go again?

27
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,580
We're gonna wake the neighbors.

28
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,160
I think they'd approve.

29
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,070
Or we could just invite 'em over.

30
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,180
Bruce!

31
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,370
You said all options on the table.

32
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,050
Okay,mister,two can play at this.

33
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,430
Only two?

34
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,730
Boring.

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,240
morning,folks.

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,450
This is captain decker.

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,810
We've reached our cruising altitude of 33,000 feet.

38
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,190
The air up here is smooth and clear,

39
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,910
so feel free to stretch out and mingle with your fellow passengers.

40
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,230
Been helming the miami/o'hare route for the past seven years now,

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,400
and it has been my pleasure serving you,

42
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,840
but all good things must come to an end,

43
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,730
so after today,

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,460
I will be leaving you in the steady hands of my newly-promoted co-captain,

45
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,470
mr.Rick gilmore.

46
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,150
as for me,I will be piloting pan meridian's new service to tokyo starting next week.

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,700
I hope to see you good people on that long flight to the far east very soon.

48
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,480
konichiwa,captain.

49
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,650
In a restricted area,ma'am.

50
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,210
I'm gonna have to ask you to find your seat.

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,120
Is this one taken?

52
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,410
Well,folks,it seems i have my hands full up here,

53
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,960
so I invite you to kick back,relax,and enjoy the ride.

54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,290
and that goes double for you.

55
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,320
I come to speak with the counsel.

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,400
What sounds better,shrimp-stuffed peppers or garlic chicken milanese?

57
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,840
- I wouldn't eat either one.
- Good.

58
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,250
I'm not making it for you.

59
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,820
We better pick up some flashlight batteries.

60
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,220
Oh,and bug spray.

61
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,960
The mosquitoes nearly ruined the entire trip for janet last year,remember?

62
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,010
Yeah,vividly.

63
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,930
Morning,kiddos.

64
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,940
Off to a late start.

65
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,760
Thought you guys wanted to get a jump on the weekend.

66
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,030
Yeah,we,uh,kind of did.

67
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,250
- Load the car,please.
- Right.

68
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,820
something you want to say?

69
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,400
- Nope.
- Good.

70
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,380
bologna.check.Triscuits.

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,670
check.

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,090
Muffin tins,check.

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,910
Oven cleaner.

74
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,660
Hey,did you find your tackle box?

75
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,430
No.No,I didn'T.

76
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,500
Well,I'm sure there's plenty of lures at bruce and susan's cabin.

77
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,970
Not that you two ever catch any prize winners.

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,290
What's the matter?

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,230
You've been mopey all morning.

80
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,730
I don't know if it's a good idea for us to go this weekend.

81
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,170
What are you talking about?Are you feeling all right?

82
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,660
No.

83
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,960
No,actually,I'm not.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,530
Call and tell them we can't make it.

86
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,660
If anything unexpected happens and you can't reach us,

87
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,180
call the mcconnells.

88
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,950
I mean,all the emergency numbers are on the pad near the fridge.

89
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,000
It's two days,mom.

90
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,370
I can handle it.

91
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,420
oh,the thompsons are going to be dropping rick off any minute.

92
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,240
Don't let those boys give you a hard time.

93
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,430
I-I told bj you're in charge.

94
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,790
Hello?

95
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,590
Yup,hang on,mrs.Thompson.

96
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,690
Hi,janet.Ready when you are.

97
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,320
So,how was miami?

98
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,810
Oh,hot and sweaty.

99
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,090
The weather was nice,though.

100
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,110
hi,guys.Welcome home.

101
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,730
I forgot you guys were coming back today.

102
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,420
Don't even look at that wallpaper.

103
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,360
I'm embarrassed it's still there.

104
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,080
Your mail.

105
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,240
I hope it wasn't a problem.

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,300
No,not at all.

107
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,870
We were just trying to scoot out of town ourselves.

108
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,310
I saw the fishing poles,and where you off to?

109
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,630
Uh,door county,wisconsin.

110
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,640
Susan's family has a cabin on the lake.

111
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,830
Oh,how romantic.

112
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,600
Yeah,kind of.

113
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,670
We're driving up with the thompsons.

114
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,950
Actually,we're not.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,940
Janet just called and cancelled.

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,320
Something about roger having the flu.

117
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,430
In the middle of summer?

118
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,540
I know.I'm so sick of playing this game with her.

119
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,070
I mean,all we did was move a few blocks away.

120
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,490
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,920
Ah,we still got the lake breeze and the fresh pine.

122
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,060
And each other.

123
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,100
- Sounds pretty good to me.
- Yeah.

124
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,670
why don't you join us?

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,090
Oh,susan,tom didn't mean for you to invite us.

126
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,790
No,I-I'm serious.

127
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,860
Let it be our turn to show you guys a good time,right,bruce?

128
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,960
Absolutely.

129
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,430
Uh,plenty of room.

130
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,330
You know me.I'm always up for an adventure.

131
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Are you sure?

132
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,770
Then let's do it.

133
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,250
Great.

138
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,110
***********

139
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,420
Your grandfather built this place?

140
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,740
Great grandfather.

141
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,270
It was originally intended to be a church retreat,believe it or not.

142
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,500
Half the town used to congregate here on sundays.

143
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,590
Grandpa lyons used to minister here after a fallout with the local parish.

144
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
Sounds scandalous.

145
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,240
You can read all about it in those log books.

146
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,450
They-they go back to the turn of the century.

147
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,880
Uh,bedrooms are through there.

148
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,950
Take your pick.

149
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,420
You catch any bass in that lake?

150
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,530
Yeah,I try to.

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,120
Uh,sometimes I think the fish can smell the city on me.

152
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
Let's get settled,and we'll rig up the boat.

153
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,140
Uh,hold on.

154
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
First things first,bruce.

155
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,640
Right.

156
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,430
I almost forgot.

157
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,760
Something we should know?

158
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,440
Uh,we have a little tradition.

159
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,570
Newcomers have to jump in thee lakfirst thing.

160
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,120
No toe-testing,all the way in.

161
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,010
It's not mandatory,of course.

162
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,220
Your weekend,your rules.

163
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,790
Come on,tom.Let's go put on our suits.

164
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,680
what are we doing?

165
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,240
Let's not overthink it.

166
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,620
Okay.

167
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,320
looks like you're feeling better.

168
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,400
Yeah.

169
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,620
Guess so.

170
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,010
You know,if we get on the road right now,

171
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,420
there's still time to salvage the weekend.

172
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,560
I'm happy right where I am.

173
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,800
Roger,what is going on?

174
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,430
You've been acting peculiar ever since bruce and susan's housewarming.

175
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,150
Maybe I'm just tired of spending all of our free time with them,you know?

176
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,970
I mean,what do the four of us really have in common anyway?

177
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,810
How about,uh,ten years of birthdays and-and easter dinners and thanksgivings?

178
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,480
They were our neighbors.They lived across the street from us.

179
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,050
Susan is more than just a neighbor.

180
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,780
Look,I know things have changed,and.

181
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,560
but if we go up there,

182
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,780
and-and we do all the things we've always done together,maybe.

183
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,820
maybe things can change back.

184
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,240
What if it's already too late?

185
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,180
I don't accept that.

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,120
Hey,gaywad!

187
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,530
what kind of putz mows the lawn when his parents are out of town?

188
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,080
I thought yours decided not to go.

189
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,420
So,why should that ruin our weekend?

190
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,150
Grab your bike.

191
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,500
Let's book over to vintage vinyl.

192
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,230
They just got a bunch of kiss bootlegs in from holland.

193
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,510
Bj!

194
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,390
Oh,great,it's rapunzel.

195
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,370
Hey,samantha.

196
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,680
Are you done mowing the lawn?My mom's trying to sleep.

197
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,540
What,is her mom a vampire?

198
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,510
Kind of.

199
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,910
Tell her I'm finished.

200
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,230
Hey,we're gonna go buy records.

201
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,480
You want to come?

202
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,500
Where are you going?

203
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,510
Vintage vinyl.

204
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,480
It's in evanston.

205
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,260
Hold on.

206
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,710
Are you kidding me?

207
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,040
What is your problem?

208
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,070
Why can't you just be nice to her?

209
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,790
I don't think she has a lot of friends.

210
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,390
Big shock.

211
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,810
Lookin' good,ladies.

212
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,990
oh,what a gorgeous day.

213
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,470
- Thanks for inviting us.
- Thanks for coming.

214
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,740
I love how spontaneous you and tom are.

215
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,190
you know,I had to plan this weekend a year in advance with janet,

216
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,650
and she still cancelled.

217
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,910
Sounds like she's really testing your friendship.

218
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,980
She thinks we've changed somehow.

219
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,910
Um,what do you think?

220
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,930
maybe she's right.

221
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,000
Things have changed a lot in the last two weeks.

222
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,620
You mean since our night together?

223
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,370
things seem really good with you and bruce.

224
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,630
Yeah.

225
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,080
Trina,remember what I told you that night at the playboy club,

226
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,720
about the pact that bruce and I made?

227
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,360
To keep your relationship exclusive.

228
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,050
We,um,had another talk about it last weekend,

229
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,010
and decided to try to open ourselves up a little bit after all.

230
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,520
Meaning?

231
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,300
We haven't exactly defined it yet.

232
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,350
Right now we're just trying to be open and honest

233
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,540
with each other about how we feel 

234
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,770
about,uh.everything.

235
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,800
That's the only way it works.

236
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,350
No,no,don't rock the boat!I got a bite!

237
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,680
I got a fish!I got a fish!

238
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,610
Close the net!

239
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,220
I have to get a picture of this.

240
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,120
I think it's a big one!Get the net!

241
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,120
I got it.

242
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,800
Hey,boys!

243
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,040
Over here!

244
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,370
We're okay.

245
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,670
Guys,we are officially into the homestretch here.

246
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,670
Two weeks from today you'll have the ap credit out of the way.

247
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,420
You'll be able to enjoy the sunshine without pondering

248
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,830
what nietzsche or camus might have to say about it.

249
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,230
Raise your hands if you thought this class was excruciatingly long and slow.

250
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,280
hmm,okay.

251
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,180
How many of you thought these six weeks just zipped by?

252
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,940
All right,you all get "a'S."

253
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,140
kidding.

254
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,940
In the spirit of fleeting moments,

255
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,440
your next assignment will be to write an essay on the subjective nature of time,

256
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,970
drawing from any of the philosophers we've been studying.

257
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
that's it.Have a good weekend,everybody.

258
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,790
it's a cool assignment: The subjective nature of time.

259
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Faster,slower,older,younger.

260
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,110
it's all perception,right?

261
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,490
Yes.

262
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,180
laurie,I think we should talk.

263
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,990
Me,too.

264
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,180
Here.

265
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,570
That fish was huge,and i nearly had it in the boat.

266
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,340
Yeah,all right,all right.I messed up.

267
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,690
I take full responsibility.

268
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,100
Yeah,I want that in writing.

269
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,520
It'll be noted in the log book,I promise.

270
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,130
And don't forget to mention just how big it was.

271
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,320
Size isn't everything,dear.

272
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,600
I think I'll go rinse off.

273
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,830
Yeah,the water's hot,but there's not a lot of it,so.

274
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,310
well,a little hot water goes a long way.

275
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,820
Well,I could get it started for you.

276
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,170
Or we could.

277
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,720
all get in together.

278
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,410
Your cabin,your rules.

279
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,000
Uh,susan?

280
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
Okay.

281
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,250
Knock,knock!

282
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,950
Surprise.

283
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,720
San,what's going on?

284
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,820
Hey,kids.

285
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,950
I didn't know this weekend was going to be a three-way.

286
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,720
Janet,let's go.

287
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,680
Sorry to interrupt.

288
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,390
No,whoa-whoa,rog.He's just joking.

289
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,870
What,what are you two doing here?

290
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,980
What are we doing here?

291
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,950
Well,you said roger wasn't feeling well.

292
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,820
I mean,you said you weren't coming.

293
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,250
Well,it never occurred to me you had our replacements all lined up.

294
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,760
Um,let's not make a deal about this.

295
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,650
Tom,let's go get dressed.

296
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,660
You two drove all this way and we practically invited ourselves.

297
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,790
Hold oa minute,trina.Susan?

298
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,300
why doesn't everybody just stay?

299
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,900
In two bedrooms?

300
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,080
How does that work?

301
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,340
We're gonna turn back around.

302
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,020
No,I don't want you to do that.

303
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,680
Look,there's plenty of room.

304
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,850
We can figure this out.

305
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,630
Please?

306
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,750
It's up to you.

307
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,810
I suppose we can manage one night.

308
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,780
Of course,we'll need more food.

309
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,820
We were just going to head to the market.

310
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,310
You know what?I-I'm going to go.

311
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,930
Okay,you guys can dry off.

312
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,170
Roger,I'm going to come with you.

313
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,610
Just give me a sec to put something on.

314
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,650
I don't suppose anybody took the time to wipe down the kitchen?

315
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,950
No.

316
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
Hey,laurie.

317
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,580
Long time no see.

318
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,880
Where have you been hiding?

319
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,800
I haven't been hiding.

320
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,240
I've been studying.

321
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,050
Summer school should be about over by now,isn't it?

322
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,720
Two weeks.

323
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,160
Summer always flies,right?

324
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,320
I'll see ya.

325
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,560
I came back for you,you know.

326
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,180
That night after the play,I drove around the block.

327
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,950
I circled back for you.

328
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,290
Where'd you go?

329
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,920
You left me downtown without a ride,logan,so.

330
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,980
I found one.

331
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,840
With who?

332
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,980
Does it really matter?

333
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,560
There's a bonfire at north beach tonight.

334
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,100
Be cool if you were there.

335
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,970
My parents are out of town.

336
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,870
I'm watching my brother.

337
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,570
But even if I weren't,I wouldn't be going to the bonfire.

338
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,080
Do you understand what I'm saying?

339
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
Yeah.

340
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,520
Okay.

341
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,610
Bye,logan.

342
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,400
How's the whitefish?

343
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,550
Fresh as it gets.

344
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,350
Practically leapt into my husband's boat this morning.

345
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,360
Bruce and tom won't be happy to hear that.

346
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,480
Oh,well,fine.

347
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,590
We'll get something else.

348
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,230
No,no,I meant bruce and tom flipped the boat over this morning trying to catch fish.

349
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,470
It was hysterical.

350
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,700
Two whitefish,please.

351
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,750
Roger,are you okay?

352
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,280
Oh,yeah,yeah,I just had,like,a 24-hour flu or something.

353
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,670
No,no,I-I mean.

354
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,890
I know it's awkward with tom and trina here,but.

355
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,920
you and janet called and cancelled.I just.

356
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,910
you don't,you don't have to explain yourself to me.

357
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,670
I'm sorry we crashed your party.

358
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,020
You didn't crash anything.

359
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,080
You were invited.

360
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,150
Well,with us here,

361
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,090
I doubt it'll be the kind of weekend you expected to have with your new friends.

362
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,970
Here you are.

363
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,100
All right,thank you.

364
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,420
All right,we should.

365
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,910
we should go.

366
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,730
Where'd you learn to split wood like that?

367
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,980
Boy scouts.

368
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm trying to imagine you as a boy scout.

369
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,370
Well,it didn't all stick.

370
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,500
But I can still light a fire,rig a sail and whittle a tiny totem pole.

371
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,330
You whittle?

372
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,360
Oh,yeah.

373
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,800
Big whittler.

374
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,780
Hey,listen,tom.

375
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,730
I-I'm really sorry about the unexpected guests.

376
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,740
Don't worry about it.

377
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,110
Hey,whatever the party is,that's the party I'm at.

378
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,080
Man,everything just rolls right off you,doesn't it?

379
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,290
Waves coming at you a little fast these days?

380
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,860
You know,I'm just aware these are potentially dangerous waters susan and I are wading into.

381
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,320
It's not that complicated.

382
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,340
You want to keep it open,gotta keep it honest.

383
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,530
- Okay.
- Lemonade,gentlemen?

384
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,670
Hey!

385
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,630
What's cookin',good-looking?

386
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,610
What's cooking is a batch of my brownies.

387
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,870
World-famous recipe.

388
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,730
well,if they're anything like your lemonade,we are in for a treat.

389
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,040
The lady does make a mean brownie,I gotta give her that.

390
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,400
Thank you.

391
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,300
You ever seen a man split a log,jan?

392
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,570
Can't say that I have.

393
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,100
Well,now look who's in for a treat.

394
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,300
I'll take this in.

395
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,030
Enjoy.

396
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,290
who's winning the he-man contest?

397
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,220
Tom,hands down.

398
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,420
I didn't mean to abandon you with janet.

399
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,070
I have a feeling she might loosen up.

400
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,420
Uh,yeah,step away from the stove.

401
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,360
You don't want to mess with janet's brownies.

402
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,200
Just adding something to give it a little extra kick.

403
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,630
You know,I'm guessing that isn't oregano.

404
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,990
We could all stand to mellow out a bit tonight,don't you think?

405
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,110
Hey,hon.How's the market?

406
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,190
Fine.

407
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm going to check on janet.

408
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,620
Bruce,would you start cleaning the fish?

409
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,130
Who lives here,sonny and cher?

410
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,440
Be quiet,rick.

411
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,640
You're sure this is worth it?

412
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,660
They have a stereo and a pool.

413
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,450
I'm not getting arrested just so I can see some freaky house.

414
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,130
It's not some freaky house.

415
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,760
It's freak central.

416
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,770
susan,the fish is perfect.

417
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,600
Roger's idea.

418
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,160
All I did was point and pay.

419
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,910
susan,those cabin journals are fascinating.

420
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,570
There's one entry from 1948.

421
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,790
All it says is,"I'm as lonesome as topaz."

422
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,660
That would be great aunt sally.

423
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,800
Everyone is lucky everyone is so kind I'll get the brownies.

424
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,320
Everyone,just sit.

425
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,260
I wonder what aunt sally was like.

426
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,360
Did you know her,bruce?

427
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,520
Only in legend.

428
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,650
She never married.

429
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,690
Everyone said she was damn happy about it.

430
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,770
Except for the lonesome part.

431
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,020
I doubt you two had much in common.

432
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,900
Why is that?

433
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,480
I just.

434
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,330
can't imagine you've ever had a lonely moment in your entire life.

435
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,510
There's a lot about me you don't know,janet.

436
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,260
You should learn to control your prejudices.

437
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,040
Well,that's a laugh coming from you.

438
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,960
I'm sorry?

439
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,820
I know how you feel about me,trina.

440
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,200
I mean,you wrote it on susan's wall,for pete's sake.

441
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,550
What was it?

442
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,050
Um,"killjoy"?

443
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,150
You might want to help susan with those brownies.

444
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,100
Oh,yeah.

445
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,650
Nun's habit?

446
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,230
This is a complete disaster.

447
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,740
What was I thinking?

448
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,800
Just let janet and trina work it out.

449
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,530
It's not about you.

450
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,320
Of course it's about me.

451
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm the one who invited the deckers.

452
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,120
You know,it's like.

453
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,960
it's like the minute I make a few changes in mjalife,

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
y net starts behaving like.

455
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,670
like a forgotten child.

456
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,180
Not that trina's making things any easier.

457
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,250
Can't argue with you on that.

458
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,230
And then there's roger.

459
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,510
He can barely look me in the eye.

460
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,410
It's like I've done something unspeakable.

461
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,920
I.

462
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,700
what?

463
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,900
Uh,I-I probably should've told you this earlier,

464
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,420
but-but I-I kind of mentioned to-to roger

465
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,620
that we'd done some experimenting with the deckers.

466
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,050
You what?

467
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,900
What is the matter with you?

468
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,970
You should really try to learn to lighten up.

469
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,010
Might do you some good.

470
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,820
Oh,you know what the problem is,trina,is that I'm not going anywhere.

471
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,700
You're not gonna get rid of me.

472
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,720
Anything else I should know?

473
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,950
Uh,yeah,um.

474
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,830
uh,about those brownies.

475
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,530
I didn't write anything about you on susan's wall,

476
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,160
janet; that's paranoid.

477
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,760
Oh,and I suppose it was just an accident

478
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,750
that you sent me to the basement on the fourth of july.

479
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,940
You must have really enjoyed yourself.

480
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,720
Let's send the boring,stupid housewife to wander off into an orgy.

481
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,730
that's enough,both of you.

482
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,930
Roger.

483
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,680
you and I need to talk.

484
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,750
Everyone else,have a pot brownie.

485
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,520
They're delicious.

486
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,030
Pot brownie?What's she talking about?

487
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,300
World-famous recipe.

488
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,330
Trina,can you stop pushing everyone's buttons for five minutes?

489
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,820
- You laced my brownies?
- Loosen up,janet.

490
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,130
You're on vacation.

491
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,090
I'll be outside.

492
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,900
- I'll get the car.
- No.

493
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,880
What are you doing?

494
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,310
We came here for a reason,roger.

495
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,050
Now go outside and find susan.

496
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,180
We are staying.

497
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,980
and I am going to eat a pot brownie.

498
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,720
well,I feel nothing.

499
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,140
It takes time.

500
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,790
Maybe you didn't make them right.

501
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,080
Maybe you should eat another.

502
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,940
Oh,bad idea,jan.

503
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,980
Trust me on this one.

504
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,960
Hello.

505
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,480
Let's play a game.

506
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,180
Oh,oh,how about pinochle?

507
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,910
I was thinking something a little simpler.

508
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,460
Susan?

509
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,470
I know that bruce told you what we did at tom and trina's party,and I.

510
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,780
your marriage is none of my business.

511
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,630
I'm not judging you.

512
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,390
Well,it's why you cancelled this weekend,isn't it?

513
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,210
Yeah.

514
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,300
I guess it's a little hard for me to see how janet and I fit into your new lifestyle.

515
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,780
There's no "lifestyle," roger.

516
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,520
Why didn't you just talk to me about it?

517
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,650
You and I don't really have that kind of relationship.

518
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,600
We've been friends for years.

519
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,390
Yeah,sure,you're friends with janet,

520
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,510
and I'm friends with bruce,

521
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,630
but I didn't think that we could.

522
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,560
you know,that you and i could have A.

523
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,040
I didn't know how to talk to you about it.

524
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,450
Does.

525
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,450
janet know?

526
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,940
Not from me.

527
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,100
Oh,she,uh.

528
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,290
she idolizes you.

529
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,830
I don't want to be idolized.

530
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,600
What do you want?

531
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,390
Just to be happy.

532
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,830
You got a great house and a great family.

533
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,150
What more do you need to be happy?

534
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,020
That's a good question.

535
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,690
Roger.

536
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,900
are you happy?

537
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,520
Mostly.

538
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,680
Good.

539
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,860
I'm glad.

540
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,350
I wasn't long,was I?

541
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,570
Not at all,mrs.Dietrichson.

542
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,900
Hope I've got my face on straight.

543
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,100
Perfect,for my money.

544
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,610
Neff is the name,isn't it?

545
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,750
- Hi.
- You're late.

546
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,990
Uh,well,I would have called,but your note didn't have a phone number,so.

547
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,030
well,come on in.I'm just cleaning up.

548
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,410
Wow,you made dinner.

549
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,180
Poulet provence.

550
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,380
It's kind of gross.You didn't miss much.

551
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,300
My parents are out of town,so I thought I'd try and cook.

552
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,550
Uh,laurie,I shouldn't be here right now.

553
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,300
I thought you wanted to talk.

554
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,970
You're right.

555
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,090
Um,look,about what happened in the library last week.

556
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,710
um,that was.

557
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,650
just a kiss.

558
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,920
It's not that big a deal.

559
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,910
No,that was a very big deal.

560
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm your teacher.

561
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,340
Only for two more weeks.

562
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,130
Well,if I did anything to.

563
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,770
I don'T.you know,uh,lead you to think that.that.

564
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,850
I-I just want to say I'm-I'm sorry.

565
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,840
- I just want to apologize.
- You didn'T.

566
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,100
We were alone,surrounded by books,and dylan was playing.

567
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,470
I practically jumped you.

568
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,580
I like you,laurie.

569
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,450
I do.I really do.

570
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,280
I mean,you're smart.You're funny.

571
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,930
I value your input in class.

572
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,520
You know that,but this.this can't happen.

573
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,030
Laurie?

574
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,430
Sorry.

575
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,870
Pbs is doing a film noir week.

576
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,950
Oh,barbara stanwyck.

577
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,100
Oh,wow,this is double indemnity.

578
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,640
One of the rare occasions I wish I owned a tv.

579
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,560
You don't own a tv?

580
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,530
Nah,conscientious objector.

581
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,700
Then stay.

582
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,410
Watch it with me.

583
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,760
Who wants a shot?

584
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,930
No,thanks.

585
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,700
You know,you're stealing from them.

586
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,500
Yeah,this from the girl who showed us how to break into their house.

587
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,420
That's smooth gin.

588
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,910
U yowant to go in?

589
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,800
You first.

590
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,650
Sucker.

591
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,470
You are so dead.

592
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,540
No.

593
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,050
It's right foot yellow.

594
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,910
hey,hey,hey,watch the goods,little missy.

595
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,700
I warned you.

596
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,050
I was a chee eader.

597
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,380
Rlokay,spin it!

598
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,280
Okay,trina,right hand green.

599
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,560
Right hand green.

600
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,150
Hurry,hurry,hurry,hurry.

601
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,070
I can't do it.

602
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,930
I win!

603
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,850
Oh,oh,you're too much for me,lady.

604
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,620
Flattery will get you nowhere with me,mister.

605
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,890
Okay,who wants to play again?

606
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,260
I'm afraid I must bow to the queen.

607
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,070
You know,if this were high school,

608
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,430
you'd be my new best friend.

609
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,860
Oh,no,if this were high school,

610
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,450
you wouldn't even be talking to me.

611
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,800
You're probably right.

612
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,730
I was too busy making out with the bad boys.

613
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,970
you know what I was like in high school?

614
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,950
Exactly the same as I am now,but with saddle shoes.

615
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,760
I know-- sexy,right?

616
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,130
I thought you were a cheerleader.

617
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,410
Only on weekends.

618
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,280
Ooh,it's always the quiet ones,isn't it?

619
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,370
Roger wishes.

620
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,360
I have never done anything wild and crazy in my entire life.

621
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,200
Maybe tonight's the night.

622
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,240
Trina.

623
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,460
I have an idea.

624
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,580
Oh,crap.Now,see.

625
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,320
you want to use a little wrist action.

626
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,610
Check it out.

627
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,110
Okay,wrist action?

628
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,100
Yeah,it might come in handy at one of tom and trina's parties.

629
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,130
hey,you think tom skips stones?

630
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,570
Hey,man,you can skip or not.

631
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,750
Whatever you're into.

632
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,550
You guys okay out here?

633
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,970
Much better.

634
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,940
- Good.
- How's it going in there?

635
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,810
Is that laughter or screaming I'm hearing?

636
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,780
Little of both.

637
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,770
I think janet's buzz is definitely peaking.

638
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,760
I better go check on her.

639
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,880
ally,ally,all come free!

640
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,250
You guys in,or what?

641
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,480
Shall we?

642
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,030
rick's wasted.

643
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,920
Make sure he sleepsface down.

644
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,550
Most girls get advice about boys and make-up from their moms.

645
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,130
Mine tells me how not to puke in my sleep.

646
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,500
Have you ever been drunk?

647
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,130
Nah,I don't want to end up like my mom.

648
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,790
Or anybody else in this neighborhood.

649
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,220
So how come this place is freak central?

650
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,350
They have these parties.

651
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,640
I've seen them sometimes.

652
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,420
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

653
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,350
My parents are with them this weekend.

654
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,580
I can't really imagine them doing anything weird.

655
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,410
They're like the definition of normal.

656
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,350
Everything looks normal on the outside.

657
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,780
honey?

658
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,350
Can you get my hair?

659
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,390
Mmm,that's nice.

660
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,750
So.

661
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,960
roger and I will just sleep on the porch.

662
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,650
Oh,no,no.You guys take the bed.

663
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,820
Man,I dig the night air.

664
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,530
No,no,it's fine.I'll just get some blankets.

665
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,480
I have an idea.

666
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,790
How about girls in one room and boys in the other?

667
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,220
you mean,like a sleepover.

668
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,910
Cthatould be fun.

669
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,610
Works for me.

670
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,610
good night,honey.

671
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,580
Good night.

672
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,630
- Good night.
- Good night,roger.

673
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,390
Good night.

674
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,100
Meet me on the porch in 20 minutes.

675
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,840
so.what do you think?

676
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,790
I know I'm supposed to go along with the whole femme fatale thing.

677
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,760
I just wish powerful women weren't always portrayed as evil.

678
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,900
It's like a poisonous spider that has to be exterminated.

679
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,290
Fred macmurray wasn't exactly a paragon of virtue,though.

680
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:15,050
Yeah,but the movie practically blamed all of his bad behavior on her.

681
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,430
God,why are men so paranoid?

682
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,560
Not all men are.

683
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,020
At least she had great hair.

684
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,640
There is that,yes.

685
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,810
This works,you know.

686
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,460
You and me.

687
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,460
but you have to go,don't you?

688
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,890
Yes,I do.

689
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,990
I had so much fun tonight.

690
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,910
Me,too.

691
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,240
Me,too.

692
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,230
I can't remember the last time I slept with anyone other than roger.

693
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,960
no,not that I ever slept with anyone but roger.

694
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,500
I just mean.

695
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,690
sleep,as in actual sleeping.

696
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,610
Tom's starting a new job,flying to tokyo next week.

697
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,080
A lot of nights apart.

698
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,940
Are you worried?

699
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,700
I'm not worried.I'm just.

700
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,720
lonesome?

701
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,670
As topaz.

702
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,460
Don't worry.

703
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,140
You can always call us.

704
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,880
did we actually all survive this?

705
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,710
Yeah,I think so.

706
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,200
Of course tomorrow's another day.

707
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,670
There isn't really a handbook for what we're going through right now,is there?

708
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,960
No,there isn'T.

709
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,100
We're.

710
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,710
we're okay though,right?

711
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,920
Yeah.

712
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,120
We're okay.

713
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,440
mm,morning.

714
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,700
What am I wearing?

715
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,410
That's mine.

716
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,440
Where are my clothes?

717
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:57,410
Last I remember,you threw them in the fireplace.

718
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,440
My head.

719
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,950
Where the hell are we?

720
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,000
is that pancakes?

721
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,370
Morning.

722
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,300
Hey,morning.

723
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,820
We have blueberry and banana pancakes.

724
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,660
I couldn't find any walnuts.

725
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,090
You're leaving?

726
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,180
Well,you know roger.

727
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,540
He always likes to be the first one on the road.

728
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,760
I thought you'd stay.

729
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:03,900
It'S...

730
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,800
it's time for us to go.

731
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,040
Morning.

732
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,990
I hope you guys don't mind,but tom and I decided to get back today.

733
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,810
I got my first big flight monday; I want to be ready.

734
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,340
Of course.

735
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,990
Why don't we stay,janet?

736
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,270
Okay.

737
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,640
Trina,are you sure you don't have time for pancakes?

738
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,170
There's plenty.

739
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,010
Sure.

740
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,220
Always have time for pancakes.

741
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,840
Suse,you coming?

742
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,100
Just a sec.
