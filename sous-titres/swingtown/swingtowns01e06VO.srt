1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Previously on Swingtown

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,100
This works, you know--
you and me.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,500
You're a really good teacher,
you know that?

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,800
Only for one more week.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,900
Then what?

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,400
It's nice having
spontaneous nights like this.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,500
I don't want to lose that.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Tom's starting
a new job.

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,900
Flyin to Tokyo
next week.

10
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:16,900
Are you worried?

11
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,506
You don't do well alone, Tom.

12
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:19,505
I'm not that guy anymore.

13
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:21,507
What do you think?
Who is that?

14
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:22,902
Harry Reems.

15
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:25,502
You're throwing a fund-raiser
for an actor in a porno film?

16
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:27,603
It's terrible what's
happening to this man.

17
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:30,203
You don't want to go to a party
like that without me.

18
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,300
I saw Deep Throat last night.

19
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:33,703
Why are you telling me this?

20
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:36,903
I didn't come to support pornography.
I just want to make that perfectly clear.

21
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:38,002
Harry Reems.

22
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:40,501
What is going on
with you, Susan?

23
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:42,403
Get your things.
We're going home.

24
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,101
No, I'm not.

25
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,300
I don't know what's going on
in the world.

26
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:47,703
It-It's not about you.

27
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:51,100
It... It's not about us.
It's... It's about me.

28
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:58,402
??? of Flight 274 from Bombay.

29
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:00,602
Flight 274 from Bombay.

30
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:03,303
I love our little airport game.

31
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:04,902
Okay, your turn.

32
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,900
Mm.

33
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:11,402
Standby passenger Ford Watkins
at Q Gate 34...

34
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,502
Redhead, 10:00.

36
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:14,900
Well...

37
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,103
I wouldn't kick
her out of bed,

38
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:20,101
but I always secretly preferred
Mary Ann to Ginger.

39
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:21,002
Hmm.

40
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:23,203
You got ten seconds.

41
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,901
- Nine, eight...
- Hold on.

42
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:27,003
seven...

43
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,600
Hello! Hitchcock blonde
in the white dress.

44
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:31,602
You got me.

45
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:33,402
So much for
Mary Ann.

46
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh!

47
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,803
- You!
- For you.

48
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:46,501
- How nice.
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,402
Did you have
a good day at work?

50
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,400
- Yeah, the market rallied a bit.
- Mm.

51
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:53,503
Looks like we can keep
the house for another week.

52
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:55,802
Oh, good. See, it is gonna take
me at least that long

53
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:58,001
to choose a new wallpaper
for the living room.

54
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:59,701
What's the big deal?
Just pick one.

55
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:02,900
I don't want to
make some hideous mistake

56
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:05,602
we're gonna have to stare at
the rest of our lives.

57
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:09,303
So, I still got half an hour
to kill before my flight.

58
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:10,600
Double or nothing?

59
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,600
- You're on.
- Okay.

60
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:15,202
Start the clock.

61
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,902
How about climbing the stairway
to heaven with Robert Plant?

62
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:19,601
I'm way past my
hippie phase, dear.

63
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:22,403
And you are a stickler
for personal hygiene. 

64
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,402
Ah, Silver Fox?

65
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:28,603
Oh, he's a dead ringer
for my Uncle Barry.

66
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:30,500
- Huh.
- Mm.

67
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:31,600
Tough room.

68
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:34,503
Five seconds.
Four, three...

69
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,202
Bingo.

70
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:36,902
Check him out.

71
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,402
Oh, my God.

72
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,103
Luke!?

73
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,901
Trina?

74
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:45,601
I can't believe it.

75
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:46,502
Hi.

76
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:49,402
Hi. Oh, my God.
Look at you...

77
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:53,603
Susan, I've been thinking about
what you said the other night,

78
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:57,403
about wanting to get more involved
in the world,expanding your horizons.

79
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:58,400
Yeah.

80
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,702
Don't look so surprised.

81
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,702
I think I have
just the thing.

82
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:07,402
The Children's Hospital
Ladies Auxiliary.

83
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:09,400
The what?

84
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,500
My boss's wife runs it--
Rita Pierce.

85
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:14,303
Pulled a few strings, got you
on the planning committee

86
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,603
for their annual benefit
this weekend.

87
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,201
Bruce, that's sweet...
kind of.

88
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:21,201
They meet tomorrow at the
Lake Crest Country Club.

89
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,501
Oh, I can't.
BJ's scout camp starts tomorrow,

90
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:25,503
and once we drop the boys
at the bus,

91
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,003
Janet and I have our traditional
lunch downtown at the Berghoff.

92
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,803
So bring Janet along.

93
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,403
Okay, here's the thing.

94
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:34,303
All the company wives'll
be there, pitching in.

95
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:37,000
All the wives?

96
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:42,300
Is this about expanding my horizons or
about making you look good to the boss?

97
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:44,102
- Two birds, one stone.
- Right.

98
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,701
You'll be doing me a big favor.

99
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,300
What do you say?

100
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:50,301
Please?

101
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:54,501
High school sweethearts.

102
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:56,603
- How about that?
- All four years.

103
00:03:56,807 --> 00:03:58,003
On and off.

104
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,702
Not if it had
been up to me.

105
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:02,001
Back then, Trina wasn't
much of a one-man woman.

106
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:03,601
Guess that's
changed, though.

107
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,100
You're a lucky guy,
Tom.

108
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:07,502
That I am. 

109
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,403
So, what brings you
to the Windy City?

110
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,003
Business.Running
my dad's company.

111
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:12,100
Can you believe it?

112
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:15,300
The same father who threatened to send
you to military school twice a week? 

113
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,200
Same one.

114
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,203
Luke's family pretty much owns
the Manhattan skyline.

115
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,301
Maybe half.

116
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:22,902
Man, it is good
to see you.

117
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:24,203
You know, I'll be at the Drake
through the weekend.

118
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,601
You think you got time
to grab a bite? 

119
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:26,502
How about tomorrow?

120
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,601
You can keep me company
while Tom's away.

121
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:30,703
We're cutting it
awful close, Captain.

122
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:32,503
About 15 minutes
to push back.

123
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:33,401
Thank you, Bobbi.

124
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,602
- You seeing your husband off, Trina?
- Mm-hmm.

125
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,301
You're so sweet.

126
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,903
Well, I better get going.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

127
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:41,401
Take good care of my wife
while I'm gone. 

128
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,403
Will do.

129
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:48,502
Safe trip.

130
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,802
- I'll miss you.
- You better.

131
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:56,801
I can't
believe...

135
00:05:37,307 --> 00:05:38,302
Hello.

136
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,001
Hey, babe.

137
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,802
You're out of breath.

138
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,300
And dripping wet.

139
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,102
Oh. Really?

140
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,900
I just got out
of the pool, dear.

141
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,102
How was your flight?

142
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,503
We caught a headwind,
so we were a little late.

143
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:52,600
Just catching some shuteye
before we head back.

144
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,306
Well, hurry home.
I miss you.

145
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,605
Thought you had Luke there
to keep you company.

146
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,907
Not till tonight.

147
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,701
He's coming over later
for drinks.

148
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:02,301
- Why? You jealous?
- Should I be?

149
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:04,203
Please.

150
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:05,603
So...

151
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:07,702
tell me...

152
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:10,302
just how wet are you?

153
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:14,403
You all packed for camp?

154
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:15,500
Yup.

155
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:17,303
Can I go outside now?

156
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,401
Pens and stationery?

157
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:23,103
There's some in the kitchen.
Put them in your bag.

158
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,103
What for?

159
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,900
Two weeks is
a long time.

160
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,700
I expect you to write
to me this year.

161
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,800
It's camp,not school.

162
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:32,303
Don't argue with
your mother, BJ.

163
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:39,601
You know, means a lot to me,
you agreeing to do this today.

164
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,803
You didn't give me a
whole lot of choice.

165
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:45,801
But now that you are advising me
how to spend my days,

166
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,103
do you mind telling me what
I should wear to this thing?

167
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,602
I wouldn't want to clash with
the other company wives.

168
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:52,802
The pink definitely.

169
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,403
You know I've never been much
for group activities.

170
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:00,600
Didn't seem that way
at the Deckers.

171
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:04,803
The Harry Reems fund-raiser.

172
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:06,803
That is hardly the same thing.

173
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:10,602
You're right.Not all charity events
can benefit porn stars.

174
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,500
Somebody's got to help
the poor, sick children.

175
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,503
- Hello?
- Hi.

176
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:24,601
Hi, Janet.

177
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:27,302
Susan, did you rember
packing itch cream for BJ?

178
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,900
Ricky came home covered
in poison ivy last year.

179
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:32,602
I always say, "You can never
travel with too many ointments."

180
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,800
Right.

181
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:38,603
Janet,are you sure you don't mind
going with me to this thing today?

182
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:40,102
Susan, I told you
last night.

183
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:41,802
Berghoff's will
always be there.

184
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:45,200
A chance to work with Rita Pierce--
it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

185
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,101
I'll see you
in an hour.

186
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,801
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

187
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,601
Once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity?

188
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:55,602
Susan got invited to the Children's
Hospital Ladies Auxiliary luncheon.

189
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,202
Guess who she's
bringing as her guest?

190
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:58,003
Charo?

191
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,903
Roger, this is a major
philanthropic organization.

192
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:02,802
It's very
exclusive.

193
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:06,000
These women are terribly proper.

194
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,903
Well, then
you should fit right in.

195
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,603
In this outfit?
I don't know.

196
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,400
Ricky, get down here.

197
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:15,702
We have less than an hour
to get you on that bus.

198
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,101
Tell you what?

199
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:18,501
Why don't you...

200
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:21,202
go buy yourself
something nice to wear?

201
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:24,502
Not that I think
you need it, of course.

202
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:26,903
Thank you

203
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,103
You have a
wonderful day.

204
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:33,103
Wonderful?

205
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:37,303
12 years of selling insurance,and I
haven't had a day full of wonder yet.

206
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,300
Ricky!

207
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,801
All summer, we've studied
the great thinkers.

208
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:52,500
Now it's time for you to think for
yourselves and speak for yourselves,

209
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:55,001
so no bluebooks
tomorrow.

210
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:57,402
Your final exam will be oral.

211
00:08:57,606 --> 00:09:01,902
Be prepared to discuss the notions
of authenticity and self-expression...

212
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,902
drawing from all the philosophers we've
been studying,and most importantly,

213
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:07,200
from examples in your own lives.

214
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:09,902
Thank you.

215
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:19,501
Yes, Laurie?

216
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,800
Authenticity
and self-expression?

217
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:22,702
Uh-huh. 

218
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:25,100
Using examples
from our own life.

219
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,203
That's the assignment.

220
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,103
In front of the entire class.

221
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,202
Right.

222
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:32,201
Interesting.

223
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:41,700
Mm, and don't forget:

224
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:45,300
each of you is expected to bring
at least two likely donors

225
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:46,800
to the benefit
tomorrow night.

226
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:48,403
That must be Bruce's
boss' wife.

227
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:49,301
Rita Pierce.

228
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,803
Her picture's always in
the Tribune party pages.

229
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:53,700
I'm sorry about
the Berghoff.

230
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,302
- I owe you lunch.
- Forget it.

231
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:59,600
But in the meantime, I want to
thank you ladies for your hard work

232
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:02,502
on behalf of all the sick
children who will benefit

233
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:05,102
from our efforts
tomorrow night.

234
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:07,700
Go ahead. Give yourselves
a little round of applause.

235
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,601
Oh.

236
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:13,201
Fabulous. Oh!
Brand-new suit,ruined.

237
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,700
Nobody touch
the jacket.

238
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:17,301
Give it to me.

239
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:18,802
Do I know you?

240
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:21,603
Janet Thompson.
I'm-I'm here with Susan Miller.

241
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,700
M- my husband works
for your husband.

242
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:28,401
Give me some Sweet 'N Lows,
much as you can find.

243
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:29,402
- Hurry!
- Yes, madam.

244
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,500
And once it's dry,
and the stain is absorbed,

245
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:41,500
you simply brush off
the whole mess, like so, and...

246
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:44,200
- ...voila!
- Oh!

247
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:45,000
Good as new.

248
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:48,300
Janet,you are a miracle worker.

249
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,700
Ladies, can
you stand it?

250
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:54,703
Janet, I insist-- you must come
to the benefit tomorrow night

251
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:56,401
as my guest.

252
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:59,601
It-It would
be my honor.

253
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,301
Rita, I was wondering
about the children.

254
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:05,503
When you volunteer
at the hospital,

255
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,302
what is it exactly
that you do?

256
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:09,103
Well,our efforts with
the Ladies Auxiliary

257
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:10,703
are mainly devoted
to fundraising.

258
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,002
So you don't work
with the children at all?

259
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,602
Oh, we're not
doctors, dear.

260
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,202
Although this one's a bit of
a mad scientist, isn't she?

261
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:21,900
Well, now, where's our waiter?

262
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:24,100
We need to order lunch
and get back to work.

263
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:31,101
Bruce.

264
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,200
I wanted to thank you.

265
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,401
Hey, Melinda. What for?

266
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,701
Learned a lot this morning.

267
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:40,301
What you did
with IBM-- brilliant.

268
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:43,801
How did you know to stay long
when everyone was selling short?

269
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:47,201
Uh, research,
uh, and instinct.

270
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,700
Your market's not
always gonna roll your way, 

271
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,803
but if you keep an even head,
the odds are with you.

272
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,001
Think I'll write that down.

273
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:54,101
Whiskey on the rocks, right?

274
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,401
Oh, no, no,
let-let me get it.

275
00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:58,102
Bruce, you're a gentleman,
but this one's on me.

276
00:11:58,405 --> 00:11:59,103
Hey

277
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,903
Hey, guys. Would you excuse
me for a minute? Thanks.

278
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:07,000
All right! All right, O'Hara,
got you down for 50 on Miller.

279
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:09,402
You got business
I should know about, Mareno?

280
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:11,001
Strictly
extracurricular.

281
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:14,801
Office pool on who'll be the first
to bag the hot new runner.

282
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:15,901
Melinda?

283
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:18,001
Right now, you're the odds-on
favorite, two to one.

284
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,802
Are you kidding me with this?

285
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,300
Just making a market, Bruce.

286
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,703
What we do for a living.

287
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:24,800
You want in?

288
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:27,101
I don't know what I want.

289
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:28,701
What do you think?

290
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:29,302
Depends.

291
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:31,502
What do you want the wallpaper
to say about you?

292
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,802
That I have good taste
in wallpaper?

293
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:35,000
Come on, Mom.

294
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,900
Try and get in touch
with your authentic self.

295
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,700
- My authentic self?
- Yeah.

296
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:42,802
According to the existentialists,
we're always encountering

297
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:47,400
all these outside pressures from society,
and the only way to remain authentic

298
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:50,500
is to remain true to our own desires,
despite those pressures.

299
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,102
So it really doesn't matter
which wallpaper I like.

300
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,103
It matters which one you like.

301
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,601
I knew I was having
a decorating crisis.

302
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:00,802
I didn't know
I was having an existential one.

303
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:01,701
Sorry.

304
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:03,501
Philosophy final tomorrow.

305
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,703
- And it's an oral exam.
- You'll be fine.

306
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:09,002
You obviously know
what you're talking about.

307
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:12,101
Here maybe, when it's just you
and me and the wallpaper,

308
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,502
but in front
of my entire class?

309
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:16,501
In front of... my teacher?

310
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:24,903
Unfortunately, life isn't always
about doing what we like.

311
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,500
I like this one.

312
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:56,201
The wedding silver?
What's up?

313
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:58,801
I am. I am
up, up, up.

314
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,801
I had the most
incredible day.

315
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,101
Turns out there's more to Susan's
new world than just the Deckers.

316
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,402
These ladies
I met today...

317
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,402
These are the kind of people
we should be friends with,Roger.

318
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:12,702
I'm looking forward
to meeting them.

319
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:14,803
Good,because you're going to
tomorrow night

320
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:18,403
at the Children's Hospital
Ladies Auxiliary Benefit Gala.

321
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:19,403
Sounds fancy.

322
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:22,401
They all belong to Lake Crest
Country Club where we had lunch,

323
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:27,502
and I was thinking,maybe if we make
a good impression tomorrow night,

324
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:29,703
one of them will sponsor us
to join.

325
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,700
Janet, you know
we can't afford a country club.

326
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,301
Well, not right now,
maybe, but...

327
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:40,102
Remember this morning,how you said
you've been selling insurance for 12 years?

328
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,403
Don't remind me.

329
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:45,103
Maybe you need to be reminded,you are
the best salesman that company's got.

330
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,502
Maybe you need to remind
your boss of that, too.

331
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:50,102
Mr. Stone has to realize
how valuable you are.

332
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:53,702
I think it's high time you stood up
and asked for a raise.

333
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:59,800
You certainly deserve it.

334
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,903
We deserve it.

335
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:10,303
My God, that bathing suit?

336
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:12,502
Might as well have
been a nun's habit.

337
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:13,801
Not to me.

338
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:18,200
That was the summer my mom caught
you sneaking out of my room.

339
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,102
You got me grounded
for a month.

340
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:24,203
The one and only time that she dragged
her ass out of bed before noon.

341
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,900
What were the chances?

342
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,600
Thought I told you to go out
the window like everyone else.

343
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:31,201
Shimmy down the drain pipe?

344
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,400
No,I was gonna walk out the door
of your bedroom like a man.

345
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:37,202
Please. You weren't a man
until I made you one.

346
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,302
Oh, no.

347
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:44,902
Actually, being forbidden to see
you was probably the best thing

348
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,202
that could have
happened to us.

349
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:47,503
How is that? 

350
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,502
I always want
what I can't have.

351
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:01,400
Hello?

352
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:02,603
Hey, babe.

353
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:05,602
Tom,you're missing
quite a show here.

354
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:07,602
We dug out
my old slides.

355
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:09,501
- "We"?
- Luke's here.

356
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:12,502
- Where are you?
- Uh, San Francisco.

357
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:15,402
We hit that same weather system over
the Pacific,had to fly around it.

358
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,102
Forced us to stop
and refuel.

359
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,402
I... I should be home
by morning.

360
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:20,702
As long as
you're safe.

361
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:22,602
Miss you.

362
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,502
Yeah, I miss you, too.
Bye-bye.

363
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:30,202
Looks like I'm free for dinner.

364
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,001
So where do you want to take me?

365
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:35,802
Actually, I could stay here
looking at these slides all night.

366
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:37,903
Let's order in.

367
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:41,603
How about a drink,
Captain?

368
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:44,902
Sure.
Why not?

369
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,801
Susan.
Come on in.

370
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:06,402
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

371
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,800
Well, I-I know
it's last minute, but...

372
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,101
uh, Bruce's boss's wife
is hosting a benefit tonight

373
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:16,103
for the Children's Hospital,
and I'm on the committee suddenly.

374
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:20,803
Anyway, we're supposed to invite
people like you and Tom.

375
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:21,800
Say no more.

376
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:23,203
- Count us in.
- Really?

377
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,501
God, that felt great.

378
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,702
What a way to start the day.

379
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:27,603
Hi.

380
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:30,202
Susan,this is Luke,
my boyfriend.

381
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,800
From high school.

382
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:33,503
Oh.

383
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:35,903
Luke, this is my neighbor,
Susan Miller.

384
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:38,302
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you.

385
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:39,603
You're not busy
tonight, are you?

386
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:41,400
Whatever I've got,
I can cancel.

387
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:44,400
Susan,if you're looking for donations,
invite Luke to the benefit.

388
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:45,702
He's filthy rich.

389
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:47,300
Filthy.

390
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:48,800
Who's filthy?

391
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:52,201
Honey...
welcome home.

392
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,800
Thank you. Susan.

393
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:57,701
- Luke.
- Hey there, Tom.

394
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,400
Hey, Trine,
I've got a meeting downtown.

395
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:00,403
Can I grab
a shower?

396
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,200
Sure. Right
through there.

397
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,103
Luke and I had a late night
reminiscing.

398
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:09,902
Think he had one too many.

399
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:14,202
Well, I'm gonna...

400
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:15,901
See you tonight.

401
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:23,702
Predominant cultural norms are inauthentic,
according to Kierkegaard and Heidegger,

402
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:28,500
because they require peopleto behave
in ways that obscure their own desires.

403
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:32,101
So,concluding from that,

404
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:34,401
authentic self-expression
is possible only when 

405
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:39,202
it is unfettered by the confines
of societal conventions.

406
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:40,402
Thank you.

407
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:42,403
Is that it, Laurie?

408
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,803
That's it.

409
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,601
The assignment was to draw
from philosophers we've studied,

410
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:51,203
and from experiences
in your own life.

411
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,603
I know, but...

412
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:53,002
Guys,

413
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:57,202
the subject of this exam 
is authentic self-expression,

414
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:00,403
so,when you're up here,I want you
to really express yourselves. 

415
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:03,102
Laurie,why don't you
take another stab at it?

416
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:09,102
Sorry, Mr. Stephens,
that's all I got.

417
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:14,903
And I've also exceed sales in
each of the past six quarters.

418
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:16,803
Sir, what I'm
saying is this.

419
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:19,600
Based on my track record,
on my experience,

420
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:22,901
I believe I'm ready to step into
a stronger management position,

421
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:25,503
one with a stronger
compensation package.

422
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:28,102
Mr. Field, you're wanted
in the conference room.

423
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:30,203
Well, I believe you're right.

424
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:31,001
Thank you.

425
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:34,000
Unfortunately, Rog,
that just can't happen here.

426
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,300
Not in this economy.

427
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,800
Heck, corporate is forcing me to
make cutbacks at every level.

428
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:43,701
We can't afford to compensate someone of
your experience anymore,not fairly,anyway.

429
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,400
And you know
I am nothing if not fair.

430
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:47,801
- Mr. Stone...
- The truth is,

431
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:51,303
I've kept you as long as I could,
under the circumstances.

432
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:55,601
I wish you luck,
wherever you end up,

433
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,600
and I thank you for
your years of service.

434
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:14,002
Hi, Mr. Thompson.

435
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,103
You're home early.

436
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:21,601
Didn't want to be late
to the party.

437
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:24,000
You better hurry up
and get changed.

438
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,201
I'll-I'll call
the Thompsons.

439
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,002
See if they can be ready
a little earlier.

440
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,000
The Thompsons are coming?

441
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:32,403
To my boss's
wife's benefit?

442
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:35,202
Rita Pierce loved Janet.

443
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:37,200
Then I bet she really loved you.

444
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:39,203
She loved that I brought Janet.

445
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,303
- Tom and Trina are coming,too.
- Good.

446
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,003
Far as I'm concerned,

447
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,602
the Deckers and the Thompsons
cancel each other out.

448
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:49,002
Haven't you chosen
a pattern yet?

449
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:52,702
I'm trying to decide which one
expresses my authentic self.

450
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:53,803
What do you think?

451
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:55,400
Your "authentic self?"

452
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:58,400
Uh, honey, I have no idea
what that is.

453
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,303
Roger!

454
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,203
Janet, wow.

455
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:32,202
I was just in town having my hair
fixed for the benefit.

456
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:34,000
Thought I'd swing by
and pick you up.

457
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,403
Do you like it?

458
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:37,801
Yeah.

459
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:40,802
Oh!
And look.

460
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:43,802
A tuxedo.

461
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,402
It's a rental
from Fells.

462
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:48,803
I was hoping we'd have a little
something extra to celebrate tonight.

463
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,103
Well, don't keep me
in suspense.

464
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:53,403
How did it go
with Mr. Stone?

465
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:55,500
Did he agree
you deserved a raise?

466
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:57,402
He did.

467
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,603
Oh, I knew it!

468
00:21:58,607 --> 00:22:00,402
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

469
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:04,302
Things are about
to change for us, Roger.

470
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:06,002
I can feel it.

471
00:22:07,105 --> 00:22:08,300
Can't you?

472
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:11,701
Yes.
I can.

473
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:20,401
I'm excited.

474
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,400
Are you excited?
I'm excited.

475
00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm not sure I fit in
with these women.

476
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,400
Not... not
like you do.

477
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,701
Susan, you just got
to keep an open mind.

478
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:30,702
Give them a chance.

479
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,200
You know,like you're always
telling me to do with Trina.

480
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,603
- Bruce-ky!
- Hey, Mareno.

481
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:41,102
- You know my wife, Susan.
- Yeah.

482
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,200
I think you met
Janet and Roger at our housewarming.

483
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,501
Yeah, right, right.

484
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:46,703
Hey, remind me what it is
you do again, Rog.

485
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:50,003
Roger's the sales manager
at Mutual of Omaha.

486
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:52,301
Janet!
There you are.

487
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,900
I want you with me,
setting up the auction.

488
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,903
I love auctions.
The excitement, the paddles.

489
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,001
Mr. Mareno,

490
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:01,401
I can't thank you enough for
volunteering to be our auctioneer

491
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:02,103
again this year.

492
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:03,102
It's my pleasure.

493
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,501
Anything for the kids.

494
00:23:04,605 --> 00:23:08,001
Susan, I'd like you to collect
the checks at the end of the night.

495
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:10,601
Uh, Rita, I'm-I'm
Bruce, uh, Miller.

496
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:13,202
I just want to say how fantastic
it is to work for your husband,

497
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:17,600
and-and also what a- a great thing,uh,
this is you ladies are doing tonight.

498
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,701
I'll be sure to pass that on
to Mr. Pierce.

499
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:21,001
Ladies, follow me.

500
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:26,800
Auctioneer?

501
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,202
Hey, man, you want to get
in good with the boss,

502
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:30,400
you gotta get in good
with the boss's wife.

503
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:32,402
I mean, you've got Susan
playing for Team Miller,

504
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:35,100
though with a woman handling the checks,
no wonder it's a non-profit.

505
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:39,403
And speaking of women
and profit...

506
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:41,201
Melinda?

507
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:46,800
I think I'm having
a flashback.

508
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,502
Good one or bad one?

509
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,103
My mother used to parade me
around at these things.

510
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:52,903
Feel like I'm 16 again.

511
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:57,300
With your high school boyfriend here
to complete the trip.

512
00:23:57,306 --> 00:23:58,301
Hi, Tom.

513
00:23:58,507 --> 00:23:59,502
Trina.

514
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,103
Lovely as the day
I first saw you.

515
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,201
Minus the braces
and ponytail.

516
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,900
God, I think the last time
I saw you in a tux was... 

517
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:06,102
Your cotillion.

518
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:08,001
You still remember
the dance?

519
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,202
With your permission,
of course.

520
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:14,102
Go for it.

521
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:37,500
Janet,Susan,
the girls and I have agreed: 

522
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:39,602
we would like to
formally invite you both

523
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:42,803
to join the Children's Hospital
Ladies Auxiliary.

524
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:45,102
Wow, that's...

525
00:24:45,606 --> 00:24:49,802
Such an honor just to be included,
um, in-in-in all your good work.

526
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:51,202
For the children.

527
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,300
- Susan, isn't it an honor?
- It is.

528
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:57,600
Roger,Susan and I have been asked
to join the Ladies Auxiliary.

529
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:58,403
Wow.

530
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:00,800
- That's terrific, honey.
- I know...

531
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:04,801
but, you know,with my schedule
and the kids, I'm not sure

532
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,801
- I'm gonna have time...
- Yeah, ladies, uh,

533
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,200
would you excuse us
just for one moment?

534
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:10,501
By all means.

535
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,403
What are you doing, Susan?

536
00:25:15,506 --> 00:25:17,000
This is a big opportunity
for you.

537
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:19,100
I think you mean
for you.

538
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:20,701
For us.

539
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:21,901
It's not right for me, Bruce.

540
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:24,302
I am nothing
like those women.

541
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:25,500
You've barely given
them a chance.

542
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:26,900
Oh, please,
I- I don't think Rita Pierce

543
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:28,901
could find the Children's
Hospital on a map.

544
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:30,602
And-and what happened
to being open to new things,

545
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:32,502
all options on the table?

546
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:35,000
- This is different.
- Why?

547
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:36,903
Because it's
something I want?

548
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:38,903
You're not being fair.

549
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:41,900
Maybe we should go
over the rules one more time.

550
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:46,601
Bruce...

551
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:56,501
I'll go start damage control.

552
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:15,702
I was passing by
and saw the light on.

553
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:18,200
Yeah, I'm just packing up.

554
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,503
About today...

555
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:28,300
you asked me to express myself
in a true and authentic way,

556
00:26:28,506 --> 00:26:30,803
but the truth is
that you're all I think about,

557
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:33,701
and all I want to do is scream it
out to anyone who will listen,

558
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:36,601
and I knew that anything I said in class
today besides that would come across


559
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:39,501
as complete bull which, unless
I misunderstood the assignment,

560
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:41,202
was the exact opposite
of what you wanted.

561
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:43,203
- Laurie...
- But I couldn't exactly say that, could I?

562
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:47,401
Not in front of the class-your class-
because you're my teacher.

563
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,703
I'm not your teacher anymore.

564
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:53,400
- Huh?
- Summer session's over.

565
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,002
So then, we can...

566
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:07,902
Say whatever we want.

567
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:12,401
I think I'm done talking.

568
00:27:31,507 --> 00:27:32,601
Which one's yours?

569
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:33,500
Sorry?

570
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:35,302
Which trader are
you married to?

571
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:37,003
Uh, Bruce Miller.

572
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:39,400
He's one of
the good ones.

573
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:42,600
- You work for Lehman Pierce?
- Uh-huh.

574
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:44,502
I didn't... I didn't know
they had any, uh...

575
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,802
Women? Not many.

576
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,203
Job's not for everyone.

577
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:50,801
No, I've seen
the trading floor.

578
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:52,401
All that pushing
and shoving.

579
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:53,900
How do you
stand it?

580
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,500
It's what I've always
wanted to do.

581
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:57,300
And a padded blazer
doesn't hurt.

582
00:27:57,306 --> 00:27:58,802
A padded blazer?

583
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,101
Some guys grope.

584
00:28:00,707 --> 00:28:02,502
I figure:
why not fake it,

585
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:04,503
let them think they're getting
what they want?

586
00:28:04,908 --> 00:28:05,902
Fake it?

587
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:06,801
Sure.

588
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,801
I laugh, by an eye.

589
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:10,901
Makes the guys easier
to manage.

590
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:16,501
- That doesn't make you feel...
- Cheap?

591
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:18,900
No, I-I was...

592
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:21,503
going to say inauthentic.

593
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:22,700
They make it hard for me
to do my job, 

594
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:24,703
I do what I can
to make it easier.

595
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:27,102
Sure, I lie a little
every now and then,

596
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,902
but I'm still being true
to myself.

597
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,100
I know exactly who I am.

598
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:47,303
Man, Jan, you
look dynamite.

599
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:49,402
Thank you.

600
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:53,600
Isn't this the most
fabulous party?

601
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:57,000
Uh, been to a lot
of parties in my day.

602
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, not me.

603
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,701
I had no idea Trina
was such a lovely dancer.

604
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:09,003
Yeah, she's a woman
of many surprises.

605
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:12,903
- Janet?
- Hmm?

606
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:14,302
Would you like to dance?

607
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,801
- It was really nice to talk to you.
- And you.

608
00:29:38,805 --> 00:29:39,703
Good luck
with everything.

609
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:41,703
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Yeah, okay.

610
00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:42,901
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hello.

611
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:45,500
Excuse me.

612
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,203
Interesting priorities, Susan.

613
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:52,703
What do you mean?

614
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:55,901
You insult the boss's wife,but
you be friend the lowly runner?

615
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,901
You just asked me
to give these people a chance.

616
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:00,201
I didn't mean her.

617
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:01,800
I like Melinda.

618
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:03,501
And she's not lowly.

619
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:04,401
Unlike most of the women here,

620
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:06,503
she's actually doing something
with her life.

621
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,403
Well,you know all the guys
are taking bets

622
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,003
on who'll be the first
to sleep with her.

623
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:11,603
That says something.

624
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,801
That says more about the guys
than it does about her.

625
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:16,103
Did you try to stop the bet?

626
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:18,400
Or tell her about it?

627
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:22,601
Interesting priorities, Bruce.

628
00:30:25,705 --> 00:30:27,403
Next item up for bid
is dinner for two

629
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:29,501
at the beautiful
Lake Crest Country Club.

630
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:31,801
Start the bidding
at $25, 25...

631
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:34,903
$25 right there.
Do I hear $50?

632
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:35,603
Fifty.

633
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:37,902
$50, do I hear 75...

634
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:39,502
Janet, I need
to talk to you.

635
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,901
Ladies and gentlemen,
$75...

636
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,503
I don't think the Ladies
Auxiliary is right for me.

637
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:44,901
I hope you're not offended.

638
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:46,302
Why would I be offended?

639
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:49,603
Well, a little disappointed
maybe, but not offended.

640
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:53,303
$75, $75 to the gentleman.
How about $100?

641
00:30:53,906 --> 00:30:54,802
For a hundred dollars, folks.

642
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:57,601
Of course I'd rather we join together,
but as it happens,they want me

643
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:58,702
whether you're part
of the package or not.

644
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,800
And we both know
that's not always the case.

645
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:02,702
...$75 going once.

646
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:05,300
So you're okay
if I don't join.

647
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:06,500
As long as you're okay
if I do.

648
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:07,901
$75 going twice.

649
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:08,903
$100!

650
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,203
$100 going once...

651
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:13,200
twice...
sold!

652
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,900
Oh! Oh!

653
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:25,502
So why do you think it is
that we didn't end up together?

654
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:29,100
Must've been
some reason.

655
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:32,400
Ever wish that
we could go back?

656
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:36,601
I like to live
in the here and now.

657
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:38,501
Right here is good.

658
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,000
Right now.

659
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:53,403
Easy, tiger.

660
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:55,802
Tom doesn't have to know.

661
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,803
Yes, he does.

662
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:06,002
Tom and I have
an open marriage.

663
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:07,403
We don't cheat.

664
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:10,701
So, you mean...

665
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:17,900
My wife and I are
a package deal, Luke.

666
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,800
- Uh, Melinda...
- Excuse me.

667
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:30,803
Bruce.

668
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:31,801
Fun night, huh?

669
00:32:31,805 --> 00:32:33,401
Mareno really hammed
it up out there.

670
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:37,100
Yeah. Look, uh,there's something
I-I need you to know about Mareno,

671
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:40,003
and-and all
the Lehman Pierce guys.

672
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,203
They've-they've got this bet.

673
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:45,600
About you.

674
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:47,401
I know.

675
00:32:48,908 --> 00:32:50,403
Mareno just won.

676
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:52,100
What?

677
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:53,301
You and Mareno?

678
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,303
What, here?

679
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:57,901
For the smartest
guy on the floor,

680
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:00,003
you don't know much about
women, do you, Bruce?

681
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,003
No, I, well,
I guess not.

682
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:08,203
I agreed to say
I slept with Mareno;

683
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:10,901
and he agreed to split
the pot with me.

684
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:12,503
Look, how much
did you lose?

685
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:14,703
- I'll give you your money...
- No, uh, no.

686
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,700
I- I didn't bet.

687
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:18,001
You didn't?

688
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,001
I knew you were one
of the good ones.

689
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,102
There you are.

690
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,100
Susan, I overheard
them saying

691
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:33,303
that you are in charge of getting
the checks from the auction.

692
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:36,202
And I'm going need to get
Janet's check back.

693
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:37,302
Why?

694
00:33:40,107 --> 00:33:41,601
I got fired today.

695
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,400
Oh, Roger...

696
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:46,002
I'm so sorry.

697
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:48,201
I'm not.

698
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:51,103
You know what selling
insurance is?

699
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:54,102
It's selling safety.

700
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:56,901
And you know the best way
to sell safety to someone?

701
00:33:57,408 --> 00:33:59,202
- How?
- Scare them.

702
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,703
I was miserable at that job.

703
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,800
I was just too scared
to admit it.

704
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:08,202
Roger, I...

705
00:34:09,705 --> 00:34:10,701
Janet didn't...

706
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,303
Oh, Janet doesn't know.

707
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:14,402
I didn't want to ruin
her big night.

708
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:17,500
Still, you-you shouldn't have
to keep this from her.

709
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,000
It's not about me.

710
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:22,701
I can pretend for one night.

711
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:28,501
I'll see what I can do
about that check.

712
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:30,401
Thanks.

713
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:56,703
I'll be right back.

714
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,202
Okay.

715
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:27,403
Thanks.

716
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:29,100
- I really...
- Forget it.

717
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:30,502
Here.

718
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:32,701
What's this?

719
00:35:32,706 --> 00:35:35,203
The certificate for dinner
at the country club.

720
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:36,303
I bought it for Janet.

721
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:37,802
She'll never know
the difference.

722
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:39,603
Susan, I can't accept this.

723
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:41,400
I owe her lunch anyway.

724
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,103
You ready to go?

725
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:46,402
Good night.

726
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:49,201
Good night.

727
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:01,602
Bye, Susan!

728
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:04,101
I'll see you next week
at the hospital!

729
00:36:04,105 --> 00:36:05,401
Bye, Rita.
See you then.

730
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,701
The hospital?

731
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:08,400
Yeah, I volunteered.

732
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:10,800
I thought the Ladies Auxiliary
wasn't right for you.

733
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:14,002
Maybe I can make it right.

734
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:21,700
And until then,
I can fake it.

735
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:38,103
You coming back in?

736
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:39,802
Oh, I think
I'll sit this one out.

737
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,303
You go ahead though.

738
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:43,100
Babe, what's going on?

739
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:49,802
You and Luke...I don't know...
It just feels different.

740
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,602
Maybe it's 'cause he gets parts
of you that I'm never gonna get.

741
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:53,902
What do you mean?

742
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:55,801
Your childhood

743
00:36:56,407 --> 00:36:57,700
and your family.

744
00:36:58,306 --> 00:36:59,802
You're my family.

745
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:04,300
Do you ever wish
you'd married him instead of me?

746
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,903
I'm gonna tell him to go.

747
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:18,901
Don't.

748
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:20,600
Come on.

749
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,303
Coming to bed?

750
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:02,802
In a sec.

751
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,202
That's the one.

752
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:18,200
You sure?

753
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:20,500
I'm sure.
