00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,810
Previously on Swingtown...

00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,760
Well, congratulations, Bruce.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,740
What's  interesting?

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,110
Our new neighbors.

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,810
They look happy.

6
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,470
Hi.

7
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,400

9
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,680
This is my husband Tom.

10
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,730
Welcome to the neighborhood-- 

11
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,480
if you'd like to share, 

12
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,520
why don't you bring it to our party tomorrow night.

13
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,430
What'd I say, nothing left, huh?

14
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,210
Take it easy.

15
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,590
Bye!

16
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,540
My family's moving, so...

17
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,630
Uh, that's it,everyone.

18
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,720
Mr.Stephens.

19
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,240
Have a good weekend.

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,360
Times have changed, Mom.

21
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,280
Women can decide if and when they want to have sex withomeone.

22
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,360
So, are you?

23
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,560
Having sex?

24
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,500
Samantha.

25
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,880
I ed you to run to the A&P.

26
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,430
We're out of tin foil.

27
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,470
Are you running away?

28
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,000
You should mind your own business.

29
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,970
The new neighbors invited us over for a drink.

30
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,600
That's all.

31
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,790
Out with the old, in with the new.

32
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,220
Why don't you join us?

33
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,960
Hey, it's the new kids in town.

34
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,470
You and Tom have an open marriage?

35
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,290
Honestly, opening our relationship was the best thing 

36
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,710
that ever happened to me and Tom.

37
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,790
Quaalude?

38
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,560
It'll take thedge off.

39
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,640
Uh, Trina?I was trying to  find Susan.

40
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,200
Have youeen her?

41
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,110
She was heading towards the basement.

42
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,170
Down the hall, second door on the left.

43
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,870
What's in the basement?

44
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,970
The playroom.

45
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,000
You won't believe what kind of party this is.

46
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,150
We don't...We don't belong here.

47
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,310
We're gonna stay.

48
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,670
Great hands, Susan.

49
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,080
Soft.

50
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,610
Why don't the four of us  go someplace a littlquieter?

54
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,390
Ooh, hot apple pie.

55
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,870
Now that's the way to start off a week.

56
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,480
Pie  not for you.

57
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,210
Oh, come on, just one   tiny little slice?

58
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,060
Sorry.

59
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,120
Oh, for Pete's sake, Janet, let the man have some pie.

60
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,450
God knows the poor guy  can use a little pie.

61
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
Roger!

62
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,170
Something smells good.

63
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,360
Relax, Jan.

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,650
It's-it's Janet.

65
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,330
Relax, Janet.

66
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,260
You're in good hands.

67
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,810
You both are.

68
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,020
Is anybody gonna    get that?

69
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,210
Don't answer.

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,840
But what if it'..

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,930
I know who it is.

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,050
Yocan't avoid her forever, Janet.

73
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,190
And besides, isn't night card night?

74
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,160
Just let it ring.

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,350
Morning, Ricky.

76
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,290
Sit down, I'll whip up some eggs.

77
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,580
Hon?

78
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,610
What does this tie say about me?

79
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,830
You know, second week with the new firm,

80
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,360
it's time to make an impssion.

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,970
I like you in navy.

82
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,600
'm playing in a whole different league now, Sue.

83
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,920
I gotta dress the part.

84
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't forget, tonight's bridge night with the Thompsons.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,860
We're still doing that?

86
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,920
Good question.

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,270
I haven't been able to get ahold ofanet since...

88
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,230
What, since we brought them to a swinger's party on Saturday night?

89
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,280
Bruce, we are not swingers.

90
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,870
Oh, my God.What did we do?

91
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,670
Nothing everybody else.else isn't ing.

92
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,670
We're not everybody else.

93
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,140
I know-- we're still just Bruce and Susan.

94
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,560
And don't forget, Janet and Rogeare the ones who left.

95
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,730
Let's make a pact.

96
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,460
Let's promise that it'll only be that one time.

97
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,210
You got it.

98
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,380
You want to go for a run?

99
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,590
Oh, I think I just had my exercise for the day.

100
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,740
Thank you.

101
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,020
C'mon, before it gets too hot.

102
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,320
Hello?

103
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,530
You got him.

104
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,380
What, a pilot call in sick?

105
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,020
Really.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,250
All righ well,give me an hour, all right?

107
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,050
I've been summoned by Corporate.

108
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,280
Why, what's going on?

109
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,650
I'm not sure.

110
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,680
Could have something to do with all that talk 

111
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,960
about adding a non-stop to Tokyo 

112
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you think they'll offer you the route?

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,190
They can offer me  whatever they want.

114
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,270
I have no interest in spending my nights 10,000 miles away from you.

115
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,410
Here, genius.

116
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,480
Morning, guys.

117
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,790
Cupboards are kinda bare, Mom.

118
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,340
Well,  I'headed to the store later, 

119
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,660
if you want to add something to the list.

120
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,380
How about everything?

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,530
We just moved.

122
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,310
Big day, Beej?

123
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,070
Not really.

124
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,300
Then I need this more than you.

125
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,860
You have a good day,  kids.

126
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,430

127
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,660
Okay?

128
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,320

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,130

130
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,800
Dad forgot his briefcase.

131
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,110

132
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,130

Yeah, I guess I...

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,950

Oh, God, I'm sorry.

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,710
The backing must've  fallen off.

151
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,360
It happens to me all the time.

152
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,030

171
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,020
One of the perks of the industry.

172
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,090
Not that I have to tell you.

173
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,160
Oh, no, sir.

174
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,380
Please.

175
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,630
Understand you married one  of our stews a few years back.

176
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,230
Yeah, she's    tired, now.

177
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,000
Most of them do when they reach a certain age.

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,240
The rest of them just keep   getting younger and younger.

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,300
Like that pretty little trainee on your Miami route-- 

180
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,340
Tammy Matthews.

181
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,210
Yeah, yeah, nice kid.What about her?

182
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,190
Spilled hot coffee on you during your approach on Friday, is that right?

183
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,210
There was a little turbulence,on the plane; 

184
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,100
no big deal.

185
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,220
That's not all she spilled, Tom.

186
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,500
Kid's been talking to some of the other girls about,  

187
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,440
uh, sharing playtime with you  and your wife.

188
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,580
Yeah, well, that was all  off the clock.

189
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,250
No, no, no, it's not the point.

190
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,190
See, with all these women's libbers out there,

191
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,380
a girl like Tammy could make serious trouble for us.

192
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,540
this'll be your last week on the Miami route.

193
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,690
Am I being fired?

194
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,880
Of course not.

195
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,590
Your flying record is flawless.

196
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,920
In fact, when we announce service to Tokyo next week, 

197
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,570
I want you at the helm of that 747.

198
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,010
You're being promoted.

199
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,450
Congratulations.

200
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,250
Oh, excuse me.

201
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,700
Susan.

202
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,540
Uh, I thought you'd  be shopping on the other side of town now.

203
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,110
Janet.

204
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,660
I've been calling and calling.

205
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
ll, forgive me for not waiting by the phone.

206
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,730
Janet, wait.

207
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,420
I'm sorry about the other night.

208
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,030
We should've left the party with you and Roger.

209
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
Then why didn't you?

210
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,380
Hey, Susan! 

211
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,710
Buy one, get one free--    

212
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
I codn't resist.

213
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,880
Trina, fancy running into you here.

214
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,860
ll, I was just tagging along with Susan for company.

215
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,940
How sweet of you.

216
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,470
Trina, would you excu us for a minute?

217
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,380
I'll be up front.

218
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,710
This is so awkward...

219
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,270
o you spend time with  is none of my business.

220
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,330
Of course it is,  you're my best friend.

221
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,410
Are we still on   for bridge tonight?

222
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,450
Actually, we're not.

223
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,970
Uh, Roger and I made other plans.

224
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,610
If you'll excuse me, I have  a dier party to plan.

225
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,710
...biggest hypocrite  I know!  

226
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,270
u know what?

227
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,800
I can do do what I want to do 

228
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,330
and there is nothing  you can do! 

229
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,740
is getting hopeless   on that stuff!

230
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,060
That is a load   of crap and...

231
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,550
Every time I try to.

232
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,430
Please!Spare me the lecture.

233
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,630
Gail, shut up!   

234
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,220
I'm sick of you making a federal case...

235
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,810
'cause like to have a good time! 

236
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,900
Yeah?Yeah?

237
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,920
And since when did you come an angel anyway?

238
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,970
Gail, you're a junkie!   

239
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,850
Where are you going?

240
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm leaving!    

241
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,750
-Stu...! 
-Go to hell!

242
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,650
Wait! No! No!

243
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,760
Don't you leave me!

244
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,090
I'm sorry!

245
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,740
All right, welcome back, everyone.

246
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,640
I think you'll be very happy to hear 

247
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,870
today marks the official midway  point for our summer session.

248
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,080
I, uh, hope you all found time to enjoy your existential freedom over our bicentennial.

249
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,180
I know I spent mine enjoying your essays on Kierkegaard,    

250
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,270
and, as it seems more than one of you 

251
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,060
struggled to find appropriate literary comparisons to draw from,    

252
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,110
I thought I might offer you all a chance to pull some extra credit.

253
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,100
In the back of your essays,  

254
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,220
you'll see a flyer.

255
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,670
It's for a non-Equity production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting FoGodot.

256
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,060
The director is a very good friend of mine.

257
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,190
She has a very interesting feminist spin on the material-- 

258
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,770
so, if you write a brief, honest review,   

259
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,700
I will bump up that grade on your essays  by one letter.

260
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,300
Raise your hand if you think   you might be able to come.

261
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,820
Great.

262
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,820
So...where should I put these?

263
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,260
Oh, just on the counter here is fine.

264
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,030
Okay.

265
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,950
You know, I'm sorry out everything with Janet.

266
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,420
Believe me, she hasn't always been this tightly wound.

267
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,630
Most of the time she's funny  and thoughtful.

268
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,130
I-I think she's just feeling a litt threatened right now.

269
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,140
By me.

270
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,890
By...change.

271
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,240
Please tell me that Tom and I didn't scare you and Bruce off, too.

272
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,040
No, no, of course not.

273
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,080
You have to understand that that night is so...

274
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,220
far beyond anything Bruce and I have ever done together.

275
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,650
Well, then, I have an idea.

276
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,920
Let's have you over for dinner tonight.

277
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,900
Just your basic, casual evening with friends.

278
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,020
I think you'll see  we're not so different after all.

279
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,450
Hey, Mom.

280
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,800
-Hi.
-Hi 

281
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,250
This is my daughter Laurie.

282
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,380
This is Mrs.Decker,    

283
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,050
our neighbor from   across the street.

284
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,230
The post and beam?

285
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,040
That's us.

286
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,990
It's a great house.

287
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,380
I love how all the glass frames the stone.

288
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,990
Aryou interested in architecture?

289
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,390
Laurie's interested in a lot of things.

290
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,250
She's our resident overhiever.

291
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,550
I see the resemblance.

292
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,750
Nice meeting you.

293
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,350
So...what do you say to dinner?

294
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,580
No Quaaludes, I promise.

295
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,490
You're back.

296
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,550
Coming in?

297
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,510
You bet I am.

298
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,050
How was your morning?

299
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,200
Inresting.

300
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,930
Tell me yours first.

301
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,820
How does four or five days in the Bahamas sound?

302
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,870
Like a bribe.

303
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,740
You said yes to Tokyo, didn't you?

304
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,920
It tns out bringing young stewardesses home isn't the smartest move a captain can make,  

305
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,580
present company excluded.

306
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,270
Well, I could have told you that.

307
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,610
As aatter of fact, I think I did.

308
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,030
You mad?

309
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,940
Ask me from a Japanese pay phone, 

310
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,630
after we've been apart for three days.

311
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,920
You'll still accept the charges, rit?

312
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,850
So...how did you spend  your "interesting" morning?

313
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,070
With Susan.

314
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,570
Susan-and-Bruce Susan?

315
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,910
They're coming over  for dinner tonight.

316
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,550
Wow, that is interesting.

317
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,180
Kind of thought they   were a one-time thing.

318
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,090
Well, doesn't me we can't get to know them better.

319
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,110
How far do we have to drag this crap?

320
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,620
Not much further.

321
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,440
I can't believe you wasted six months' allowance 

322
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
on camping gear for some crazy chick you barely know.

323
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,410
It's her m who's crazy, not Samantha.

324
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, right-- running away to live in the woods is totally rational.

325
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,130
You know, I sure hope y're banging her.

326
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,950
I thought I told you to come alone.

327
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,640
Who's he?

328
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,530
Rick.'s cool.

329
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,180
Anyone else know you'reere?

330
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,410
No.

331
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,450
We can help you set up the tent.

332
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,610
Just leave it.

333
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,950
That's it?

334
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,600
Not even a thank-you?

335
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,180
Thanks.

336
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,600
You n run home to your mom and dad now.

337
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,430
Yeah, she doesn't seem crazy at all.

338
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,340
New York desk likes our position on IBM, 

339
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,600
so stay in the money as long as possible.

340
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,360
Carrie, what do you got?

341
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
Here you go, Bill.

342
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,550
Size trader out of New York wants to unload his position on Standard Oil.

343
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,460
Standard's trading at 40.

344
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,370
Uh, it's a buy.

345
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,670
Seems the word of an ofhore drilling accident might be hitting the wire after  open.

346
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,170
Yeah, I know the marketaker in the oil pit.

347
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,500
He'll work with me on this.

348
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,990
You got an in with Gilboy?

349
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,110
Yeah, he's kind of a mentor.

350
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,760
easy, cowboy, I trade Standa.

351
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,320
SOH is my baby.

352
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,360
Sorry, Mareno, got to fill the order.

353
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,210
Miller, you better deliver.

354
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,300
All right, gents, go print some money.

355
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,500
All right, 15,000 cards.

356
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,330
Standard Oil  at a third.

357
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,300
Look, Standard's up to 42!

358
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,560
Okay if I go to the library after dinner?

359
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,510
Sure, if you bring    your brother.

360
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,740
Are you guys going out tonight?

361
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,930
The new neighbors invited us over.

362
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,060
Is that what you're wearing?

363
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,410
Why?

364
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,720
I don't know.

365
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,280
Mrs.Decker seemed kind of stylish.

366
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,940
I just wouldn't want you to feel frumpy.

367
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,960
Where have you been all day, BJ?

368
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,290
Hanging out with Rick.

369
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,170
Your clothes are filthy.

370
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,190
You have exactly 20 minutes to clean yourself up before dinner.

371
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,330
Frumpy?

372
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,080
Here you are, fellas.

373
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,520
The, uh, the drinks are on me, gentlemen.

374
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,510
Thank you so much.

375
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,530
Thank you.

376
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,510
All right, you know, I'd better call the wife 

377
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,210
and let her know I'm gonna be  a little late.

378
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,870
And a little loaded.

379
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,240
Does anybody got a dime?

380
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,730
Here, I'll apply it against your bonus.

381
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,970
Believe me, you  got one coming.

382
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,930
Thanks, man.

383
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,710
Hello.

384
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,650
y, Laurie, it's Dad.

385
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,560
I-Is Mom there?

386
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,140
No, she left to pick you up.

387
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,560
Uh, yeah, well, I'm, uh, I'm   still, uh...

388
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,150
uh, downtown.

389
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,270
Yeah, could you, uh,  could you write down a number 

390
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,660
and have them page me here when she gets back?

391
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,710
Hey, Susan.

392
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,780
Ror.

393
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,320
You here for Bruce?

394
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,250
I don't think   he was on the train.

395
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Are you sure?

396
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,750
I didn't see him.

397
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,190
Wow, you, uh...

398
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,390
you look great.

399
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,890
A little dressy, maybe, for a bridge game  

400
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,180
but...great.

401
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,900
Janet canceled tonight.

402
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,390
Said you'd made other plans.

403
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,400
I didn't know that.

404
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,210
-She didn't tell me that.
-It's okay.

405
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,790
S's been avoiding me  ever since...

406
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,000
the party,and...

407
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
I don't blame her.

408
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,940
Roger, about the other night...

409
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,330
No.No, no, no, it was fun.

410
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,380
No, I had a good time.

411
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,210
Really.

412
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,920
And you know how Janet is.

413
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,810
She'll, she'll come around.

414
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,120
Looks like you were right abouBruce.

415
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,870
Can I give you a lift home?

416
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,750
Ah, I'm going to,I'm going to walk.

417
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,110
It's the only real exercise I seem to be getting these days, so...

418
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,660
And dinner's probably  already on the table.

419
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,720
Don't want to be late for that.

420
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,960
Bye, Roger.

421
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,810
Hey, kiddo, what's for dinner?

422
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,450
Something weird Mom's cooking.

423
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,860
She around?

424
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,120
In there.

425
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,240
With them.

426
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,650
Oh, Roger, finally.

427
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,000
Uh, Roger, meet Paul and Martha Hincamp.

428
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,700
They moved in to the Millers' old house today.

429
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,190
This is my husband Roger.

430
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,320
Most nights, he's a little more punctual.

431
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,620
Welcome to the neighborhood.

432
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,030
Can I talk to you r a minute?

433
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,330
Excuse us.

434
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,210
I thought tonight was supposed to be a night with Bruce and Susan.

435
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,730
Well, if they can move on, so can we.

436
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,470
I got you a new shirt, it's upstairs on the bed.

437
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,270
Now, hurry up and chan.

438
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,390
Dinner's almost ready.

439
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,580
Can I frhen up  anyone's drink?

440
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,550
Susan, come on in.

441
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,010
Tom's still getting ready.

442
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,400
You look great.

443
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,550
Thanks, but I   have bad news.

444
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,840
uce and I can't make dinner.

445
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,440
Well, Bruce specifically.

446
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,730
I-I wanted to   drop off this wine to apologize.

447
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,760
Oh, is everything okay?

448
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,700
apparently, he had a run of good luck thisfternoon,  

449
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,710
so he's off celebrating at thelayboy Club with his trading budes.

450
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,380
The Playboy Club--  now, there's an idea.

451
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,120
Oh, Tom's a member, too.

452
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,730
Oh, Bruce isn't a member.

453
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,150
I don't think.

454
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,200
I say we head downhere and surprise him.

455
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,970
Oh, I don't know.

456
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,500
Oh, well, you can't waste that fantastic dress on a night in.

457
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,560
Bruce will love it.

458
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,020
Are women even allowed?

459
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,400
Allowed and encouraged.

460
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,270
Let me just go digp my key to the club.

461
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,460
How about a drink   before we go?

462
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,700
gimlet, right?

463
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,530
Hey, Laur.

464
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,860
Where you headed?

465
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,130
To the El ation.

466
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,950
I like the new digs.

467
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,170
No wonder I haven't seen you around.

468
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,670
Probably got lost  in all those rooms.

469
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,810
I don't have time for this, Loga

470
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,460
Like you said, 

471
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,400
I was, um,an idiot the other night at the beach.

472
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,230
Just wanted to make it up to you.

473
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,940
Look...

474
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,390
you're aeally good guy, 

475
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,120
and I've had a lot of fun hanging out with you this summer, 

476
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,100
but we just don't have anytng in common, so...

477
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,880
Comen.

478
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,980
Let me give you a ride  wherever you're off to, 

479
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,020
and we'll talk about it.

480
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,310
I'm going downtown to see a play.

481
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,710
I love pys.

482
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,550
Name one, and I'll take the ride.

483
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,160
Hair.

484
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,240
Who's up for one more?

485
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,000
No.

486
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,430
Can't.

487
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,220
Got to get home before the wife starts wondering what I'm up to.

488
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,600
One of a hundred reasons I never tied the knot.

489
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,170
I do enoh lying on the trading floor.

490
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,100
If you marry the right girl, 

491
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,900
you don't have to li 

492
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,070
That girl don't exist.

493
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,610
Actually, she  just walked in.

494
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,390
This is so last minute.

495
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,250
Susan?

496
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,340
Surprise.

497
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,270
What a you doing here?

498
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,160
Is it all right?

499
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,550
What, are you kidding?

500
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,540
How did...?

501
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,730
Oh, long story.

502
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,930
-Bruce, good  to see you.
-Bruce.

503
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,880
Trina!

504
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,680
What are you doing in our neck of the woods...

505
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,580
-Brad.Tom.
-without so much as a phone call?

506
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,150
Spur of the moment adventure.

507
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,110
Trina, youook lovely, as always.

508
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,990
Susan, Bruce,   Sylvia and  Brad Davis.

509
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,500
Hi.How are you?

510
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,190
Hi.Nice to meet you.

511
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,400
Hi.Nice to meet you.

512
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,120
You have to have at least one drink with us.

513
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,900
Well, we just got ourselves a booth, 

514
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,420
so, why don't we  all sqeze in?

515
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,200
Good.

516
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,300
You sure it's okay

517
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,150
Damn liberals would rather give handouts to drunken welfare mothers 

518
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,650
than pay for a war to kick the Commies' ass.

519
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,160
'Nam's a war we could have won.

520
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,290
That's a fact.

521
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,960
I'm not so sure about that, Paul.

522
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,270
Well, I guess we'll never know.

523
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,910
And watch out for this Carter guy.

524
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,330
All smiles and  Southern charm.

525
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,870
What you think the devil's gonna look lik 

526
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,240
Horns and fire?

527
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,980
More corn?

528
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,080
Martha?

529
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,090
Corn gives my wife gas.

530
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,600
You're excused, Ricky.

531
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,930
Finally.

532
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,500
I'll go get the pie.

533
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,970
-No, I'll get it.
-I'm...Excuse me.

534
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,970
I'm gonna...

535
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,780
get the pie.

536
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,810
Man, is that guy a douche.

537
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,040
How'd you like to make five bucks?

538
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,990
All female cast?

539
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,470
there any  nudity in this?

540
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,780
Could you please tryot to completely humiliate me?

541
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,200
, Laurie, glad you made it.

542
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,250
You're jusin time.

543
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,840
Hey, man, is  this your play?

544
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,090
No.

545
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,440
This is Mr.Stephens.

546
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,890
He teaches the class.

547
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,290
Oh, cool.I'm Logan.

548
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,580
curtain's about to go up, so, come on.

549
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,770
????

550
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,550
We'll have a party.

551
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,090
Just you and me.

552
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,710
I'll wear something nice.

553
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,900
Hurry up.

554
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,630
Okay.Bye-bye.

555
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,590
Who's there?

556
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,030
You.

557
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,550
What do you want?

558
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,790
I'm sorry.

559
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,770
Well, I don't suppose you two play bridge?

560
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,300
Mom?!    

561
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,400
What is going on in here?

562
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,150
I'm sorry, Mom.

563
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,200
It-It just slipped out of my hands.

564
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,650
Boys his age are  always getting into some kind of trouble.

565
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,340
Cut's pretty deep.

566
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,240
We're gonna have to get him to the emergency room.

567
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,300
Let me see.

568
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,110
Oh, my God! What the...?

569
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,970
Let me get the first aid kit.

570
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,730
Sorry, folks.

571
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,220
We're gonna have to call it a night.

572
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,790
Yeah.Come on, Martha,let's get out of the way.

573
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,090
Thanks for   the eats, Jan.

574
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,240
It's Janet.

575
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,450
Relax, Mom.

576
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,580
It's just a gag.

577
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,160
Ketchup.

578
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,130
It was Dad's idea.

579
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,880
Well, then...

580
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,500
I guess the joke's on me.

581
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,000
-Thank you.
-Of course.

582
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,080
I can't believe the outfits they make these girls wear.

583
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,660
It must be so humiliating.

584
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,980
Actually, ere's power in it.

585
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,130
Thatunny tail put me through law school.

586
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,290
-You were a bunny?
-You're a lawyer?

587
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,740
Yes, and yes.

588
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,920
Sylvia's a partner at Kessler and Loeb.

589
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,980
But I worked here from '68 till '72.

590
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,240
Organized the girls into a union before I left.

591
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,440
Now they are fully insured, with benefits.

592
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,740
I still have the costume at hom 

593
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,550
Indeed she does.

594
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,230
And what do    you do, Brad?

595
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,520
Veryittle compared to my wife.

596
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,110
Brad's a psyclogist.

597
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,600
He's written three books on human sexuality.

598
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,530
And how about you, Susan?

599
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,910
Just a homemaker...

600
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,120
and a mother.

601
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,670
Culturally speaking, raising a family i the most snificant job there is.

602
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,170
Ugh! Could you be more condescending?

603
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,910
I meant it as a compliment.

604
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,570
How-How many   women work at your firm, Sylvia?

605
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,010
Not nearly enough.Why?

606
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,160
Are you thinking about taking the bar any time soon?

607
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,910
Oh, I think the time for law school has passed me by.

608
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,890
Says who?

609
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,710
Today's womacan do anything she puts her mind to.

610
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,330
How about a toast?

611
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,260
To the women in our lives.

612
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,460
And to new friends.

613
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,990
Cheers.

614
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,620
Oh! I love this song.

615
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,520
Susie?

616
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,610
Go on.

617
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,130
Shall we, gentleman?

618
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,690
Whoever's out there,  I have a gun,    

619
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,970
and I know how to use it.

620
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,330
It's BJ.

621
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,220
That's just a t.

622
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,920
What are you  doing here?

623
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,470
I brought you some dinner.

624
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,020
Tuna andoodles.

625
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,800
You're letting all the bugs in.

626
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,150
In or out?

627
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,990
Let me see.Let me see.

628
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,330
Ha! What was I saying?

629
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,470
We could go on fm there.

630
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,820
What were you saying when?

631
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,060
At the very beginning.

632
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,460
At the very   beginning of what?

633
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,700
What the hell are  they talking about?

634
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,390
Shh! This evening...

635
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,310
I was saying...I was saying...

636
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,690
Babe, just say it already.

637
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,460
Shh! Shh! 

638
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,850
I got to get out of here.

639
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,580
-Then go.
-Fine.

640
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,460
We were happy.Happy...

641
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,700
You coming?

642
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,650
What do we do now that we're happy?

643
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,650
We go on waiting.

644
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,470
Waiting.

645
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,870
Let me think.

646
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,290
It's coming.

647
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,820
Go on waiting.

648
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,460
Now that we're happy.

649
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,110
Let me see.

650
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,150
Ah, the tree!

651
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,410
The tree?

652
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,600
Look at it.

653
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,320
Do you not remember?

654
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,440
I saw yo mom today.

655
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,190
She was fighting with some guy.

656
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,550
That's Stu.

657
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,700
And they're always fighting.

658
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,630
But he's not your dad.

659
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,560
My dad went to Vietnam when I was five   and never came back.

660
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,700
To me,At least not to us.

661
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,450
How'd you get his wedding ring?

662
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,670
Just came one year   in a Christmas card.

663
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,920
It's a walkie-talkie.

664
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,030
The other one's at my house,    

665
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,450
in case you need anything.

666
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,590
Thanks.

667
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,090
Uh, but I-I don't think the signal would reach.

668
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,770
You can't stay out here    foreve you know.

669
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,170
I-I'sure my mom has the cops    looking everywhere  for me by now.

670
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,360
Actually, I don't even think    she knows you're missing.

671
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,030
I'm pretty sure Rick and I are the only ones who know you're here.

672
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,850
You need to go.

673
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,130
Come back with me-- 

674
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,330
if things gebad, you can stay in my room as long as you want.

675
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,560
Look, I can take  care of myself.

676
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,600
Let me help you.

677
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,900
Just go.

678
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,840
What?

679
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,580
You and me, here?

680
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,110
Dancing, surround   by all these people.

681
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,390
Doesn't seem that weird, does it?

682
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,650
No, it doesn't.

683
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,920
Do you have any idea   how much I love you?

684
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,640
Tell me.

685
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,770
You just keep surprising me.

686
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,270
That's a good thing, right?

687
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,990
And it's only gonna get better.

688
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,510
It's incredible.

689
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,480
What?

690
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,900
You and Tom.

691
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,450
That it actually works.

692
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,490
You're really not jealous?

693
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,760
Oh, it's only sex.

694
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,400
It's not what really matters.

695
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,020
Bruce and I made a pact.

696
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,100
Notto do it again.

697
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,150
The swging.

698
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,930
Oh, good.

699
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,570
You should both decide for yourselves what works and what doesn't, 

700
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,700
just as long as you're on the same page,

701
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,590
and believe me, 

702
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,760
Tom and I   have a few pacts of our own.

703
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,690
I am so happy I met you, Trina.

704
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,700
Me, too.

705
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,600
What happened to Brad and Sylvia?

706
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,540
Oh, you just missed them.

707
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,820
Sylvia has court in the morning   

708
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,600
Oh, that's too bad.

709
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,130
We've all been invited  to a penthouse at the Hancock for a little after party.

710
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,910
Oh, you know, we gotta home to the kids,

711
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,130
but we'll take a taxi.

712
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,830
Actually, you know, I think I'm ready to head back, too.

713
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,460
It's been a long day.

714
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,230
I'll go get Bruc

715
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,350
You okay?

716
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,800
Yeah, it's nice having  spontaneous nights like this.

717
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,930
I don't want to lose that.

718
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,830
Because of Tokyo.

719
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,270
We'll make it work.

720
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,410
It'll be really great.

721
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,790
Oh, you think?

722
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,180
Hey.

723
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,150
You ready to go?

724
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,080
Yeah.

725
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,720
I'll go get my jacket.

726
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,460
The only thing that can save these characters is the act of leaving, 

727
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,110
not just the desire to leave.

728
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,260
But existentialists don't believe that life actually has an objective.

729
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,840
True, but it still has value,  

730
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,850
and to achieve that value, a  person has to live, 

731
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,070
not just talk about it.

732
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,440
Anane, this is Laurie Miller,

733
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,060
the student I was telling you about.

734
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,210
Uh, Anane directed the play.

735
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,790
So, what'd you think of the productn?

736
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,300
Brilliant.

737
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:46,530
I loved that you turned a play about existential inertia into aeferendum on feminine stereotypes.

738
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,170
I'm glad it spoke to you.

739
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,600
So, how'd it all end?

740
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,430
Wait-- let me guess.

741
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,400
"Should we go?

742
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,390
No, let's stay.

743
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,110
"No, you stay.

744
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,210
Okay, fine, I'll go." 

745
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,580
There's a bar around the corner that doesn't card.

746
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,030
You guys want to check it out?

747
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,030
I'm sorry.

748
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,190
Can you excuse us?

749
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,360
Yeah, yeah.

750
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,480
Who was that guy?

751
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,760
Mellow out, I'm  just joking around.

752
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,690
But you're not funny.

753
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,780
Why, because I don't care about that dbass play?

754
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,100
No, because I   care about it,  

755
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,830
but you're too busy  embarrassing me to give a damn.

756
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,790
Right, I almost forgot whatn idiot you think I am.

757
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,850
Fine-- you're such a genius?

758
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,150
Figure out your own way home.

759
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,070
You need a    ride, Laurie?

760
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,150
That'd be great.

761
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,990
You mind if we make a detour to the North Shore?

762
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,790
No problem.

763
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,160
Well, you ladies wait here, 

764
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,190
and I'll "Godot" get the car.

765
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,020
I'm headed up to bed.

766
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,580
Sorry about the dish.

767
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,250
Dinner was terrific, by the way.

768
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,700
It was a disaster.

769
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,230
Those people were a disaster.

770
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,940
Dinner was great.

771
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,060
One of the best you ever made.

772
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:24,770
Really?

773
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,140
Yeah.

774
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,270
Hey, look...

775
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,730
I guess I don't say it enough, 

776
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,850
how ch I appreciate everything u do to make things so perfect all the time.

777
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,150
Thank you.

778
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,080
So, why is it,

779
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,620
no matter how hard I try,  

780
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,590
everything still seems  to be falling apart around me?

781
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,270
Hey...

782
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,530
Everything's not falling apart.

783
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,960
I miss Susan.

784
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,410
Then do something about it.

785
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,410
I'm not sure I know what to do.

786
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,060
Janet?

787
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,620
at are you guys doing here?

788
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,080
Uh, I..

789
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,450
We just...I just, um...

790
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,020
Janet wanted to, uh, drop off a pie for you.

791
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,350
At this hour?

792
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,130
I don't know what    we were thinking.

793
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,700
Obviously, I should have waited till morning.

794
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,730
We, good night.

795
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,810
Hey, fun night tonight.

796
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,240
Yeah, thanks  for the ride.

797
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,900
Yeah, I'll call you, Susan.

798
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,220
Good night, everyone.

799
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,300
Your pie is on the stoop.

800
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,800
Janet, wait.

801
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,630
Do you want to come in?

802
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,870
I could make some decaf.

803
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,050
No, thank you.

804
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,480
Roger?

805
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,210
Hello?

806
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,220
Samantha, where are you?

807
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,930
Home.

808
00:40:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
