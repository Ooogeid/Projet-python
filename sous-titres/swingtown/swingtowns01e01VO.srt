00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,120
listen up,folks.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,490
It's time to stub out those cigarettes and finish up your cocktails.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,600
I've just initiated our descent into o'hare.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,640
The weather down there is hot and muggy,so I hope your bicentennial plans include...

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,340
Too rough.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,540
Include a dip in the la.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,890
Fasten your seat belts,good people.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,260
I'll have you at the gate in 30.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,200
-It'll blister.
-It's not that bad.How's,um...

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,660
Tammy.Young,useless,in tears,of course.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,930
I'll check in the back for some burn cream.

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,860
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky...

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,100
July 2,1976

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,820
you okay,tammy.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,430
Oh,I'm so embarrassed.I just hate myself.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,200
Take it easy.

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,630
It was an accident.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,670
Your shirt's ruined.

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,960
It's okay.I have plenty.

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,390
Your wife is going to kill me.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,320
my wife is going to love you.

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:19,130
Your love is liftin' me higher 

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,280
than I've ever been lifted before 

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,470
********

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:44,390
quench my desire and I'll be at your side forever more 

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:02:00,580

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,360

28
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,530
-Have any questns for me.
-Uh,no.

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,820
-Ngratulations,bruce.
-That's it.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
Well,everything but the mortgage.

31
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,490
sorry,sorry.got kind of caught up in the moment there.

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,060
No,no,I wish my little lady were still as enthusiastic.

33
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,930
I cat imagine why she wouldn't be.

34
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,040
Don'forget to let me know when you and the missus have that housewarming.

35
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,500
I'm gonna give our guest a ride home.

36
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,840
It was really nice meeting you,mrs.Decker.

37
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,820
-Uh,you're really,um...
-you,too.

38
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,550
-What's so interesting.
-Our new neighbors.

39
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,890
They look happy.

40
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,170
Yeah,I was just thinking the same thing.

41
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,560
I'll be right back.

42
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,380

43
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,100
Drop me back at the train.

44
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,410
Can't you take the rest of the day.

45
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,410
Not really the right ssage to send my first week on the new job.

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,790
This is going to change everything,isn't it,bruce.

47
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,900
Only for the better.

48
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,310
hey,take these.

49
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,600

88 cents a pound.

55
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,880
Why is it,whenever we have a block party,I always draw the most expensive item at thpicnic.

56
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,440
Why don't we switch.I'll bring the meat and you can gethe corn.

57
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,460
We may not be able to afford a mansion off the lake,but we can certainlypring for a few hamburgers.

58
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,950
You have any extra cardboard boxes in the back.

59
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,100
Oh,sure,mrs.Miller.You want big,all,medium.

60
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,090
Whatever you can spare.We're moving this weekend.

61
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,650
To a lakeside mansion.

62
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,800
That's right,frank.My butler will be doing the shopping from now on.

63
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,820
I'llet them by the side door.

64
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,240
Hi,how are you doing today.

65
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,980
You're going to miss me,you know.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,610
No,I'm not,'cae I'm only moving a few blocks away.

67
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,810
Ricky,off.

68
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,680
Last thing you need is more sugar-- put it back.

69
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,270
-Mom.
-Rick.

70
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,450
Cart,too,bj.

71
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,300
D hurry up; you still have that whole basement to pack.

72
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,470
If it's only three blocks,then why do you even need to move at all.

73
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,000
They say change is good.

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,650
To be honest,I feel like I'm ready for the next thing,you know.

75
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,580
Hmm,guess I've always been happy with the way things are.

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,680
You know,all this time,I had no idea you were so unsatisfied.

77
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,330
Hi,how are you.

78
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,400
I have a coupon for that.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,010
Samantha.

80
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,070
Where are you.

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,070
samantha.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,460
I need you to run to the a&P.We're out of tin foil.

83
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,340
Come on in and I'll give you some money.

84
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,340
Hurry it up.

85
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,740
Just a few more minutes,guys.

86
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,530
I know some of you are heading out of town for the fourth,

87
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,080
so we'll hold off talking about your essays till next week.

88
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,290
It's the only long weekend we get during summer session,so...

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,890

90
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,220
Looking forward to it,laurie.

91
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm not going anywhere.

92
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,300
This weekend.

93
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,370
My family's moving,so,I guess,technically,I am going somewhere.

94
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,890
Just a few blocks,but still.

95
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,380
My dad is such a capitalist.

96
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,930
uh,that's it,everyone,come on,bring them up.

97
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,660
mr.Stephens.

98
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,110
Have a good weekend.

99
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,620
Oh,you,too,laurie.Good luck with the move.

100
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,690
what are you doing here,logan.

101
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,090
Giving you a ride,if you hop i wasting a day off if you don'T.

102
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,490
you're stoned.

103
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,030
-uh,pomade,dye.
-Things you put on your hair.

104
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,520
uh,butter,uh,sheets.

105
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,520
Things that you spread.

106
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,060
$10,000.

107
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,990
Sorry that took so long.

108
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,130
Kid lives way out in schaumburg at her parents' house.

109
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,410
-You believe that.
-YeS.

110
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,640
What was her name again.Cammy.Kimmy.

111
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,460
Something like that.

112
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,950
She had a name tag.

113
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,280
Tammy.But she will probably be fired after her performance today,

114
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,140
or at least kicked down to commuter service.

115
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,930
Seems me you enjoyed her performance just fine.

116
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,240
Are you jealous.

117
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,620
You know you are the only stewardess for me.

118
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,540
jerk.

119
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,080
Let's just keep it in our age bracket for awhile,okay.

120
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,910
Done.

121
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:20,220
darling,if you want me to be closer to you get closer to me...

122
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,230
-Honey.
-In the bedroom.

123
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,420
Kids around.Thought could swing them by the house.

124
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,520
Bj's across the street,laurie's not back yet.

125
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,210
Even better.

126
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,830
Let's head over without them.

127
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,090
Might be the only time we get the new house all to ourselves.

128
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,350
Bruce,do I seem unsatisfied to you.

129
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,240
what are you talking about.

130
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,840
We...we got everything we er wanted.

131
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,280
Nothing.Forget I said it.

132
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,160
So...what do you say.

133
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,780
mom.

134
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,060
Just leave it in the hall.

135
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,260
And stop breaking into that house next door.

136
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,270
The new family moves in tomorrow.

137
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,980
I can't believe these were hiding in your basement the wholtime.

138
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,200
Your dad's a perv.

139
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,560
He'll also be a murderer if he finds out we swiped these.

140
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,460
Relax,we timed it so he'll think the movers stole 'em.It's perfect.

141
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,390
You know,this chick looks just like betsy burdis.

142
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,010
No way.

143
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,420
I'm not talking about the face.

144
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,640
-I should send in a polaroid of her.
-Like she'd give you one.

145
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,130
I'm telling you,if her mom hadn't come home last week,we'd have gone all the way.

146
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,750
You and betsy burdis.Right.

147
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,510
What you doing,ricky.

148
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,030
go away,dad.

149
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,770
Why is this door locked.

150
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,690
It's open.

151
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,220
Everything okay in here.

152
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,100
Fine.What do you want.

153
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,400
Can't give a hello to the old man after work.

154
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,790
Hi.Can you go now.

155
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,070
Bj,your mother just called.She's running late with dinner.

156
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,110
I'll set another place.

157
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,710
It's your lucky day,pal.

158
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,750
My wife's famous sloppy joes tonight,am I right.

159
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,380
Every friday.Go wash up.

160
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,480
Where the heck did you get this.

161
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,140
Nowhere.

162
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,530
Some kid.

163
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,940
Don't let your mother catch you with this.

164
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,880
She'd have a coronary on the spot.

165
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,060
Let's do this right.

166
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,810
welcome home,mrs.Miller.

167
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,680
I swear,if your back goes out...

168
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,950
bruce,I'm a mess.

169
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,870
Who's complaining.

170
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,940
The windows.

171
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,570
Okay.Pick whatever room you want.

172
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,020
They're all ours.

173
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:04,750
hey hey what's the matter with your head,yeah...

174
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,730
bruce,please.Hold on,give me two seconds to catch up.

175
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,310
Okay,one...two.

176
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,450
Bruce...bruce,just hold on.

177
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,170
What.What is the problem.

178
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,500
It's easier for you to get there,you kw that,and,and...

179
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,370
just not always so easy to keep you there once I join in.

180
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,950
low blow.

181
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,770
I...I'm sorry.

182
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,920
I didn't mean it like that.

183
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,300
How did you mean it.

184
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,440
hi.We were just heading out for a run,and s you pull up.

185
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,370
I think we're interrupting.

186
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,030
No,my husband was ju...we-we were just...

187
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,120
we'll come back.

188
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,860
No,it's fine,really...

189
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,110
-I'm susan.
-Trina decker.

190
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,810
This is my husband tom.We live right acrosshe street.

191
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,490
-Bruce miller.
-Hi.

192
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,190
Welcome to the neighborhood.

193
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,360
dom perignon.

194
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,730
I'm afraid we don't have any glasses.

195
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,630
Well,tell you what.

196
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,370
If you'd like to share,why don't you bring it to our party tomorrow night.

197
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,050
Come either way,we'll light some fireworks,you can make some new friends...whatever you're into

198
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,730
-Tomorrow's going to be a long day.
-we'll try to make it.

199
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,360
Great.I'm guessing you have children.

200
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,950
Two.

201
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,410
Well,u might want to get a sitter.This partyill go late.

202
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,390
Hey,I'm heading over to schaeffer's to pick up the booze.

203
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,130
-Need anything while I'm out.
-Aspirin.

204
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,910
And a pack of 100s.

205
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,860
Sohat do you think of our new neighbors.

206
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,220
We,they seem nice.Good-lookin'.

207
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,450
My guess is he hit it big in the market; not huge.

208
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,890
You think they'll show tonight.

209
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,930
-Why,you interested.
-I don't know yet.

210
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,550
Seemed a little straight and narrow.

211
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,130
Might be kind of a tough sell.

212
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,370
Syea is boring.

213
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,240
ricky,get rid of those things before you lose a finger.

214
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
hello.

215
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,510
Hi,logan.I guess you get the honor ofhe last phone call in the old house-- hold on.

216
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,100
Laurie,logan's on the phone.

217
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,230
Hey,what's happening.

218
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,340
We're at the bitter end,mercifully.

219
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,760
I don't know,can we decide later.

220
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,670
Because I'm anding in the living room with my mom staring at me.

221
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,620
Okay,bye.

222
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,020
What is it you think you can't say in front of me

223
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,340
Mom,can you just not.Pleas 

224
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,620
no,I can't "just not.

225
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,000
This has been going on all summer.

226
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,320
Things getting serious.

227
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,660
Logan hasn't read a book since he finished high school.

228
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,650
He can barely hold a five-minute conversation with me.

229
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,990
Well,it's not the conversation I'm worried about.

230
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,610
He's an older boy.

231
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,690
Times have changed,mom.

232
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,610
Women can decide if and when they want to have sex with someone.

233
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,000
So,are you.

234
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,090
Having sex.

235
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,430
you say that like it's the worst thing a person could do.

236
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,330
That's not an answer.

237
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,320
Look,I get that I'm the same age that you were when dad knocked you up

238
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:15,020
but you don't need to worry,'cause I'm smarter than that.

239
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,500
I know you are.

240
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,600
I just-- I want you kid to have happy,healthy lives.

241
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,060
It keeps me up at night.

242
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,030
You know there are better things to do at night.

243
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,010
 Okay,that's everything.I sent the truck ahead.

244
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,010
Hey,dad,what's the last book you read.

245
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,130
The last book.I,uh...

246
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,270
I thumbed through the shark parts of jaws.Doeshat count.

247
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,630
What do you think,mom.Es that count.

248
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,790
Bj.

249
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,030
So,anyone have any final words to say for the old casa.

250
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,470
nah,me,neither.

251
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,880
Come on,let's hit it.

252
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,340
-Bruce,just a sec.
-What.

253
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,430
I'm st going to check upstairs in case I left anything.

254
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,270
There's nothing up there,babe,I doub-checked...

255
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,220
actually,dad,could you get this for me.

256
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,570
It's kind of heavy.

257
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,030
I swear,between you and your mother...

258
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,460
I call the room farthest from them.

259
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,890
Excellent.

260
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,130
i think it was this'll be great.

261
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,970
are you trying to be ironic.

262
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,530
That's your department,laur.I just like the song.

263
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,420
this is so humiliating.

264
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,330
Hey,I'm gog to get you.

265
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,290
Hey.Be right back.

266
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,680
need a hand there,big shot.

267
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,890
You're about the only guy I'm going to miss around here,rog.

268
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,150
I wish you could come with us.

269
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,140
If you,uh,need some help backing out,I'll make sure you don't hit any kids.

270
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,960
See ya.

271
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,470
What the heck is keeping your mother.

272
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,360
Susan.

273
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,870
uh,it's a scrapbook.Mostly pictures.

274
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,500
Uh,pressed flowers from your garden,some of my recipes.

275
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,680
Janet,that is so thoughtful.

276
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,500
I know,I know-- I'm being ridiculous.

277
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,850
It's just you...

278
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,380
you've been my best friend for so,so long...

279
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,240
that's not going to change.

280
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,770
Everybody's waiting,sue.

281
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,530
Go,go,go.

282
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,440

283
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,210
I' call you.

284
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,650
Take it easy.Bye.

285
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:29,220
Funny days in the park every day's the fourth of july...

1
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,370
hello.

2
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,040
It's me.

3
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,270
Just wanted to see if you went home with a blue ribbon for your apple pie.

4
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,340
Janet: Four years in a row.

5
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,240
how's it going over there.

6
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,320
I keep thinking we had to have moretuff.

7
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,030
This place is so big.

8
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,550
Keep us together so,uh,what are you doing for dinner tonight.

9
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,000
God,I haven't even thought about it.

10
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,870
Bruce just walked in.

11
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,290
He wanted me to apologize for missing the barbeque.

12
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,650
Tell him inderstand.

13
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,970
It was a big day.

14
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,580
can I call you later.

15
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,070
I'll be here.

16
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,220
Okay.Bye.

17
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,340
How's old janet.

18
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,830
It her wrists yet.

19
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,480
Janet may be a handful,but she is the most loyal person I know.

20
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,360
Loyal or clingy.

21
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,310
Stop it.

22
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,230
Okay,okay.

23
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,390
You know...

24
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,770
things are pretty damn good for us right now.

25
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,130
Here's to you and me,enjoying every minute ofT.

26
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,390
let's go to the neighbors party tonight.

27
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,600
Start things off right.

28
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,940
We can't leave bj by himself.

29
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,790
He's a big boy; he'll be fine.

30
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,240
Okay if I go to the movies tonight.

31
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,610
absolutely.

32
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,230
My treat.

33
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,460
Big date.

34
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,730
Just rick.

35
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,660
Don't you have any other friends thanhat kid.

36
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,200
Susan: Do you want me to give you a ride,honey.

37
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,210
We're going to bike.

38
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,390
See how well that worked out.

39
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,380
those things are all nitrates.

40
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,080
Worse than cigarettes.

41
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,820
What are you doing here,mr.Stephens.

42
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,470
It's still a public beach,last ickheed.

43
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,710
No...

44
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,370
I mean,yeah,but...

45
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,170
don't think it's weird,running into one of your students here.

46
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,250
I mean,not weird,just...

47
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,190
out of context.

48
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,310
Right.

49
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:37,040
I should warn you,I also go to theupermarket,the post office,and the occasional dylan concert.

50
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,960
Dylan.Really.

51
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,430
Did yoread my essay yet.

52
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,550
I did.

53
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,110
That doesn't sound like an "A.

54
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,360
You didn't follow the assignment.

55
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,320
Why.

56
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,440
Because tropic of cancer isn't approved source material.

57
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,260
No.Henry miller's a master.

58
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,170
You were supposed to choose one terary example of kierkegaardian freedom,

59
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,900
and then one from your n personal experience.

60
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,720
Unless you and anais nin were pals,u didn't answer the question.

61
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,430
Anais nin is so much more interesting than I am.

62
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,180
Noing I've done comes close to what she writes about.

63
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,640
Guess you have to work on that.

64
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,940
that your boyfriend.

65
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,170
Yeah...

66
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,090
not really.

67
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,230
Um,I should go.

68
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,810
Hey,happy independence day.

69
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,360
My makeup bag went missing,so I had to borrow laurie'S.

70
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,770
Too much.

71
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,580
Are you kidding.

72
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,710
knock,knock.

73
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,910
Hi,guys.

74
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,180
What are you doing here.

75
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,670
Thought you might want the extra brats and burgers from the cookout.

76
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,940
Leovers...now that's a hoewusarming gift.

77
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,040
Hey,we also brought a six-pack.

78
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,490
I'm just messing with you,rog.Much appreciated.

79
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,610
Hey,I wish we knew you were coming.

80
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,190
We were just stepping out.

81
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,760
so it seems.

82
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,530
When you said you didn't ha any plans tonight,I thought...

83
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,310
well,the new neighbors invited us over for a drink.That's all.

84
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,700
Well,don'T...

85
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,740
let us stand in your way.

86
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,390
Out with the old,in with the new.

87
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,490
Why don't you join us.

88
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,090
We won't know a soul there.

89
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,220
Oh,no,no,that'S...

90
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,550
are you sure.

91
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,630
The invitation seemed open enough,didn't it,bruce.

92
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,850
Well,I suppose,if,uh...

93
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,740
roger can borrow one of bru's shirts,unless barbeque stns are the new fashion.

94
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,330
me on.

95
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,330
couldn't you ha put on some aftershave.

96
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,000
You smell like lightefluid.

97
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,430
hey,it's the new kids in town.

98
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,520
Susan and...

99
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,600
Bruce.

100
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,780
Bruce.

101
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,990
We were hoping you guys could make it.

102
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,480
I hope you don't mind,we broht some old friends.

103
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,950
Old neighbors,actually.

104
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,150
The more the merrier.

105
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,970
you know,you and tommy d really got it figured out,trine.

106
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,730
The guy has no idea how luckhe has it with you.

107
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,380
Susan,hi.

108
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,450
You two get settled in okay.

109
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,010
The best that we could.

110
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,440
Our old furniture barely fills half the new house.

111
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,740
Maybe you could give my wife some decorating tips.

112
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,250
Sure.Call a decorator.

113
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,100
who'd up for a harvey wallbanger.

114
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,590
Sounds like a winner.

115
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,490
Gimlet for me 

116
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,720
I'll just have a chablis.

117
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,900
Oh,trina,this is janet.Janet's my old...

118
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,870
say "old neighbor" one more time,I'm going to go home and hang myself.

119
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,350
I was going to say,my friend who used to live across the street.

120
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:26,180
And that lug of a man who lumbered off without introducing himself is my husband roger.

121
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,490
How about a tour.

122
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,750
You,um...

123
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,860
-sure.
I'll jt wait here for my husband.

124
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,080
Yeah,I'll just wait.

125
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,150
Let's go.

126
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,480
laurie: I'm getting eaten alive.

127
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,610
Do you have any bug spray.

128
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,420
If anyone's biting you tonight,it's going to be me.

129
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,780
You're a pig.

130
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,650
You like it.

131
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,910
cool.

132
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,350
Maybe,if you're a sixth-grader.

133
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,020
How far up your butt does that stick go.

134
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,860
Sorry.

135
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,310
Warm beer and bottle rockets don't really do it for me.

136
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,530
What is with you tonight.

137
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,040
Alof the sudden,you act like you're too cool to hang.

138
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,450
Too bored is more like it.

139
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,910
Boring is wasting the entire summer taking some ap english class you don'even need.

140
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,190
Philosophy 

141
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,410
same difference.

142
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,300
You know what.

143
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,170
You're an idiot.

144
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,170
You don't know anything about me.

145
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,560
Know enough to get in your pants every night.

146
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,330
Where you going.

147
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,650
Laur.

148
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,720
* you can call it another lonely day *

149
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,760
and this is the bedroom.

150
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,120
Oh,trina,thank god.

151
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,770
Do you have any coke.

152
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,880
Oh,no,honey,never when I host.

153
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,790
But I think bud green has plen.

154
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,280
But just watch out;he's more handsy than usual.

155
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,200
I'm sorry.Ve you two met.

156
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,130
Oh,gail saxton,this is susan miller.

157
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,800
Susan just moved into the house next door to you.

158
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,610
Do you have any coke.

159
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,070
Sorry.

160
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,700
Honey,I think stu's looking for you.

161
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,630
big surprise.

162
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,770
she's harmless.

163
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,740
Miserable,but harmless.

164
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,200
I keep saying they suld open up their marriage like everyone else,

165
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,280
but her husband's a little uptight.

166
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,820
You and tom have an open marriage.

167
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,560
We,don't you.

168
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,860
No,bruce would go ape if I cheat on him.

169
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,170

Think I'm going to the basement.

221
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,310
What's in the basement.

222
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,740
Playroom.

223
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,080
Give me a hand with the fireworks.

224
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,670

230
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,850
She was heading towards the basement.

231
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,170
Down the hall,second door on the left.

00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,590

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,260
How do you feel.

236
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,830
So far,so good.

237

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,920
You wouldn't believe what she suggested.

239
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:43,280

00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,500

253
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,730
we're gonna stay.

254
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,060
where is it.

255
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,760
My ring.

256
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,030
I know you have it.

257
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,920
That looks like a wedding ring.

258
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,950
It was.My dad'S.

259
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,080

00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,630
I don't know.Or care.

261
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,080
Then why do you keep it.

262
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,960
To remind me not to do anything stupid like get married.

263
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,490
Or talk to people like you.

264
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,140
Are you running away.

265
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,340
You should mind your own business.

266
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,420
anyone need a drink.

267
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,770
