1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Previously on Swingtown

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,400
I want us to be
completely open,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,800
all options on the table.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,500
You said yes to Tokyo,
didn't you? 

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,100
You mad?

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,100
Ask me from a Japanese pay phone
after we've been apart for three days.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,600
Sylvia's a partner
at Kessler and Loeb.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,900
Today's woman can do
anything she puts her mind to.

9
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,100
I am going to eat
a pot brownie.

10
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:18,900
Olly, olly,
oxen free!

11
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:22,506
This works, you know?

12
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:24,005
You and me.

13
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:44,807
Babe?
What time is it?

14
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,400
Well, it's bedtime
for me,

15
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:48,600
but you've got about an hour
to get to the airport.

16
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:51,803
Not going to be easy
getting used to this schedule.

17
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:53,600
Tell me about it.

18
00:00:53,907 --> 00:00:54,903
I was debating whether or not

19
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:56,403
I should let you
sleep right through it.

20
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:57,901
Come here.

21
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:08,301
Did you know that
I can count on one hand

22
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:11,501
the number of days we've spent
apart since we were married?

23
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,503
Don't think about it in days,
think about it in hours.

24
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,801
13-hour flight to Tokyo,
13-hour turnaround,

25
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:19,401
quick 13-hour
flight back home.

26
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,701
Why are there so many 13s
in that sentence?

27
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,903
You superstious?

28
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,902
Not about the flight.

29
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:30,301
You don't do well alone, Tom.

30
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:32,102
I'm not that guy anymore.

31
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,701
And I wouldn't do anything
to mess this up.

32
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:39,101
It's too... perfect.

33
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:42,501
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

34
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:57,200
As you can see, ladies,this
particular line of stacking bowls

35
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:59,402
is not just ideal
for storage and convenience,

36
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,800
but it's also
spill-proof.

37
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,402
How much for
the whole lot?

38
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:06,302
If selling these things
were only that easy.

39
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:08,501
I suppose the bright side of Susan
moving across town is that

40
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:10,402
it opens up a
whole new market.

41
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:14,103
If I could just relax and
remember my talking points.

42
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:16,401
Maybe I can
help you relax, hmm?

43
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:17,903
Take a later train?

44
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:20,201
Roger, what has
gotten into you?

45
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,103
Well, I-I just
did my hair.

46
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:26,401
Come on, where's the crazy
skinny-dipper from the cabin?

47
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,001
That was one weekend
of bad judgment,

48
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:31,000
and I will not have you holding
that over my head my entire life.

49
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,002
That was the most fun
I ever saw you have.

50
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:36,900
Oh.

51
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,902
Well, maybe, uh,we can pick back up
when I get home tonight.

52
00:02:44,508 --> 00:02:47,103
Last I checked,
today is not a Friday, Roger.

53
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:49,800
Now go to work.
Honestly.

54
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:57,200
"Anti-ERA leader Phyllis Schlafly
will testify"before the RNC today,

55
00:02:57,207 --> 00:03:00,100
urging members"to stand up against
the Supreme Court's decision

56
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:02,400
protecting a woman's
right to choose."

57
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:04,503
Can you believe this?

58
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:07,103
It's a complicated issue.

59
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,802
I don't see
what's complicated about it.

60
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,902
Carter better win this election,
or women are totally screwed.

61
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:13,203
Watch your
mouth, Laur.

62
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,700
Why, because you don't
like what I'm saying?

63
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,403
No, 'cause you sound
like a truck driver.

64
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,401
Paper, please.

65
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,903
What's for
breakfast?

66
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,303
Uh, this is actually for
Janet's luncheon, but there's

67
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:25,602
English muffins in the fridge.

68
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,403
Okay.

69
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:32,303
Wow. How many women
are expected at this thing?

70
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:33,700
Mm, a dozen.

71
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:35,703
Right.

72
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:37,903
I'm gonna take this dip over
to Trina's.

73
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,101
Maybe she can use it
for her party tomorrow night.

74
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:42,903
What party? I don't remember
you mentioning a party.

75
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,503
Maybe you weren't
listening.

76
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,601
It's a
fund-raiser.

77
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,900
Apparently, the government
arrested some actor, and

78
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:50,901
Trina and Sylvia are raising
money for his legal defense.

79
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:53,600
The invitation's right there.
I'll see you tonight?

80
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,203
Oh, wow. I don't
believe this.

81
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,202
What?

82
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:09,803
Come on in.

83
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:11,101
You and Tom busy?

84
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:13,001
Oh, Tom flew to Tokyo
last night. 

85
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:15,003
But Sylvia and I were just
prepping for the party.

86
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:16,901
Oh. Well, maybe
I can help.

87
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:19,901
I- I accidentally made too
much seven-layer dip. Oh.

88
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:21,800
Thought if you had room in your fridge,
you could serve it at the party.

89
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:23,602
- Oh,well,it's-it's being catered.
- Oh.

90
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:26,002
But the two of us have been
at this since the crack of dawn,

91
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:29,601
so,if you don't mind,I might
just break out those chips right now.

92
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,900
- Morning, Sylvia.
- Hi!

93
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,202
While I have you here,
I can use your opinion.

94
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,302
What do you think?

95
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:39,502
Exhibit A.

96
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:40,803
Oh, my God!

97
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:43,001
Who-Who is that?

98
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,200
Oh, it's Harry.

99
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,702
Well, maybe you'd recognize him
better without the stickers.

100
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:56,201
Harry Reems, our guest of honor.

101
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:57,502
I...

102
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,101
The star of Deep Throat.

103
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:01,703
Deep Throat?

104
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:03,201
Well, of course.

105
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:05,202
What did you think
this party was for?

106
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,202
Um...

107
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:19,401

110
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,403
You're throwing a fund-raiser
for an actor in a porno film?

111
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:37,003
Well, Harry's an American
citizen first and foremost.

112
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,303
Not to mention
a very sweet guy.

113
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,202
Yeah.

114
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:43,003
- Right back.
- Okay.

115
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:47,901
Hello?

116
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:49,902
Is this the lady
of the house?

117
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:52,503
That depends
on who's calling.

118
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,503
What you wearing?

119
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:58,303
Oh, honey, you know I'm always
up for a little overseas chat,

120
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:02,303
but you caught me in
full-blown party-planning mode.

121
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:04,600
What time is it there?

122
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:06,701
Who knows? The clocks are
all in Japanese.

123
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:07,603
You in for the night?

124
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,301
Hmm. Where am I gonna go?

125
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,203
Wouldn't be any fun
without you.

126
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:14,301
Right, then I'll call
you in a bit and...

127
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,103
tuck you in,
okay, babe?

128
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,300
- Mm
- hmm.

129
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:20,203
- Love you.
- I love you more.

130
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:36,601
That was quick.You didn't give
me time to brush my teeth.

131
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:38,403
Don't bother on my account.

132
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,601
Hey, Rex. No, I thought
you were the wife.

133
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:41,203
Any plans?

134
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,001
Nope.
I'm hanging in tonight.

135
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,303
Want to do some partying?

136
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:46,401
Yeah?
Who you with?

137
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:48,203
Someone new.
What do you say?

138
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,702
Yeah...
Why not?

139
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,600
Yeah, stop by
on your way out.

140
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,902
Susan, if you have time
to help stuff envelopes,

141
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:02,101
I can promise you a signed
eight-by-ten glossy of Harry.

142
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:02,903
Uh...

143
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,500
Susan's not coming.

144
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,306
When I RSVP'd,

145
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:10,305
I- I didn't realize what
this party was all about.

146
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:12,507
I- I have children.

147
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,100
What if one of them
grows up and decides

148
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:15,900
to be a film maker
 or a painter?

149
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:19,101
You want them living in a country
that-that prosecutes artists

150
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,803
for expressing themselves?

151
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,502
Oh, you don't seriously
consider Deep Throat art?

152
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,503
Who's to say?

153
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,803
I mean, frankly,
I thought it was hilarious.

154
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,002
I'm-I'm curious, Susan.

155
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:32,500
What did you find
so offensive?

156
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:35,601
I mean, beyond
the ridiculous premise.

157
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:37,803
Well, to be honest,
I- I haven't seen it.

158
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:38,903
So,

159
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:41,300
you're fine letting them throw
a man in jail

160
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:43,100
over a movie
you haven't even seen?

161
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:44,303
No, I...

162
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:49,202
I... It's-
It's pornography.

163
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:50,700
Susan, it's fascism.

164
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,500
The Nixon administration set out
to prosecute Harry Reems

165
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,600
for one reason--
to distract attention from Watergate.

166
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:57,801
It has no legal
precedent.

167
00:07:57,808 --> 00:07:58,602
I'm sorry. 

168
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:01,303
This is not exactly the kind of
thing my husband and I discuss

169
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:02,401
around the dinner
table, and I...

170
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,702
Please tell me you're not one of
those wives who needs her husband

171
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,403
to give her her opinion.

172
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:07,302
Sylvia!

173
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:10,103
Well, by looking the other way,
she's helping them get away with it.

174
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,003
What do you think it is
we're doing here?

175
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,003
Well, Susan's not the enemy.

176
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:17,403
It's all right, Trina.

177
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:22,903
I think I better go.

178
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:33,501
Ah. You're up, buddy.

179
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:36,200
Oh,not tonight.Still adjusting
to the time difference.

180
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:37,802
You got to
at least have a drink.

181
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,200
Sure.

182
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:41,800
Uh...
cocktail?

183
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,203
Uh, just grab her a beer.

184
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:44,503
She's, uh...

185
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:48,602
She's exotic, Rex, but...
how do you communicate?

186
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:51,300
Language of love.

187
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:52,803
It's universal.

188
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:55,501
Well, who could that be?

189
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:56,902
Oh, I hope
you don't mind, Tom.

190
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,801
I let some of the stews know
we'd be up here.

191
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:05,403
Hey!

192
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:08,703
All right, let's
get this party started, huh?

193
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,201
Let's have a round.

194
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:11,602
This is Tom.

195
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,503
No volleyball net.

196
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:15,802
Are you sure?

197
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,001
I remember rolling it up right before
we moved out of the last place.

198
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:22,902
Nope. Someone should have one
down at the beach.

199
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,600
Or we could just tie a rope
between two trees?

200
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:26,503
Samantha?

201
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:29,001
Did you steal my
smokes from the pantry?

202
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:32,900
Cigarettes don't get up
and walk off by themselves.

203
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,600
Samantha doesn't smoke.

204
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,602
No one's talking to you.

205
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:38,800
It was my fault, Mom.
I saw you were running low.

206
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:39,700
I should have said something.

207
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:41,401
I'll ride by the store,
pick you up a couple packs.

208
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:44,200
Okay. Here.

209
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,802
I'll be counting
the change.

210
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:50,801
Don't keep me
waiting all day.

211
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,001
You stole your
mom's cigarettes?

212
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,200
I always take two
out of each carton.

213
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,100
Why?

214
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:01,203
'Cause now we have enough to
buy a volleyball net.

215
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,002
Come on.

216
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:04,703
I'll race you
to the beach.

217
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,901
Good afternoon,
Miss Miller.

218
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,703
Afternoon,
Mr. Stephens.

219
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:16,000
So, last few days
of summer school.

220
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,201
Hmm.
Time really flies, huh?

221
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:18,903
Do you think?

222
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:21,602
Feels to me like this week
is dragging on forever.

223
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,500
Hey, Laur.

224
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't you look nice.

225
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:29,002
Hey, teach.
It's Logan.

226
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:31,103
We met a couple weeks
ago at that play.

227
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,303
Right.
How's it going?

228
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:35,503
Can't complain.

229
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:39,000
Uh, Laurie,
I will see you in class?

230
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:40,900
- Yup.
- Logan.

231
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:44,802
What are you up to, Logan?

232
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:46,702
I saw him leave your house
last weekend.

233
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:48,703
No sense in
denying it.

234
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:51,101
You're spying on me?

235
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:52,502
More like

236
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:54,702
looking out for you.

237
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:57,002
What do you want?

238
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:00,003
You.

239
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:05,701
Look, you better go learn
something while you still can,

240
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:08,503
because a teacher like that might
not be working here much longer.

241
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:20,400
The latest line of easy-store containers
passed over a dozen factory tests.

242
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:23,201
This is our small bowl
in avocado.

243
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:26,500
Susan, if you'd kindly pour
the tomato soup...

244
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:35,600
Now, to retain freshness,
you simply lift a corner,

245
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:38,701
and you burp the bowl
of all extra air, snap...

246
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,301
and seal... whoops.

247
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:43,901
Clumsy me.

248
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:47,001
Now, would you look at that.

249
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,901
Not a drop on the sofa.

250
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:53,203
Excuse me.

251
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:56,100
Now, if you ladies will
follow me into the kitchen...

252
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:01,102
Hi, I just wanted.

253
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:03,100
Oh, I'm sorry, do
you have company?

254
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:05,902
No, it's just, um,
more like a Tupperware...

255
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:09,202
party, something Janet and I
have been doing forever.

256
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:11,901
I- I would have invited you,
but I-I didn't think you'd

257
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:15,301
be interested
in burping plastic bowls.

258
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:16,203
Good call.

259
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:20,103
I was worried that you may have
felt a little ambushed this morning.

260
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:24,102
Actually, I-I felt,
um, stupid.

261
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:26,200
Oh, that's an
ugly word...

262
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:28,500
and the last one I'd use
to describe you.

263
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm not sure Sylvia would agree.

264
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:32,602
Sylvia's used to arguing in court--
she can come on a little strong.

265
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,203
- Trina.
- Hi.

266
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,203
I didn't think you'd
be joining us.

267
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:37,001
Oh,I'm afraid I can't stay,Janet,
but sign me up for a dozen of... 

268
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:40,001
Oh,I'm afraid I can't stay,Janet,
but sign me up for a dozen of...

269
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:41,400
whatever.

270
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,103
Susan,
it's showtime.

271
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:45,601
- I'll be right in.
- Okay.

272
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:48,200
Well, I'll let you get
back to your party.

273
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:50,800
Here's a little
research on the issue.

274
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:53,301
And the last thing you should
ever feelis stupid, Susan.

275
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:56,303
If you happen to change
your mind about the party,

276
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:58,203
the invitation's open, okay?

277
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:04,101
Thank you all very much for your hard
work in class these last few weeks.

278
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,502
At least, I'm assuming
you worked hard.

279
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:13,901
I'll find out tonight
while I'm here grading these.

280
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:18,501
If you are sitting there wishing
you'd put in a little more effort,

281
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,203
I could always use some hot coffee,
maybe a donut at around midnight.

282
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:24,201
Anyone?

283
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:27,101
I'm just saying there's- there's
extra credit in there somewhere.

284
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:44,803
Susan?

285
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:46,802
Upstairs.

286
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,000
Is it after 6:00 already?

287
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:55,002
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you'd pick me up from the station.

288
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:56,402
I'm meeting Roger in the gang

289
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:59,200
for a last practice before
tomorrow's bowling championship.

290
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:01,900
- Sorry, I-I lost track of time.
- Uh...

291
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:08,100
"Reaming Harry Reems
in Court"?

292
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:09,701
Is this about
that fund-raiser?

293
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,200
It's terrible what's
happening to this man.

294
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:14,502
Susan, the guy's
a porno actor.

295
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:16,802
You-you know about him?

296
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:19,600
Yeah, yeah,
I saw the movie.

297
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,902
You did?

298
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,203
A few months ago,with some guys
from the exchange.

299
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:27,401
Why didn't you tell me?

300
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,000
It was just for laughs.

301
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,100
I didn't want you
getting the wrong idea.

302
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,400
Trust me.

303
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,601
The movie is not for you.

304
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,901
I want to go
to the party.

305
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:45,801
- Well, we can't.
- Why not?

306
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:50,200
I have the league championship tomorrow,
and you don't want to go to a party

307
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:51,700
like that without me.

308
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,302
Oh, come on.

309
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:56,400
You know what goes on
across the street.

310
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,500
Look, is dinner almost ready?

311
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,803
'Cause Roger's
picking me up in, like, 20.

312
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:04,101
Coming right up.

313
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:33,600
- Can we talk?
- Sure, about what?

314
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:36,401
I saw Deep Throat
last night.

315
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,301
You went to a porno theater?

316
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:42,400
Yes.

317
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:44,203
- Did anyone see you there?
- I don't know.

318
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,803
I... nobody was paying
any attention to me anyway.

319
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:47,501
Well, no,of course not.

320
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:50,103
What could possibly be more interesting
than what they were watching?

321
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:52,903
What were they watching?

322
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:56,902
This ridiculous story
about...about a woman whose...

323
00:15:57,606 --> 00:16:01,402
pleasure center is in her throat,
and this wacky doctor who helps her

324
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:04,000
to, uh, find it.

325
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:05,603
That's horrifying.

326
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:06,603
Oh, completely...

327
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:11,500
and... and also oddly...
amusing.

328
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,801
I... it's...really,
it's just a silly movie.

329
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,000
With naked people.

330
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,503
- Yes.
- Having sex.

331
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:18,500
Oh, yes.

332
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:20,001
Why are you telling me this?

333
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:22,303
Because...

334
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:26,801
the government's prosecuting
the leading actor.

335
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:27,701
Well, good.

336
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:29,903
No, it's not, they...

337
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:32,200
I mean, they're denying him
his First Amendment rights,

338
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:37,000
and Trina's throwing a fundraiser
for his legal defense tonight.

339
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:38,300
Why am I not surprised?

340
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,500
I want you to come with me.

341
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:46,002
To a party
for a porno actor?

342
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,000
At Trina's?

343
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,302
I...

344
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:51,900
I think it's important,

345
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:55,401
and-and Bruce and Roger are bowling
tonight,so I know you're free.

346
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:58,101
Please?

347
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:01,801
Remember that girl who ate pot brownies
and played Twister at the cabin?

348
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,401
Why does everyone keep
throwing that back at me?

349
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:05,701
You know I would do anything
for you, Susan...

350
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,001
But not this.

351
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,002
I'm sorry.

352
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:15,201
There should be martini shakers
under the bar sink,

353
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:18,603
and if you need extra glasses,
they're right over here.

354
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:20,503
Konichiwa.

355
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:23,001
Oh, baby.
You're home.

356
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:25,101
I told you I'd be back
in time for the party.

357
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:29,300
I tried calling a couple times
last night, or morning.

358
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,703
- My time or your time?
- Both.

359
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:32,900
- You didn't pick up.
- Yeah, well,

360
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:34,102
a few friends came by the room.

361
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:36,501
It turned into
quite a little party.

362
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,103
Really? Who?

363
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,201
Rex and the crew,
nobody special.

364
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:46,300
Well, I can use your help
putting up some of these banners.

365
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,600
Mmm, you got it.

366
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:49,901
Just give me a few minutes
to rest my eyes.

367
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:59,301
Does it bother you to constantly
be compared with Olga Korbut?

368
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:02,902
I am not Olga Korbut;
I am Nadia Comaneci.

369
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,102
A very
confident Nadia...

370
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:05,802
Hey.

371
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,001
- What's going on?
- Bored.

372
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:11,203
The Deckers are having one
of their parties.

373
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,403
My mom's going.

374
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:13,701
Is that good or bad?

375
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:15,200
Good, for now.

376
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:17,500
I don't have to worry
about her till she gets home.

377
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,201
That's
that Romanian girl.

378
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:23,600
She was on the news
last night, too.

379
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:25,503
Look at that dismount!

380
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:27,401
She scored
another ten.

381
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,100
Hard to believe she's
just a kid, like us.

382
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,102
Yeah, except she's perfect.

383
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:33,603
I wonder what
her mother's like.

384
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,801
Probably a lot like yours.

385
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:38,503
You want a Yoo-hoo?

386
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,102
And the judges are
tallying her score.

387
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,501
- A perfect score!
- Perfect.

388
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:50,203
Hey, when did you get home?

389
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,503
Few minutes ago.

390
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:53,202
It's bowling night,
remember?

391
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:55,201
You going somewhere?

392
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:57,003
Um, Trina's party.

393
00:18:57,405 --> 00:19:00,400
I thought we decided we
were sitting this one out.

394
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,400
Actually, you decided that.

395
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,102
Susan, this party is
about pornography.

396
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,202
I know what it's about.

397
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:09,800
I saw the movie.

398
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:11,201
Come again?

399
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,303
Last night,
when you were at practice,

400
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,701
I had to see for myself what
the fuss was all about.

401
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,403
Are you guys talking
about Deep Throat?

402
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:21,200
Okay, Laurie,you're interrupting
a private conversation.

403
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:22,103
Door was open.

404
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:25,002
I've had it about up to here
with your sass,young lady.

405
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:28,700
I don't want you going to
the Deckers'tonight,not without me.

406
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:30,202
That's Mom's decision, Dad.

407
00:19:30,206 --> 00:19:31,500
Laurie, don't talk
back to your father.

408
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,202
I was defending you.

409
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:35,601
Wow.

410
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:38,301
You know, maybe
Dad's right.

411
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:42,201
If this party is about fighting censorship,
maybe you don't belong there after all.

412
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,302
I'll be home
 after bowling.

413
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:54,302
We'll finish the
conversation then, okay?

414
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:03,102
Tell us the truth.

415
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:04,601
That was a
camera trick.

416
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:05,603
On our budget?

417
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,001
What you see
is what you got.

418
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, well, that's
a little hard to swallow.

419
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:11,600
Ignore my husband,
Harry.

420
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:15,202
The whole movie is ridiculous
male fantasy,never mind the...

421
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,501
anatomical stretch.

422
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,802
Hey, I'm not a real doctor.

423
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:19,002
I just played one in the movie.

424
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:23,100
Well,Linda Lovelace didn't exactly
invent that move, you know?

425
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:25,003
But I could give her
a run for her money.

426
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:29,003
Enchante,Mr. Reems.
My name is Gail.

427
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:30,300
I'm a big fan.

428
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:31,101
Ah.

429
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,203
Excuse me.

430
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:35,501
She's not kidding,
you know?

431
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:37,800
I'm not.

432
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,302
Susan...

433
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,303
You made it after all.

434
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:45,200
Yep.

435
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:46,603
Come on in.

436
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:50,301
Things are just
getting started.

437
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,501
Susan, you look fantastic.

438
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:03,000
Where's Bruce?

439
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:04,700
Bowling.

440
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,201
Tom, will you get
Susan a drink, please?

441
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:08,603
Sure. Bowling?

442
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:11,502
I don't believe it.
Janet?!

443
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,501
Well, well, well.
Look who's stepping up for Harry.

444
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,800
What are you
doing here?

445
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:19,103
I didn't come
to support pornography,

446
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,902
I just want to make that
perfectly clear.

447
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm only here to support Susan.

448
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:25,202
Good for you.

449
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,403
Ladies, can I
get you a drink?

450
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:28,402
Gimlet, Susan?

451
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:29,402
Yes, please.

452
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:31,301
Uh, I'll have one,
too, please.

453
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:33,700
Let's mingle.

454
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:46,002
That bad, huh?

455
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:50,703
Don't worry, it's not yours.

456
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:52,101
I actually save
your essay till last.

457
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:53,900
It gives me something
to look forward to.

458
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:57,202
Coffee and a bear claw.

459
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:02,900
Seems you are the only one who took
my offer of extra credit seriously.

460
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,701
I'm not here for extra credit.

461
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:06,600
What are you here for?

462
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:10,300
It's been a weird couple days.

463
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:14,402
Yeah, yeah.

464
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:17,503
You, uh, you seemed a little
out of sorts in class.

465
00:22:17,907 --> 00:22:19,803
Anything you want to talk about?

466
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:21,902
No.

467
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:24,001
Just wanted to see you.

468
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:32,301
"By renouncing fear in his definition"
of an examined life,

469
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:36,301
Camus hands each of us the tools
of our own salvation."

470
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,500
- Cindy Linder wrote this?
- Mm-hmm.

471
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:41,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Eh, eh.

472
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,002
Sorry, you can't read that.

473
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:46,301
Right. Sorry.

474
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:52,202
You're a really good teacher,
you know that?

475
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,202
Only for one more week,
then class dismissed.

476
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,702
Then what?

477
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,103
I don't know.

478
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:03,301
But I sure am
looking forward to it.

479
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:06,401
Me, too.

480
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:11,802
Where you going?

481
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:16,503
To renounce my fear,
like Cindy said.

482
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,601
Here you go, ma'am.

483
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,803
Thanks for your support.

484
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:35,201
I'm afraid that's
my last picture.

485
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,201
Well, don't worry, ladies,

486
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,203
I'll dig up some posters
from the movie.

487
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:41,603
Worst case,
you can sign Polaroids.

488
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:43,101
I've signed stranger things.

489
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:44,803
Bored yet?

490
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:49,602
I could think of a couple things
to liven up the party.

491
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,200
Ever have a
Singapore Swing?

492
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:56,501
Uh,I'm-I'm gonna grab some food
while I got the chance.

493
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:01,601
It's a complete witch hunt,

494
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,202
conceived and executed
by Washington ideologues.

495
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:07,101
And we're all paying for
it with our tax dollars.

496
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:09,201
That's right.

497
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:11,301
Susan, I am so glad
you're here.

498
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:12,503
What changed your mind?

499
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:16,203
I might not agree
with what the movie stands for,

500
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,402
but you were right.

501
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:19,301
Harry Reems is
being railroaded.

502
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,501
It's censorship,
pure and simple.

503
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:22,701
I owe you an apology.

504
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:25,002
You and I live completely
different lives, Sylvia.

505
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,703
I don't expect you to understand
where I'm coming from.

506
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:30,301
And I never will
if I don't remember to listen.

507
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:33,202
Apology accepted.

508
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,003
Thank you.

509
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:39,902
I need a break.

510
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:42,103
Well, these watercress
sandwiches are delicious.

511
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,800
Mm, too spicy
for me.

512
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:45,802
If you're afraid
of a little spice,

513
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:47,703
I don't know
why you're at this party.

514
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:49,301
Little help from my friends.

515
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:51,601
They're trying
to keep me out of jail.

516
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:55,100
Oh, my goodness.

517
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:57,902
Uh, you're him?

518
00:24:58,306 --> 00:24:59,403
Harry Reems.

519
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,100
That cannot be your real name.

520
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:03,400
No.

521
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:04,901
It's how people know me.

522
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:07,902
Seems to me, people know you for
an entirely different reason.

523
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,800
My winning smile.

524
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:12,500
Ha-ha.

525
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:19,901
I haven't seen your film, Mr.Reems,
so pardon my ignorance,

526
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:21,200
but what the heck
were you thinking?

527
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:23,203
It was a job.

528
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,103
They weren't hiring
at Woolworth's?

529
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:28,003
I'm an actor.

530
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:29,802
I just wanted to pay my bills.

531
00:25:29,806 --> 00:25:32,501
Well, I hope they paid you well,
for all the trouble it caused.

532
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:36,103
$250.
That's it.

533
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,302
My legal expenses are
in the tens of thousands.

534
00:25:39,307 --> 00:25:41,403
Plus, no one will hire me
as an actor now.

535
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:46,401
Certainly there must be
something else you can do.

536
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:48,801
I, for example, am in sales.

537
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:51,002
No kidding.
What do you sell?

538
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:53,900
Uh, kitchen necessities.

539
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:56,303
Though I'm not sure
they'd let a man do the job.

540
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:58,400
I cater almost
entirely to women.

541
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:01,101
I'm pretty good with women.

542
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:08,901
Well, you really knocked
'em down tonight, Bruce.

543
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:10,701
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

544
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,101
You know we-we won
the trophy, you know?

545
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:16,301
Yeah, I'm sorry, Rogie.

546
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:18,501
It's just, you know,
trouble at home.

547
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:20,402
What kind
of trouble?

548
00:26:21,108 --> 00:26:22,500
Something's going on
with Susan.

549
00:26:22,508 --> 00:26:24,502
I'm not quite sure
how to explain it.

550
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:27,401
Does it have to do
with the, um...

551
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:30,603
you know, the thing
with the Deckers?

552
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,400
Uh, yeah,
in a way.

553
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:35,700
Nothing's been the same
since we met Tom and Trina.

554
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,000
You want to hear
something weird?

555
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,003
It gets weirder?

556
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:41,303
Okay.

557
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:45,200
The morning after that first
night with Tom and Trina,

558
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:48,402
that is the closest I have
felt to Susan since...

559
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,000
our honeymoon.

560
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,503
Yep, that's pretty weird.

561
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,803
But now,it's like she's this
completely different woman.

562
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:57,800
What do you mean?

563
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:00,003
Well, she's got
all these new opinions.

564
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:02,202
I mean,she's not
picking me up at the train,

565
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:04,400
dinner is not ready
when I get home.

566
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:08,302
She went and saw a
porno movie,for Pete's sake.

567
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:10,803
I mean, sure, the sex,
yes, is great,

568
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:12,600
but these
other things, man...

569
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:15,503
I'm sorry,you are,you're talking
to the wrong guy on this one.

570
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:18,002
The only time I'm allowed
to have sex with my own wife

571
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,802
in my own house is
every other Friday night.

572
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,602
- Wow.Um...
- Yeah.

573
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:30,301
Yeah,figured Janet might have loosened up
a bit after that night at the cabin.

574
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:31,601
All Janet brought back
from the cabin

575
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:34,200
is her determination
to stay Susan's best friend.

576
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:36,000
That's why she went to
Trina's party tonight.

577
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:38,103
Janet went to
the Deep Throat party?

578
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:39,703
Only because she thought
Susan need her.

579
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:41,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, Susan is there, too?

580
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:43,001
I'm sorry,
to the what party?

581
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,502
Check, please.

582
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:55,500
Hey, Laur.

583
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,700
Thanks for
meeting me, Logan.

584
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:00,102
So where's your teacher?

585
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:02,400
Grading papers.

586
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:05,102
You know I can bring him down
anytime I want.

587
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:07,702
Then what's stopping you?

588
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,101
- I don't get you.
- I know.

589
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:15,503
But he does.

590
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:18,902
Look, I understand
you're not happy.

591
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:22,501
And, yeah, you have
all the power.

592
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:25,802
But you also have a choice.

593
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:32,002
Do you remember
the day we met?

594
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:34,402
You stepped on that rusty nail
at the beach.

595
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:37,801
And you carried me
all the way to your truck,

596
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:41,202
told me stupid jokes
in the emergency room.

597
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:44,702
I didn't expect that from you.

598
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:47,303
That's the reason
I went out with you.

599
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:51,203
So what do you
want me to do?

600
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,603
Just let me go.

601
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:56,601
Laurie?

602
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:58,003
Are you still
out there?

603
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:03,802
You're really sure
this is what you want?

604
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:18,403
Hey.

605
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,203
I thought you left already.

606
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:21,602
I was just about to.

607
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:26,802
Well,I'm,uh,I'm all finished up,
so if you need a ride home...

608
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:28,102
No, thanks.

609
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,500
I'm gonna walk.

610
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,100
One more week, right?

611
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,002
Yeah, one more week.

612
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:52,301
Thanks for coming, everyone.

613
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:56,700
Um,I want to thank our wonderful
hosts,Trina and Tom Decker,

614
00:29:56,906 --> 00:29:59,101
for welcoming us
into their home.

615
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:03,803
And we are honored to have
Harry Reems among us tonight.

616
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:09,800
They have the nerve to charge Mr.Reems
with conspiracy to distribute obscenities 

617
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,502
They have the nerve to charge Mr.Reems
with conspiracy to distribute obscenities

618
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:15,203
across state lines,
of all ridiculous things.

619
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:19,001
As you all know,Mr.Reems
is being targeted by the...

620
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:20,300
There's Janet.

621
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:22,702
No Susan?

622
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:27,301
And it's up to us
to do something about it.

623
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:30,503
And now, to cap off the evening,
we have a very special treat

624
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:31,501
for all of you.

625
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:34,702
Get your things;
we're going home.

626
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:35,502
Bruce...

627
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:38,403
So,please,grab
whomever's next to you,

628
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:42,102
and join us for a private
screening of Deep Throat.

629
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,502
Roger, what are
you doing here?

630
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:49,600
What am I doing here?

631
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:51,801
Are you okay?

632
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:53,402
Of course I'm okay.

633
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:57,502
Well,hey,good.Well,they're about to
show the movie, so we better go.

634
00:30:58,406 --> 00:31:00,200
It's just a movie, Roger.

635
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:01,700
How bad could it be?

636
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:04,802
Are you saying
you want to stay?

637
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:09,703
What is going on
with you, Susan?

638
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:13,502
I came to hear people discuss
an important issue.

639
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,202
More important to you
than me?

640
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,602
Look,look, you know I didn't
want you to come tonight.

641
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:20,600
Bruce, you're making
a scene.

642
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,803
- You two all right?
- We're fine.

643
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:26,200
This is my husband,
uh, Bruce.

644
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,101
This is Harry Reems.

645
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:28,403
Yeah, I know
who you are.

646
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:29,700
Look, this is between me
and my wife...

647
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:30,301
Hey,come on,
man,be cool.

648
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,601
If she wants to stay,
she should stay.

649
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, shut up, Harry!

650
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:34,101
Bruce!

651
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:41,400
Get your things,
we're going home.

652
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:44,400
No, I'm not.

653
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:52,702
Fine.

654
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:55,603
Where are you going?

655
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:56,803
Bruce...

656
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,100
Oh!

657
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,501
Yeah!

658
00:32:33,505 --> 00:32:34,303
Right back.

659
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,600
You okay, Susan?

660
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,600
I don't know.

661
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:54,401
Everything seems to be
getting so complicated.

662
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:56,803
How do you mean?

663
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:03,100
Bruce and I
aren't in sync

664
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:04,902
the way you
and Tom are.

665
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:08,802
You-you, you always seem to know
where the other's coming from and...

666
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:11,600
we don't have that.

667
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:17,702
Well,change isn't easy on a couple,

668
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:20,800
no matter how close you are.

669
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:25,603
What if I'm the only one
who's changing?

670
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,103
What if Bruce is...

671
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:33,900
...incapable, somehow?

672
00:33:39,005 --> 00:33:41,000
Then it's up to you
to help him.

673
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:51,402
Well, that was...
perverse.

674
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:54,500
Just kinda dumb,
I thought.

675
00:33:54,508 --> 00:33:56,502
Well, it certainly
was that.

676
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:00,802
Well, I'm sorry
if it upset you.

677
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:05,100
Well, it didn't exactly,
upset me.

678
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,201
Just...

679
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:12,902
Did, um, did any part
of you like it?

680
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:18,002
Why, did-did you?

681
00:34:18,008 --> 00:34:19,103
There you are, Janet.

682
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,403
I saved one for you.

683
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:26,202
You two want to
join us in the basement?

684
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:29,201
We got a little after party
kicking up.

685
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:32,001
Thanks, Harry.

686
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:34,302
Uh, but I think it's time
for us to, uh...

687
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,900
move on along.

688
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:37,302
- Right?
- Yes, definitely.

689
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:38,303
Time to go.

690
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:43,003
Mr. Reems.

691
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,900
Good luck to you.

692
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,202
Thanks.

693
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:49,003
I appreciate that.

694
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:58,200
If you could be any animal
in the world, what would you be?

695
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:02,403
A bird.

696
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:05,903
What would you be?

697
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,500
I don't know.

698
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:12,000
Tiger, maybe.

699
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:17,602
If you could be any person
in the world, who would you be?

700
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:20,703
Can I choose to be me?

701
00:35:22,907 --> 00:35:24,403
Then me.

702
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:26,602
What about you?

703
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,901
Well, definitely not me.

704
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:32,100
Or you.

705
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:33,802
Then who?

706
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:38,301
Nadia?

707
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,100
Damn it!

708
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:48,300
I gotta go.

709
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,400
Here.

710
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,703
Take this.

711
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,500
Mom,you okay?

712
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:13,000
You been in my
liquor cabinet?

713
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:14,203
No, Mom.

714
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:21,101
Maybe you shouldn't have
anymore tonight.

715
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm the parent,
you are the kid.

716
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:26,703
Got it?

717
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:29,600
Yeah.

718
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:32,100
Good night.

719
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:37,401
You think I'm a
terrible person,don't you?

720
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:39,300
No.

721
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,201
You're just unhappy.

722
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,300
I love you,
Samantha.

723
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:04,800
I love you, too.

724
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:30,900
I didn'go to that party
tonight to upset you.

725
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:33,700
Why did you go?

726
00:37:35,405 --> 00:37:37,603
I think...

727
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:40,800
sometimes I feel like
I don't know what's going on

728
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:42,103
in the world.

729
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:44,601
It-it's not about you.

730
00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:45,803
It... it's not about us.

731
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:48,100
It's-it's about me.

732
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:51,503
Everything keeps shifting.

733
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:57,402
You, you gotta stop moving
the goal post on me

734
00:37:57,506 --> 00:37:59,802
I know it's
confusing for you, Bruce.

735
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:01,901
It's confusing for me.

736
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:09,402
I just want to know...

737
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,702
...where all this is taking us.

738
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:17,903
I don't know.

739
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:26,001
But I love you.

740
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:01,902
- Some party.
- Mmm.Mm-hmm.

741
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:04,000
How's Susan?

742
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:07,702
Oh, she and Bruce are having
some growing pains.

743
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:12,702
Do you realize
when we first met,

744
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:15,700
I was a stewardess
on an international route,

745
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:19,003
and you were a co-pilot
on his first big assignment?

746
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:19,902
Mm-hmm.

747
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:24,102
You were also in a committed
relationship at the time.

748
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:27,003
Technically,I was
the other woman.

749
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:30,402
Those were extraordinary
circumstances.

750
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:33,400
They seem to be repeating
themselves.

751
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:37,202
You want me to quit this route?
I'll do it tomorrow.

752
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:42,101
No...

753
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,403
I just want you
to understand...

754
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:51,303
...the reason I didn't want you to
take it in the first place.

755
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:55,000
What are you afraid
of, babe?

756
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:57,302
Losing you.

757
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:59,002
Never gonna happen.

758
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:01,702
That's a promise.

759
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:15,400
Mmm.

760
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:20,302
Want to join our guests
down in the basement?

761
00:40:20,307 --> 00:40:22,000
Maybe, later.
Right now

762
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:27,200
I feel like spending
some alone time with my wife.

763
00:40:38,107 --> 00:40:39,303
Samantha.

764
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:41,900
Look out your window.

765
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:55,403
You went to the party anyway,
didn't you?

766
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:01,103
Yeah.

767
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:05,903
Way to go, Mom.
