3
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:13,179
Well, he's lying.

4
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:20,561
The son of a bitch has been
playing us the whole time.

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,685
You really think we're that dumb?

6
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:25,741
No, I didn't say anything!
I didn't...

7
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:06,184
Expenses and overtime are two areas
we should really take a look at.

8
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,540
And, we should consider changing
our company investments portfolio.

9
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:14,115
- You started dating again, haven't you?
- Stop it, Cal, right now!

10
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,298
Stock broker?

11
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:16,635
Money manager?

12
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:17,539
Banker?

13
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:20,956
- I thought you wanted to have some fun.
- I'm having fun, don't you worry.

14
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,940
Really?

15
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,292
There's a visitor in your office,

16
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,946
Sally Robinson from London.

17
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:31,799
What?

18
00:01:32,714 --> 00:01:33,802
Sally who?

19
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,137
Robinson.
High school sweetheart or something?

20
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:37,858
In my office?

21
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:45,571
Gotcha!

22
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,768
God almighty.

23
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:50,673
But my mates still call me Terry.

24
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,301
Come here.

25
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,131
Sally Robinson?

26
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,908
Hold on, is that a canoe
in your pocket, Cal?

27
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:00,054
Nicely played there, Mia.

28
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:02,099
Thank you anyway.

29
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,763
Excuse his manners.

30
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:07,564
- His ex-partner in crime.
- In a manner of speaking.

31
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:10,212
Gillian Foster. Current partner
in crime. Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:13,019
- You, too.
- All right, that's enough of that.

33
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,216
Good bye, Dr. Foster.

34
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,094
Cal, that is so charming.

35
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,831
It's been 22 years, isn't it?

36
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,766
- Jill, you fancy meeting us later?
- That's Gillian,

37
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:23,178
actually.

38
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:24,518
And she's busy.

39
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,593
- I'll take it.
- Call me if you need me.

40
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:33,950
So what are we drinking to?

41
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:37,156
How about Sally Robinson,
wherever she may be.

42
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,758
You wanker.

43
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:45,873
You all right there?

44
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,862
Don't start that bullocks
with me, Cal.

45
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:48,710
What?

46
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,305
With the eyes,
like you're reading my fortune.

47
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,776
No, I'm just pleased
to see you. Really.

48
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:58,546
Though a touch curious
as to why now.

49
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,984
Well, truth be told, I've thought twice
about looking you up

50
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,015
loads of times.

51
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,060
Terry marsh thinking twice.
Well, that's a first, isn't it?

52
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:07,326
Come on.

53
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,313
Where?

54
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:11,398
Listen, we'll do a deal.

55
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,767
What's past is past.

56
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,611
What's done is done.

57
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,143
It's just all water
under the bridge.

58
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:19,865
Fair?

59
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:25,996
Water under the bridge, then.

60
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:38,531
Hello, lovely lady.

61
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,428
I'm Terry.

62
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,288
- You should say hello to my dad.
- Hi, dad.

63
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:46,783
I'm Cara.
This is Alice.

64
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,291
- Stage names?
- Down, dad, down.

65
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,396
Forgive him.

66
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:59,340
Feast your eyes.

67
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,574
Not that way.

68
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,370
Over there, son.

69
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,803
I don't play cards anymore.

70
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,860
Look at me very carefully, Cal.

71
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,416
I did not get this jailbird
for nothing.

72
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,463
Don't make me say it.

73
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:19,508
I owe you my life.
There you go. I said it.

74
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,095
Do this for me tonight,
and then we're all square.

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,681
How much do you owe?

76
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:27,701
12 large.

77
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,923
- 12 grand?
- Like before.

78
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:31,604
I'll do all the talking and you...

79
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,826
Yeah, science.

80
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:35,001
It's texas hold'em,

81
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:36,033
no limit.

82
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:38,933
And this is my last 2 grand
in the world.

83
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,268
Cheers.

84
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:50,278
I've had a bit too much to drink
for this.

85
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:52,527
Yeah, well, that's rubbish.
But nice try.

86
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,632
- You're feeling luckier tonight?
- Hey, gents.

87
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,801
An old mate of mine,
Harry Sloane from N.Y.C.

88
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,628
How you doin'?

89
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,983
Hey, Foster.
Have you seen Lightman?

90
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,518
He's taking a personal day.

91
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,057
He's with a man who's
on the Scotland Yard watch list,

92
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,831
which means, when he's over here,
he's on the FBI watch list.

93
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,674
It's part of the
special relationship with the brits.

94
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:19,058
What's Terry done wrong?

95
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:22,829
Nothing recently. Watch lists are more
precautionary than anything else.

96
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:25,737
Yet, your tone is telling me
it's more than just a head's up.

97
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,869
It should also be telling you, I'm not
at liberty to discuss this any further.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,648
G.B.H: Grievous Bodily Harm,

99
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:34,651
22 years ago?

100
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,076
They want you to dig into
Lightman's past with Terry?

101
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,092
Let's just say it's his immediate future
I'm more worried about.

102
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:49,351
Thousand.

103
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:50,874
I fold.

104
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,182
Call.

105
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:02,735
Down.

106
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,714
You OK, Terry?

107
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,449
I'm good for it, Lance.

108
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:14,832
- You know I am.
- I know you are.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,584
We're all gentleman here,
someone get this man a drink.

110
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:19,870
Thanks.

111
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:24,353
Call.

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,111
All-in.

113
00:06:56,723 --> 00:06:58,597
- I said...
- I heard you the first time.

114
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,361
Call.

115
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:15,548
Ten high.

116
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,364
You called me on a jack high.

117
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,234
- That's ridiculous.
- Apparently not.

118
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,416
Gentlemen,

119
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,639
it's been a pleasure.

120
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:31,366
Can we have a little break, please?

121
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:33,721
Just a minute.

122
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:35,973
Why not?

123
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:37,456
Order up eggs.

124
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:39,521
Cheers.

125
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:55,432
Do you mind?

126
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:09,696
Harry Sloane from New York City?
Are you out of your bloody mind?

127
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:14,630
I could hardly say
you're Dr. Lightman, the lie expert

128
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:16,495
and the reader of faces.

129
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:20,082
The 12 grand was just a teaser
to get me in the game, is that it?

130
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,252
How much do you owe this psychopath?

131
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,947
- How much?
- 95.

132
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,114
- 95 grand?
- Yeah.

133
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,853
You expect me to take
that money off these men

134
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:34,262
instead of just walking out of here
while I still can?

135
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,285
Excuse me.

136
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,434
You know what's going
to happen to me if you walk away.

137
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,194
So is this a prank
or a serious death threat?

138
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:52,906
<i>Very soon now, you'll all be sorry.</i>

139
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,919
<i>It's all going to end this week.</i>

140
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,595
<i>The pain will stop.</i>

141
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,497
Uniforms.

142
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,999
Private school?

143
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:03,750
College preparatory.

144
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:07,508
You're the only one this video
was sent to?

145
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,767
As far as I know.

146
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:10,125
It was...

147
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:13,615
left on my desk during the lunch hour
in an envelope marked

148
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:14,848
"Headmaster, urgent"

149
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:17,490
- Has anyone else seen the tape?
- Just the FBI,

150
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,017
- and now you.
- Have you closed the school?

151
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,662
School's out for today.

152
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:24,144
My first advice to you...
Close the school.

153
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:25,333
For how long?

154
00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:28,958
Until we determine who made this.

155
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,647
So indefinitely.

156
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:36,408
Do you realize what that would do to us?
That would ruin our school.

157
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,949
So this is about money?

158
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:41,341
From handwriting analysis
on the envelopes,

159
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:44,941
student files, locker searches
and security camera tapes,

160
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:48,069
agents on site were able to make
a preliminary list of students

161
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,716
who might fit the profile.

162
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,881
25 names?

163
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,426
- Fit the profile for what?
- Homicidal intent.

164
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,431
Hands up,
who's heard of the Lightman group?

165
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:03,429
All right, well, we are scientists
who interpret human emotions.

166
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:05,084
This morning, with your help,

167
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:08,054
I'm going to run an experiment
which should be quite informative so...

168
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:11,485
Rather than listen to me drone on,
let's just get started, shall we?

169
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:23,330
<i>Very soon now, you'll all be sorry.</i>

170
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:26,116
<i>It's all going to end this week.</i>

171
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,447
<i>The pain will stop.</i>

172
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:45,018
No one's that good.

173
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,749
You two are working together.
Who is he, Terry?

174
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:51,024
You cheating me?
'cause I will put

175
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,858
a bullet in your head.

176
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,187
There's 105 grand there.

177
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,614
You and Terry are even now.

178
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,572
You keep the change.

179
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,332
We're all gentlemen here.

180
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:04,806
At least for now, with all those
witnesses in the next room.

181
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:10,085
I said he keeps the change.

182
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:26,275
Mate, say something.

183
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,368
You're welcome.
Don't mention it.

184
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:31,493
I love you, Cal.

185
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:32,934
Don't forget that.

186
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:35,024
Yeah, I'll see you
in another 22 years.

187
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:47,692
Rough night, huh?

188
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:50,513
No rest for the wicked.

189
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:53,003
Something tells me you know that.

190
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,307
You want to know what else I know?

191
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,253
You know your buddy, Terry Moss,

192
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,474
He spent 3 years in Bellmarsh prison
in England.

193
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:01,616
'87 to '90 for assault and battery.

194
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,201
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

195
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,171
And he's gone now,

196
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:06,227
and I'm tired,

197
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,894
and I'm hungover,
and it's none of your business.

198
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,395
It's my business if you spent the night
at the penthouse suite at the Park hotel

199
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,885
where there were prostitutes
and illegal gambling.

200
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:17,400
Those women were prostitutes?

201
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:20,350
How'd you know?

202
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:23,030
Did you follow us?

203
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:24,981
That's interesting.

204
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:32,982
There. Surprise and shame in less
than a second, and then nothing.

205
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,847
Pulling down the mask.
Put her on the list.

206
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,132
Go back a moment.

207
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:42,677
There you go.
See this girl?

208
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:45,815
Same girl, she glances at the teacher.
There you go, see?

209
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,059
And he catches her at it.
He's got his eye on her for some reason.

210
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,311
So does this girl here. Look.

211
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,706
Then she looks over at that guy.

212
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,277
Nice one, Loker.

213
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:02,072
Soon you'll be asking me
for a raise,

214
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,635
which I've been assured
that we can't afford so...

215
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:05,890
stand down.

216
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:08,070
Well, keep watching the tape, then.

217
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:11,415
- Be back in a minute.
- You look awful.

218
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,792
And yet, I feel so much worse.

219
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,064
I said 22 years,

220
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:27,931
not 22 minutes.

221
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,183
We're in trouble.

222
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,195
They know who you are
and what you do,

223
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:35,056
and they ain't happy.

224
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,107
- What do they want?
- You know,

225
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,097
they want to see you saw a girl in half.
What do you think they want?

226
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:42,342
They want you to be their magic man.

227
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:45,642
They're waiting around the corner.
And if you don't come now, then...

228
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,201
Then I'm done.

229
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,187
As in dead, done.

230
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:59,421
I'll see what
I can find out from him.

231
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:02,681
Your buddy's lost his FBI tail.

232
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:05,103
Do you have any clue
on where he could be right now?

233
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:06,755
Come with me, will you?

234
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:12,552
He's in my office.

235
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,147
He's in your office?

236
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,812
What is he doing in there?

237
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,838
I've got a major
bloody problem here.

238
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:19,266
You're damn right, you do.

239
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:22,944
You do understand that terry's involved
with an extremely dangerous criminal?

240
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,474
- Lance Mc Clellan.
- Lance Mc Clellan exactly.

241
00:14:25,557 --> 00:14:28,018
He's a new-school crime boss,
educated, well-connected,

242
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,368
Hidden in plain sight.
This ends now.

243
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,011
Terry's family to me. There's no way
I'm going to let him hang himself.

244
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:34,798
I'm not going to let him
hang you either.

245
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,583
Wait, what's Mc Clellan's game?

246
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,102
It depends.

247
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:39,970
Which means you don't know?

248
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:42,533
That means that you're gonna help me

249
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,171
Help terry to help you.

250
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:47,052
If anyone's helping anyone here,
It's gonna be you

251
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,070
helping to bring down
Mc Clellan and Terry.

252
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:52,019
I know he's your friend,
but those guys are bad sons of bitches.

253
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:55,340
Mc Clellan sent Terry for me, which
means he needs something from me?

254
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:57,150
Whatever it is, he needs it quick.

255
00:14:57,588 --> 00:15:00,416
If you're suggesting what I think
you're suggesting, you can forget it.

256
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,026
- You're not an undercover agent.
- Knock it off, I'm doing this.

257
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,236
- Not if I arrest you.
- You're going to arrest me?

258
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,849
I won a hundred grand
in cards last night.

259
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:10,034
I know a bluff when I see one.
You're not arresting me.

260
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:13,825
And you keep foster out of this.

261
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,998
Her focus needs to be 100%
on that school.

262
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:19,705
And I'm banking on you to have
my back for this.

263
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:21,246
Like a real FBI agent?

264
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:22,663
Something like that.

265
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,782
We're needed
in the conference room.

266
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:27,008
Torres is here with three kids
from the school.

267
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:28,940
What's wrong?

268
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:31,316
Nothing.

269
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,911
Reynolds was just telling me
what a bad seed Terry was.

270
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,638
And it came as a bit of a shock

271
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:39,258
because there was I thinking
that he was a choir boy.

272
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,205
Stand up.

273
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:48,402
Stand up.

274
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:51,152
When did you make the video?

275
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,034
- What's your name?
- I didn't make it.

276
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,323
Exploding buildings,
that was news footage?

277
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,288
- Your name is?
- Stacey.

278
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:58,924
- Stacey.
- I don't know.

279
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:00,652
Probably.
I couldn't...

280
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:02,252
I'm the one who made that video.

281
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,373
Jared rollins is my name.

282
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:08,174
I made the video.

283
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,111
Get your hands out of your pockets.

284
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,031
So what's the plan?

285
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:16,099
Is it a bombing
or a shooting or what?

286
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:19,352
Because you know,
there always is a plan.

287
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,771
You tell me.

288
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,429
So when did you make the video?

289
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:30,884
What does it matter?

290
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,323
I thought it would have
mattered a great deal to you.

291
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,077
I made it,
that's all you need to know.

292
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,704
Who did you send it to?

293
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,087
What?

294
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:42,365
It's all right there.

295
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:44,920
He's lying, he didn't make it.

296
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,755
Why would you lie
about making the video?

297
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,631
'Caus maybe
they all deserve to die,

298
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:50,592
Or at least worry about it.

299
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:51,416
Who?

300
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:53,845
They know who they are.

301
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:56,374
If he didn't make the video,
he sure wishes he had.

302
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:58,042
His face, body language.

303
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,615
It's homicidal intent.

304
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,066
<i>- Your name is?
- Stacey.</i>

305
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,861
<i>That was news footage?</i>

306
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:10,734
<i>I don't know. Probably.</i>

307
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:12,239
<i>I'm the one who made it.</i>

308
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,570
<i>Jared Rollins is my name.</i>

309
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:19,426
When he said he made the video,

310
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:22,215
He deliberately interrupted stacey.

311
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,168
And she's relieved.

312
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:27,953
He's covering for her,
he's protecting her.

313
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,731
Nice shirt. Help yourself.

314
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:39,619
I thought you'd fallen in.

315
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:41,727
That would be a quality
problem. How's your hand?

316
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,977
It's all right.

317
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,444
I don't know any approved torture,

318
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,384
But in your case, that is personal.

319
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,323
What's going on?

320
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,030
What's going on?

321
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,020
God!

322
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,653
You all right?

323
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,628
You remember those,

324
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:00,829
The property flips we used to do
back in London?

325
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:04,958
I only broke in and sold
the wrong man's miami mansion.

326
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,729
But it turns out,

327
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,379
he was connected.

328
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:13,453
Answer the question.

329
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:15,802
What are you dragging me into?

330
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,499
I don't know.
I swear to god, cal,

331
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:20,723
I do not know.

332
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,564
Well, come on, then.

333
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,649
Thank you.

334
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:31,928
Oh, shut up.

335
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,179
So the video

336
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:37,741
Even though you didn't make it,
does speak to your needs?

337
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:40,866
And which is partly why
you took false credit.

338
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:45,534
And you say they deserve to die,
but you're clearly scared to name them.

339
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:50,711
Take Jared back
to the conference room.

340
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:52,547
I need to talk to Stacey.

341
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:55,802
We're done.

342
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:04,284
- Where's Lightman?
- He's not in his office.

343
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,522
We're calling him, but it's going
straight to voicemail.

344
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,533
Where could he be?
That's not like him.

345
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,339
Could you keep trying?

346
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:30,836
Good of you to come.

347
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:35,757
I warn you, I'm not cheap.

348
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,259
Terry's life cover it?

349
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:39,838
Barely.

350
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,989
We have a deal, then.

351
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,945
I like to think of all of my people
as family,

352
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:50,271
but one of these three has been
informing on me to the government.

353
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,231
You're going
to tell me for certain

354
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:54,610
Which one is the rat.

355
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,571
So you can kill the man?

356
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,611
Three minutes.

357
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,783
Right, then.

358
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:12,434
All right, boys?

359
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:21,679
Well, you're right.

360
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:26,656
There is a liar in the room.

361
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:30,204
Liar's you.

362
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:32,980
What are you doing?

363
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:35,444
Now's not the time
to play the comedian.

364
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,901
Get up.

365
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,072
Give him one more chance.

366
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,615
He won't let you down.

367
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,588
None of these men is an informer.

368
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,880
But you already knew that.

369
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:51,582
Good.

370
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:55,461
Told you he was the best.

371
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,589
What I want to know is when
you told him that,

372
00:20:58,698 --> 00:20:59,984
Was it last night?

373
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,864
- Last week, last month?
- Quiet, ladies.

374
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:06,850
Nice one.

375
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,275
Stacey, are you and Jasmine friends?

376
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:18,305
The exact same look
she showed for jasmine in class.

377
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,569
Contempt.

378
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:20,965
She's mean to me.

379
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,834
In P.E.,

380
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:25,581
In the locker room.

381
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,702
<i>But she's not the only one.</i>

382
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,676
I hate P.E.

383
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,748
Did you tell your teacher?

384
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,964
He knows.

385
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,841
I wish I didn't have
to ask you this,

386
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:41,029
but do you ever wish Jasmine

387
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:43,718
or any of the other kids
who are mean to you, harm?

388
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:44,813
Harm?

389
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:47,285
Like,

390
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,238
you think I made that video,

391
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:51,768
that it was,

392
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,641
I may have thought
about revenge but,

393
00:21:57,753 --> 00:21:59,233
I don't want them to die.

394
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,155
She's telling the truth.
She doesn't want to harm anyone.

395
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,831
Please don't tell jasmine
I told on her.

396
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,394
Sweetie.

397
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:12,531
Maybe she is the one
who made the video.

398
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,868
All this is is her fantasy
of revenge.

399
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:17,037
Who's the P.E. Teacher?

400
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:19,045
- Why?
- It's not you, is it?

401
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,815
But I would never turn a blind eye
to bullying if I saw it.

402
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:23,967
Did you know that these kids
were picking on stacey?

403
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:27,061
I could see
she wasn't the most popular.

404
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:29,023
Is jasmine popular?

405
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:30,430
Yeah. I'd say so.

406
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:32,209
Very, actually.

407
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:34,727
It's the popular ones who think
they can get away with murder.

408
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,341
Spoken like a true scientist.

409
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:37,954
Trust me, I just know.

410
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,437
We should get jasmine in there now.

411
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:47,907
So you two go back a ways?

412
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,124
I'm sure Terry's
told you all about it.

413
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:51,392
Property scams.

414
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,490
You picked out the easy marks.

415
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,666
Terry took them for
everything they had.

416
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:59,293
If that's how Terry remembers it.

417
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,093
I remember you with the business
of picking out the right mark.

418
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:05,388
The absolute bloody
business, I swear.

419
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:09,345
Terry tells me
that you owe him your life.

420
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:11,513
Tell me about that.

421
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,143
I thought it was water
under the bridge.

422
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:17,471
Even so,

423
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,137
While we're waiting.

424
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,060
What's the faster say we were,

425
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,111
west ham supporters
at millwall game?

426
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,088
He saved you from soccer hooligans.

427
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,721
Manner of speaking.

428
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:31,168
Or were you two the hooligans?

429
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:33,243
Not guilty, your honor.

430
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:38,291
You see that look?

431
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,096
That look says that your time
on this planet is running out.

432
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,697
Put a cork in it, Cal.
That's enough.

433
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:48,401
See, it's always the same,
the criminal mind.

434
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:50,094
Never sees the end of the road.

435
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:52,756
Forever hoping,
often actually believing,

436
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,975
that there will be just
one more corner to turn.

437
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:56,909
Not his fault.

438
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:00,229
He's not the only one. I'm
basically wired the same way.

439
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:05,234
- They're on their way. 5 minutes out.
- Who?

440
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:08,503
The man that you're going to meet with.
See if he's on the level or not

441
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:10,114
Before I do business with him.

442
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,103
Call him back.
Cancel it.

443
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,951
- Excuse me?
- What?

444
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:16,334
Look out the window.

445
00:24:19,031 --> 00:24:20,708
There's an FBI tail out there.

446
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,252
They've been on Terry like
a cheap suit since he landed.

447
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:31,803
- Don't play games, professor.
- You can thank me later.

448
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,140
Show me.

449
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:41,381
See it?

450
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,276
The blue one?

451
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,066
Not the blue one, the other one.

452
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,860
That one over from it, the red one.
The red station wagon.

453
00:24:49,782 --> 00:24:52,198
Might as well have had
the blue light flashing on top.

454
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,581
Call him back. I'll meet
to the warehouse.

455
00:24:57,385 --> 00:24:58,165
Get up.

456
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:01,312
A whole lot of people think that
it's just the victims of bullies

457
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:02,969
Who get hurt.

458
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:05,086
<i>But the bullies</i>

459
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,505
Pay a price, too.

460
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:11,481
- You know, maybe not physically but,
- We were just joking around at first.

461
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:13,894
About what?
Stacey's weight?

462
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:15,841
That, and...

463
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:19,350
I can't explain.

464
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:22,577
It got out of control.

465
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:25,140
I'm so sorry.

466
00:25:25,497 --> 00:25:26,693
Are you, though?

467
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:30,131
It wasn't just me.

468
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:32,461
There are others.

469
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,479
<i>If that video means what
</i>I think it means,

470
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,701
That it's all coming to an end,

471
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:42,039
The pain, her pain, mine?

472
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:44,127
I wish it would.

473
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:47,627
I hate myself
for what I did to stacey.

474
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:51,082
But I couldn't stop. He didn't
<i>want us to.</i>

475
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:52,839
He meaning you.

476
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:56,429
And you still mean to tell me
you had no idea this was going on?

477
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,138
I can't be everywhere all the time.

478
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:00,183
Ducks the question
while grabbing for an excuse.

479
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:01,851
Classic deflection.

480
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:05,128
<i>If Stacey made </i>
that video, it's because of me.

481
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:12,821
- Where's Stacey?
- She went to the bathroom.

482
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,349
- How long ago?
- Few minutes.

483
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:15,964
More like 10, I think.

484
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,773
Come on.
Open up now, please.

485
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:34,467
- I can't find a pulse.
- Oh, my god.

486
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,970
I missed it. It wasn't
homicidal intent. I misread the sadness.

487
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:42,215
- It was suicidal intent.
- I need an ambulance.

488
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:50,471
Move it, move it.

489
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,866
Let's go, let's leave.
Three cars behind.

490
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,238
- The parents have been contacted.
- It's been taken care of.

491
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:27,632
Tell me she's going to be OK.

492
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:33,106
She's gonna be OK.

493
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:04,711
Stay here.

494
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,688
Talk amongst yourselves.

495
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,694
Was it really an FBI tail?

496
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,489
- And you just ditched them?
- Yes, to earn his trust.

497
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:22,078
That worked like a charm,

498
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:23,830
we got blindfolds and locked doors.

499
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:27,036
Are we even yet,

500
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:28,464
Terry?

501
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:30,641
Are we ever gonna be even
in your eyes?

502
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:33,565
You think that's what this is about?
It's about who's even with who.

503
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:35,637
That's a bit rich
coming from you, mate.

504
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,550
Mate,

505
00:28:36,768 --> 00:28:38,983
I did 3 years in prison
saving your ass.

506
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:41,572
So what do I gotta do?
I gotta die to save yours, have I?

507
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:43,459
You should've come to me
in the 1st place

508
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:45,014
have been honest with me and said,

509
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,337
"Cal, I'm in a bit of bother,
could use some help

510
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,851
from a friend I can count on."

511
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,289
- You'd have done what?
- I'd have done something!

512
00:28:51,372 --> 00:28:52,673
Anything's better than this!

513
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:54,650
I haven't heard from you
in over 20 years,

514
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,317
over twenty years.

515
00:28:58,687 --> 00:28:59,820
What was that?

516
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,874
Let's just face it?

517
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,327
You wanted the past dead
and me along with it.

518
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:12,071
Apology accepted, by the way.

519
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:33,967
Where is Lightman?

520
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:41,381
My financial advisor, Harry Sloane.

521
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,938
How do you do?

522
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,867
I see you two
already know each other.

523
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:49,453
Any friend of Terry
is a friend of mine.

524
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:54,500
Pleasantries out of the way. Let's
get down to the heart of the matter.

525
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,455
The merchandise, Mr. Jones?

526
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:59,035
You say it is the best ever,
flawless, in fact.

527
00:29:59,118 --> 00:30:00,568
I gave you my word,

528
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,669
man to man.

529
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:03,362
See, that's why I'm here.

530
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:05,428
Yes or no questions,
they only go so far.

531
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,929
So,

532
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,511
how flawless

533
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:10,699
is the merchandise?

534
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:12,372
The currency

535
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:13,519
is perfect.

536
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,814
There's a flicker of doubt there,

537
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,445
but might just be
about the deal in general.

538
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,777
Perfect counterfeit currency.

539
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:24,238
That's an oxymoron
if ever I heard one.

540
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:27,491
- What is this sideshow?
- He's telling the truth, though,

541
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,642
When he says that
the counterfeit's perfect.

542
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:32,149
He truly, he does believe that.

543
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:34,811
But then again, he's just...

544
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:36,045
What his name

545
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:38,294
down at the U.N.,
all over again, right?

546
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:40,258
Excuse me?

547
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:41,341
That guy,

548
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:43,576
he truly did believe

549
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:46,260
all that WMD nonsense.

550
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:48,748
Cleverly,

551
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:51,803
they sent him off down to the U.N.
To sell it.

552
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:55,186
- The rest is history.
- No one sent me here.

553
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:58,902
The currency...

554
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:01,576
is flawless.

555
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:06,468
I mean, I'm sorry.

556
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:10,034
- But... it's not good enough.
- Who is this ass?

557
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:13,579
Screw him, let's go.

558
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,483
We're not done yet.

559
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:21,769
No, you swore to me
that you would...

560
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,856
Is he telling the truth,
Dr. Lightman?

561
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:26,050
Yes or no?

562
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:29,127
Yes! He believes that he is, yes.

563
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,012
Good.

564
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,431
So do we have a deal or not?

565
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,966
Is this the best you've got,
Dr. Lightman?

566
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:40,249
Because so far, I'm under whelmed.

567
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:41,815
Or is there more?

568
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:44,669
Will you put me
in front of the actual counterfeit

569
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,902
with the bank notes in his hands,

570
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:50,407
and I'll know just how good
his product is.

571
00:31:56,724 --> 00:31:57,706
Just you.

572
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:00,158
Terry can stay here.

573
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:02,711
Terry's with me.

574
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:05,281
It's not negotiable.

575
00:32:05,462 --> 00:32:07,529
- No, I'll be all right.
- Don't be dumb.

576
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:09,541
You need to be thinking
about yourself.

577
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:10,924
Now you tell me.

578
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:12,969
It's not negotiable.

579
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:22,898
Come on!

580
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,062
Say nothing, Terry, not a word.

581
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:33,389
This is him?

582
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:36,196
- That's your counterfeiter?
- The best there is.

583
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:39,274
50,000 euros, right there.

584
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:44,974
Bloody hell!

585
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:50,301
- How many containers you got?
- That is not your concern.

586
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,495
Put it back.

587
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:58,144
- Name?
- He doesn't need to know that.

588
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,063
I gotta establish a baseline here.

589
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,770
Easy answers to easy questions.

590
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,819
Then I can get to bigger questions.

591
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:04,902
Otto.

592
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,276
Hammil.

593
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:08,903
Otto...

594
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:11,899
What's your real last name?

595
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:14,726
Frankel.

596
00:33:16,357 --> 00:33:17,803
- How many kids you got?
- None.

597
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:19,496
- Have you been married?
- I'm not.

598
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,513
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

599
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:23,746
Get on with it, please, will you?

600
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,670
These notes are counterfeit, right?

601
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,910
Yes.

602
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:31,301
How good are they?

603
00:33:31,703 --> 00:33:34,853
We already tested a modest amount
without detection.

604
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:37,492
Well, Dr. Lightman.

605
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,066
What?

606
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,101
He hasn't answered my question yet.

607
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:45,048
Easy, fellas.

608
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,280
It's taken care of.

609
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:49,224
He was right.

610
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:50,653
FBI.

611
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:56,878
I don't think I can do this.

612
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:59,049
I'll be right here the whole time.

613
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:00,232
Don't worry.

614
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,499
Just take your time, Stacey.

615
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:13,029
You knew what they were doing to me,

616
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:14,652
Mr. Fitzgerald.

617
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:17,424
You didn't just ignore it.

618
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,650
You started it all.

619
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,091
- Stacey...
- You kept telling me

620
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:23,947
I was fat

621
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:26,081
and lazy in front of them.

622
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,108
- That's not true.
- Your hands and eyes say otherwise.

623
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,045
So do I.

624
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,977
I'm so sorry, Stacey.

625
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,871
You know,
I had a coach like you once

626
00:34:38,294 --> 00:34:40,312
who had it in
for one of the kids on the team.

627
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:43,466
Constant verbal abuse

628
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,199
disguised as authority.

629
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:49,211
Eddie Johnston.
And nothing that Eddie ever did

630
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,657
was ever good enough.

631
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,179
- You're out of line.
- And the example

632
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:55,152
that that coach
set for the rest of us,

633
00:34:55,235 --> 00:34:57,511
just like you did for Jasmine
and her buddies,

634
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,268
we thought it gave us the license

635
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:02,474
to make Eddie an outcast.

636
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,117
I never touched a hair on her head.

637
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:06,221
Right,

638
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:08,814
because we did it for you.

639
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:14,278
I wanted you
to have to live the rest of your life

640
00:35:15,286 --> 00:35:17,336
knowing that what you did to me

641
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:19,099
made me...

642
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:28,153
You knew what this was really about
all the time.

643
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:30,743
I know,

644
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:33,177
because I sent you a video, too.

645
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:37,143
Which you neglected to mention,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

646
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:39,213
Making you guilty
of obstruction of justice.

647
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,027
And if this keeps you
away from kids forever,

648
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,260
I'll take it.

649
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:45,392
Right, Stacey?

650
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:51,646
Wait a minute.
One kid has a psychological breakdown,

651
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:52,892
an illness,

652
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:54,485
and I'm to blame?

653
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:01,977
- We need to talk...
- I don't...

654
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:07,187
Thank you.

655
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:11,787
There's a whitening of the skin
around the eyes,

656
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,179
which is a dead give away

657
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:15,506
for the kind of fear
that we try to hide when we lie.

658
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:18,403
And a slight rotation
of the right arm,

659
00:36:19,158 --> 00:36:21,639
which is what we call in the trade
a shrug fragment,

660
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,412
which means he's got zero
confidence in what he just said.

661
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:26,886
The eyes...

662
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:28,376
of a cheat

663
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:30,103
who thinks he has all the cards,

664
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:31,772
but who knows

665
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:34,441
I'm telling the truth.

666
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:45,035
He's lying.

667
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:48,030
The son of a bitch has been playing us
the whole time.

668
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:49,420
Easy! I didn't say...

669
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:51,667
- You really think we're that dumb?
- Easy! I didn't say!

670
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:55,295
FBI! Nobody move!

671
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,460
Anybody else?

672
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:02,636
Down on your knees!
Now!

673
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:03,804
Move!

674
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:04,887
Now!

675
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:22,392
How do you do that?

676
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,410
Blanks.

677
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,578
Blanks?

678
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:28,863
No, I mean,

679
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:30,664
with your eyes.
How do you do that?

680
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,432
It's... just practice.

681
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:34,334
What's going on?

682
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:38,617
Put your hands behind your back.

683
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,050
I swear,
I'm getting too old for this,

684
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,342
Terry, I really am.

685
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:45,387
FBI have been onto you and McClellan

686
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,855
for a while now.

687
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,698
Special agent Hutton.

688
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:50,881
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

689
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:52,768
Superior work, Agt. Reynolds.

690
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,645
Likewise, my friend.
How's that for having your back?

691
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:57,928
That's just like a real FBI agent.

692
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:00,289
- Thanks a lot, Cal.
- What?

693
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,182
When'd you first realize
I was undercover?

694
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:06,765
Back at the poker table,
you were angry

695
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,249
and fearful,

696
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:10,120
but on my behalf.

697
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:14,716
Really?

698
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,359
Come on, let's go.

699
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:19,968
Hold on a second.

700
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:21,359
I'll tell you what.

701
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,342
Terry walks for his part in this.

702
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:26,393
- What?
- And then we're evens.

703
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,556
You know I couldn't have done this
without him.

704
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,592
He goes from here to the airport,

705
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:38,775
and he doesn't come back, ever.

706
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,856
You know,
you're one lucky son of a bitch.

707
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,280
Can I borrow him for a minute?
Just personal stuff.

708
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,741
Just make it...

709
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,681
quick.

710
00:38:48,764 --> 00:38:51,737
I knew you were up to something
the moment you walked into my office.

711
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,864
Then I had to sit there
and watch you play me like...

712
00:38:53,947 --> 00:38:55,531
one of those yuppies back in London.

713
00:38:55,614 --> 00:38:57,668
McClellan had me
by the short and curlies!

714
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,201
Get out!
My best mate!

715
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,847
- What do you think I wanted to do it?
- You were in on this from the start!

716
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,829
They knew who I was before
I even sat down at that poker table.

717
00:39:05,912 --> 00:39:08,097
What was that?
That was just some little test run.

718
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,780
What do you call this?

719
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:11,620
A couple of broken fingers

720
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:14,203
for a slice of that pie?
Do me a favor.

721
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:17,229
And you can stop treating me
like a bloody moron now!

722
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:19,505
Maybe I just came
to resent you, Cal.

723
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:20,816
Hate me, more like.

724
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,159
Years will do that, Terry.

725
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,101
You saw all the way through it.

726
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,737
You saw right through it
from the start.

727
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:31,007
Still helped me, though, didn't you?

728
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,452
You know why?

729
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,663
Because you always have been

730
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,081
and you always will be

731
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,791
my best mate.

732
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,382
Don't count on it.

733
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,500
I'll tell you what.

734
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:45,212
My debt is now paid,

735
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:46,827
in full!

736
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:50,679
No, wait a second, wait a second.
You owe me now.

737
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:54,349
I saved your bacon
and I covered your ass with the FBI!

738
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,067
I'm a very lucky man.

739
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:03,022
All luck is earned... in the end.

740
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:06,561
Go, then.

741
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:08,527
Off you go.

742
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,793
Don't you dare look back.

743
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:42,734
Have a seat.

744
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,150
- Why?
- This is an intervention.

745
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,055
What?

746
00:40:49,606 --> 00:40:53,038
All right, so I had, you know,
a few drinks with a mate.

747
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,285
- More than a few, actually.
- This isn't about drinking.

748
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,016
Then if it's about poker,

749
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:00,860
I won a hundred grand.

750
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:02,143
Hundred grand?

751
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:03,845
105, actually.

752
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:06,246
It's not about gambling, either.

753
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,548
- What is it about, then?
- It's about you trusting us.

754
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,274
You were in trouble,
and you never came to us.

755
00:41:11,357 --> 00:41:13,605
- Wait a minute...
- No, you wait!

756
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:14,838
We're a team.

757
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:17,902
And you risked your life
without letting us help you.

758
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,520
I wouldn't be here at all
if it wasn't for Terry Marsh.

759
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,480
Fine. So where does that leave us?

760
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:26,781
That leaves...
you all fired.

761
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:29,052
You gotta be kidding!
I didn't wanna do this intervention.

762
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:30,371
Just you, then.

763
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,198
Just you are fired,
for having no spine.

764
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,242
- I don't believe this.
- Good.

765
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,707
'cause I'm lying.

766
00:41:37,326 --> 00:41:38,871
What, you didn't spot that?

767
00:41:39,158 --> 00:41:41,018
Did your emotions get in the way?

768
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:42,785
You should really work on that.

769
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:46,063
This has been terrific.

770
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:47,963
Really fantastic.

771
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,035
Quite the intervention.

772
00:41:50,118 --> 00:41:52,668
We should do this again
soon, very soon.

773
00:41:57,941 --> 00:41:59,891
The intervention was my idea.

774
00:42:11,148 --> 00:42:13,098
My mom died when I was young,

775
00:42:13,508 --> 00:42:15,255
and my dad was long gone by then.

776
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:18,905
Terry and his family, they took me in
even though there was no room

777
00:42:18,988 --> 00:42:22,906
and even less money. And one day, Terry
and I got into a little bit of trouble

778
00:42:22,989 --> 00:42:24,289
with the police.

779
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,827
Not your concern, but...

780
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:29,346
they were on their way.

781
00:42:30,265 --> 00:42:32,574
No way we could get out of it
without one of us

782
00:42:32,657 --> 00:42:34,657
acting as decoy for the other.

783
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:37,262
- So Terry took the fall for you?
- Yeah, he did.

784
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:39,095
He said,

785
00:42:39,396 --> 00:42:41,584
<i>you're supposed to use
that brain of yours for something,</i>

786
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,895
<i>not be dragged down into the muck
by stupid bastards like me.</i>

787
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:48,356
- He was right.
- Yeah, he was.

788
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:52,736
It cost him 3 years of his life.

789
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:58,359
So anyone who wants to compete
for my loyalty with Terry Marsh,

790
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:00,535
not really in a fair fight.

791
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,321
Good night, love.
