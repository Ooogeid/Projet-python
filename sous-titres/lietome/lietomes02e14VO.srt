1
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:21,020
Wake up, sweetheart.
Jakey?

2
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,260
Dad, you're hurting me.

3
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,618
Get under the bed.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,320
There's somebody out there,
so get under the bed.

5
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,489
Daddy.

6
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,576
Dad!
It's just the rain!

7
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,958
Do not move! Copy?

8
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,075
Jake!

9
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,745
- I told you not to move!
- You okay?

10
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,108
- You all right?.
- I'm okay, mom.

11
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:26,182
Damn it, Jeff!

12
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,008
You need help!

13
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,515
I told him not to...

14
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,653
I think somebody should say it.

15
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:44,602
It sounds a lot like PTSD.

16
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,463
Sergeant Turley got back
from Iraq 6 months ago.

17
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:49,734
He was one
of my most effective NCOS.

18
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,904
I read your bio, Dr. Lightman,
and I'm begging you,

19
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,865
do whatever it takes.

20
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,058
All right.

21
00:01:58,032 --> 00:01:59,535
Are you going to help my dad?

22
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:00,953
Who are you?

23
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:02,244
Jake.

24
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,792
- Becky.
- How do you do?

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,628
Are you a soldier?

26
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:11,213
My dad was.

27
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,424
My dad's getting a silver star.

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,384
Your dad must be really brave.

29
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:19,624
We're just going to sit over there.
Come on.

30
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:24,769
Restraints?

31
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,687
Turley nearly took out his own kid

32
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,191
with a weapon
he's no longer authorized to have.

33
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,233
We're lucky he's not
in a cell downtown.

34
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:35,203
I'll be right back.

35
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,306
All right, Jeff.

36
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,204
I'm Cal Lightman.

37
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:50,669
Only joking.

38
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,921
So...

39
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:54,590
What you so scared of, then?

40
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,583
Say again?

41
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,343
You heard.

42
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:03,002
You have any idea what it's like
to get back from Iraq,

43
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:04,850
and somebody's still trying
to kill you?

44
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,448
I can only imagine.

45
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:11,607
A bit basket case, if I were you.
No offense.

46
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:13,951
Colonel said he'd call you in,

47
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:15,908
says you can see if I'm lying.

48
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:27,832
What are you doing?

49
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,417
I'm getting you out of here.

50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,420
La <i><font color="#ff0000">Lie</font> <font color="#ffffff">to</font><font color="#ff0000"> team</font></i> présente:

51
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,447
Episode 214: <i>React to Contact</i>

52
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,203
Sergeant turley saved the lives
of 14 soldiers in Iraq.

53
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,881
Including a wounded man
he carried to safety.

54
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:12,583
Army medical files make
no mention of PTSD.

55
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,555
They haven't run all the tests yet.
The hospital has been overwhelmed.

56
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,631
It's a 6-month wait, minimum.

57
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:20,801
Somebody's trying to kill him?

58
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,262
The point is, he believes it.

59
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:26,640
File, please.

60
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,693
Thank you very much.

61
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,159
Lightman talked to the VA.

62
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:33,147
They're going to let him use the magnet.
Colonel Powler cut through the red tape.

63
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,316
- The magnet?
- Their FMRI machine.

64
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:38,152
<i>All right.</i>

65
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,030
Says here...

66
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,952
that you killed your house

67
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:44,700
with an armor-piercing round.

68
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,289
Who exactly is after you?

69
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:54,668
I don't know.

70
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,755
I wish I did.
Trust me.

71
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:02,338
Let's talk about your boy...

72
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,603
- I couldn't live without him.
- You almost blew his bloody head off.

73
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,812
Up yours.

74
00:05:16,513 --> 00:05:17,524
Calm down.

75
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,655
Look at me. Come on, I dare you.
Look at me.

76
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,023
What do you see?

77
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:26,492
A smartass limey bastard.

78
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:29,017
No, though, apart from that.

79
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,830
Friend or foe?
Be honest.

80
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:37,294
Sorry. Sorry.

81
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,798
We'll take a break, then, calm down.

82
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:42,091
I'm fine, okay?

83
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,134
<i>Take a breath.
Take a deep breath.</i>

84
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,252
- I'm good.
- I believe you.

85
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,730
When did you last have
a decent night's sleep?

86
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,796
One or two months ago.

87
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,385
Army gives me pills,
but they don't do squat.

88
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,614
The little white one?

89
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,816
Listen, I know what you're thinking.

90
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,053
No, you don't.

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,661
I don't have PTSD.

92
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,497
Excuse me, where did you do
your post doctorate work?

93
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,629
Think about cheese.

94
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,552
- What?
- Think about cheese.

95
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:24,813
We're gonna take pictures of your brain.
You might as well be smiling.

96
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,048
A bunch of pictures will appear
on the screen,

97
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:33,424
and the machine will record
what happens in his brain

98
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:35,026
when he looks at them.

99
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,274
Let's get started.

100
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,135
Flash them at 1/10 of a second.

101
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:03,672
Jeff, when you see the angry face,

102
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,383
your amygdala, here, lights up.

103
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:08,260
We would expect that.

104
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,097
It's primal warrior neurons firing,
the fight or flight reflexes.

105
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,145
Which is good,
if you're a soldier in combat.

106
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:18,591
But if you're home with
your wife and kid, not so good.

107
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,731
When we flashed

108
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,490
the neutral face...

109
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,861
This area should light up.

110
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:27,905
- But there's no change.
- Right.

111
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:31,663
So at the neuron level,
where our emotions begin,

112
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:33,452
you see this face

113
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:34,828
as angry.

114
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:39,112
So you're reading neutral faces
as hostile. Everyone is your enemy.

115
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,917
That's PTSD.

116
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:47,216
So you've seen a lot of combat,
and you're having trouble moving on.

117
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:48,967
I've moved on.

118
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,386
It's okay, babe. We're getting you
the help that you need.

119
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:55,349
That's avoidance.

120
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,254
You won't let people
get close to you,

121
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,146
even your wife,
who we know you love.

122
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:03,883
Having PTSD

123
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,023
doesn't mean someone out there
doesn't want me dead.

124
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:07,361
Absolutely.

125
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,488
And no one said they did.

126
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:10,823
So?

127
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:13,823
You're getting awarded
the silver star?

128
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:14,743
What for?

129
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:20,833
I would have thought
you'd be proud to tell me that.

130
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:24,985
I don't want to talk about it.

131
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,381
You seem more ashamed
than you are proud.

132
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:29,424
I told you...

133
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,728
I know. You don't want to talk about it,
which is why...

134
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:33,391
we're going to go back.

135
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,847
Back where?

136
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:37,442
Back to the root of the problem.

137
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,059
Why are we doing this?
He isn't being deceptive.

138
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:45,049
But he is being lied to.

139
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,902
Yeah, by his own brain.

140
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,876
During moments of extreme trauma,

141
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,530
part of the brain can just
shut down.

142
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:55,520
And in Jeff's case, the only real
memories he has of the events is...

143
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:58,203
In the form of nightmares
or flashbacks.

144
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,998
So the idea is to...

145
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,083
retraumatize him
in a controlled way.

146
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,100
Right,
so that his memories reintegrate.

147
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,881
The truth is the only way
to help him recover.

148
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,039
So this is Foster's pet project?

149
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:14,456
Virtual reality.

150
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:17,514
Foster got a DOD grant
to build this prototype.

151
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:21,950
They say
truth is the first casualty of war.

152
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,452
Foster thinks virtual reality
can change that.

153
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,031
All right. The day that you
earned your silver star,

154
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:36,825
where were you?

155
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:40,772
In my Humvee

156
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,276
<i>outside Zirmaya.</i>

157
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,125
Put the old...

158
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,788
things down.

159
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:48,295
That's it.

160
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,423
Look at that.

161
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,768
Same crap hole I just left.

162
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,892
Look to your right.
What do you see?

163
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,395
- Ronnie's sitting next to me.
- Ronnie?

164
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:07,494
Sergeant Bacca.

165
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,401
He's what?
Your army buddy, is he?

166
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:16,531
We were in the sandbox together.
He always had my back.

167
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:19,342
All right. Now,
use the remote control.

168
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,288
Yeah, to move about.
It's like a video game, really.

169
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:28,794
We were number 2 in the convoy.

170
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:33,048
Yeah. We were heading into Zirmaya.

171
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:35,435
Anything important?

172
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,178
Uh, topcover.
2 helos above us.

173
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,763
Kiowa oh-58s.

174
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,192
And an a-10 Warthog in support.

175
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,030
I'll see your Kiowas,

176
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,173
And I will raise you one warthog.

177
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,229
We're going to turn
right down this alley.

178
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:59,104
It's a routine patrol, but the
road was blocked right down here.

179
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,494
This lead humvee's going
to get hit by an IED.

180
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:10,252
Survivors?

181
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:17,390
Sutton, Cortez, and Tanaka,
all dead, just like that.

182
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,602
Never even went to their funerals.

183
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:23,997
Some hero.

184
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,143
Survivor's guilt.

185
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,347
- Pressure and heart rate are elevated.
- Want some water?

186
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:34,978
No.
Let's just do this.

187
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,921
So we're going
to take some incoming.

188
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,034
Incoming right here.

189
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,102
- Where?
- RPG, 11 o'clock!

190
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:47,039
They set my engine block on fire,

191
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,999
And Jeffers is up on top,

192
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,709
We're taking major heat.

193
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,443
All right. We're going to lose
Jeffers in a second here.

194
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,934
God. We're taking major fire.

195
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,925
Jeffers goes down. Jeffers is down.

196
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,388
He's pounding on my window, yelling.
He's going to haul my ass out of here.

197
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,348
Who is?

198
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,479
OK. We're taking major fire.
He's yelling at me.

199
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,440
He's telling me that we
got to take this compound

200
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:17,069
with this red door.
If I don't go through, he'll kill me.

201
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,612
Who's going to kill you?

202
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,774
Who's going to kill you?

203
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,873
Who's going to kill you?

204
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:34,127
What, you're a coward now, are you?
Are you scared?

205
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,755
You calling me a coward, captain?

206
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,092
Who you calling a captain, sergeant?

207
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,659
All right.
Foster? Torres?

208
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:52,233
Find this man's captain.

209
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,150
Private Johns got shot
with a 7.62 round.

210
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,403
Firsthe's going toscream
for his mama.

211
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:03,021
Now, you reach into his pack
to find the pressure bandage.

212
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,208
Instead, you find tobacco.

213
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,641
Pressure bandage.
Upper right-hand pouch as you wear it.

214
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,836
With a large wound, you can use
the plastic to contain any mess.

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,135
At ease, gentlemen.

216
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,641
Afternoon, ladies.
You work with Dr. Lightman?

217
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,268
- Jillian Foster.
- Torres.

218
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,603
Colonel Powler said I
could be of help to you.

219
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,440
You served
with sergeant Jeff turley?

220
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:41,027
Sorry to hear he's having some trouble
readjusting. Glad he's working with you.

221
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,589
We used to study Dr.
Lightman's work at West point.

222
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:46,032
Really?
At West point?

223
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,659
Every officer reads
Dr. Lightman's book.

224
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:52,516
In Iraq, we used his facereading
techniques to help identify insurgents.

225
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,833
I can't tell you how many
soldiers he helped save.

226
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,699
What are you doing here?

227
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,730
Nothing. I, uh, I got you a cactus.

228
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:33,190
- Why?
- Why not?

229
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:38,126
What have you done?

230
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,990
I haven't done anything.
I just...

231
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:42,923
It... it reminded me of you.

232
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:51,238
So can you tell us what happened
at Zirmaya, after the convoy was hit?

233
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:55,367
Turley froze, terrified. We were
in a kill zone. His gunner was K.I.A.

234
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,980
I had to get him out of that humvee.
Otherwise, he'd be dead, too.

235
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,775
Why would he say
you want to kill him?

236
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:05,862
Because at that instant, I did want
to kill him. And I wasn't the only one.

237
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:09,658
I had to yank him out of that humvee.
30 seconds later, it blew up.

238
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,785
Yet you recommended him
for the silver star.

239
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:16,122
Bravery is overcoming your fear.
Turley did that.

240
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,001
He stepped up, saved lives
without regard for his own.

241
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:26,800
Sir, battalion update briefing
is moved from 1800 to 1630.

242
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm sorry. I have to go.
We're deploying in 3 days.

243
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:33,139
Let me get you the afteraction
report from Zirmaya.

244
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,308
Taw will be back with it
in 2 minutes.

245
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:39,351
Ladies.

246
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:44,031
If you want my read,
he's telling the truth.

247
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,971
The kind of guy I'd follow into war.

248
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,738
That's because he was flirting
with you the entire time.

249
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,979
Well, it gave me a baseline.

250
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,328
This is a guy who's deploying
back to the war in 3 days.

251
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,346
His voice, the pride in it?

252
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,124
He's hiding something.

253
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:10,844
- Oh, neat car.
- Dad gave it to me.

254
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,378
Jake, Emily.
Emily, Jake.

255
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:14,264
- Is he your dad?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,099
He's helping my dad.
He's a soldier.

257
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:18,451
- Ahh.
- You can talk about that later.

258
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:19,894
- Go on.
- Bye, Jake.

259
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,789
Off you go. Go on.
Keep going.

260
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,523
Nice to meet you.

261
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,291
Keep going. Keep going.
That's it. Go on.

262
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,203
Based on the afteraction report,

263
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,221
Here is the official story.

264
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,583
Right. So, humvee gets
blown up here.

265
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,794
Now, they're taking fire
from here and here.

266
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:46,963
Jeff, Ronnie, and the captain,

267
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,506
They assault the red door.

268
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,966
Jeff goes first.

269
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,887
Yes. And he clears the
snipers nests here and here,

270
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,341
And he shoots a combatant here, OK?

271
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,060
And a firefight happens here.

272
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:04,314
- And that's the official version.
- You think there's more than one?

273
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,608
There's always
more than one version.

274
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,515
Can I have a go?

275
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:25,972
Sure.

276
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:39,836
I think I broke it.

277
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,159
- It's an accident.
- It's all right.

278
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,522
It does that sometimes.

279
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:52,325
When you asked me if I was a soldier,
Were you hoping that I was one?

280
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,850
Yeah, like my dad.

281
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,241
Oh. Well, I'm not.

282
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:03,248
Come here.

283
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,416
I...

284
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:12,632
- How'd you get that, then?
- My dad gets scared.

285
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:17,260
What, like, when he fired his gun?

286
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,382
That was an accident, too.

287
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:25,856
- Are you scared of your dad?
- How do you know?

288
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,210
Well, I was a boy once, you know.

289
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:30,326
Only I was about, um...

290
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,445
Well, I was much shorter.

291
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,947
My dad was trying to protect me.

292
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,115
From what?

293
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:40,201
The bruises.
They're from Ronnie.

294
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,029
Your dad's army buddy?

295
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,833
He lives above our garage now.

296
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:50,424
Hey, Jake...

297
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,206
When you say that Ronnie hurts
you, that's a big deal.

298
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:56,181
You know that, right?
Hmm?

299
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:03,258
I saw Ronnie and my mom
once in the kitchen.

300
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:06,604
He touched her face like this.

301
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:13,739
Jake is afraid of losing his dad.

302
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,529
He blames Ronnie.
That's why he's telling lies.

303
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,303
A boy sees his father falling apart,
and then, another soldier moves

304
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:24,078
into the house and provides support and
comfort to his mother.

305
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,486
Put yourself in his shoes.

306
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:29,042
Is there something going on
between you and Ronnie?

307
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:31,699
Ronnie's very special to us.

308
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:34,589
We're lucky to have him,
Particularly with what's going on.

309
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,517
Yeah. You said no, but...

310
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,885
what you were actually doing
was nodding yes.

311
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:41,051
She never actually said no.

312
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,347
Did you, Becky?

313
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:48,228
And right there, you just
sucked in your cheek,

314
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,773
Which means you were trying to wipe away
an obvious emotion.

315
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,303
Ronnie's the only friend we have.

316
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,570
Jeff never came back from the war.

317
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:00,074
He grabs his knife,
and he vanishes at night,

318
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,158
And the only person
I can call is Ronnie.

319
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,578
So there's nothing more
than that between you two?

320
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:10,684
No. There's not.

321
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:13,997
Not yet.

322
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:16,965
Problem. Jeff's gone.

323
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:20,552
Go to my house and see Ronnie...

324
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,179
Like I have to all the time.

325
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,564
- You going somewhere, Ronnie?
- One-eyed night at the ice rink.

326
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,498
- Who's asking?
- I'm Dr. Foster.

327
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,527
This is Dr. Lightman.
We're looking for your friend Jeff.

328
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,642
You look a little nervous.

329
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,741
Mind you, I would be, too, if I was
bashing another man's son around.

330
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:47,354
Jake says you hit him.

331
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,121
He's a kid.
It's been a rough 6 months.

332
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,616
I'd never layed a hand on Jake.

333
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,560
Are you sleeping with
your friend's wife?

334
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,972
I'll take that as a "not yet."

335
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:02,218
Mind you, I've seen her.
I mean, you know, she is tasty.

336
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:03,968
I feel your pain.

337
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:05,874
The man saved my life.

338
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,410
I'm not going near his wife.
End of story.

339
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,853
OK, I'll buy that.

340
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:14,772
I got his back, all right?
It's all good.

341
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,234
Hot date at the ice rink, Ronnie?

342
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:24,762
Jeff was here.
I'm going to go find him.

343
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,801
All right.
All right.

344
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:30,038
Becky says
he goes walkabout at night.

345
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:33,333
To the veterans cemetery.
See some friends.

346
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,066
5 months ago,

347
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:38,502
In Iraq,

348
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,289
You busted through a red door

349
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,093
with your squad.
What happened at the other side?

350
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:46,226
Well, I took the hit pretty quick.

351
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:49,348
You're going to have to
ask Jeff, or the captain.

352
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:51,684
You don't like the captain.

353
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,186
He's a good officer.

354
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,356
What about Jeff?
How does he feel about the captain?

355
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:00,303
Not much?

356
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,113
What else are you hiding from us?

357
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,468
My gun's missing.

358
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:12,664
You don't take a gun
to a cemetery, do you?

359
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,114
Captain Renshaw.

360
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,802
Dr. Lightman.
Dr. Foster.

361
00:22:26,602 --> 00:22:28,888
Your man Turley's
on the loose with a gun.

362
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:30,571
Really?

363
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,934
- We thought he might come see you.
- Why?

364
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,894
That was going to be
our next question.

365
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:37,355
He's not here.

366
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:40,694
Can we do this in the morning?

367
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,236
I actually need to get as much sleep
as I can before we ship out.

368
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:47,198
- I'm sorry we bothered you.
- We thought we would just let you know.

369
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:50,373
I appreciate that.

370
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:53,204
You should get your head down,
get some sleep.

371
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,580
I will do my best.

372
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:56,258
Good night.

373
00:22:58,381 --> 00:22:59,518
He's in there.

374
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,721
That doesn't look like a man
reaching for a drink.

375
00:23:42,846 --> 00:23:45,110
That looks like a man
who knows how to fight dirty.

376
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:46,985
It takes one to know one.

377
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,581
I'm going to go stall him
at the front door.

378
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:51,637
That's a good idea.

379
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:12,366
Hi. Captain Renshaw.
Just one more thing.

380
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:18,039
Dr. Foster, I did tell you
that we're shipping out tomorrow.

381
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,593
I was planning on going to bed.

382
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:22,469
What is so important that you need to
talk to me in the middle of the night?

383
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,367
Look, we think that Jeff
is under the impression

384
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:28,529
that he has unfinished
business with you

385
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:30,244
about the war.

386
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:32,572
I nominated him for a silver star.

387
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,681
Getting it pinned on him
is our only unfinished business.

388
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,116
We know that he is an honorable man.

389
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:40,986
He's a hero.

390
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:43,475
And we also know
that those are words

391
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,817
that he would never use
to describe himself.

392
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,735
Sounds like sergeant Turley to me.

393
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:51,531
Can I come in?

394
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,456
Put the gun down, Jeff.

395
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:01,457
You are way out of your depth.

396
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,583
Absolutely.

397
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,253
I'm coming in from your left,
and I am armed, all right?

398
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:06,838
Here I come.

399
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:08,804
Right, see?
There it is.

400
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:13,886
Why do this?

401
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,980
Why do this?

402
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:18,698
Ask him.

403
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,935
He knows. Don't you?

404
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:23,437
Why don't you enlighten me,
sergeant?

405
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,817
Did you come here to kill the captain,
or just talk about killing him?

406
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:35,572
Give him the gun.

407
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,999
Come on. Give it to him.
Give it to him!

408
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,310
He wants to kill me,

409
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,042
he can go ahead and do it himself.

410
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,086
You want to kill me?

411
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,463
Do it.

412
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:51,883
You need help, sergeant.

413
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,093
Why does the captain
want to kill you?

414
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,786
Because you deserve it?

415
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,350
Or think you do?

416
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:03,811
You're trying to kill
yourself here, aren't you?

417
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,607
It's a bit different
with the gun in my hand.

418
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:15,698
- I let everybody down.
- You didn't do any such thing.

419
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,912
When you got shot up in that humvee,
it was on fire. You were afraid.

420
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,583
But in my book, bravery is what
you do in spite of fear, son.

421
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:32,438
You know what?
Sod this, all right?

422
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,383
I mean, really.

423
00:26:36,568 --> 00:26:38,500
What happened behind the red door?

424
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,935
What happens over there
stays over there.

425
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,017
Really?

426
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,728
Not for him, clearly.

427
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,772
It doesn't do him or anyone else
any good to keep going over it.

428
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,940
Anyone else?

429
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,026
You got someone particular
in mind, have you?

430
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:53,816
Look at him.

431
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:56,697
You think this is helping?

432
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,245
Enough.
He doesn't have a gun.

433
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,789
And even if I did,
I don't want to kill you.

434
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:08,251
Put the gun down.

435
00:27:17,655 --> 00:27:18,755
Here I come.

436
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:24,767
Here.

437
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,912
So you're outside the humvee, right?

438
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,874
Now what?

439
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,540
I'm okay. Ronnie, me
and the captain were the assault team.

440
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:56,445
The rest of the convoy
is pinned down.

441
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:01,721
Look, let's skip ahead
to the bit with the red door.

442
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,323
The insurgents are in there.

443
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,058
So, you go through the red door,
you're going to save the convoy, right?

444
00:28:09,673 --> 00:28:10,723
Kick it in.

445
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,028
Kick it in.
Come on, Jeff.

446
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,369
Come on, kick it in. Go on, I dare you.
Kick it in, kick it in.

447
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:32,793
- I can't. I can't go in there.
- It's just a bloody video game, Jeff.

448
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,618
- It's safe as anything.
- I can't.

449
00:28:34,743 --> 00:28:36,922
- Why not, Jeff?
- My son is in there!

450
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:46,643
Right.

451
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,786
Your son is 9 years old.

452
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,101
Right? Right?

453
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:55,441
So he's not in this war.

454
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,625
No, he's not.

455
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:02,615
So kick the door down.

456
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:08,829
Kick the door down.

457
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:12,174
I can't.

458
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,294
Well, then your story
is a load of bullocks.

459
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,590
You're running out of options.
You either kick the door down

460
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:22,009
Or you're raising your kid
from the looney bin!

461
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:28,810
Right, in you come.

462
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,560
Faster, come on.

463
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,440
Ronnie banks left,
takes out a sniper.

464
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,044
I went right, captain goes high.

465
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,036
There was a car,
I took some cover behind it.

466
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:44,407
You're afraid. That's good,
'cause that means you're there.

467
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,827
- React to contact. We train for.
- You were taking sniper fire.

468
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,622
I return fire with my M-4,
Pop off a 40 millimeter grenade round.

469
00:29:58,017 --> 00:29:59,017
Carry on.

470
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:02,743
We move forward through the market,
I'm on point.

471
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,349
I take a turn,

472
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,817
and there was...

473
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:14,603
There was resistance.

474
00:30:15,318 --> 00:30:16,407
Resistance?

475
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:18,565
I saw a combatant.

476
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:24,405
There's a combatant?

477
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,699
A combatant?
He's not an enemy this time.

478
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,284
He's making a distinction.

479
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,416
But he came out of nowhere!
He came out of the archway.

480
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,517
It's a kid.

481
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,212
I was looking right down
the barrel of his gun.

482
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,797
Up like that?

483
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:48,994
He was 10 years old.

484
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,016
That's about the same age
as your son.

485
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:55,751
What'd you do?

486
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,029
Did you kill him?

487
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:16,582
They train you for everything,
they don't train you for that.

488
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:24,066
What you just told me...

489
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:25,966
was a lie.

490
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:28,614
What are you talkin' about?

491
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:31,783
What are you talkin' about? I told you!
We came through the market,

492
00:31:31,908 --> 00:31:34,600
I turned left, he came out of nowhere
and I returned fire!

493
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,812
All right, fair enough.

494
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:39,831
But...

495
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,400
why does that make the captain
want to kill you?

496
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:50,491
I don't know.

497
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,696
I don't know.
Maybe he doesn't.

498
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,750
Maybe I am nuts.
I'm just...

499
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,079
I'm telling you everything I know.

500
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:01,794
Something definitely happened
that day.

501
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,614
If you can't tell me what it was,

502
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,135
I'll have to get it
out of the captain.

503
00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:18,796
All right, Jeff lost it in Zirmaya.

504
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:22,772
And since that place has been
completely blown off the map,

505
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:24,865
this'll have to do.

506
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:27,793
I thought the point of therapy
was to put the day behind him.

507
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:29,976
What, you're a psychiatrist
in your spare time?

508
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,726
Neither am I.
She is, however.

509
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:36,209
Turley's gotten worse
since you've been in his life.

510
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,497
I have to agree.
He's completely unstable.

511
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:42,066
- Lightman has that effect on people.
- Try being her.

512
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,717
You said you'd take a bullet for Jeff,
didn't you, captain?

513
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,760
Anything for one of my men.

514
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,429
All right.

515
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,639
Let's put that to the test.

516
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:04,898
So you come through the red door.

517
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:09,445
Then what?

518
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,663
I go to the right with Renshaw.

519
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,658
I head left, take out the sniper,
Upper window.

520
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:19,264
Captain?

521
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,332
You're awfully quiet.

522
00:33:21,922 --> 00:33:25,172
I laid down suppressive fire
to cover the upper floor.

523
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,047
Then what?

524
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,998
I cleared through the market.

525
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,830
One more enemy K.I.A. At the end.

526
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,353
And that's when the kid
came through with the a. K.

527
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,397
Right here?

528
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,318
Right. Gillian. Be the kid.

529
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,570
Go on.

530
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:56,367
Heels off, make yourself shorter.
You know, shouldn't be too difficult.

531
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:00,588
OK, so you see the kid.

532
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:04,435
- Then what happens, Jeff?
- I killed him.

533
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,716
You killed him?

534
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,161
Is that before or after

535
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,055
Ronnie becomes a cyclops?

536
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,538
I got shot. I don't know.

537
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:27,208
But you would remember If Jeff's gun
went off before you got shot.

538
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,233
I heard a lot of shots that day.

539
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:30,442
No, no, no.

540
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:32,444
I froze.

541
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:34,947
I froze.

542
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,070
I didn't kill the kid.
I froze.

543
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:44,957
I froze.

544
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:54,883
I should have fired, but I didn't.

545
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,430
Is that because it was a kid?

546
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:19,661
Ronnie!

547
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:23,239
All right, Foster,

548
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:25,416
Point at Ronnie.

549
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:29,482
Go on.

550
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:33,741
Well, say, "bang."

551
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,881
Bang.

552
00:35:35,492 --> 00:35:38,792
All right, brilliant.
All right, Ronnie, on the ground.

553
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:43,777
Jeff.

554
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:45,726
What then?

555
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:48,701
Uh... I went to him.

556
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,147
Ronnie!

557
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,815
I covered them.

558
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,854
In the report,

559
00:35:57,513 --> 00:35:59,948
It doesn't say anything
about Jeff freezing.

560
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,935
You wrote the report up, captain.

561
00:36:04,323 --> 00:36:06,163
Why'd you leave that out?

562
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:13,712
His best friend got hurt as a
direct result of his inaction.

563
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:16,815
- You see that, right?
- Defensive posture.

564
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,135
Yeah. Defensive of...
Yourself?

565
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:24,139
I saw something.

566
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,557
- The kid?
- No, no, no.

567
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,343
The kid ran away.

568
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,486
Right, so the kid legs it, right?

569
00:36:33,044 --> 00:36:34,233
And then,

570
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:37,463
What? You saw something else?

571
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:40,579
I saw someone else.

572
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,784
You saw "someone" else?

573
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,204
Who'd you see, Jeff?

574
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,249
Who came through here?

575
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Ronnie!

576
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,934
Oh, my eye!

577
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:16,756
Get him up!

578
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:20,237
Friendly fire.

579
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:22,915
Your report was fiction, captain.

580
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:25,878
You killed one of your own men.
Game over.

581
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:28,857
He was from another company.

582
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:31,748
Got cut off from his squad.

583
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:36,855
Sorrow?

584
00:37:37,897 --> 00:37:38,797
Remorse?

585
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:40,641
It was an accident.

586
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,176
Your senior officer

587
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,346
Had you lie about friendly fire.

588
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,350
He had to, if he was going to keep it
out of the report.

589
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,730
Sergeant here is an unstable man.
History of mental problems.

590
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,107
Oh, yeah, yeah,
he's absolutely crackers,

591
00:37:57,698 --> 00:37:59,647
But one minute later,

592
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,696
Zirmaya gets blown off the map,

593
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:04,144
Right?

594
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,191
Who called in the air strike?

595
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:08,835
Captain?

596
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:10,922
I wonder.

597
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:13,832
Renshaw, he asked you a question.

598
00:38:16,132 --> 00:38:17,809
When I picked up Ronnie and ran...

599
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:20,326
- Come here, man. Come here.
- Up, up!

600
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:23,091
Unh! Come on, come on, come on!

601
00:38:23,496 --> 00:38:25,218
I could hear a warthog above us.

602
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,321
And Renshaw was calling
in an air strike.

603
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:33,101
Cobra seven, this is bulldog six.
You are cleared hot!

604
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,742
Friendly fire isn't a crime.

605
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,093
But covering up friendly
fire with an air strike...

606
00:38:51,218 --> 00:38:52,037
That...

607
00:38:52,352 --> 00:38:53,872
That's a war crime.

608
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:56,792
You know how many people
died in that air strike?

609
00:38:59,654 --> 00:39:01,088
You see that?

610
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:02,641
That...

611
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:05,518
Is what your mind couldn't handle.

612
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:37,124
All right.

613
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:40,106
So this is our friendly
fire victim, eh?

614
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:42,638
I wanted to honor him somehow.

615
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:46,174
Well, you've done that.

616
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,500
Saved Ronnie's life,
got a silver star.

617
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,763
Well done, mate.

618
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:54,778
Got something better last night.

619
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:58,053
- Oh, yeah?
- A good night's sleep.

620
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,772
Oh, 'cause I was thinking,
you know, the other.

621
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,325
Mind's in the gutter.

622
00:40:08,554 --> 00:40:10,073
Thanks for helping my dad.

623
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:12,422
No worries.

624
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:31,261
- Comfortable, Dr. Lightman?
- Does it matter?

625
00:40:33,658 --> 00:40:36,308
You want me to run the
whole battery of scans?

626
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,226
Yeah, the usual suspects.

627
00:41:03,905 --> 00:41:06,405
Have you finished
checking my homework?

628
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:10,917
I'm nearly done.
Yeah, look at this.

629
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,692
You're gonna like this.

630
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,846
Yeah. Check that out.

631
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:17,808
Take a look at this.
What do you see?

632
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:20,143
Uh, wrinkles.

633
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,811
Like... like one of those dogs
with the scrunched-up faces.

634
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,282
Like a shar pei.

635
00:41:25,852 --> 00:41:27,150
Brains are ugly.

636
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:29,404
That's my brain, that is.

637
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,531
Well, you have
a very handsome brain.

638
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,550
Thank you very much.

639
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:37,145
OK, you see this area here?

640
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,229
That is supposed to be love.

641
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:43,183
Aww, when you look
at a picture of me?

642
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:47,243
All right, now see what this says.

643
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,606
- Fight or flight?
- A picture of mom triggered that.

644
00:41:51,731 --> 00:41:54,409
- Yeah, so flight, mostly.
- You're making that up.

645
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:56,622
No, look at me, read my face.

646
00:41:57,884 --> 00:41:59,015
Huh? There.

647
00:41:59,903 --> 00:42:01,153
OK, now Foster.

648
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:03,687
Whoa, fourth of July.

649
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,523
Oh, yeah? Shepherd's pie.
All right. Here.

650
00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:11,444
That's your granddad, that is.

651
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,822
- And this you?
- Yep.

652
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,292
He was a soldier.

653
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,067
You never told me that.

654
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:18,618
You never asked.

655
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:21,516
He didn't talk about it much.

656
00:42:22,437 --> 00:42:25,603
- You know, I'm curious about him.
- Yeah. Me, too.

657
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,215
But you never asked him
about the war?

658
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,922
No, it was a matter of respect,

659
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,397
Really, you know?

660
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,552
I mean, he came out of the war,

661
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:36,052
And he went straight back to work
In the rail yard.

662
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,260
He put me through college,
so that was that.

663
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:41,141
I'd like to meet him someday.

664
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:44,264
Well, one day, eh?
