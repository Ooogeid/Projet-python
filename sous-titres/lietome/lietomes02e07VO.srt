1
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:15,559
<i>It's black Friday,
the post-Thanksgiving kick-off</i>

2
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:17,463
into the holiday shopping season.

3
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:21,274
And retailers are advertising
even deeper discounts this year,

4
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:24,273
trying to lure
cash-strapped consumers.

5
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:26,705
All managers to their departments.

6
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,596
<i>All right,
who wants to save some money?</i>

7
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,695
Doors opening in 5 minutes.

8
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,503
- Where is it?
- Maybe it's in the car?

9
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,446
I swear, my wallet was in my jacket.

10
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:47,601
Save our place.

11
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:51,020
Excuse me.

12
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:52,968
Pardon me.

13
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:02,075
<i>All right, when I say "digital,"</i>

14
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:04,178
<i>you say "recorder."</i>

15
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,898
- Digital!
- Recorder!

16
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:15,495
For an extra 100,
how can we not go with the 50 inch?

17
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:20,062
How about an "excuse me," bitch?

18
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,508
Open the doors!

19
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:41,267
Open the doors, dammit!

20
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,782
Did calculus get harder
since we took it?

21
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:16,049
That's what I said.

22
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,054
That's all right,
I'll just figure it out myself.

23
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,476
I mean, you'd think with the
intellectual stock I come from, though.

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,741
Apples always fall further
from the tree than you think.

25
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:27,785
- There's something to be grateful for?
- How was Thanksgiving?

26
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:30,858
- You know, dad lectured...
- I did not lecture.

27
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,610
- Mom fretted.
- I didn't lecture.

28
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:34,559
So much to be thankful for.

29
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:39,602
Don't you think I'm getting a little old
for make-believe family holidays?

30
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:41,349
That's how your mom likes it, love.

31
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,114
- You're a little odd.
- Why?

32
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:46,462
The apron.

33
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,735
I think it's becoming.

34
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:53,646
This is Max Roland.

35
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:57,051
Apparently he's 16
and a big fan of your book.

36
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:58,844
Over here.

37
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:00,172
You should no bell.

38
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,481
My address isn't listed.

39
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:04,810
- How'd you find me?
- Online.

40
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,311
- I just need half an hour of your time.
- You got 2 minutes.

41
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,227
My parents have lied to me
my whole life about who I am.

42
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,983
- I'm not their kid.
- Who are you?

43
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,464
This kid.

44
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,404
- James Knox.
- The James Knox?

45
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,699
- How do you know you're him?
- Look.

46
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,704
- James Knox has one just like it.
- Like everybody. You want to see mine?

47
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:30,626
I took a DNA sample from my parents.
All right, I'm not a match.

48
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:33,754
Their story of how I was born,
it doesn't make sense.

49
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:37,633
I can't spend another Christmas
with people who might have stolen me.

50
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:38,910
Please.

51
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:40,812
I have $500.

52
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:42,787
This is all I have to pay you.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Will you do it?

54
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,156
I have to know the truth.

55
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:56,232
Want a sandwich?

56
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:02,061
If he really is James Knox, he's in
a very difficult spot, psychologically.

57
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:03,941
We need to handle this carefully.

58
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:05,983
Well, don't we always?

59
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:10,304
- I can't believe you took his money.
- He wanted me to take him seriously.

60
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,774
I am.

61
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,703
Who holds interviews
on a holiday weekend?

62
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:18,204
Look, Max really wants this.
Be patient.

63
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,885
Ready? They're getting antsy.

64
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:24,830
- I'm not gonna interview, you are.
- You said you were gonna help me.

65
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:29,226
If you want the truth, you ask the
questions. So, no "yes or no" phrasing.

66
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,851
And look at me.
Look at me.

67
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:33,147
- Don't back down.
- Max, you don't have to do this.

68
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,609
It said in your book, the best
interrogations are when you can watch.

69
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:38,747
I want the best.

70
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,714
That's what you paid for.

71
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:49,656
It'll just be a few more minutes.
They're with some of the other nominees.

72
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,462
You look nervous.
What's wrong?

73
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,215
I'm not your son.
Who am I?

74
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:02,106
This again?

75
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:03,469
Not here.

76
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:06,764
There's no pictures of me as a newborn.
It doesn't make any sense.

77
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:10,809
You were born in Ecuador. Mom had you
premature. We've told you all this.

78
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:12,958
You went to Ecuador pregnant?

79
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,230
Sorry, but that doesn't
seem really smart.

80
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,563
I think I know better than you
what a mother would and wouldn't do.

81
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:21,008
He said "mom," she said "mother."
Distancing language.

82
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,405
I ordered a DNA test online.

83
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,324
I took hairs from your brushes.

84
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,356
I just got the results back.

85
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:29,203
I'm not related to you.

86
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,039
Nice fear on them.

87
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,004
Max, what the hell is going on?

88
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,296
What is this?

89
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,064
Mr. and Mrs. Roland, I'm Dr. Foster.
I'm a psychologist in Lightman Group.

90
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:47,171
- What is this place?
- Max came to us.

91
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:49,008
- He needs our help.
- We're leaving.

92
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,858
They're lying, right?
They're lying.

93
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,455
Max, we're going.

94
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,236
We may have sent him home
with his abductors.

95
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,704
- Where's Reynolds?
- Still in South Carolina.

96
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,405
Well, that's one problem solved.

97
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:09,074
- The cops...
- We can't call them.

98
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:12,571
If the cops, press or FBI get wind that
someone who may be James Knox surfaced,

99
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:14,882
I mean, the vultures
will pick Max to pieces.

100
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,751
We have to protect him.
And we have to talk to the Knoxes.

101
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:21,296
- What?
- Finally got you being like a criminal.

102
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:24,460
- Wonders will never cease.
- If this thing goes south,

103
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:25,937
you're putting up my bail.

104
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,353
Michigan 2005.

105
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:32,975
Shoppers burst through the doors
of a retail chain causing injuries.

106
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:34,698
India 2008.

107
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,708
Rumors of a landslide
at a Hindu temple cause panic.

108
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,341
About 140 people lose their lives
trying to escape.

109
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:44,945
Los Angeles. Lakers fans celebrate
a championship by looting and rioting.

110
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:48,185
About a million dollars worth
of property damage to local businesses.

111
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:51,796
In every example, the violence was
instigated by someone in the crowd.

112
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,787
What are you proposing?

113
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,343
2 of your customers died.

114
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:56,906
Dozens were injured.

115
00:06:56,989 --> 00:07:00,269
People are looking for a scapegoat,
and digital corner's an easy target.

116
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,338
What if I could prove
your company wasn't at fault?

117
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,716
Cases like this turn
on comparative negligence.

118
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,392
If the stampede was crowd induced,

119
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:10,846
it would reduce
the settlement considerably.

120
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,766
This is the raw feed from Channel 3.

121
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,877
Notice the dad showing his boys
how to lock arms and form a phalanx.

122
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:23,778
What, they expected violence?

123
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,238
Convergence theory says
that if crowds act aggressively,

124
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,198
it's because people bring
an aggressive mindset to it.

125
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,033
In the close-ups, you can see faces.

126
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:34,669
They're identical to those
of athletes during competition.

127
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,495
This crowd was a powder keg
and somebody in it was the spark.

128
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:40,654
Maybe so, but we can't have our name

129
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:43,334
dragged through the press
during our busy shopping season.

130
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,256
- We're planning on settling Monday.
- How much are you expecting to pay out?

131
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:48,133
20 million, give or take.

132
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,853
Give me a few days to prove
my thesis before you settle.

133
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,825
If I can trace the stampede
to somebody in the crowd,

134
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,641
we get 10% of what you save.

135
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,452
You save us 10 million,
you earn one.

136
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,813
If you pay the full 20,
we don't see a dime.

137
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:08,083
- How'd it go with the suits?
- Well, we got the job. Where were you?

138
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,669
None of your bloody business.

139
00:08:10,178 --> 00:08:11,726
I figured you were up to it, so.

140
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:13,973
It's probably a gross overestimation
on my part.

141
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,731
I appreciate the confidence boost.

142
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,546
Well, selling's the easy part.

143
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,874
It's delivering, that's the trick.
That's what you promised.

144
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,906
So you and Torres are on your own.
Think you're up for it?

145
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:26,280
I've read every major study
on group behavior cover to cover.

146
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:27,618
This is my wheelhouse.

147
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,330
Fascinating.

148
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:32,783
Time will tell.

149
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:36,414
- Any more words or inspiration?
- Yeah. We need the money.

150
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,440
And don't embarrass me.

151
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,406
You found James?

152
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,832
After all these years?

153
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,401
We don't want you
to get your hopes up but

154
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,545
we would like to do a DNA test

155
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:52,614
just to confirm things
one way or another.

156
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,533
The scar could match?

157
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,077
Do you have a picture?

158
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:00,980
Sorry.

159
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,710
It was taken this morning.

160
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:08,016
He's got your chin.

161
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,343
This must be overwhelming.

162
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,264
No, it's just I'm... I'm shocked
that we might be able to find James.

163
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:21,894
I got a question for you.
Do you, either of you,

164
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,161
do you remember,
was it overcast the day that your...

165
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,999
son was abducted?
Do you remember?

166
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:31,186
- It's 16 years ago.
- I think it was overcast.

167
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,836
- It definitely was.
- It was?

168
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:36,827
I think you're lying.

169
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,805
When people are telling the truth,

170
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:44,955
they don't feel the need
to recall small details

171
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:46,251
many years later.

172
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,671
You're ashamed of something.
What are you ashamed of?

173
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,038
- What are you talking about?
- What is it? Is your son still alive?

174
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:55,028
What happened to James, Mrs. Knox?

175
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,386
Or did you murder him?

176
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,222
- Of course not.
- Did you murder him?

177
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,934
- Did you kill him?
- What is wrong with you? She didn't.

178
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,144
Did you kill him?
Did you kill your son?

179
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,521
Did you torture him?
Did you make him suffer?

180
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,232
No, it was an accident!

181
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:10,067
What?

182
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:20,560
I...

183
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,743
went into the kitchen

184
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:28,298
while the bath was running.

185
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,393
I don't know how.

186
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:34,675
He had drowned.

187
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:39,952
I was going right back.

188
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:47,476
I didn't mean to.

189
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,417
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

190
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:57,851
I didn't want you to hate me.

191
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:04,085
- Maybe they're lying.
- They're talking to the police now.

192
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,272
If I'm not James Knox...

193
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:08,983
Who am I?

194
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,359
You're the same person you were
yesterday and the day before, Max.

195
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:14,612
Don't call me that, all right.
I'm someone else.

196
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:17,387
Well, what do you want
to be called, then?

197
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,645
Who do you want to be?
You want to be Johnny?

198
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:23,756
You want to be a Paul? Do you want
to be a Steve? You want to be a Sid?

199
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:26,965
You know,
you look like a Steve to me.

200
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:32,760
All of these are boys

201
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:36,104
around your age that were abducted
when they were babies or

202
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,243
when they were kids.

203
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,407
Which one is you?

204
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:44,226
I'm never gonna find out who I am.
Right, that's what you're trying to say?

205
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,705
No, you know,
you're a crap listener, boysie.

206
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:50,818
Really, pay attention, right.
What I'm saying is I'm in.

207
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,240
Are you?

208
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:56,413
Think before you answer, because
if we do go down this rabbit hole,

209
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,550
there's no telling
what's gonna bite you.

210
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:07,066
I'm in.

211
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,831
He's in.

212
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:15,313
Max, you have to let this go.

213
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,972
He's not gonna.

214
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,223
I mean, why should he?

215
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,127
If he's not your son,

216
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:23,533
he should know
why you've kept it from him.

217
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:26,038
I mean, either you've got
a good reason or you're

218
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:27,704
monsters

219
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:29,873
who stole someone else's baby.

220
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,500
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

221
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:33,168
Cops'll believe this?

222
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:36,771
I know you both love Max deeply

223
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:39,869
and you would never want
to hurt him.

224
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,929
But you are. He's in a lot of pain.

225
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,599
You're not protecting him anymore.

226
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,736
You're just hurting him.

227
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:04,753
Her name was Cheyenne.

228
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:08,375
She was barely older than you are.

229
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,290
It can cost a fortune to adopt.

230
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:14,418
And back then,

231
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,036
we didn't have the money
to pay for a service.

232
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,937
She didn't want any formal papers.

233
00:13:19,021 --> 00:13:22,300
She just wanted out.
And we wanted a baby.

234
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,237
We gave her some money for
the hospital bills and that was it.

235
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,311
You were her baby,

236
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,219
but your our son.

237
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:36,648
Maxie, what ? We've been good
parents to you, haven't we?

238
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,985
Say what's on your mind, son.

239
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:42,112
Why didn't you tell me?

240
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:46,054
We thought if anyone learned the truth,

241
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,702
They'd take him
away from you.

242
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:52,863
Who is she ?

243
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,250
My mother.

244
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:00,630
Is this all of them?

245
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,692
These are the lead plaintiffs.
There's another 80 names on the suit,

246
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,725
but these are the real bloodsuckers.

247
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,409
Or the real victims.

248
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:12,579
- Why are they even talking to us ?
- Digital corner sold it to their lawyer

249
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:14,300
as part of the investigation.

250
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:16,965
Well, let's be honest, who doesn't
enjoy a good bitch session?

251
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:20,770
<i>Gards shoving us and everything
I can't lost his elbow. I needed it</i>

252
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:22,948
Did you know that the doors
opened 20 min late ?

253
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,760
They didn't even have my tv in stock.
It was a bait and switch.

254
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:28,783
- I was almost trampled to death.
- Listen, we need to get paid.

255
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,922
Ok, it's our job to determine
what started everything.

256
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,501
That's what we've been asking. The store
hasn't turned over any security video.

257
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:39,678
Let's just begin with
what you remember.

258
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:42,358
One of the rent-a-cops picked a fight.
It was right behind me.

259
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,284
I saw him pushing
folks around like cattle.

260
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,224
He was a bully.
Damn near knocked me over.

261
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:50,292
All right, so this guard starts a brawl,
and then everyone pushes for the door?

262
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,096
Can you describe him?

263
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,897
White guy, shaved head.

264
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,208
You all just shifted
your gaze to this guy.

265
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:00,690
- You're looking to him for the answer.
- You think we're lying ?

266
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,110
Well, not consciously. It's more likely
a case of memory conformity.

267
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,710
You've all heard each other's story,
so you think it happened to you.

268
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:09,658
But you didn't remember the race
of the guard because you never saw him.

269
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,576
So you go to the real source.

270
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:15,163
I'll be supervising these interviews.

271
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:21,788
Waylon said he was shopping for family.
Eye shift downward says otherwise.

272
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:25,257
Educated guess, he was there
for someone else, like his mistress.

273
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:29,877
Oh, and he is not your only client
with a truthfulness allergy.

274
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:32,765
Delisha faked anger when Rita
asked her about her arm.

275
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,722
Her eyebrows never pulled together,
lips never pressed or tightened.

276
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:37,017
She's faking it.

277
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,520
That doesn't excuse the store
or the security guard.

278
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,273
Oh, the bully? No, that wasn't a lie.

279
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,899
As far as we can tell.

280
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:46,241
Just because a few people
are gaming the system

281
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,762
doesn't mean
Digital Corner's off the hook.

282
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,431
What are you doing
in the DMV database?

283
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,377
Your dad is committing a felony.

284
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:20,770
Why am I not surprised?

285
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,719
I'd take you with me, but that would
make you an accessory after the fact.

286
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:33,472
Feel free.

287
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,290
I can't believe you found me.

288
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,892
He's been looking for me?

289
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:43,970
Oh, yeah, for a long time now.

290
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:45,626
Yeah, he just wants to meet you.

291
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,591
- He's here?
- Yep.

292
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,380
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
You did the right thing by him.

293
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:00,310
I want meet him.

294
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:07,067
Maxie boy.

295
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:09,857
You're up.

296
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:13,287
Max, this is Cheyenne Matson.

297
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,826
Oh, my God.

298
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:20,205
I knew I'd see you again someday.

299
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:24,261
- I just knew it.
- I found you.

300
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:30,237
- I can't believe it.
- Oh. Oh, my baby.

301
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,975
- Max.
- What?

302
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:43,478
Stop hugging her, son.

303
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,396
Why?

304
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,607
'Cause she's lying.
She's not your mother.

305
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:01,002
You don't know
what you're talking about.

306
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:03,393
I gave birth to him in Virginia.

307
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,417
- And then I ...
- See, that's a lie.

308
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:09,295
What are you gonna do, you just gonna
keep them coming, or are you done now ?

309
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,772
Have you been drinking today?

310
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:15,957
No, I don't think it's alcohol.

311
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,631
I think it's drugs.

312
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:20,640
So what was your drug of choice
back in the day. Was it "X" ?

313
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,589
Meth ?

314
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,393
Coke ?

315
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:25,977
- There it is, cocaine.
- What did you do ?

316
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:28,314
Did you sell him for drugs ?
How did you get him ?

317
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,819
I was on the pipe back then.

318
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:35,364
I got close with my dealer.
He had this ...

319
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:37,385
crash pad in D.C.

320
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,341
And I got there and there was this baby.

321
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,563
- Who's baby?
- I don't know. I don't know.

322
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,922
He was crashing.
And he said he was gonna smother him,

323
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,544
so I took the baby.

324
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,297
You kidnapped him ?
You were trying to protect him ?

325
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,791
I saw this ad.

326
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:58,887
These people wanted a baby,
so I said I was his mother.

327
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,962
What was the name of your
drug dealer back in the day?

328
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:04,101
I only remember him as Romeo.

329
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:08,022
It was a long time ago.

330
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:15,380
Of course Max says he's fine.
He's a 16-year-old boy.

331
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:17,987
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you
have to coddle him, does it ?

332
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:21,596
A hard truth in the long run
is far better for you than a soft lie.

333
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,404
- We are talking about a child.
- And what child are we talking about ?

334
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:27,276
Foster here disapproves

335
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,957
my parenting techniques, which I think
is a bit of a cheek, don't you ?

336
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,991
So you're not actually talking about,
let's say, an adolescent boy ?

337
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,759
Should we be? You?

338
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,388
Then maybe you two
can explain something to me.

339
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,951
- I'll do my level best.
- Try to picture this.

340
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:47,310
I'm in Hilton Head, eighth hole,
2 under par, best game of my life.

341
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,671
Then all of a sudden I get this call
from my FBI supervisor

342
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:54,114
wondering if my interest in
16-year-old boys is business

343
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:56,149
or purely recreational.

344
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,371
And which is it?

345
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:00,822
Well, see, that's what I'm hoping
that you can help me with.

346
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,909
Because it seems like
somebody here in D.C.

347
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,370
used my personal
id number and password

348
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,273
to access an FBI database.

349
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,894
But when I'm not actually in D.C.,

350
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:13,345
That sets off alarms,
so can either of you tell me

351
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:16,673
who I should blame
for ruining my vacation?

352
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,552
Sorry, I just... I heard what happened.

353
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,040
Is there anything I can do?

354
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:43,449
You could stop looking at me like you
think I'm a freak or screw-up.

355
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:46,593
I don't think you're screwed up,
I think ...

356
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:49,289
your family is.
There's a big difference.

357
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:53,376
Perfect girl with the perfect life's
some expert on messed up families now ?

358
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:56,544
My dad's a human lie detector.

359
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:59,049
I have a family history of suicide,

360
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:03,109
and my divorced parents sleep
together sporadically, fight ...

361
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:06,854
constantly, and still insist
we get together on holidays.

362
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:08,706
How's that for perfect?

363
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,894
At least you know
who your parents are.

364
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:16,349
Anything I can do to help.

365
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,865
I promise,

366
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,356
one freak to another.

367
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,175
You know, I go away for one weekend,

368
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:30,955
and you two start acting
like Bonnie and Klyde.

369
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,449
You're doing Christmas with me.

370
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,719
No one needed to convince me
that bringing the authorities

371
00:21:34,803 --> 00:21:36,228
into this case was a bad idea.

372
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:38,891
If you had come talked to me first,
I could helped avoid all of this.

373
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:40,504
Any chance that can happen now ?

374
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:43,720
Because of what these people did,
a kidnapper got away abducting a baby.

375
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,785
Mr. and Mrs. Roland.

376
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,924
Are you here about Max ?
Have you seen him ?

377
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:50,224
- No, what happened?
- He left a note. He ran away.

378
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:54,898
We have a warrant for your arrests.
You're Being charged with false adoption

379
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,669
and child endangerment.
Come on, let's go.

380
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,660
So, bottom line,
they're saying we provoked it,

381
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,079
but they don't have anything concrete.

382
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,632
Just firsthand accounts.

383
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:14,749
Well, the news footage
didn't show anything.

384
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:19,170
Your security guards, they mention
anything about bullying your customers ?

385
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:22,655
Look. People resent authority.

386
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:25,762
I get it. My dad was a cop.

387
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:28,888
Mr. Bernardo, uh...

388
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:33,018
One of the things we do
is look at body language.

389
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,493
And we've found that sometimes when
people are feeling vulnerable,

390
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:38,789
they tend to cover their...

391
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:41,526
gonads.

392
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:46,489
Can you pull up that photo you showed
me last month ? You want me to do it ?

393
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,080
Churchill at Yalta...

394
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:58,112
Roosevelt and Stalin are divvying up
the world. Britain's being left out.

395
00:22:58,196 --> 00:22:59,846
The hat placement says it all.

396
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:01,727
Now...

397
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:06,300
What is it you're not telling us?

398
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:09,513
We have some security video

399
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:11,723
of the parking lot
and the storefront.

400
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,891
What does it show?

401
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,879
Things got a little heated between the
guard and some of the customers.

402
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,964
But that was 10 minutes
before the stampede.

403
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,977
That's embarrassing,
but it's not a direct cause.

404
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:24,183
You're trying to bury the evidence ?

405
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:27,661
We don't want the nightmare of
someone posting it online.

406
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:30,092
But since you signed
a non-disclosure agreement,

407
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,784
I'm happy to share it.

408
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:46,767
Cheyenne's description matches
a former drug dealer on record

409
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:48,620
who went by the name "Romeo"
like she said.

410
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:51,603
But the guy dropped off
the grid a few years ago.

411
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:52,822
All right.

412
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:58,145
- What did Reynolds say about Max?
- There's still no sign of him.

413
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:00,691
If he's on the run,

414
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:03,360
first person
I'd want to talk to is Emily.

415
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:07,445
Bad boy fixated in finding the truth...

416
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,615
She probably feels like
she's known him her whole life.

417
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:16,361
They haven't found Max yet.

418
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:20,393
Where are the cops looking for him ?

419
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:23,216
I don't know.
You got any ideas on that ?

420
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:28,216
Oh, sure. He's at the secret hideout
where all the teenage runaways go.

421
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:35,306
He's just some messed-up kid
who got screwed over.

422
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,978
- You should take that.
- Really ?

423
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,522
Thanks.

424
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:49,434
They found Max's biological parents.
They're bringing them in.

425
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:51,875
That's great.
I mean, that's great, right ?

426
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,678
Max is gone, though, and the
state he was in when he ran,

427
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:58,625
he could be about to do something
that could ruin his entire future.

428
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:00,834
I need you.

429
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,894
She knows where Max is.

430
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:17,724
Thanks for that.

431
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,763
Oh, for lying to Emily ?

432
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,482
so I wouldn't have to.

433
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:28,477
Romeo's real name is Ray Blake

434
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,950
narcotics distribution, assault,
spent 8 years in prison.

435
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:34,735
Any family who
know where to find him ?

436
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:37,618
He had a daughter, but she
died while Blake was in prison.

437
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:42,471
<i>They'll be happy to see you
no matter what...</i>

438
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:44,810
There he is.

439
00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:46,116
Thank God.

440
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,380
- Where are my real parents ?
- I didn't find them.

441
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,632
Found you, though. Thanks, Em.

442
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:58,548
Now, I would have expected this kind of
thing from him, but you lied to me.

443
00:25:59,055 --> 00:25:59,891
I know.

444
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,996
No, she did what she had to do
to help Max. He was in trouble.

445
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,630
Help him ?
You get his parents arrested, and then

446
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:07,735
you make me lie to him
to get him back here ?

447
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:10,574
- He'll be safe here.
- Till you send him off to Foster care.

448
00:26:10,572 --> 00:26:12,904
The FBI knows we have him.
We will figure this out.

449
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,822
Now who's he gonna trust?

450
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:18,242
Did you find Blake?

451
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,209
All we've got is his old parole officer.
That's it.

452
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,635
Foster, come on.

453
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:36,971
Mr. Donnelly,
you were the parole officer

454
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,197
for a convict named Ray Blake,
right?

455
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,438
In my old life.

456
00:26:41,174 --> 00:26:42,174
Ray Blake?

457
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:43,857
He was a drug peddler.

458
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:46,354
Used to go by the name of Romeo.

459
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,241
No logical reason why.

460
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,775
Do you have any idea
where we could find him now?

461
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:53,465
Creep was a gambler.

462
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:58,115
OTB in Bethesda was about the only place
I could ever count on finding him.

463
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:01,535
You seem a little angry...

464
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,034
about your past life.

465
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:05,331
What, you didn't like being
a parole officer then?

466
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:09,441
You know, my old boss sent me
to the department shrink.

467
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,252
I don't think I need another one.

468
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:13,709
How'd you end up in that chair?

469
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:17,113
That's a little personal.
Don't you think?

470
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:18,803
Very personal, I'd say.

471
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,858
I got a game to get back to.

472
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:27,763
Either you did something really bad
back then, or...

473
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,075
something really bad was done to you.
Which was it?

474
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:32,013
- That's none of your business.
- It is.

475
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:33,496
This is important.

476
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:38,126
Fine.

477
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:39,443
16 years ago,

478
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:42,059
somebody broke into my house,
killed my wife,

479
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:45,121
put a bullet in my back,
and stole our baby son.

480
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:51,894
I broke the crowd into sectors.

481
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:53,553
I followed 6 people at a time

482
00:27:53,677 --> 00:27:55,720
from the minute they showed up
till the riot started.

483
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:57,422
You find someone to pin it on?

484
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:00,075
Watch this guy.

485
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,112
He moves through the crowd.
This guy grabs him, pulls him back.

486
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:06,392
A second later,
the sectors behind him surge forward.

487
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,021
- Mob mentality takes over.
- Who do you think was in that stampede?

488
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,356
They weren't peace-loving hippies...

489
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,124
Working people, Loker.

490
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:18,289
Parents who can afford game systems
and MP3 players one day a year.

491
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:22,083
So desperate to make their kids happy,
they wake up at 4 AM to stand in line.

492
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,145
You're proving my point.
Contagion theory says

493
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:25,809
crowds infect the people in them.

494
00:28:25,892 --> 00:28:28,755
You can dress it up with science
all you want. It's still an agenda.

495
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:30,447
You're trying to impress Lightman.

496
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,669
If I bring home 7 figures,
he has to respect that.

497
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:37,047
I don't know why Lightman
screws with you the way he does

498
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,924
or why he's got it in for you.

499
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:41,058
But I wouldn't get my hopes up
about things changing.

500
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:43,141
Let's take Lightman out of it.

501
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:45,327
This video does not lie.

502
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:49,012
Let's go see the guy
and see who's right.

503
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,985
- Why were you cutting the line?
- Someone said the doors were opening.

504
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,568
Guess I got excited.

505
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:00,566
The look on your face
isn't excitement.

506
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:02,501
It's not even aggression.

507
00:29:03,203 --> 00:29:04,353
That's panic.

508
00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:07,436
You were afraid,

509
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,817
before the stampede even started.

510
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,205
My daughter...

511
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,712
I told her to stay close.
And when I heard her crying...

512
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,763
It's every parent's worst nightmare.

513
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:22,009
Then the crowd starting moving
before I could get to her.

514
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,527
- Is she OK?
- She got knocked down.

515
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,247
Her arm's broken in 3 places.

516
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,516
I don't know what we're gonna do
about her hospital bills.

517
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,934
She wasn't hurt in that stampede,
like you've claimed.

518
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,021
It happened before that, didn't it?

519
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:36,558
You think I hurt her?

520
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:40,361
But I do think
that you are an opportunist.

521
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,991
Just tell us the truth.
How did she break her arm?

522
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,575
It wasn't in the stampede, was it?

523
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:50,945
She fell.

524
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:56,585
When I heard her crying, I panicked.
I went looking for her.

525
00:29:56,994 --> 00:30:00,248
And the crowd thought
that you were breaking its first rule...

526
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:01,781
Don't cut the line.

527
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:04,552
Or they saw you moving forward
and assumed the doors're opening.

528
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,407
Either way, what they couldn't
contemplate in that state of mind

529
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,538
was a father
rushing to help his daughter.

530
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:12,273
OK, so what happened,

531
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,261
those people who died...

532
00:30:15,286 --> 00:30:16,439
it was my fault?

533
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:20,881
He turned up this week.

534
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,400
Are you saying
that you might have found my son?

535
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:28,085
Alive?

536
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,669
That was his photo.

537
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:44,891
But they cleared all my parolees.

538
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,846
- Blake fooled them, apparently.
- When was the last time you saw Blake?

539
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:53,146
Maybe a year or two before that night,
maybe more.

540
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,070
I'd given him a random drug test
that he failed.

541
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,453
That's what sent him back to prison.

542
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,752
Blake's daughter died...

543
00:31:02,835 --> 00:31:05,085
while he was serving that sentence.

544
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,531
I think he blamed you
for breaking up his family.

545
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,575
He left you to live with the pain,

546
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,911
just like he felt you did to him.

547
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:17,176
Whatever. The...

548
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:19,874
The only thing that matters now...

549
00:31:19,957 --> 00:31:23,267
is my son.
So, what, if the DNA matches,

550
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:26,425
- he'll come home?
- That's not up to us.

551
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:29,448
Well, I've waited 16 years for this.

552
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:34,771
If that's my son, I want him back.

553
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,925
I think we can put a bow
on this one.

554
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:44,896
The man in the crowd
started the stampede.

555
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:47,407
Shouldn't we find out about
Ken's daughter before the stampede?

556
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,290
Is that why we were hired?

557
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:51,441
The client's could be happy...

558
00:31:51,524 --> 00:31:53,598
They will be ecstatic.
It'll save 'em millions.

559
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,621
And it's a pretty big payday for us.

560
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,329
I think you should take
some of his windfall and have yourself

561
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:01,210
a little celebration, both of you.

562
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:02,612
Really?

563
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:07,164
As nauseating as it is for me
to say this to you, Loker...

564
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:10,553
Well done.

565
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:26,235
I got us the last table at Marcelli's,
8:00.

566
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:29,234
- We're going big.
- I'm gonna pass.

567
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:31,156
Lightman buying dinner
is unprecedented.

568
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:42,418
These families deserve to know why
their loved ones died in a parking lot.

569
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,005
We know what happened.

570
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:47,284
Some customers blindly followed
when Ken pushed forward.

571
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,259
The others didn't want to be displaced.
Either way, Ken was the stimulus.

572
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:52,886
How did his daughter break her arm?

573
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:57,958
I've been through the tapes many times,
before the stampede and after.

574
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,144
There's no evidence.

575
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,937
Then have a nice dinner.

576
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:30,495
Taxi!

577
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,990
What's that glare?

578
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:00,073
Where?

579
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,332
Right there,
that light coming off the asphalt?

580
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:05,885
What is that?

581
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:20,474
You wanna meet your father?

582
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:23,864
Here they are.

583
00:34:25,505 --> 00:34:26,505
Hey.

584
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:28,461
Max, this is your...

585
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:30,097
biological father

586
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:32,232
John Donnelly.

587
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,567
Meet your son.

588
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:44,104
Hi.

589
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:51,630
You have your mother's eyes.

590
00:34:58,889 --> 00:34:59,763
Owen...

591
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,916
Your name is Owen.

592
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:11,525
Is there anything
you want to ask your father?

593
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,483
I play music.

594
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:21,128
I don't know why I said that.

595
00:35:21,543 --> 00:35:23,793
I'd love to hear you play sometime.

596
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,665
Do you know anything about music?

597
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:28,695
I don't.

598
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,327
You like hockey.
Right, Mr. Donnelly?

599
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:39,961
I have season tickets
for the Capitals.

600
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:41,644
We could go next week.

601
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,308
For your birthday.

602
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,060
My birthday is in April.

603
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:51,718
And I don't play hockey anymore.

604
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:53,471
I quit.

605
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:57,738
- We don't have to go.
- You have the wrong person.

606
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,015
Careful, son.

607
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:05,086
I'm your father, Owen.

608
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:07,080
No, this isn't my dad.

609
00:36:17,446 --> 00:36:19,446
He doesn't even know who I am.

610
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:20,982
He loves you.

611
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:23,430
He has this whole time.
He just couldn't find you.

612
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,766
You got the people who really love me
arrested.

613
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,167
Give him a chance.

614
00:36:28,442 --> 00:36:30,116
All right? He wants you in his life.

615
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:32,648
- I don't want him.
- Finally, the truth.

616
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,652
He needs to hear it.
That man in there, that's what you have.

617
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,879
So, deal with it.

618
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,197
- Max, we care about you.
- I'm not your kid!

619
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,493
You want a kid,
go have one of your own.

620
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:45,926
Want to lash out,

621
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,986
do you?

622
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:48,357
Go on then.

623
00:36:48,924 --> 00:36:50,991
Give me your best shot.
Go on then!

624
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:54,695
Come on...

625
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,630
Give me your best shot.

626
00:36:58,588 --> 00:36:59,638
Come on in!

627
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:11,728
Is that enough?

628
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:13,351
Come on boy.

629
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:15,525
That enough?

630
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,973
We're working out the details,
but it looks like

631
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:22,557
the settlement will be more
in the neighborhood of 2 million,

632
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,890
not 20 million.

633
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:30,293
Your findings were worth
every penny.

634
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,134
1.8 million...

635
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,970
That's a lot of zeroes.

636
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:42,593
Before we take this, we have
a couple of outstanding questions.

637
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,002
What are your protocols
for dealing with ice?

638
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:51,595
We salt.

639
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:54,631
You salted the parking lots
and the sidewalks that morning?

640
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:57,566
- I'll show you the inventory...
- That won't be necessary.

641
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:00,928
Classic evasion.

642
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,898
And you know what?
We'll pass on the bogus paper trail.

643
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:08,318
If that girl doesn't slip on the ice,
he never pushes through the crowd.

644
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:10,515
Couple that
with your security guard's negligence

645
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:12,548
and the mindset of the crowd,

646
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:14,291
you've got a perfect storm.

647
00:38:15,227 --> 00:38:17,377
If you're looking to renegotiate,

648
00:38:18,468 --> 00:38:19,534
we can do that.

649
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,175
This is what we found.

650
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:26,499
Then I'm glad we have
a non-disclosure agreement.

651
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:33,329
You can use the whole report
or none of it.

652
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,885
Or I'll see that it leaks.

653
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,750
And then you'll have a tragedy
and a cover-up.

654
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,399
We'll use none of it.

655
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:01,673
He can see me, can't he? Donnelly?

656
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,085
I came peacefully
so he could see me.

657
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,306
Where did you find him?

658
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,757
He was outside of a liquor store,
next to the OTB that Donnelly mentioned.

659
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:18,143
It'll take a few weeks for the FBI
to confirm their DNA test.

660
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:20,501
If we can get a confession today,

661
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,414
you can go home with your father.

662
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:28,073
<i>Your daughter was taken</i>

663
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,950
from you when she was...

664
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,010
6, right?
And she died in foster care?

665
00:39:37,997 --> 00:39:40,253
You've been waiting for this day,
haven't you?

666
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:43,005
You think the best thing
you could have done for your daughter

667
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:46,008
<i>was to avenge her death
by stealing the son</i>

668
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,592
of the man responsible.

669
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,810
<i>He should have let me keep her.</i>

670
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,889
<i>I begged him.</i>

671
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:58,645
You're going to jail for the rest
of your life, you know that.

672
00:40:00,955 --> 00:40:02,238
What do you want me to say?

673
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:05,371
The question really is,
what do you want to say...

674
00:40:05,454 --> 00:40:06,504
to Donnelly

675
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,949
<i>before you disappear?</i>

676
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:16,497
My only regret
through this whole thing

677
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:19,750
is that you didn't know
who did this to you.

678
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,630
Now you do.

679
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,979
So does his son.

680
00:40:29,372 --> 00:40:30,177
What?

681
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:32,637
The boy found him.
His son found him.

682
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:35,974
They're strangers.

683
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:39,211
Give them time, eh?

684
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:53,699
You want to tell me how we went
from a 7-figure payday to nothing

685
00:40:53,782 --> 00:40:55,130
It wasn't an ideal outcome...

686
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:57,554
No, it wasn't. We can barely
keep our heads above water.

687
00:40:57,637 --> 00:40:59,428
You decide to go ahead and sabotage

688
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:01,272
a potential elephant account.

689
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,569
What did you do?
You put in 40 full hours on this?

690
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:06,809
And then there's Torres' time?

691
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:08,607
You've any idea
where that's coming from?

692
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,749
- Your pocket.
- Bloody right, my pocket!

693
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:14,291
- You promised me you'd deliver.
- Shifting blame from the guilty party,

694
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:15,972
that wouldn't have been the truth.

695
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:17,878
You see, that choice...

696
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:19,807
That choice...

697
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:23,355
That's how you make
your contribution to this firm.

698
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,230
We could go dark, for all I care.

699
00:41:26,313 --> 00:41:27,984
We follow the truth here, right?

700
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,779
No matter the cost to our egos
or our wallets.

701
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:35,659
- So, if I'd have taken the money...
- I would have sacked you.

702
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:39,786
Can I get one of those "attaboy"
speeches from yesterday?

703
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,019
I've run out.

704
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,993
You think this co-custody
thing can really work?

705
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:49,526
2 sets of parents
is better than none.

706
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:52,744
This is so screwed up.

707
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:55,614
Just give it a chance.
It'll work itself out.

708
00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:58,197
When in doubt,
I just do what she says.

709
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:09,647
Go on. Off you go, son.

710
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:26,877
Hell of a rabbit hole.

711
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,505
We made it.

712
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:41,185
- Have you forgiven us?
- I guess.

713
00:42:41,335 --> 00:42:42,335
Have you?

714
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,430
You were protecting a friend, right?

715
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:48,064
You are your father's daughter.

716
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:50,650
I know a little bit about
how crazy families can be.

717
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:54,112
You think he'll be all right?

718
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:55,953
Don't know.

719
00:42:58,847 --> 00:42:59,847
Hope so.

720
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:06,317
Maybe we should invite him
to Thanksgiving next year.

721
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:08,734
He'd fit right in with us.
