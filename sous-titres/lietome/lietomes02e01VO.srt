1
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:39,513
Cal Lightman sees the truth.

2
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:41,654
It's written all over your face.

3
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:45,699
It's also in your voice,
your posture, the words you choose.

4
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:48,831
Because of Dr. Lightman's
scientific discoveries,

5
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,925
we know
that these signs are the same...

6
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,757
Laying it on a bit thick, isn't she?

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,004
It's called selling books, dad.
Shut up and bask.

8
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:56,764
Give him 5 minutes and 20 questions,

9
00:00:57,022 --> 00:01:00,295
and he'll know whether you went off
to Argentina to cheat on your wife,

10
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:03,510
lied about a well-timed stock sale,
or...

11
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,748
murdered a one-night stand.

12
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:08,944
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in welcoming

13
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,954
the world's foremost
deception expert

14
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:13,614
and one of America's
preeminent scientists,

15
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:15,449
author of <i>Lies We Tell</i>,

16
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,118
Dr. Cal Lightman.

17
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:25,907
She's right when she says
I'll know if you're lying,

18
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,429
but what I wanna know is why.

19
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:30,927
That's still your secret.

20
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:32,987
Any questions?

21
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,084
Dr. Lightman.

22
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:38,153
Thanks for coming.

23
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:42,893
How come no one ever looks me
in the eye at these things?

24
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:46,647
Cool tattoo.

25
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:49,459
- Who do I make it out to?
- Trisha, please.

26
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,778
You're the world's
biggest expert on lying?

27
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,656
When he's not being a dad
or a big-time author.

28
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:58,172
So you'll know
I'm telling the truth.

29
00:01:58,943 --> 00:02:01,743
The police don't believe me.
No one does. I...

30
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,498
I just really need
someone to believe me.

31
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,543
I saw a murder.

32
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:12,882
I didn't "see it" see it,
but I saw it

33
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:15,722
In a vision, a psychic vision,

34
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:18,095
but I know it really happened.

35
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:22,885
Am I telling the truth?

36
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:27,831
Yes, you are.

37
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,835
- Where are we going?
- Surprise. Divorce present.

38
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,342
Wasn't planning to toast
the demise of my marriage, but thanks.

39
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:13,279
- How you feeling?
- Horrible,

40
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,215
depressed, like a loser.

41
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:19,073
- You're happy.
- I'm not happy. I'm devastated.

42
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:27,739
Trisha Howell,
she's a Georgetown law student,

43
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,443
and she claims she had
a psychic vision...

44
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,042
of a murder.

45
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,083
I understand the scientist in you

46
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,022
sees every day as an opportunity
to discover something new

47
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:38,922
and wonderful about the brain,

48
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:40,410
but come on...

49
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:43,451
- You don't believe in psychics.
- As of now, I'm Switzerland.

50
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:45,202
Plus our plate is too full for this.

51
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,402
We have a potential
Supreme Court nominee to vet.

52
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,194
I do believe there's a scientific
explanation for what she saw.

53
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:56,714
Trisha Howell,

54
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,529
this is Gillian Foster.

55
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:02,471
Why don't you tell Foster here
about your vision.

56
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:06,288
I started writing it down, but...

57
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,256
I saw a man...

58
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:09,339
Tall,

59
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,408
short black hair, blue eyes.

60
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:13,023
He's in a hotel,

61
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,328
room 202,

62
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,795
he's freaking out. There's blood...

63
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,126
all over.

64
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,268
Whose blood was it?
Did you see a victim?

65
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:22,261
Just...

66
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:23,839
an ashtray

67
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:27,055
smashing down,
and then he's running, and...

68
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,274
The hotel sign
has some kind of a devil on it.

69
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,274
It's by that druggie park
over off of L street.

70
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:37,438
Can you excuse us
for just one moment?

71
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:48,485
That's a smooth exit line.
It's very professional.

72
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:51,302
This is a matter for the police
or a magic 8-ball.

73
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:53,543
These are the options: 1...

74
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:56,545
Trisha's ill;

75
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,801
2: she actually is a psychic;

76
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:01,702
3: she witnessed the murder

77
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,357
and no one believes her.

78
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:05,971
In any of these cases,
she needs our help, right?

79
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,849
Agt. Reynolds is waiting
with J. Simon.

80
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,809
Potential supreme court nominee.

81
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:13,664
Right.

82
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,264
Here he is.

83
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:19,550
Judge Simon,
this is Dr. Cal Lightman.

84
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:22,405
Glad you could clear your schedule
on such short notice.

85
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:24,892
I couldn't, actually.
This is Ria Torres.

86
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,576
She's gonna determine whether or not
you're a lying son of a bitch.

87
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,489
Just one...

88
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,017
The president
specifically asked for you.

89
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:39,334
You do know
I can tell when you're lying.

90
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:42,150
How 'bout this? Vetting this guy
is the F.B.I.'s responsibility,

91
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:45,578
and you have a contractual obligation
to give F.B.I. cases top priority.

92
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:48,168
Lightman group has that obligation,
not Lightman proper.

93
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,130
Torres is a natural.
She's gonna do fine.

94
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:51,547
Fine's not gonna cut it.

95
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,769
If this guy's
got some deep, dark sec...

96
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:55,980
- He does. We all do.
- Let me be clear.

97
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,665
My ass is on the line.

98
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:04,405
- I was just gonna call you.
- I saved you the trouble. Hi, Ben.

99
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,122
Testy ex-wife trumps testy F.B.I. agent.
Excuse us.

100
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:09,285
We're not done.

101
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,704
- Always nice to see you, Zoe.
- Nice to see you, Ben.

102
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:15,769
Emily says you've been good weird.
She's concerned.

103
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,428
I quit the Department of Justice.

104
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,879
I'm moving to Chicago
to head up my own practice.

105
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:24,787
What does Emily have to say
about this?

106
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,778
Doesn't know yet and since she'll wonder
why I'm not going in to work,

107
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,753
I figured we should probably tell her
before then, say, today.

108
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,013
Chicago's a nice town.

109
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,068
Not close, though.

110
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:39,086
You're always the one who said
if I had any guts,

111
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,552
I'd start my own law firm.

112
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:41,568
But, Chicago?

113
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,569
You remember Dave Gruber
from law school?

114
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,070
The handsy, flirty guy.

115
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:48,836
You're gonna work for this guy?

116
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,484
I'm not gonna be working for him.

117
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,724
I'm gonna be running
a new branch of his law firm.

118
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:54,245
Still not your firm, though.

119
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,041
I knew you'd try to make me
change my mind, and I'm not going to.

120
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,084
It's done, so just be happy for me.

121
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,109
- I am happy for you.
- Good.

122
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,506
It'd just be
quite an adjustment for Emily.

123
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:06,681
It'll take time.

124
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:09,025
She's an amazing kid.

125
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:13,594
You wanna take Emily to Chicago.

126
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,899
I've already made a schedule where
you can have her for the holidays,

127
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:20,496
and you're free to come to Chicago
any time you want.

128
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,132
We can make this work.

129
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,538
I'm not saying it's not selfish,

130
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:29,239
but the right thing for me also happens
to be the right thing for Emily.

131
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,892
Don't do that.
You know I hate it when you do that.

132
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,218
Thanks for waiting, J. Simon.

133
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,519
I came here fully prepared
to be vetted by an expert.

134
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,391
How old are you?

135
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:57,711
24.

136
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:05,936
Let's get started.

137
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,567
Where's the girl?

138
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,830
There was a girl in there claiming
Psychic abilities. Where is she?

139
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,859
Where's the girl?

140
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:25,300
Do we have funds
for a study on herd behavior?

141
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:27,467
- The girl, where is she?
- She left.

142
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,736
And you let her?

143
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:31,969
I run a research lab, not a prison.
She wanted to leave, she left.

144
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,679
Where are you going?

145
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,097
None of my business.

146
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,417
Check. Power of nonverbal communication.
Awesome. Love it.

147
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:53,930
You got a room?

148
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,033
You lookin' for company?

149
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,098
Not in this economy.
I'll settle for the porn package.

150
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,811
That does appear to be blood.

151
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:28,019
We need to find the girl.
I assume you wanna bring her downtown.

152
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:30,613
The girl with the psychic visions?
Why don't we just have her

153
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,842
Give us tomorrow's lottery numbers,
and we can all retire early?

154
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,742
Nice to meet you.

155
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,120
This is what you dragged me down
here for.

156
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,375
Every hotel room this side of town

157
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,407
is gonna be ripe with blood
and various other human discharges.

158
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,012
No body, no crime.

159
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:51,762
I'm gettin' back to the judge.
I suggest you do the same.

160
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:57,802
That's it
for your most prominent cases.

161
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:02,792
Let's move on to your family.

162
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:08,607
Celia, your wife, tell me about her.

163
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:10,514
What would you like to know?

164
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:14,321
I guess the big one is: 
have you ever cheated on her?

165
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,502
I can't imagine any senator
on the judiciary committee

166
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:18,617
asking me that.

167
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:20,367
That's not...

168
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:21,703
I just...

169
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,973
I have to ask you.

170
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,356
The answer's no.

171
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:28,835
So you've never been interested
in another woman in that time?

172
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:30,507
Never.

173
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:33,780
Really?

174
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,134
You never cheated?

175
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:37,504
He said no.

176
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,973
Did you ever cheat on your taxes?

177
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:42,510


178
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:43,768


179
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,937
And I've been paying them
longer than you've been breathing air.

180
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:49,254
My age really bothers you.

181
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:53,396
In my experience,
anybody under the age of 35

182
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:56,363
normally doesn't know their ass
from a hole in the ground.

183
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,027
So, yes,

184
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,733
The fact
that you're standing between me

185
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:04,705
and a position on the Supreme Court
of the United States of America

186
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,588
does not thrill me.

187
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:37,821


188
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,994
Found this under the bed.

189
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,395
Who are you?

190
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:50,104
What do you want?

191
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:51,710
Don't you know me?

192
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:55,734
I know you.
You and me, we're old friends, babe.

193
00:11:58,207 --> 00:11:59,301
Tell me your name.

194
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:00,772
Why should I?

195
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:09,436
It's Jessie.

196
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:11,772
I'm Cal Lightman.

197
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,770
We met earlier today.

198
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,526
Only, then you were someone else.

199
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:18,653
I'll be anybody you want me to be.

200
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,947
I wanna spend some time with you.

201
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:23,325


202
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:24,987
Not like that.

203
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,164
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

204
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:32,088
Gonna cost you extra.

205
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,496
I'll expect it to worth.

206
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:39,001


207
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:41,385
The camera, the strange white room.

208
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:43,428
She's afraid.

209
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,626
And we're about to get funky.

210
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:49,851
This is from 4 hours ago...

211
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,368
Right before she ran out of here.

212
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,358
Shoulders back.

213
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,526
Chest out.

214
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,236
Totally different posture.

215
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:01,655
Totally different girl.

216
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,112
Hello, hair.

217
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:06,159
Trisha walked into that room,
and Jessie walked out.

218
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,631
For funsies, I had...

219
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,964
Hooker Jessie write down
her coffee order,

220
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:14,299
and I compared that
to law student Trisha's account

221
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,002
of her so-called vision.

222
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,326
Night and day.

223
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:21,043
These 2 documents indicate
2 fundamentally different personalities.

224
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,593
Trisha's got it,

225
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,011
this multiple personality disorder.

226
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,890
- The holy grail of psychiatry.
- This...

227
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,725
is your divorce present.

228
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,129
It's dissociative identity disorder,

229
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,426
and it's more plausible
than a psychic phenomenon,

230
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,954
just barely.
Of course, if it is D.I.D.,

231
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:41,374
there's empirical evidence of explicit
memory transfer in such cases.

232
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,764
She could have perceived that
as a vision.

233
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,086
- So her alter witnessed a murder.
- Or committed a murder.

234
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,038
This girl didn't hurt anyone.

235
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:53,836
If she had, her other personalities

236
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,542
would never have let her come to me.

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,551
Jessie
probably isn't the only alter.

238
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:00,716
Right.

239
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:14,080
You know I can see you all out
there staring at me.

240
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:15,437


241
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:23,816
What the hell?

242
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:25,947
Just giving you some privacy.

243
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:29,618
Met some freaks in my time,
but this place is perv central.

244
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:31,786
You might have a point there.

245
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,788
Guess if you're payin' for it.

246
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,629
Why'd you sneak
into that hotel room?

247
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,931
Why did you?

248
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,365
Were you trying to cover up a crime?

249
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,328


250
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:47,636
Lip curl, forced eye contact.

251
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,054
You're lying.

252
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,935
I'm not some lab rat.

253
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,984
Did you kill somebody?

254
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:55,892


255
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,690
Heart rate, blood pressure, all steady.
It's not sure, but she's believable.

256
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,190
I'm gonna go see
how Jessie feels about hypnosis.

257
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:05,176
Bring your wallet.

258
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,991
You presided over 16 cases
before your 35th birthday,

259
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,327
starting with Cahill v. Wilson.

260
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:15,455
Then Abandandou v. Temple.

261
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:19,187
Ohio v. George.

262
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,548
All right, Ohio v. George.

263
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,926
Why do you have
that reaction to that case?

264
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,678
What reaction?

265
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:34,393
A drifter named Bryce George
raped 56-year-old Margaret Lane.

266
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,725
Where's agent Reynolds?

267
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,311
Busy. You gave him life in prison
for a first offense?

268
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:44,433
You think I should have given him
a lesser sentence?

269
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,615
Agent Reynolds doesn't know
we've started up again, right?

270
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,743
Did you have a personal relationship
with Margaret Lane?

271
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,709
I may be 24, but I have a talent
for spotting lies.

272
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,574
Move on, Ms. Torres.

273
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,328
You really shouldn't speak that way

274
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:10,913
to the person standing
between you and the supreme court.

275
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,736
Just listen to my voice and float.

276
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,779
As you listen to my voice,
keep breathing,

277
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,380
getting heavier with each exhale,

278
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:28,359
again, allowing yourself
to fall into a deep...

279
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:30,724
Deep...

280
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,395
... sleep.

281
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,234
In their conscious lives,
the alters aren't aware of each other.

282
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,747
Hopefully hypnosis will allow Foster
to tap into their shared unconscious.

283
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,621
- Torres is in over her head.
- You know, I could...

284
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:47,714
I could jump in on that.

285
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,507
I'm just saying I have seniority,

286
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,870
and if the wrong guy gets
put on the supreme court,

287
00:16:51,953 --> 00:16:54,804
I mean, that could really affect
the whole future of the...

288
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,270
... country.

289
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:58,139
Yeah, I'm fine here.

290
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,544
Now that you're fully relaxed,
you can open your eyes.

291
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:08,109
Is it OK if I ask you
a few questions?

292
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,069
Sure.

293
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:12,197
Can you tell me about Trisha?

294
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:15,075
- Her.
- You don't like her?

295
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,619
She thinks she's so perfect.

296
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,969
Anyway, Gavin likes me way better.

297
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:21,486
Who's Gavin?

298
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,416
My best friend.

299
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,134
Why don't you tell me about him?

300
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,497
I don't want to.

301
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:29,003
Well, maybe Trisha
can tell me about him.

302
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,514
Can I speak to her?

303
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,426
Hi, Dr. Foster.

304
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:48,566
What... What am I doing here?

305
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:50,361
I met Jessie today.

306
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:54,273
You two don't get along.

307
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:56,866
She's very crass.

308
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,619
Jessie was telling me about Gavin.

309
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:01,220
She would.

310
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,373
She thinks he adores her.

311
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:07,585
Trisha, did anything bad happen to you?
Anything when you were younger?

312
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,001
The bad things happen to R.J.

313
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,917
That's a new name.

314
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:18,686
- Can I talk to her?
- You mean him.

315
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:20,306
R.J. doesn't talk to people.

316
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,559
R.J.'s strong.

317
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:24,418
Nobody can hurt him.

318
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:26,552
He protects the rest of us.

319
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:31,291
I don't wanna think
about this anymore.

320
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:33,002
You're doing great. No problem.

321
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:36,364
OK, close your eyes.

322
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,527
On my count, you're gonna
wake up feeling refreshed.

323
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:42,287
You'll be totally yourself.

324
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:45,442
Trois... Deux...

325
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:47,064
Un...

326
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,865
Trisha, you're... You're safe.

327
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,267
Trisha, you're safe. Trisha.

328
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,646
- Trisha, you're safe.
- I'm not Trisha.

329
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,065
I'm Sophie.

330
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:13,963
I'm sophie.

331
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:15,780
I'm sophie.

332
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:17,363
I'm sophie.

333
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:19,073
I'm sophie.

334
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:29,390
I'm Dr. Cal Lightman.
This is Dr. Gillian Foster.

335
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,643
Try to relax, please.

336
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,104
- I don't wanna be in a hospital.
- It's not a hospital.

337
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:36,935
It may look kind of weird,
but this is where I work.

338
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,844
You came to me.

339
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,180
Which one of me?

340
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:46,518
You know about the other personalities?
You know about Trisha and...

341
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,034
... Jessie and... and R.J.?

342
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,568
They stole my life.

343
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,387
Sophie, are you
the core personality?

344
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,045
I'm the real person,

345
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,223
the doctors say.

346
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,081
What did they do?
They did something bad?

347
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,304
We believe one of your personalities
witnessed a murder.

348
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,220
Trisha came to me
because she thought I could help.

349
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:17,939
God.

350
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,239
Why?

351
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:22,180
She tried the police,
but they didn't believe her.

352
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:25,549
The work I do here
is determining the truth,

353
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,059
and I do believe her.

354
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:29,775
I think we can help you.

355
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,313
You can't help me.

356
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,484
Nobody can help me.

357
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,437
There's a murderer out there
who may know who you are.

358
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:42,765
We need to prove a crime happened
to get the police involved.

359
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,428
Can you tell me who Gavin is?

360
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:49,080
I don't know.

361
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:01,217
You're safe here.

362
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:03,984
You can trust us. I promise.

363
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:09,929
Gavin's my brother.

364
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:11,811
I don't...

365
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:12,854
... see him,

366
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:14,546
ever.

367
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:18,973
Jessie does.

368
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:25,130
Starting with Cahill v. Wilson,

369
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:26,993
Then Abandandou v. Temple,

370
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:28,653
Ohio v. George.

371
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,754
Look. Right there. 5C.

372
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:32,638
That's fear.

373
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:34,330
If you say so.

374
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:36,959
He doesn't want me
anywhere near that case.

375
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,671
OK, watch this. Ohio v. George

376
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,223
was a rape case.
Nicole Lane was the victim's daughter.

377
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,529
And now he will never hurt
another woman.

378
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:47,889
Judge Simon did the right thing.

379
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,767
He's a noble man,
and I'll always be grateful.

380
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:53,436
Her pupils dilate
when she talks about him.

381
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:55,823
That's arousal.

382
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:57,855
And her voice gets all gooey.

383
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:02,000
Well, you expect me to tell
the president not to nominate this guy

384
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,160
because 20 years ago,
some woman's voice got all gooey.

385
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,492
Have you even talked to her?

386
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,702
She died.

387
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,038
Ovarian cancer 2 years ago.
But watch this.

388
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:20,171
It's the same face.

389
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,216
I am telling you, he had an affair
with Nicole Lane during that trial.

390
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,554
Or maybe you just
don't like the guy.

391
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,054
- Excuse me?
- Come on. I'm no face reader,

392
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,014
- but even I can see it.
- He's a liar.

393
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,073
A liar who had an affair with someone
involved in a case he was deciding.

394
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:35,013
He doesn't deserve to be
on the supreme court.

395
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:35,895
Maybe.

396
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,171
Maybe not, but, see, the problem is

397
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:40,003
the second that this got personal,

398
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:41,991
you lost the right
to make that decision.

399
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:54,789
Hi. How you doing? Gavin Howell?

400
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,069
- I'm...
- Jessie?

401
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,516
Oh, my god.

402
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,819
What happened to your sister?

403
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:14,350
Well, whatever it was,

404
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,310
you blame yourself, don't you?

405
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,840
The two of us spent summers at our
grandparents' farm in upstate New York.

406
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:26,085
For me, it was heaven.

407
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,140
Not for Sophie?

408
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:32,090
I didn't know till I was 10,

409
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:36,329
and she was 13. I walked into the barn,
and my grandfather...

410
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:39,465
... did things to her.

411
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:42,413
It was evil.

412
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:46,088
When did you first start
seeing a change in her,

413
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:49,469
- that she was different?
- Jessie showed up the next summer,

414
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,096
selling herself to local kids.
Trisha came later.

415
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,995
They visit you.

416
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:55,224
Jessie does.

417
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,951
She crashes in my shed
when she's had a rough night, but I...

418
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,732
Not lately.
I haven't seen her in months.

419
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,345
I really stay here?

420
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,922
Scared the hell out of me first time
you showed up.

421
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,915
Does anything feel familiar, Sophie?

422
00:24:20,664 --> 00:24:22,877
I got that bike
for my seventh birthday.

423
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,843
I smell that bad, Gavin?

424
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:30,510
You're holding your breath,

425
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,233
which could mean
you're tense or upset...

426
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,862
Or it could mean
you're hiding something.

427
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:41,146
Exhale marks the spot.

428
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,303
I'm sorry.

429
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,823
I really can't protect you, can I?

430
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,340
Kyle Arnow.

431
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:11,603
Did I kill him?

432
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,688
- Hi.
- Yes?

433
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,930
Sorry about the intrusion. I was just
driving by, and I saw your car.

434
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:25,356
- It's a beautiful car.
- Thank you.

435
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:28,497
- I don't suppose it's for sale.
- It's my husband's.

436
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,571
A man is in love with your car.

437
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:35,947
Good taste. I had the interior
completely restored about 6 years ago.

438
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,118
That's a nice job.

439
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,286
I found...

440
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,828
This.

441
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,090
And...

442
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,745
I thought you were dead.

443
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:48,880
- Where'd you get that?
- It's clue in a murder investigation.

444
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:51,119
Murder? What are you talking about?

445
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:59,208
- So you didn't do it, then.
- You have to go away.

446
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,454
- Does your wife know you like hookers?
- No, because I don't.

447
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:06,355
Because the only thing I didn't find
in your wallet was a condom.

448
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:09,025
Why don't we ask your wife.

449
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:14,824
How your wallet ended up covered
in blood at a murder scene, shall we?

450
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:21,829
Two working girls robbed me
at some hotel downtown.

451
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,449
I fought back, and I ran,
but that's not my blood,

452
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:27,770
so how about you just mind
your own damn business?

453
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:39,930
What?

454
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,351
Your husband likes unprotected sex
with hookers,

455
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:45,853
so it might be a good time
to get yourself tested

456
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,140
for... You know.

457
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:48,940
Everything, really.

458
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,060
Nice car, Kyle.

459
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,919
Let's say Sophie
didn't kill anybody.

460
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,435
Or Jessie

461
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,185
or Trisha.

462
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,481
But there's another
personality out there, a male

463
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:12,964
personality, R.J.

464
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,403
- But we don't even know if he exists.
- I think he does.

465
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:17,028
I think he's the protector,

466
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:20,189
the one who emerges
when there are violent situations.

467
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:23,921
What if he perceived Sophie
to be in trouble?

468
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,435
Who knows what could have happened?

469
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,561
But it doesn't make him
a killer, does it?

470
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,315
He could have witnessed the murder.

471
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:32,970
Things get ugly.

472
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:35,152
- Jessie gets scared.
- And transitions

473
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,458
into R.J.,

474
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:37,991
the protector,

475
00:27:38,316 --> 00:27:39,316
meaning...

476
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:41,962
It was R.J.

477
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:44,036
that Trisha saw in her vision.

478
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,799
R.J. running down a street.

479
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:48,076
R.J. washing off the blood.

480
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,657
We talk to R.J.,

481
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,255
we'll get to the truth.

482
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:57,937
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm walking
across the Georgetown quad

483
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,455
with a backpack full of books
I've never seen,

484
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,471
or I'm in a changing room

485
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,061
trying on an outfit
I've never picked out,

486
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:08,220
or the worst one, I'm...

487
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,373
I'm stumbling out of some guy's car.

488
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:18,152
I just wanna be me.

489
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,043
Well, you'll get there, love.

490
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:25,517
Maybe...

491
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:28,321
One day, one of 'em
will take over for good,

492
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:31,402
and I'll just be gone.

493
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:35,371
Hey, so mom said
you wanted to talk to m...

494
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:37,916
Bad timing.

495
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,427
Hi. I'm sorry. Unlike my dad,
I'm not normally

496
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,179
totally insensitive.

497
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,347
That's OK.

498
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:46,708
You hungry? Let's get a snack.

499
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,279
- Is she OK?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

500
00:28:56,857 --> 00:28:58,194
No, not really.

501
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:00,715
Well, did she really
witness a murder?

502
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:04,122
That's nothing for
you to think about.

503
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:05,336
All right?

504
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,594
I wanna talk to you
about something else.

505
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,634
Just please tell me you
and mom aren't, like,

506
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:15,506
getting back together or something.
Ah, no, no.

507
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:21,884
Something's come up for your mum.

508
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,135
Not now!

509
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:28,307
Remember when I said,
"no body, no crime"?

510
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,504
I just got off the phone
with my detective friend.

511
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:33,811
There's a body, a prostitute
by the name of Amber O'Malley.

512
00:29:33,894 --> 00:29:36,790
She's been known to work
out of the Devil May Care hotel.

513
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:38,062
That changes things.

514
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:40,739
The cops, they wanna talk to your girl,
I mean like right now.

515
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:42,394
They're on their way up.

516
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,132
All right?

517
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:49,870
- You should get home.
- OK.

518
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:51,622
Bye.

519
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:58,049
- And we'll talk about this later.
- OK.

520
00:29:58,132 --> 00:30:00,214
- You driving?
- Yeah.

521
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:08,097
- Let's go.
- What's up?

522
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,555
Cops found a body. They wanna
talk to you. Where's Foster?

523
00:30:10,638 --> 00:30:11,748
Bathroom. Why?

524
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:13,573
I need to talk to RJ.

525
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:22,778
Dr. Lightman, what's going on?

526
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:31,933
Now, before I do this,

527
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,663
I want you to know that I'm sorry.

528
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,819
What's happening? What's going on?

529
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,669
Take your clothes off.

530
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,042
What?

531
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:46,114
Take your clothes off,
you dirty, filthy whore.

532
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:50,600
Take your clothes off.

533
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:52,279
No, no, no!

534
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,449
I can smell your stink from here.
You're vile.

535
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:57,990
I'm not! Help me!

536
00:30:58,227 --> 00:30:59,972
- No one's gonna help you.
- Cal!

537
00:31:00,313 --> 00:31:02,568
Open the door! Cal!

538
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:04,695
What's goin' on?

539
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:06,829
Get the master key.

540
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:08,365
- Cal!
- Lightman!

541
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:10,993
I should do them all a favor.
I should kill you right now.

542
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,793
- Please. No, please.
- Open this door!

543
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:14,996
Fight back!

544
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,541
Fight back, you son of a bitch.
Fight back.

545
00:31:17,624 --> 00:31:18,962
Cal, what are you doing?

546
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,836
Open this door.

547
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,766
Open the damn door!

548
00:31:34,263 --> 00:31:36,463
What the hell? Enough!

549
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:39,522
Get off. Come on.

550
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,064
Have you lost your mind?

551
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,152
Tell me what happened
in that hotel room.

552
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,007
Tell me what happened
in that hotel room!

553
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,154
I'm trying to protect you,
just the same as you are!

554
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:49,825
This is over! I'm takin' her in.

555
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,106
Who killed the other prostitute?

556
00:31:57,372 --> 00:31:58,372
Tell me.

557
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:02,021
Who killed Amber?
Who killed the other prostitute.

558
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:03,234
Say something!

559
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:04,456
Say something!

560
00:32:06,146 --> 00:32:07,545
He can't. He can't.

561
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:10,970
- Alters are one-dimensional.
- Let's go for a ride.

562
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,514
- Watch him.
- R.J. is the protector.

563
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,600
He never needed to talk.
He never needed to talk.

564
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,233
Reynolds! Reynolds!

565
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:27,728
What?

566
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,682
Give me one minute with her.

567
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:31,501
Just give me one minute.

568
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:34,903
I promise I'll weigh in on the judge.
I promise.

569
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,425
I know you wanna help Sophie.

570
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,936
You've been trying to help
her all along, haven't you?

571
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:04,020
Now, you showed Trisha.

572
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:06,966
She thought
she was having visions, but...

573
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:09,653
You were showing her
what happened, weren't you?

574
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,397
Now, Trisha's seen pieces.

575
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,434
If you wanna help Sophie,

576
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:17,453
Trisha needs to see all of it.

577
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,674
You understand?

578
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:22,804
Now, I know you can't tell me,

579
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,304
But you can show her...

580
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:28,149
Can't you?

581
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,275
Dr. Lightman.

582
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:50,088
Trisha?

583
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,108
I just had another vision.

584
00:33:55,193 --> 00:33:56,902
I know who killed the girl.

585
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,873
Judge.

586
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,918
Thanks for staying so late.

587
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:10,096
Right. Tell the truth, whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

588
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,794
we'll have you out of here in a jiffy.

589
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:14,708
If not, we'll squash
your nomination like a little bug.

590
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,678
You got it?

591
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:17,169
Got it.

592
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:18,596
Good.

593
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,724
Nicole Lane.

594
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,534
Why'd you have sex with her?

595
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,605
I told her
and I'll tell you I didn't.

596
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:29,650
Would you say
you were in love with her?

597
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:34,815
Nicole came to
the courtroom every day.

598
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,783
I was young, and I shouldn't have,
but I...

599
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,646
spoke with her a couple
of times in the hallway,

600
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:42,504
always briefly.

601
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:47,335
But there were feelings...

602
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:51,286
Inappropriate feelings.

603
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:55,744
Then she asked to see me
in my chambers one day.

604
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:58,518
We kissed...

605
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:00,767
Just once.

606
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:04,820
Do you think your feelings for her
affected your judgment in the case?

607
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:07,438
Did that kiss affect the sentence?

608
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:11,603
My behavior was improper and unethical,
and I deeply regret it,

609
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:16,358
but it did not affect the sentence.

610
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:23,278
Right.

611
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:26,556
I think we're done here.

612
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,168
I think it best
that I withdraw my name.

613
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,837
Why?

614
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:34,773
You were young.

615
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:38,424
Your feelings got in the way,
you made a mistake,

616
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:40,988
But you've lived
a good life since then.

617
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,352
Let's hope
the president agrees with you.

618
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,324
Judge Simon, let me walk you out.

619
00:35:57,065 --> 00:35:58,363
You write this up,

620
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:00,908
But you choose your words carefully.

621
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:03,790
Why'd you put me on this case?

622
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:05,996
You knew I wasn't ready.

623
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:08,832
Well, far as I can tell,
you nailed it.

624
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,921
Look, what do you wanna be
when you grow up?

625
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:16,113
I am grown-up.

626
00:36:16,427 --> 00:36:17,944
Terrific. Who are you?

627
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:20,166
I'm... I'm a...

628
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:24,431
You're on your way to becoming one of
the world's leading experts in deception.

629
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,520
But up here, you're still a baggage
screener at the airport.

630
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:33,857
Till you change that,
you'll always think you're not ready.

631
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:45,160
When I was 14, my boyfriend
robbed a convenience store.

632
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:47,996
I was in the car.

633
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:49,891
I knew he was gonna do it,

634
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,763
didn't know he'd have a gun.

635
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:55,460
Nobody got hurt,
but somebody could have.

636
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,589
So for me,

637
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,839
baggage screener was a big step up.

638
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,586
Well, keep steppin', then.

639
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:15,219
Hey, baby.

640
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,609
Where you been?

641
00:37:18,178 --> 00:37:19,403
You miss me?

642
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:20,832
No.

643
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,529
Figured you'd be in jail by now.

644
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:27,249
Figured you'd be in jail by now.

645
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:28,871
I don't follow.

646
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:32,624
We both know I was there for your
little tantrum the other night.

647
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,384
We both know I was there for your
little tantrum the other night.

648
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:38,271
That's crazy talk.

649
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,453
Why didn't you just send her
in as the hooker?

650
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:43,065
The hooker doesn't know the story.

651
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:44,722
Sophie does,
and the hookers are liar.

652
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,411
Sophie remembers what happened?
Not exactly.

653
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,078
R.J. used their shared consciousness
to show Trisha.

654
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,394
Trisha told Lightman.
Lightman told Sophie.

655
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:56,161
Now it's important for Sophie
to get her power back.

656
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:57,853
I'm not sure she's pulling it off.

657
00:37:57,936 --> 00:37:59,944
She's definitely not Jessie.

658
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,279
What do you want?

659
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:06,307
The same thing we all want,
darlin', money. Money in my pocket,

660
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,688
you give me that, I'll give you
the wallet, you want so bad.

661
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:09,912
What wallet?

662
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,842
The one with Amber's
blood all over it,

663
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:15,040
- your fingerprints, too.
- Your fingerprints.

664
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:16,875
It proves you killed her.

665
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:19,546
I didn't kill that bitch.

666
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:21,673
Yeah, you did.

667
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,115
You were angry we robbed that John. You
came, you swag that ashtray at her head.

668
00:38:25,198 --> 00:38:27,770
You would've done the same thing
to me if I hadn't gotten out of there.

669
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:30,168
She's gonna transition.

670
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:31,968
He hasn't admitted to anything.
No good.

671
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:35,090
If she slips into Jessie or R.J, we're
done. She's gonna have no idea

672
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:37,147
- what's going on.
- Sophie, you're doin' fine.

673
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:38,968
Hang in there. Hang in there.

674
00:38:42,242 --> 00:38:43,404
Sophie, you hear me?

675
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,362
Sophie, are you there?!
Sophie, hang in there.

676
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:54,731
Sophie, he won't hurt you
till he knows where that wallet is.

677
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:56,303
Back off, Trent.

678
00:38:57,745 --> 00:38:59,544
You'd better give me that wallet.

679
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:02,297
5 grand, it's yours.

680
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,238
I don't have 5 grand.

681
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,177
Too bad, then.

682
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:13,246
I told you and Amber
to stop rolling johns in here.

683
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,769
It was driving away customers.

684
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:19,856
I wouldn't have done her
if you had behaved right.

685
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:21,356
We're good. Let's go.

686
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,779
Run! Get out of there!

687
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:29,616


688
00:39:32,278 --> 00:39:33,245
Freeze!

689
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:43,422
You did it. You did it. You're OK.

690
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,843
You did good. You did good.

691
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:51,559
You did it. You are all right.

692
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:08,697
Cal, I'm sorry
it's happening like this.

693
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,005
I really am.

694
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,628
It's for your share of the Lightman
Group. I'm buying you out.

695
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:26,673
Don't do this.

696
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:29,303
You got it in the divorce.
It's your money. You earned it.

697
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:35,584
Look, 15 different ways
I come up with today.

698
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:40,952
Money just shows up
opportunity comes your way.

699
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:43,453
Just one small con.

700
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,566
- You'd've been none the wiser.
- I'd have seen through that.

701
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:48,722
You'd have suspected,
but you wouldn't have known.

702
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,350
But this is my daughter.

703
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,936
Last couple of days,
I've been teacher,

704
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:01,799
boss, a colleague, pal, bastard.

705
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:04,977
Just suits you put on, take off.

706
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:07,724
What? So dad is your favorite suit?

707
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:10,705
No, that's the only one
that's not a suit.

708
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:16,501
You can't afford this,

709
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:18,210
and I have made a commitment.

710
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:21,735
Everything you wanna do in Chicago,
you can right here,

711
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:23,745
except it'll be your own firm.

712
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:27,986
If you take what's yours.

713
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,649
I'm not saying
its not selfish. It is.

714
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,311
But it's the right thing for me.

715
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:39,906
Also happens to be
the right thing for you

716
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:42,290
and Emily.

717
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
<i>In other news,
it looks as though the president</i>

718
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:51,896
<i>has made a decision
for a supreme court nomination.</i>

719
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:54,511
<i>- The president this morning...</i>
- Good morning.

720
00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:57,413
<i>Announcing his pick for the opening
on the supreme court.</i>

721
00:41:57,496 --> 00:42:00,034
<i>Judge William Simon,
a moderate from Ohio,</i>

722
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,945
<i>was considered a long shot
 last week.</i>

723
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:03,687
I hope he made the right choice.

724
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,583
<i>He began his career as a attorney...</i>

725
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:09,093
I got a call from the bank first thing.
They thought I'd know that the Lightman 

726
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:12,066
group's loan has been approved and the
ownership shares have been transferred.

727
00:42:12,149 --> 00:42:13,517
I know. I bought our way out.

728
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,884
Did you consider

729
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:19,141
telling me, your partner,
about this before you did it?

730
00:42:19,778 --> 00:42:21,732
Zoe was gonna take Emily,
so I had to...

731
00:42:21,815 --> 00:42:24,333
Jeopardize the financial
future of this company?

732
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:26,626
That's a bit dramatic, isn't it?

733
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:29,467
You know, I... I lied earlier

734
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:31,884
when I said I was devastated
about the divorce.

735
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:32,799
I'm not.

736
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,222
You know, for the first time in 5 years,
when I get dressed in the morning,

737
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:39,612
I don't automatically reach
for black or brown or navy blue.

738
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:43,040
I'm wearing pink today, Cal, pink,
because I like pink. It makes me happy,

739
00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:46,615
which is something that I have
not been for a very long time.

740
00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:50,467
I'm divorced,
and I'm free, and I'm happy,

741
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:52,821
and if you do something
to screw that up...

742
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:53,439
I won't.

743
00:42:54,284 --> 00:42:55,487
I promise I won't.

744
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:02,455
Push comes to shove, I can always
go to Vegas, make the money back,

745
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:04,456
Don't even joke about that.

746
00:43:05,406 --> 00:43:06,170
Cal...

747
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:10,667
Promise me you'll never go back
to Vegas.
