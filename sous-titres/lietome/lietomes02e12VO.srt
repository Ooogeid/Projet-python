1
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,754
I sing terrible, too.

2
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:20,839
Cabbie, we'll just go
and get out here and walk.

3
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:22,480
It's a bloody zoo out there.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,720
Out.

5
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,611
Get it up.

6
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:30,404
Keep the change.

7
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:48,673
Let's go.

8
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:26,877
It's not like there aren't
any decent schools around here.

9
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:30,345
But... no, my little genius,
she's got her heart set on Berkeley,

10
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,142
which is 3,000 bloody miles away.

11
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:34,427
This is her mother's doing.
Her fingerprints all over it.

12
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,387
And now Emily's late, right?

13
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,348
I can't even find my picture ID.
So, what's the matter?

14
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:41,183
Remember Henry Andrews?

15
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:42,727
Pentagon, 2003.

16
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,145
He just called.

17
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:47,406
He wants to tell you the truth
about the whole Jimmy Doyle business,

18
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:48,607
face to face.

19
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:51,193
That was 7 years ago.
He wants to come clean now?

20
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:53,848
He was 10 minutes away
when he called.

21
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:56,654
I got to be at the airport
in about 10 minutes.

22
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:00,411
What was that?

23
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,899
Come on, Loker.

24
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:25,629
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

25
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,489
Someone, please!

26
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,192
Somebody help!

27
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,461
I need a little help here!

28
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:52,046
There was a man in that car
and he's in...

29
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:54,746
He's dead. He...

30
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:57,071
It was...

31
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:58,975
He's in shock.
To the break room.

32
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,363
Come on this way.

33
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,545
<i>All circuits are busy now.</i>

34
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,469
<i>Will you please try your call a...</i>

35
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,484
<i>Metro authorities have closed off...</i>

36
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,829
<i>... until further notice.</i>

37
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:18,233
<i>The police department,
along with the fire department,</i>

38
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:19,782
<i>will be controlled...</i>

39
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,852
This just came for you.
The man said it was urgent.

40
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,950
Drink it.

41
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:35,097
What man? What did he...
when did he come?

42
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:37,297
Just before...
He said no matter what happened next,

43
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:40,076
- you need to open this.
- What did he look like?

44
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:43,138
He was wearing a hat, sunglasses.
It was really quick.

45
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:45,307
I was going to lunch.

46
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:47,768
- If I hadn't had to stay for this...
- I know.

47
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:50,521
Here's Emily's number.
I want you to call her.

48
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,841
You get her on the phone,
you come and find me.

49
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,275
All right, darling?

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,303
<i>... to and from each...</i>

51
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,362
<i>According to reports,
the car was traveling South</i>

52
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,698
<i>on seventh near Harvard Square
when the bomb detonated,</i>

53
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:03,414
<i>killing the driver instantly,</i>

54
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,244
<i>whose identity is unknown
at this point.</i>

55
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:08,292
<i>The cause of the explosion
is as yet unknown...</i>

56
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,456
What is that?

57
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,644
<i>... several government
counterterrorist agencies...</i>

58
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,133
What's important for me right now
is to talk to Emily,

59
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,116
so make him comfortable
and give him some tea.

60
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,006
No, you know
something about this bomb

61
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:20,728
or at least you think you do.
I know that look!

62
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:26,185
It's got to be gridlock out there.
Emily's probably stuck in it.

63
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,061
Say it.

64
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,283
Go on. You can say it.

65
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:37,768
Doyle is back, he killed Andrews,
I'm next.

66
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,572
La <i><font color="#ff0000">Lie</font> <font color="#ffffff">to</font><font color="#ff0000"> team</font></i> présente :

67
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,577
Épisode 212 : <i>Sweet Sixteen</i>

68
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,268
This came just moments before
that bomb went off, right?

69
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,729
"Lightman, psych evaluation,

70
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:17,107
"March 20, 2003, session one."

71
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,567
Ring any bells?

72
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,924
UCM stadium, tunnel 6, 1 P.M.

73
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,465
Or Doyle gets the other 5 tapes.

74
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,618
Someone's blackmailing you?

75
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:29,286
Is that what it is?

76
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,996
- It's nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

77
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,851
Apparently, my job here

78
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,931
depends on my meeting with you.

79
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:58,941
So, did they tell you
all about me, then?

80
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:00,734
Why they sent me,

81
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,274
so you could officially

82
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:06,713
diagnose me as broken in the head?

83
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,701
No longer reliable.

84
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,703
Not to be taken seriously.

85
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,705
I'm here to help you, Dr,

86
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,915
not judge you or rubber stamp

87
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:17,151
anyone's attempts to discredit you

88
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:18,544
or your science.

89
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:21,368
Which, by the way, happens to be
of great interest to me.

90
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,341
Is this session being recorded?

91
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,438
This office is for therapy
and counseling only.

92
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:31,567
I would not tolerate anyone recording
what is said in here.

93
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,729
Who would send you this?

94
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:45,154
Did you know it was being taped,
and if so, who was doing the recording?

95
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,116
You can't just sit in here
and talk about me.

96
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,121
It was the Pentagon.

97
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:57,458
Of course it occurred to me
it could have been bugged.

98
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,876
Do I know by who?

99
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:01,795
You know me better than that, Cal.

100
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,134
Did Anna reach Emily yet?

101
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,927
No, no.
She's still trying.

102
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:11,803
I can't just walk away.

103
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,543
You can't just walk away from me
when anyone with half a brain knows that

104
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,340
you both know something
about that bomb,

105
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:18,437
which, by the way, came this close
to killing me.

106
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,690
<i>Mr. Andrews, the confirmed victim,</i>

107
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,485
<i>a british born U.S. Citizen
and fossil fuel entrepreneur.</i>

108
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,071
<i>Here's what we're learning
about him.</i>

109
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,822
- <i>He was a bachelor.</i>
- You know him.

110
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:31,623
<i>Right now we're being told
that we're going to take you live</i>

111
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:33,744
<i>to the director
of national intelligence</i>

112
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,306
<i>at FBI headquarters.</i>

113
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:38,131
<i>We do not yet know
who is responsible,</i>

114
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,375
- <i>but multiple agencies...</i>
- That's a lie.

115
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:43,266
Okay, Lightman, we know
you knew the victim.

116
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,529
What else do you know?

117
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,398
That man was killed by Jimmy Doyle,

118
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:50,511
one of the most dangerous
bastards I've ever come across.

119
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,804
Doyle. Irish?

120
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:55,503
Belfast.

121
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,809
You okay, Foster?

122
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,908
Everything's fine.

123
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:02,459
The man that was killed by that bomb

124
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:05,713
was not a foss fuel entrepreneur.

125
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:09,321
He was british liaison
for counterterrorism at the Pentagon.

126
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,901
And 7 years ago he was my boss.

127
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,535
Okay, who is he to you, Foster?

128
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,495
Did you work at the Pentagon, too...

129
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,080
Oh, my God,

130
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,623
- You did.
- Dad?

131
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:23,128
Where you been?
I was worried sick.

132
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,213
I was stuck out in the mess
with everyone else. What's going on?

133
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,488
That's what we all want to know.

134
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:30,509
Look, you know, I'm sorry

135
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,122
about what you just went through,

136
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:34,263
but right now I need
a moment with my daughter.

137
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,451
After that, I'll figure out
how I'm gonna use you guys on this.

138
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,393
That's how it works,
so end of conversation.

139
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,116
That was a conversation?

140
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,323
Okay. All right.

141
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:49,403
How are you doing?

142
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:52,153
I'm sorry about Berkeley.

143
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,888
We'll do that another weekend.

144
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,493
We'll do it soon, I promise.

145
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:59,072
But right now,
I need you to do me a favor.

146
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:02,207
Do you have a friend that you
can stay with for a day or two?

147
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:04,775
Can it be a boy?

148
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,233
"Can it be a boy?"

149
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:09,819
I had no idea

150
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,717
our sessions were being
recorded back then.

151
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,364
Since we're so close, that means you,
scientifically speaking, of course,

152
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,120
are my blind spot,
which you well know.

153
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:20,278
- You don't believe me.
- Did I say that?

154
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:23,187
Emotionally, you want to believe me.
Scientifically, you can't be sure.

155
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,218
Please, don't go after those tapes.

156
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,608
It's not worth it.
Don't go to that stadium.

157
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,370
What's not worth it?

158
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,741
You have no idea who's behind this
or what this is really about.

159
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:39,039
Do you know who's behind this?

160
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:41,841
Drop it, Cal.

161
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:43,373
I'm not doing this.

162
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,579
All right.

163
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:47,538
Look, no one knows I'm doing this,
understand? No one.

164
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:00,827
Doyle?

165
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,351
Dr. Lightman.

166
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:04,788
7 years ago,

167
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:09,066
you were involved in the murder
of my wife and daughter.

168
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:10,806
Yeah, that's me.

169
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,376
Yeah.

170
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:17,623
Do you have a family now,
Dr. Lightman?

171
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:21,036
You already know the answer
to that question, don't you?

172
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:22,704
How old is she?

173
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:24,594
Your daughter, Emily.

174
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,869
- You leave my daughter alone.
- How old is she?

175
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:31,923
16.

176
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:47,738
I didn't plant that bomb
in Andrews' car.

177
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,608
Now you got my attention.

178
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,827
Sure, tracked him down,

179
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,951
I put the fear of God in him.

180
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:00,450
But he swore he didn't know
who killed my girls.

181
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,536
After I was done with him,

182
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,067
I tailed him to a corner store.

183
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:10,928
He bought this.

184
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,467
A throwaway phone.
Made 2 calls,

185
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:15,162
then tossed it.

186
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:17,801
That's my office.

187
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,919
- Yeah.
- And the other number I don't know.

188
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,472
It's untraceable.

189
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:25,970
Well, if you didn't kill Andrews,
Whoever did,

190
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:27,853
they made it look like your work.

191
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:33,495
You got 24 hours to find the
killer of my wife and daughter

192
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,166
Or you're a dead man.

193
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,113
Yeah, I need to show you something.
Can I show you something?

194
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,116
Go on.

195
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,041
Here.

196
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:54,204
Someone's trying to use my fear
of you to blackmail me.

197
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:55,658
But...

198
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:58,857
Now that we've met, it's kind
of a moot point, don't you think?

199
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,882
These tapes, what's on them?

200
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,400
It's me talking about...

201
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:07,596
My role in the death
of your wife and daughter.

202
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:10,913
Now, I'm gonna find

203
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:14,339
whoever made these tapes and they're
gonna tell me who killed your family.

204
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,486
I'll do that for your wife and daughter.
I won't for that.

205
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,050
For now.

206
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,473
Dr. Lightman gave me his phone

207
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,141
for track down Emily for him.

208
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,520
You okay?

209
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:53,943
Is there anything I can do?

210
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,065
No. Thanks.

211
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,239
<i>So you're the in-house shrink?</i>

212
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:04,282
I'm a psychologist.

213
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:06,148
Oh, yeah. Psi ops.

214
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,317
Let's see, dirty tricks brigade, eh?

215
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:12,666
- Speaking of dirty tricks...
- No, you see,

216
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,978
That wasn't supposed to happen.

217
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,546
Now that it has happened,
how do you feel?

218
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,172
Is this a plant?

219
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:22,300
I mean, is this supposed
to soften me up?

220
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:25,743
Yes. That's exactly what it is.

221
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,589
Well, it's working.

222
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:39,526
3 days ago, when I was undercover

223
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,622
In a bar in Boston,

224
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:46,134
four IRA men from Belfast
were there to talk

225
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:49,165
about a peace agreement
with their american money

226
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,371
who were feeling a pinch
from the war on terror.

227
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:52,875
And my read

228
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:56,313
on one of these IRA men,

229
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,682
Jimmy Doyle, was...

230
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:03,884
That he was about to ruin the peace.

231
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,349
And someone

232
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:10,515
in this building took that
as license to kill him.

233
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:13,204
Only the morons messed it up.

234
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,630
They killed his wife
and daughter instead.

235
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,859
How do you think I feel?

236
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,655
The paper says...

237
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:26,114
they caught the two men

238
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,174
who robbed and killed
Mary and Bernadette Doyle.

239
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:31,286
But darling, that's a cover-up.

240
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,188
That's two junkies with records framed
and flushed down the toilet as we speak.

241
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:37,042
Come on,
you're an intelligent woman.

242
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:39,057
You feel responsible.

243
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:40,861
Ashamed.

244
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:41,796
Guilty.

245
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:43,381
My daughter

246
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:46,259
is the same age
as that little dead girl.

247
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,095
That's empathy is healthy,
but it doesn't make you guilty.

248
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,308
So where is this Doyle now?

249
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:53,736
He got away.

250
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:58,149
- Are you sure he's a terrorist?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

251
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,316
Oh, even more so now we've
murdered his family.

252
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:38,228
<i>Porn?</i>

253
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:40,689
You are human.

254
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:43,733
You seem to be making
a speedy recovery.

255
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:45,694
What are you really working on?

256
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,683
Personal stuff.
It's my personal laptop.

257
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:51,564
Personal stuff.
In the middle of all this?

258
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,239
That's what I call
compartmentalization.

259
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:58,832
- They teach you that at the Pentagon?
- Can I help you with something, Eli?

260
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:00,957
Actually, you can...

261
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:02,082
Gillian.

262
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:10,281
- You hacked into... you can't do that!
- In my sleep.

263
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,974
Here's what I know.
In 2003, you were at the Pentagon

264
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,269
when Henry Andrews, the man whose blood
I just cleaned off my face,

265
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:22,637
Ordered you to evaluate
a member of his team,

266
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:26,192
Dr. Cal Lightman,
who was acting irrationally

267
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,645
and I quote, "in danger
of causing serious harm

268
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,406
to ongoing counterterrorist
operations."

269
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:35,707
It could have been worse.

270
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:39,082
It could have been porn.

271
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:48,340
<i>Lightman didn't believe
the robbery-homicide story.</i>

272
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:51,148
You mean the Pentagon's
cover-up story.

273
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,675
Those men were found guilty of
the murders of Mary

274
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,767
and Bernadette Doyle
by their peers in a court of law.

275
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,136
You know what I hear

276
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:01,186
in that official,
very un-Foster-like speech pattern?

277
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:03,563
Fear and doubt.

278
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:15,059
Lightman wanted to go public with
what he believed was the real story.

279
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,979
He wanted to blow the whistle
on a botched Pentagon ordered hit?

280
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,835
To prevent him from doing that,
or at least to discredit

281
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,751
his mental state if he tried,
his boss sent him to see me.

282
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,059
His boss... Henry Andrews...

283
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:35,319
The man who was killed
in that car bomb.

284
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,390
Did Lightman ever blow the whistle?

285
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:41,552
His life was in serious danger.

286
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,127
See, that doesn't sound
like Lightman.

287
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:48,359
A lot of what Lightman does these days
is because of what...

288
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,235
He didn't do back then.

289
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:51,654
Odd.

290
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,488
So I was almost killed
by a terrorist

291
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:57,409
who is after Lightman.

292
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:07,001
Jimmy Doyle killed Andrews.

293
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,174
You could be next, Dr. Lightman.

294
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:16,049
I don't talk to people
whose faces I can't see.

295
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:19,055
- You want the tapes back or not?
- How do I know you've even got them?

296
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,949
What do I have to do
for the rest of them?

297
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,400
Find Doyle.

298
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,238
Flush him out.

299
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:43,455
We'll take care of the rest.

300
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:45,742
Like you did the last time.

301
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,460
Who are you?

302
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:23,966
What?

303
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:26,435
The disk.

304
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:32,259
I'll save you the trouble
if you like.

305
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,538
Somewhere on there,

306
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,600
I called you a terrorist.

307
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,505
Terrorist scum I think it was.

308
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,780
At least I never killed
innocent women and children.

309
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,394
All fanatics wash their hands of the
innocent's blood in the cause's name.

310
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:49,893
Right?

311
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:56,523
Do me a favor.

312
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,697
You're no innocent.

313
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,265
No by any stretch
of the imagination.

314
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:14,378
I told you to go to Torres' place.

315
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:16,126
I will when she gets off work.

316
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:19,370
If it's safe enough here for everyone
else, it's safe enough for me.

317
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,595
- That's a fair point.
- What happened to your face?

318
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:24,432
I fell, officer!

319
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,547
- Where's Foster?
- Quit changing the subject.

320
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:30,436
- Where were you?
- I was working. And yes, on this bomb.

321
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,438
I can't tell you about it,
you know that.

322
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:35,692
So do me a favor, could you find
Foster for me, please?

323
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:37,318
Hi.

324
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:49,247
You must be Emily.

325
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:53,293
Hello.

326
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:55,457
This is Mr. Doyle.

327
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:02,847
I'll explain later.
Will you find Foster for me?

328
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:13,104
Let's talk about your family.

329
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:17,650
Why?

330
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:20,945
Your wife Zoe
and your daughter Emily.

331
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:22,447
Off limits.

332
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,317
It must be quite a strain...

333
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,372
juggling family
with the type of work you do.

334
00:21:31,497 --> 00:21:32,498
No, it's not.

335
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:34,676
Not if your family comes first,
it's not.

336
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:37,129
And not to mention the dangerous
set of circumstances

337
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,339
you clearly believe yourself
to be in right now.

338
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:46,137
I get it. It's loud and clear.
That's all I need to hear.

339
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,931
Now, you tell them I'll go quietly.

340
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,934
- Just leave my family alone.
- Dr. Lightman, that's not what I meant.

341
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:53,603
You're calling me paranoid?

342
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,147
I was referring to Doyle still
being out there somewhere.

343
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,269
You're trying to tell me something else,
right? Only you can't.

344
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,611
Why is that?

345
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:04,869
There it is again.

346
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:08,750
Thank you very much.

347
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,170
What's this?

348
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:21,175
This...

349
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:23,091
is Jimmy Doyle.

350
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,609
I know who it is.

351
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,867
He's not a threat to us.

352
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,716
Unless I fail to do right by him.

353
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:31,099
Do right by him?

354
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:37,188
Who did that to your face?

355
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,374
When we first met at the Pentagon,

356
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,964
who did you report to?

357
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:45,738
Andrews. You know that.

358
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:47,615
- Who else?
- No one else.

359
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,535
- Who did Andrews report to?
- He never told me.

360
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:53,930
This is really important.

361
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:55,783
I can see that.

362
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:59,283
But I still don't have
an answer for you.

363
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:03,308
Are you gonna tell me
what that man is doing here?

364
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:06,039
This is our one chance
to right a huge wrong

365
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:07,635
that we both played a part in.

366
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:11,681
You are not to blame for the murders
of that man's family, Cal.

367
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,018
I'm not talking about the murders.

368
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:19,147
Actually, I'm talking
about the cover-up afterwards.

369
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,815
I mean, me, that's one thing,
but you...

370
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,153
You're way better than that.

371
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:28,031
Which is something that's been
bothering me for a long time.

372
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:31,451
Now, you know, whatever it is

373
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:34,078
that you're hiding from me,
I forgive you.

374
00:23:34,531 --> 00:23:36,871
I have never hidden
anything from you, Cal.

375
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:39,542
Let it go.

376
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:44,847
Why don't you ask Doyle
about Andrews?

377
00:23:45,713 --> 00:23:47,675
'Cause I've always valued
your opinion.

378
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:01,357
Jimmy Doyle, Gillian Foster.

379
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,319
What are you making him do?

380
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:10,114
I just need to find my wife
and daughter's killer.

381
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,783
To avenge them.

382
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:15,329
Are you prepared to hunt
and kill another man?

383
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,403
I don't believe that. Even if he does
have a gun to your head.

384
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:20,773
You know, 7 years ago,
I helped murder...

385
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:23,006
this man's wife and child.

386
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,624
And now I would like to know exactly
who it was that I helped.

387
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:38,476
- Why now?
- Why now what?

388
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:41,299
- Kill Andrews?
- I didn't kill Andrews.

389
00:24:41,424 --> 00:24:43,189
I just talked to the man.

390
00:24:49,984 --> 00:24:52,627
Then why wait 7 years to come back
and do any of this?

391
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:57,232
When Mary and bernadette were murdered,
I died that day, too.

392
00:24:57,971 --> 00:25:00,915
I went from grief to drink,
drugs, you name it.

393
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,670
Member of a terrorist organization.

394
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,877
God knows how many lives
you're ruined, so, please.

395
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:07,731
Bloody hell!

396
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,906
How did you track Andrews down?

397
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:13,386
I got his name from the lawyer
who represented the two junkies.

398
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,430
He framed for the murder
of my girls.

399
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:17,722
Who is he?

400
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Where is he?

401
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,316
Almonds.
It smells like a bakery.

402
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:45,654
Howard Moss!

403
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:04,478
Bomb!

404
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:25,231
Almonds.

405
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,076
C-4 smells like almonds.

406
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,050
Cal, you okay?

407
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:50,233
I could listen to that all day.

408
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,651
I thought we were done.

409
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:54,749
- Who's threatening my family?
- Dr. Lightman...

410
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,490
Now, you see, I can see it
in your eyes, all over your face.

411
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,783
It's as clear as day.
I'd just like to know

412
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:02,536
who it is and what it is
I'm dealing with here.

413
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:06,592
I asked you about your family
like any therapist

414
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:08,192
would ask any patient.

415
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:15,466
Maybe you have difficulty looking
for a lie because there isn't one.

416
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:19,428
I thought your lot called
patients clients these days.

417
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,793
Listen,

418
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,760
you don't have to talk
about your family with me.

419
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:26,510
But you should find someone.

420
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:29,276
You know, my wife...

421
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:33,943
She doesn't know about any of this.

422
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,581
Would you like to talk to her
about it if you could?

423
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:42,365
No, I don't mean
about my work in general,

424
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,537
I mean about this Doyle mess.

425
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:45,705
So do I.

426
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:49,834
I would not like to tell her about it.
It would hurt her too much.

427
00:27:50,414 --> 00:27:53,045
Why did you choose to work
in counterterrorism?

428
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:55,018
It is a choice.

429
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,409
The power of terrorists,
it lies in the fear of the innocent.

430
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,477
I want to...

431
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,558
take that power away, you know?

432
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:07,143
Why?

433
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,232
I got a daughter.

434
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,845
You know that in the war
against terror,

435
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,158
there's often collateral damage.

436
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:24,354
As awful as that sounds.

437
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,787
I'm sorry.
What are you saying?

438
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,918
Some collateral damage
can be avoided.

439
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:32,418
You talking about my Emily?

440
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,757
We would be irresponsible...

441
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:37,660
not to talk about Emily.

442
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,105
Bloody hell.

443
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,585
That's all we need.

444
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,245
Get... No, I'm good. I'm good.
I can help myself up.

445
00:28:59,477 --> 00:29:01,113
Sod off, you! Go on.

446
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,231
All right, look, you...

447
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:10,873
you're gonna be all over the bloody
Internet in a minute, so take that.

448
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,197
Lay low, and don't answer that
unless her name comes up.

449
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,962
You two are quite the pair,
aren't you?

450
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,255
Are you still here?

451
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:21,819
You all right?

452
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:28,400
Good morning.

453
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,608
Yesterday, at 3:47 PM,

454
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,982
a bomb composed of high-grade C-4

455
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:38,122
made in the style and MO
of what we strongly suspect,

456
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:40,410
according to our friends
from British Intelligence,

457
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:43,936
to be the work of a terrorist
named James, aka Jimmy, Doyle.

458
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:45,950
That's a patent lie for a starter.

459
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,818
Excuse me? Dr. Lightman.

460
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:52,843
- Who the hell are you?
- Dr. Cal Lightman, deception expert.

461
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:55,065
He knows who I am.
You know who I am, don't you?

462
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,669
Why would you lie about that?

463
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:01,656
Because you say excuse me?

464
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,855
I mean, really,

465
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,761
if we excused you for the lies you tell,
where would it end, then?

466
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:17,648
There.

467
00:30:18,376 --> 00:30:20,537
That's the man Lightman saw
that we didn't.

468
00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:23,487
The one man there who knew
who's responsible for that car bomb.

469
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:27,191
This press conference is over.
It's enough.

470
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:29,243
What are you hiding, Mr. Prosser?

471
00:30:30,277 --> 00:30:32,121
I want the room cleared, now.

472
00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:37,835
Dr. Lightman just asked you
a question on national television.

473
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,996
I want to give you the opportunity
to answer him now, quickly,

474
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:43,883
before I go back on national TV
to defend you and to discredit him.

475
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,886
- Do you have more information?
- I'm not taking any questions.

476
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:52,475
All right, Lightman.

477
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:54,977
This is a courtesy
to your resume and your FBI status,

478
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:58,121
both of which are now on the line.
You have a question for him?

479
00:30:58,246 --> 00:31:00,046
- Make it quick.
- Right.

480
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:03,736
Doyle is not a terrorist threat.

481
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,377
He's a wanted terrorist

482
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:08,407
from a known terrorist organization.

483
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,992
He did'nt kill Andrews.

484
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,037
We have evidence
that links him to the car bomb

485
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,440
and the apartment bomb.

486
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:16,665
I have scientific proof that says
he has nothing to do with either bomb.

487
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:18,246
Scientific proof.

488
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,127
I spoke to the man.

489
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:23,172
Which means
that your evidence was cooked.

490
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:26,368
- There's a shocker.
- You know where Doyle is?

491
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,552
- Because if you know where he is...
- Mr. Prosser,

492
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,222
how was St. Patrick's day, 2003,
for you?

493
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:32,604
Excuse me?

494
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:34,540
You know, the day that Doyle's wife

495
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:37,019
and 9-year-old daughter
were shot dead in Boston.

496
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,689
Were you working at the Pentagon?

497
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,278
- Put that one in the yes column.
- Yes, I was at the Pentagon then.

498
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,990
What happened to your former
colleague Henry Andrews yesterday?

499
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:54,652
He was tragically killed,
murdered, by a terrorist car bomb.

500
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:56,506
He, who was on his way to tell me

501
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:59,703
what happened that day in Boston,
but was killed by somebody

502
00:31:59,828 --> 00:32:01,877
who couldn't afford the truth
to get out. How's that?

503
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,421
Those are very serious
allegations, Lightman.

504
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,996
Wild allegations.

505
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,306
Based in science.

506
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,445
Right, then.

507
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,357
7 minutes by FBI chopper to my lab,

508
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,976
where we can do this properly
and away from the press.

509
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:21,105
I can even arrange a couple
of FBI agents as escort if you want.

510
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:24,573
I don't think that'll be
necessary, will it, Richard?

511
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,277
I've got nothing to hide.

512
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,706
There's nothing to this.

513
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:42,459
<i>It's child's play
for a man like you, I know.</i>

514
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,627
Right.

515
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,425
Where's the rest of these?

516
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,799
Your office?

517
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:50,551
Home?

518
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,472
Safe deposit box?

519
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:55,723
Home it is.

520
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:58,934
2003, the Pentagon.
What was your job?

521
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:00,561
That's classified.

522
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,214
But Henry Andrews...

523
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:04,940
he reported to you, correct?

524
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:06,790
That's also classified.

525
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,168
<i>All right, how about this?</i>

526
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:11,572
<i>Today, your job is...</i>

527
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,083
Assistant deputy director

528
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,254
over the department
of national intelligence.

529
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:18,412
Correct?

530
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,751
That's correct.

531
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,957
Do you like your job?

532
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:25,470
I need your words, Mr. Prosser,
for the machine.

533
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:27,705
It's not as smart as I am.

534
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,340
Though I say so myself.

535
00:33:29,928 --> 00:33:31,620
<i>I'm proud of the work I do.</i>

536
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:35,174
<i>But you'd like the director's job
even more, wouldn't you?</i>

537
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:36,472
<i>Is that right?</i>

538
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:39,058
Blimey. There.

539
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,727
That was almost a moment
of total honesty there.

540
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,997
- You all right? You need to lie down?
- Excuse me.

541
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:46,690
Mr. Prosser. Jimmy Doyle...

542
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,358
He says he's at your home
with Mrs. Prosser.

543
00:33:58,563 --> 00:34:01,747
I'd take that call
if I were you, Mr. Prosser.

544
00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:03,916
If you love Mrs. Prosser, that is.

545
00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:09,042
Take it, anyway.

546
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,264
I do not negotiate with terrorists.

547
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,724
That's one way
of getting rid of the wife.

548
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,379
How dare you.

549
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:25,970
I love my wife.

550
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:28,169
We need to send a team to my house.

551
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,985
- Doyle's not at Prosser's house.
- Where is he?

552
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,112
Don't know.

553
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,489
Polygraph's a decoy, too.

554
00:34:36,163 --> 00:34:38,143
Lightman needs Prosser
to focus on beating that

555
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:40,452
so he can't mask the truth
with his body language.

556
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:43,809
<i>Your wife's not so keen
to talk to you either, Mr. Prosser,</i>

557
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,500
<i>now she knows what you're done,</i>

558
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:48,364
<i>who you really are.</i>

559
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,145
You two are in this together.

560
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,340
You're aiding and abetting
a wanted terrorist.

561
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:56,969
- Wanted for what?
- The murder of Henry Andrews.

562
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,930
Now, listen.

563
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,241
You see this?

564
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,645
This was delivered to my office

565
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,941
less than a minute before Andrews
blew past my window.

566
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,309
You see this?

567
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:19,521
This was given to me
a short time later,

568
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,453
by one of your goons at a stadium.

569
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:25,199
You taped my sessions
with Dr. Lightman

570
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:28,083
without my knowledge.
Why?

571
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:30,753
You authorized the assassination

572
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,119
of Jimmy Doyle back in 2003,

573
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:34,631
based on my intelligence.

574
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:37,767
That's anger,
and it's directed at Lightman.

575
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:41,597
Prosser based his kill order
on Lightman's science.

576
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:43,932
<i>When your people killed</i>

577
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,350
Doyle's family,

578
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,478
you knew he'd be back one day.

579
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:51,441
You planned to use these to blackmail me
to draw Doyle into your crosshairs.

580
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:54,165
And so, the lawyer, he tips you off.

581
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:56,528
Doyle is back in town,
he's going after Andrews.

582
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,990
So before Andrews could
lead Doyle back to you...

583
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:03,611
No more Andrews.

584
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,372
Made to look like Doyle's work,
and again boom,

585
00:36:06,823 --> 00:36:08,073
no more lawyer.

586
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:10,709
Another loose end taken care of.

587
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:13,892
You can't prove anything.

588
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:16,565
I'm not trying to.
I'm not trying to prove anything.

589
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,925
Not in a court of law.

590
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:20,160
Right? Anyway, I'm not that naive.

591
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:22,679
No, I just...
I wanted the truth, for myself.

592
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:25,432
Now I've got it, you can go.
Have a nice life.

593
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:28,310
What about Doyle?

594
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:32,413
You there?

595
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:36,393
He's gone again.

596
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,689
That's all right.
He'll be back, sooner or later.

597
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:41,990
Yeah, you should give us
a call when he shows up.

598
00:36:51,173 --> 00:36:52,573
I want protection.

599
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:56,255
In return for what?

600
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:57,788
And immunity.

601
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,511
I never knew this situation in Boston
was going to become such a mess.

602
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,692
When I found out
that Doyle was back,

603
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:07,641
I told Finch that he needed
to clean up his own trash.

604
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,102
Finch. Is that a code
or a real name?

605
00:37:10,621 --> 00:37:11,419
Code.

606
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:13,278
I don't know his real name.

607
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:17,360
But I never told him
to kill Andrews and the lawyer

608
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,485
or Doyle.

609
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,360
I never used those words.

610
00:37:20,878 --> 00:37:22,447
I never said that.

611
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:26,256
Call Finch.

612
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,301
You better hurry or you'll miss him.

613
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:47,267
That's all of them.
Send my best to Dr. Foster...

614
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:48,724
Gillian.

615
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:54,271
Where is he?

616
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,725
Parkview Hotel.

617
00:37:58,071 --> 00:37:58,942
Room 344.

618
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:27,387
Let's have a look
at your face, shall we.

619
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:28,513
You.

620
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:34,242
The one cabdriver
I have never forgotten.

621
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,297
Weapon.

622
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:38,435
Slowly,

623
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:41,199
finger and thumb.

624
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:56,291
Finch?

625
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:58,085
Finch?

626
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:02,142
It's like a small bird.

627
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:04,633
I was just following orders.

628
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:11,738
Look at her.

629
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:16,401
My Bernadette...

630
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:19,276
would have turned 16 today.

631
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,417
Wait...

632
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:25,846
I didn't mean for...

633
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,468
You grabbed the gun when I...

634
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:31,465
I'm sorry.

635
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:33,718
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,843
He is, you know.
He is sorry.

637
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:39,692
I can't tell
how genuine it is, so...

638
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:44,134
It's up to you, Doyle, really.

639
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:45,424
What?

640
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:49,553
I am sorry, too.

641
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:04,313
How did you know
the weapon wasn't loaded?

642
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:07,906
I didn't.

643
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:12,138
Why wasn't it?

644
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,173
Love of revenge...

645
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,872
killed my girls.

646
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,285
And so Prosser gets immunity.

647
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:35,390
Does he, hell.

648
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:38,730
Why didn't you talk about
what happened to my girls that day?

649
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:41,646
I have girls of my own, mate.

650
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,434
I'll never get over my hatred
for you people.

651
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,586
I was the one that told him.
I said that...

652
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,158
the only way to fight terrorism

653
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:05,243
was to fight like a terrorist,
and I meant that.

654
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:10,889
So while I read Doyle as a threat,
I knew they'd kill him.

655
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:12,659
I wanted them to kill him.

656
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:16,098
Do you think you can
forgive yourself?

657
00:41:19,905 --> 00:41:21,591
So were you ever gonna tell me?

658
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,078
He came to me...

659
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,086
in the middle of the night,

660
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:47,955
before our first session.

661
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:51,383
Not to my office, to my house.

662
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:55,073
My house.

663
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,732
I'd never seen him before
and I never saw him again.

664
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,774
He told me to do what I had
to do to keep you quiet,

665
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:11,984
or Doyle wouldn't be the only man
to lose his wife and daughter.

666
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:18,569
If I told you that it would have been
proof positive of a cover-up,

667
00:42:18,694 --> 00:42:20,402
and you would have never let go.

668
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:25,478
So...

669
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:32,081
I couldn't let you do that.

670
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:34,539
To you,

671
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:36,381
your family.

672
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:39,349
You'd never have gotten
to blow the whistle.

673
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,126
He would have cut you down...

674
00:42:41,665 --> 00:42:43,435
before you put it to your lips.

675
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:47,522
So, all that talk...

676
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:51,526
about you being a bad liar,
That's just an act.

677
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:53,972
Right? That's a lie.

678
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,990
Depends on the lie.
