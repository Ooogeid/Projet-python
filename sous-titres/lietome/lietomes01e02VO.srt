3
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:20,578
Dr. Lightman, the guys from Homeland Security are here.

4
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:25,993
They want your assessment
of the new handheld polygraph.

5
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:28,007
I'll be right there.

6
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:33,587
Do you work at the Department
of Homeland Security?

7
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:35,096
Yes.

8
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:49,079
Do you have black hair?
Yes.

9
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,384
See, the handheld measures cardio
and galvanic skin response.

10
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:56,694
It's the only polygraph ever developed
with this kind of portability.

11
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:58,570
Oh, not quite.

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,958
Uh, Cal, you know Secretary Miller
from Homeland Security.

13
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:01,958
Good to see you.

14
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,858
And this is Tom Whitmore,
the new TSA deputy.

15
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:07,791
Uh... what the hell is this?

16
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,192
It's a lie detector.

17
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:11,316
The West Africans used them first.

18
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:14,159
When you're on trial, you held the egg in your hands,

19
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:17,272
and if it broke, it's a sign of anxiety.

20
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:19,119
You were found guilty.

21
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:22,292
Well, I'd say our handheld's a little more advanced.

22
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:25,834
Well, unfortunately,
both devices suffer from the same problem.

23
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:28,261
Uh, Ms. Cooper, would you mind?

24
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,425
May I?

25
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,058
LIGHTCould you ask the control questions again, please?

26
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:39,225
What are you doing?

27
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:43,380
Hi.

28
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:49,120
Do you work at the Department of Homeland Security?

29
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,225
Uh, yes.

30
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:56,259
Do you have black hair?

31
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,592
Yes.

32
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:02,498
The problem with all polygraph tests
is false positives.

33
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,459
Innocent people can fail
if they feel an increase in any emotion--

34
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,025
anger, fear,

35
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:08,958
sexual arousal.

36
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:10,292
Not just guilt.

37
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:14,958
Your polygraph is no better than the egg at telling us which emotion it's responding to.

38
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:16,425
No.

39
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,192
I've been wanting to try that for years.

40
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,259
See,

41
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:24,135
you would have been found guilty,
but you were just angry.

42
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:27,051
You should be, uh, spending your money studying the face.

43
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,758
43 muscles combine to produce a possibility
of 10,000 expressions.

44
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,958
Now, if you learn them all,
you don't need a polygraph.

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,459
How much did we spend on this damn project anyway?

46
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,125
Uh, not much.

47
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,582
I'm sure we can recoup most of our costs.

48
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,691
Now, that was lovely.

49
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,019
What?

50
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,325
A gestural retreat.

51
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,392
What's that?

52
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,246
His step backwards.

53
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:55,558
Means he doesn't believe a word he just said.

54
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:56,762
He's lying.

55
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:59,159
Well, I'm not a crook.

56
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:01,459
I've earned everything I've got.

00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,571
What do you see?

60
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:51,421
I see a skeptical, emotionally distant scientist
obsessing over facial twitches.

61
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,562
Why are you doing micro expression training?

62
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,201
Well, I got it set at triple speed.

63
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,764
You know, when you try and hide your emotions,
they leak out at a fifth of a second?

64
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:02,242
Well, this is testing me at a 15th of a second.

65
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,467
Impressive.

66
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:06,972
You know who else is impressive

67
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:10,836
on that thing? Is this another attempt to get me
to take Ms. Torres under my wing?

68
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:12,613
You need somebody to back you on the military case.

69
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:13,870
I got you for that.

70
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,704
I'll be courtside with Earl White.

71
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:19,271
It's a freshman shooting guard,
hottest NBA prospect in the country.

72
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:23,571
College Athletic Association wants us to find out
if he took a bribe to play for GWCU.

73
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:25,723
Well, we got a meeting at Fort Meade in half an hour.

74
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:29,837
Look, I'll... I'll meet you there later,
okay, but let's get Torres involved.

75
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,837
She's a natural.

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,437
She's got phenomenal instincts.

77
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,343
Doesn't mean she knows the science.

78
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,437
Dr. Foster said you wanted to see me?

79
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,803
What do you see?

80
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,244
Anger.

81
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:54,963
Fear.

82
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,418
Sadness.

83
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:07,371
Let's go.

84
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:26,520
<i>Specialist Sheila Lake has served
<i>with the 23rd Mountain Division for three years,</i>

85
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,715
two of those in Afghanistan.

86
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:32,837
Lake is asserting that she was raped
by her platoon leader,

87
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,474
Staff Sergeant Russell Scott.

88
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:38,471
We'd like you to find out if the allegation's true.

89
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,237
Lake.

90
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:42,668
Lake!

91
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:45,586
Grab your gear and report to the staff judge advocate.

92
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,404
Is Sergeant Scott being court-martialed?

93
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:53,803
We're not there yet.

94
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:57,851
Sergeant Scott's leadership is crucial to the tribal intelligence missions

95
00:05:57,851 --> 00:06:00,087
we're running on the Pakistani border.

96
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,339
We start a court- martial proceeding,

97
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,704
he'll be off the line for six months.

98
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:07,623
Then, I'm afraid we can't help you.

99
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:09,204
Excuse me?

100
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:10,970
Hire us when you want the truth.

101
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,937
waste taxpayers' money if that's not what you're after?

102
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,970
Dr. Lightman,

103
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:17,756
my first concern is the safety
of every woman in that platoon.

104
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:19,437
That's why we're investigating.

105
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:22,018
But Sergeant Scott passed a polygraph.

106
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,447
Yeah, well, I bet his grandmother
didn't think he did it, either.

107
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:25,808
That's equally reliable.

108
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:28,704
Look, Sergeant Scott's set to redeploy in three days.

109
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:31,704
He's the only commander who can recognize hostiles on that border.

110
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:35,674
Without him, the mission's more dangerous
for every soldier in the 23rd.

111
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:39,052
I certainly can't have a rapist in charge of the females in that platoon, 

112
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:41,001
but if I'm going to pull
Sergeant Scott off the line,

113
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,527
I need to know this woman is telling the truth.

114
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,276
<i>Six-five, moves like he's five-one.</i>

115
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:58,164
Could dunk at ten, won the state championship at 14.

116
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:02,009
National high school player of the year
the last three years. 

117
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,866
I would not have pegged you for a hoops geek.

118
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,514
You know the fifth-grade boy
with the vintage Dr. J poster

119
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:09,170
and the instant recall of his career stats?

120
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:10,571
I was that boy.

121
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:11,603
Dr. Foster?

122
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,626
I'm Jeremy Levine with the Athletic Association.

123
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:14,770
Thanks for coming down.

124
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:17,588
Who doesn't enjoy a day
watching Earl White do his thing?

125
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:19,170
Howard Taft certainly does.

126
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:23,704
He's the alumni booster who allegedly paid Earl $50,000 to come and play for Carver.

127
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:25,567
We'd like to investigate this quietly.

128
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:26,804
Earl's a good kid.

129
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:28,149
He lost his mom last year.

130
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,604
He's raising his brother on his own.

131
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:30,970
Plus, he's gonna go pro this spring,

132
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:33,615
and you don't want any more bad press
for the "one and done" rule. 

133
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:36,229
Making kids go to college for a year before they turn pro

134
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,638
forces them to take high school more seriously.

135
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:41,416
It also forces young superstars
to play a year of college ball,

136
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,263
jacking up ratings and revenues.

137
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:46,534
Loker here has a hard time with half-truths.

138
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,097
You hungry? Huh?
Huh?

139
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,770
Earl White, Dr. Gillian Foster
and her associate, Eli Loker.

140
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:01,537
You folks are the lie guys, right?

141
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,937
More the truth guys, but it depends on the case.

142
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:06,201
Do you have some time to chat?

143
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,164
You know, I have to take my little brother home,

144
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:10,004
and I got an Econ midterm tomorrow.

145
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,338
Need to get with the books, you know?

146
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:12,604
But hit my cell later.

147
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,504
Anything I can do to clear my name.

148
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,704
Appreciate it.

149
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:20,471
Any quick reads?

150
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:21,658
His speech was hurried,

151
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:23,536
and he brought that basketball to his chest,

152
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,070
creating a barrier between us.

153
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,504
Those are both signs of anxiety.

154
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,248
Well, that's something
any college athlete might feel

155
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:31,070
when he's been accused of taking a bribe.

156
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:32,324
We're not magicians.

157
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:33,627
We're scientists.

158
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:37,604
We'll need to talk to Earl and the booster
to spot any conclusive signs of lying.

159
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,425
I'm not naive, okay?

160
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:50,638
When you sign up to be one of four women
in a platoon of 30 guys,

161
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,471
guys who aren't gonna see
another woman for six months,

162
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:57,638
well... like they say in Girl Scouts,

163
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,337
"Be prepared."

164
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,770
So, you were harassed?

165
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:03,404
Porn in the latrines...

166
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:06,271
Jody calls.

167
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:07,417
Jody calls?

168
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:10,638
* I taught that bitch her left then right *

169
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:12,271
* Nailed her ass

170
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,104
* Then left last night. * Got it.

171
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,486
Yeah.

172
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:18,504
Did Staff Sergeant Scott participate in any of this?

173
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:22,141
He didn't make jokes or anything, but...

174
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,937
oh, his hands were everywhere.

175
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,803
He liked to walk in on us while we were changing,

176
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:30,903
if we were in the showers.

177
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,819
Tell us about the attack.

178
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:47,836
I was, uh... I was on my way back from a workout.

179
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,671
Ran into him behind the mess.

180
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:55,770
And he ordered me to strip.

181
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,671
He grabbed me.

182
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:03,364
He pinned me down.

183
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:07,937
And he assaulted me.

184
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:14,903
I was sexually assaulted.

185
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,350
Hey, what's up with the mime act?

186
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,303
LIGHTYou ask the questions, I observe.

187
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:27,070
Dr. Lightman finds asking questions distracting.

188
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,795
He prefers to watch.

189
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,304
You finish the psych profile on the guy she's accused?

190
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,304
Nice to see you, too.

191
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,655
What's his problem?

192
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:40,704
"Friendly fire."

193
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,037
"Collateral damage."

194
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,371
You can start with the lies in the language.

195
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:48,214
Bet they're not gonna end there.

196
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,537
Last Tuesday?

197
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:52,170
I went to dinner.

198
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:54,137
I had a few drinks at the NCO Club.

199
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,639
I stopped by the PX, and then headed back to the barracks.

200
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,903
Tell me again-- start with drinks.

201
00:10:58,937 --> 00:11:00,837
Drinks, PX, barracks.

202
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,937
Toothpaste and deodorant.

203
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,762
I have the receipt.

204
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,150
You weren't anywhere near the mess hall?

205
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,041
I just said I wasn't.

206
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,472
And you're telling me you didn't attack Specialist Lake?

207
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:08,682
That's exactly what I'm saying, 

208
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:10,504
and while we're on the subject... LIGHTOkay.

209
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,471
That's good.

210
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,455
Thanks for your time.

211
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:20,471
Hey, you.

212
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:24,115
Whoa, quite a bicep you have there.

213
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:26,504
You must really love the weight room, huh?

214
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:31,514
I don't normally mix business with pleasure, but...

215
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,463
well

216
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:38,310
And I was wondering you fancy grabbing a drink later or...?

217
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:43,304
Uh, I'm not gay.

218
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,237
And isn't this a little inappropriate?

219
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,770
Absolutely.

220
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:48,237
Sorry.

221
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,803
Right.

222
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:51,104
Excuse me.

223
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:59,271
What the hell was that? I love a man in uniform, you know?

224
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:02,756
The rape was unplanned, one time,
with no additional violence.

225
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,604
That suggests a power assertive rapist,

226
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:06,471
somebody who is obsessed with masculinity,

227
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:08,337
who needs others to see him as a man.

228
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:10,471
If Sergeant Scott fit the profile,

229
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:14,441
he would have reacted to my overture
with one emotion-- disgust.

230
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,371
There was no disgust, just surprise.

231
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,656
Correct-- eyebrows up, jaw down.

232
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,937
<i>Okay, but... the guy was totally amped up.</i>

233
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,050
Yeah, but he showed no deception leakage,

234
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,504
right, no sign of lying.

235
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,562
He looked like he wanted to throw me across the room.

236
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:29,970
A man charged with rape is even more likely
to be angry if he's innocent.

237
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:31,803
Well, they can't both be telling the truth.

238
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:33,209
They're not.

239
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:38,571
Sheila Lake made two mouth shrugs
when she was describing the rape.

240
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:41,903
<i>That's a classic gestural slip.</i>

241
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,304
It means she has no confidence in her words.

242
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:47,357
The woman was lying.

243
00:12:57,672 --> 00:13:00,186
I was sexually assaulted.

244
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,349
You really think
a woman would lie about rape?

245
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,944
Unpleasant truths, human mortality, a moustache on a woman--

246
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,772
three things we'd all prefer to ignore.

247
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:13,775
FBI crime reports have found that eight percent of rape allegations are false.

248
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:18,726
Okay, but the army vets I worked with at TSA said
that sexual assault was a big problem.

249
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,345
It doesn't explain the gestural slip.

250
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:23,042
Lake's also not exhibiting
any of the emotions a rape victim

251
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:25,601
typically displays when recounting her story.

252
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:29,540
No shame... no fear.

253
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:34,239
We should be seeing a lot of activity in the forehead,
but there isn't any.

254
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,059
Maybe she's got post-traumatic stress.

255
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,193
Emotional numbing might explain
her inability to express her feelings...

256
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,705
But not the mouth shrug.

257
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,915
Look, I'm telling you, there's something off
about Sergeant Scott.

258
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:48,868
You know, I once had actors play out the testimony 
from a rape case in front of 30 federal judges.

259
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:52,755
And you know the biggest predictor of whether they believed the man or the woman?

260
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:55,279
The gender of the judge.

261
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,570
You think I'm saying he's guilty

262
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,613
'cause I'm a woman?

263
00:13:57,613 --> 00:14:01,798
Me, Darwin, and 2,000 years of evolutionary biology.

264
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,454
Well, I think what Dr. Lightman is trying to say is

265
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:05,476
that it's important not to let what you bring in the room

266
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:06,935
affect what you see in the room.

267
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:08,560
Dr. Lightman?

268
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:09,906
What is it?

269
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:11,101
Harassment report.

270
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,654
The platoon's equal opportunity rep

271
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:13,872
just sent it over.

272
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:15,963
Looks like it was filed anonymously last fall.

273
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:21,917
It alleges Sergeant Scott surprised women in the showers
and entered their barracks unannounced.

274
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:24,496
Hmm, backs up Lake's story.

275
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:32,310
You know, generally it's not a good idea
to call your boss an idiot.

276
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,493
I didn't say you were an idi...

277
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:35,241
But your buccinator did.

278
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:39,106
That's not... Oh, that's
a pretty impressive combination of contempt and disgust. 

279
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:42,006
I'm... I'm s... I...

280
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:44,207
Apology accepted.

281
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,433
Head back to Fort Meade

282
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:49,568
and check into the personnel files
of the woman and the sergeant.

283
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,540
And hang in there.

284
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:57,306
You should consider going a little easier on Torres.

285
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:58,282
LIGHTWhy?

286
00:14:58,282 --> 00:14:59,938
She's all false positives.

287
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:01,473
See, that's the trouble with naturals.

288
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:02,903
They don't see what's missing.

289
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,187
They're all instinct and no science.

290
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:07,686
I'll have a falafel sandwich, please.

291
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:08,744
An Italian ice.

292
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,127
Grape.

293
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,930
You wash your hands today?

294
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:18,012
Uh, yeah, of course.

295
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:22,062
Do you have any kind of pain in your neck?

296
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:24,034
Uh, no. Why?

297
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,437
People touch it when they lie.

298
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,639
It's a classic manipulator.

299
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,705
You been to the bathroom today?

300
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:34,705
Cal.

301
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:35,872
Uh, no.

302
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:38,113
Oh, great.

303
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,705
Anybody else want a side of feces?

304
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,660
Anybody?!

305
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,306
Side of feces?!

306
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,572
If an alum took me here,

307
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:51,170
I would want to play hoops for Carver.

308
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,323
I bet it made an impression on Earl White.

309
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,416
Why is it guys named White are always black

310
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,411
and guys named Black are always white?

311
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,705
Am I going to be sorry you're here?

312
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:01,146
Barry White, Jack Black.

313
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:04,398
Does your radical honesty pledge mean
you have to say everything you think?

314
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:05,943
It's the only way to be truly honest.

315
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,942
Let's turn it off while we're working, shall we?

316
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:10,191
Now, what do we know about the booster?

317
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:11,770
Uh, Howard Taft,

318
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,739
forty-five,

319
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,534
made his money on Internet job boards,

320
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:17,324
led the funding campaign for Carver's new athletic center.

321
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:20,148
Apparently he likes giving back.

322
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:24,373
Mr. Taft, thanks for agreeing to talk with us.

323
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:27,639
Always a pleasure to talk Carver basketball, Dr. Foster.

324
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:30,774
Hey.

325
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,993
Oh, championship ring. Sweet.

326
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,607
Must have cost a fortune online.

327
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:40,505
Actually, I, uh, I earned it
riding the pine for the '86 team.

328
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:43,624
What's that?

329
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:44,271
It's a, uh,

330
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,972
voice stress analyzer.

331
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,812
It measures pitch and gauges anxiety.

332
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:52,033
We find it's less about what you say than how you say it.

333
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:55,829
Now, tell us about your relationship with Earl White.

334
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:05,139
He ordered me to strip.

335
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:06,306
He grabbed me...

336
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,572
Oh, sorry.

337
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:11,183
These are Specialist Lake's platoon mates.

338
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,739
Hi.

339
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,346
Thanks for coming in.

340
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:15,972
I want to conduct individual interviews,

341
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:18,046
so if you could come with me,
you two stay here.

342
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:19,724
Thanks, Heidi.

343
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:36,012
...pinned me down.

344
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:39,572
And he assaulted me.

345
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:44,406
I was sexually assaulted.

346
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,530
You finish the vocal stress analysis on Taft?

347
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,091
Yeah.

348
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,460
Check it out.

349
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,778
Hey. Oh, championship ring.

350
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:06,341
Sweet. Must have cost a fortune online.

351
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:11,839
Actually, I... I earned it
riding the pine for the '86 team.

352
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:14,788
Typical vocal stress on a typical question.

353
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:16,512
That's Taft's vocal stress baseline.

354
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,383
And given how irritating most people find you...

355
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:19,794
It's a high tolerance baseline.

356
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:22,957
He'd have to be extremely anxious
for his pitch to spike above it, so...

357
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:24,605
applying the baseline...

358
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,499
You can see from the spikes that Taft had three moments of extreme anxiety. 

359
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:28,373
Let me guess.

360
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:30,306
That's when he denied bribing our basketball phenom.

361
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,406
Yep.
Indistinguishable to the ear, but...

362
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,572
And, no, I didn't bribe Earl White.

363
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:39,778
Really, I didn't give Earl a penny.

364
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:41,139
A bribe?

365
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:42,739
I barely know the kid.

366
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:46,118
Thanks to the technology,
we can see the stress in Taft's voice.

367
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:47,672
The data suggests young Mr. White

368
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:48,972
just came into a lot of money.

369
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,590
But we've seen no uptick in Earl's spending habits.

370
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,558
I talked to his friends.

371
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:53,943
The guy's got no bling,

372
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:55,821
he lives in a walk-up with his brother,

373
00:18:55,821 --> 00:18:59,543
he takes the bus... Earl's got
a big payday coming as soon as he turns pro.

374
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:02,117
Why take Taft's money if he's not going to spend it?

375
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,024
The psychology's inconsistent.

376
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:05,891
We need to get inside Earl's head.

377
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,678
You want me to pull recent interview footage,

378
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:09,896
see if he leaks anything
when he talks about playing for Carver?

379
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,081
Yeah.

380
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,540
What's that last sound wave?

381
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:18,440
Always a pleasure to talk Carver basketball, Dr. Foster.

382
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:20,234
That is when Taft met you.

383
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,282
See how the graph is all scrunched up?

384
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:24,306
It indicates arousal.

385
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:28,087
Apparently the pine was not the only thing our aging jock wanted to ride.

386
00:19:28,137 --> 00:19:29,695
Hey, can I...?

387
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,455
Please.

388
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,661
Staff Sergeant Scott has a past.

389
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:37,053
He has a criminal record?

390
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:38,492
A long one.

391
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:40,699
I thought you couldn't get into the army with a record.

392
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:43,662
You can't, unless they grant you what's called a moral waiver.

393
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,140
It used to be just for misdemeanors,

394
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,661
but the army is so stretched for recruits

395
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:48,294
that they're using them to let felons in.

396
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:49,627
Moral waiver.

397
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:51,244
The army really has a way with words.

398
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:54,670
Uh, Sergeant Scott was arrested
for possession, arson, assault and battery...

399
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,065
He has an arson conviction?

400
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:57,733
He was 16, but the assault's more recent.

401
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,060
No, i-it's the arson that's significant.

402
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,556
Arson and rape have an unusually high correlation.

403
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:04,906
They're both crimes about the assertion of power.

404
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:07,739
So with the arson conviction...

405
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:08,806
Yeah.

406
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,072
It makes the rape a lot more likely.

407
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,167
We're seeing promising indicators
in the Pentium chip market.

408
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:21,013
Techspring earnings should be strong as ever.

409
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,505
Hey, boss. Call my broker,

410
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:26,500
have him dump all my holdings in Techspring.

411
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,194
Okay. And, uh, I just spoke with Major Harris' office.

412
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,034
I told them you were on your way.

413
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:34,688
Look at that hand shrug.

414
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,918
It's not a good time to be investing in Techspring. 

415
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:38,667
We need to talk about Sergeant Scott.

416
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,904
Oh.
This is classified.

417
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:42,967
How'd you get it?

418
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,698
The same way you would have.

419
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:47,266
Given the correlation between arson and rape...

420
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,533
Well, it's interesting, but it's irrelevant, I'm afraid.

421
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:53,000
Turns out Lake's platoon mates had rather a lot to say.

422
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,734
Heidi said they wouldn't talk about the rape.

423
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,101
Well, I didn't bring them in to hear them talk.

424
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:59,400
I brought them in to watch them listen.

425
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:04,238
- They turned the video back on, huh?
- Yep.

426
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,779
It's human nature.

427
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,034
They always flip the switch.

428
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,567
Hey, Natural.

429
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:14,475
What do you see?

430
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,366
Nothing.

431
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,433
I don't see anything.

432
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:19,993
Exactly.

433
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,067
I don't understand.

434
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:22,067
Well, look.

435
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:27,191
The absence of emotion is...

436
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:32,667
just as important as the presence of emotion.

437
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,607
Now, you, you need to learn that.

438
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:39,800
When women listen to a rape victim they believe, they reflect certain emotions.

439
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,600
They blush, avert their eyes, hunch their shoulders.

440
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:44,594
These women exhibit none of that.

441
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,400
They're not showing any reflectors.

442
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:48,400
So they don't believe her.

443
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,967
That doesn't prove anything.

444
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Lake lived with those women for three years

445
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,300
and neither one of them is reacting.

446
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,694
They know this rape never happened.

447
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:04,052
LIGHTYou made a false accusation against your sergeant.

448
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:05,747
That's a crime.

449
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:10,948
And then there's the other women in your platoon.

450
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,667
You know, we have MPs standing by.

451
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:17,906
If your friends helped you plan this,

452
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,633
they're as guilty as you are, right?

453
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:26,038
They know you're lying, don't they?

454
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,233
Thought so.

455
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,233
Have the MPs arrest her platoon mates.

456
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:37,886
They're all in on it.

457
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:45,333
No!

458
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:47,950
Look, they had noth... They had nothing to do with it.

459
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,027
It was my idea.

460
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:53,967
Sergeant Scott didn't rape you?

461
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,392
No.

462
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:57,700
He didn't.

463
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,181
Take Specialist Lake into custody.

464
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,010
How could you do this?

465
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,332
You know how hard it is for women in the military.

466
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:06,767
The army has just started to take these claims seriously.

467
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,433
There are victims out there who need help.

468
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,100
A lot of them.

469
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,366
You should be ashamed of yourself.

470
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,867
Ashamed?

471
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,655
I may have lied, but I was doing the right thing.

472
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:20,227
Okay, I was trying to protect my platoon.

473
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:21,567
I was doing the right thing.

474
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,500
I was doing the right thing!

475
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:32,697
Ladies, if you could, uh, wait in there,
I will be taking you in one at a time.

476
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:34,518
Playing out your favorite fantasies, Loker?

477
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:37,977
Studying the psychological influence
of uniforms on credibility.

478
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:41,333
Lightman wanted to see
how they affect people's ability to spot lies.

479
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:43,613
<i>Women in uniform?</i>

480
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,633
I do love my work.

481
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,067
How's it going with Lightman?

482
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:50,633
Uh, he's not my biggest fan.

483
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,572
Well, that's just 'cause you're uneducated.

484
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:53,633
Excuse me?

485
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,667
Well, you're a natural.

486
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,500
The few naturals Lightman's come across
have one thing in common.

487
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:00,867
No college degree.

488
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,311
You haven't been asked to focus on verbal skills,

489
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:05,524
?

490
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:08,134
You're saying I can't learn the science.

491
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,067
I'm saying you didn't have to.

492
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:12,807
That's got to be irritating
for a guy who's spent two decades

493
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:15,534
trying to see what you were born seeing.

494
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:18,760
Thanks.

495
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:20,967
That's very un-Loker of you.

496
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:24,775
I've never been with a Latina woman.

497
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:27,952
Don't push it.

498
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:33,436
How's it going with the ballplayer?

499
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:35,132
Ballplayers play baseball.

500
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:36,133
Yeah. Chicken dumpling?

501
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:38,201
Oh, no. Never eat meat I can't see.

502
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,834
No. Really.

503
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:42,934
No. You have no idea what's in there.

504
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:45,724
Take a look at this.

505
00:24:45,724 --> 00:24:47,646
Earl White just took state for the third time.

506
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:50,165
The kid's on the list of every NBA scout in the country,

507
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:52,467
but when asked about playing pro ball...

508
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,867
Chin thrust. He's angry.

509
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,467
Very. Earl White should be on top of the world.

510
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,467
Why is he secretly angry?

511
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,957
I spot the liars.

512
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:05,150
You're the feelings department.

513
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,667
Follow me.

514
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,470
I got something for you.

515
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:15,900
Okay, would you lie to right a wrong?

516
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,867
Depends. Why?

517
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:24,533
Lake lied, but then said she was protecting her platoon.

518
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,265
I'm doing the right thing.

519
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,832
She said it with conviction, and with no deception leakage.

520
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:32,377
How does accusing your commander of rape protect the platoon?

521
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:33,633
That's what I asked myself.

522
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,211
Okay, these are

523
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:37,633
the individual interviews with her platoon mates.

524
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:41,034
Watch what happens when they discuss Sergeant Scott.

525
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:44,683
Sergeant Scott is a strong leader.

526
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:46,333
I'm glad Sergeant Scott's in command.

527
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:48,017
Concealed disgust.

528
00:25:48,017 --> 00:25:51,141
Yup. Looks the same every time.

529
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,298
They know he didn't rape Sheila Lake,

530
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,800
but they feel intense disgust for him.

531
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:56,867
Made me think.

532
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,143
What if Sheila Lake didn't lie about everything?

533
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:03,973
What if she lied about the victim, but not the crime?

534
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:05,853
So, you think

535
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,867
Sergeant Scott raped someone else in the platoon?

536
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,500
The harassment report, arson conviction--

537
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,667
both consistent with the profile of a rapist, right?

538
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,893
What if the real victim is too scared to come forward?

539
00:26:16,893 --> 00:26:20,034
So Lake accuses Sergeant Scott to right a past wrong,

540
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:22,900
and to protect the other women in the platoon.

541
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:25,734
Do you think Scott raped one of them?

542
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:27,734
No.

543
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:31,604
None of them is exhibiting any fear.

544
00:26:31,604 --> 00:26:33,266
It could have been someone who was transferred,

545
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,929
or-or killed in combat.

546
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:37,592
Hey. I thought we were done with this case.

547
00:26:37,592 --> 00:26:38,568
No. It's possible

548
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:41,808
Sergeant Scott raped someone
who used to be in the platoon.

549
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,081
Your buccinator's playing up again.

550
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,600
It's not...

551
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,266
I didn't say... Oh. Oh, look.

552
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,366
Now you're embarrassed.

553
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,646
Well, you have every reason to be.

554
00:26:50,646 --> 00:26:51,819
You did get it wrong, didn't you? I mean,

555
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,296
Sergeant Scott didn't rape Sheila Lake. Cal...

556
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:56,366
What? She's the one making snide comments. Look at her face.

557
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,140
How do people work here?

558
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,268
Sergeant Scott redeploys within 24 hours.

559
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:01,967
I want you to get ahold of military personnel.

560
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,488
I want the historic roster for the platoon right away.

561
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:05,600
Got it.

562
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:08,834
What?

563
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,034
Oh, what, now you're starting on me?

564
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:13,134
Don't say something

565
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,954
you'll regret. And I saw that.

566
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:18,113
Can I have a muffin?

567
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,533
Ah, no. No, no, no, you don't want the muffins here.

568
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,800
They are terrible. They taste like sofa cushions

569
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:25,934
covered with the moldy nuts your grandmother used to keep

570
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:28,101
in that old jar on her... Oh. Okay, okay.

571
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:30,300
Between you and Lightman, a girl could starve.

572
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,214
Do you have something for me? Yeah, um...

573
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:33,958
I've been watching tape of Earl

574
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,800
trying to understand what's behind the anger.

575
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:40,233
Uh, nothing so far, but I did come up
with this expression.

576
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:44,201
I've been through the facial coding book,

577
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:47,500
and there's elements of AU-four and AU-five.

578
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,124
But it's not anger. No.

579
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:51,567
It's not.

580
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,340
Can we pull up full stats for Earl over the year?

581
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,646
Sure.

582
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:57,190
What emotion is it?

583
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,066
It's not an emotion.

584
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:07,912
And earlier, CEO Robert Rosiello
tried to calm investors after Techspring shares plummeted

585
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,000
in the wake of a subpar Q1 earnings report.

586
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:12,667
This is entirely unexpected.

587
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,422
I'm sure we'll rebound in the second quarter.

588
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:18,315
You know, for a CEO, this guy's a terrible liar.

589
00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:19,600
You talk to personnel at Fort Meade?

590
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,233
None of the women in the 23rd died in combat,

591
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,111
but there's one who went AWOL.

592
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:26,304
Rebecca Metz was on the 23rd's roster in Afghanistan.

593
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,738
Went AWOL four months ago,

594
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:29,800
shortly after her transfer request was denied.

595
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,600
She tried to transfer out of her platoon?

596
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:32,718
Mm. That's not all.

597
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:35,900
Here's a copy of the anonymous harassment report
on Sergeant Scott.

598
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:37,747
Handwriting's the same.

599
00:28:37,747 --> 00:28:39,568
They have any idea where she is?

600
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:43,366
No, but the number of AWOL soldiers has doubled
since we invaded Iraq.

601
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,834
I doubt they got the manpower
to play that much hide-and-seek.

602
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,337
Well, she's got relatives in Baltimore, right?

603
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:49,134
Yeah.

604
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,944
Hate to miss a family reunion.

605
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:00,667
Hello?

606
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:02,734
Uh, what can I do for you?

607
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,967
Looking for your granddaughter, Rebecca Metz?

608
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,325
She's not here.

609
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,950
Sounds good.

610
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,300
You mind if I borrow this?

611
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,001
What? Where are you going?

612
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,734
Help!

613
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:21,134
Help!

614
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,333
Grandpa?

615
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:23,559
Grand...

616
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,025
Help.

617
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:34,333
<i>Sheila admitted she was lying,
but she said she was trying to protect the platoon.</i>

618
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,800
I don't know what this has to do with me.

619
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:38,266
LIGHTSheila didn't make everything up.

620
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:40,877
We know why you went AWOL.

621
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:44,300
We're not here for the army.

622
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,477
We just want to know what happened.

623
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:58,734
I, uh... never had a problem with Sergeant Scott in the States.

624
00:29:59,301 --> 00:30:02,433
He wasn't loud or gross like the other guys.

625
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:07,297
But... But on our
first day in Afghanistan,

626
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:09,467
after curfew,

627
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:12,266
he came in my tent.

628
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,266
He raped you?

629
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,741
The sergeant's in charge.

630
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:20,698
He's supposed to have your back.

631
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:23,720
My job is to say yes.

632
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,467
Yes, sir.

633
00:30:25,684 --> 00:30:28,056
It happened more than once?

634
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:32,633
Almost every night over there... for months.

635
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,834
I couldn't take it anymore.

636
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,567
When we got back, I just...

637
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,000
You ran.

638
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,082
LIGHTYou need to come with us.

639
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:43,298
Your platoon redeploys tomorrow.

640
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:45,067
You can't let the army send those women back

641
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:46,500
to Afghanistan with Sergeant Scott.

642
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,900
I can't go back. Well, what about Sheila? She lied for you.

643
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:49,667
I... I can't.

644
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,574
Rebecca... No. I...

645
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:52,700
LIGHTOkay.

646
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:54,809
Okay then.

647
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,067
Sorry to barge in.

648
00:30:57,445 --> 00:30:58,633
What are you doing?

649
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,201
I'm going back to the base.

650
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,467
But...

651
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,700
Okay.

652
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:04,869
How did...? 
 Sir, turn around.

653
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,562
Did they follow us here?

654
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:08,433
Oh, no. I called them.

655
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,369
Leave me alone.

656
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:21,372
Rebecca... 
I know you called the MPs.

657
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:23,336
LIGHTWell, I had hoped you'd talk, but,

658
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:24,736
yeah, I had them standing by.

659
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,336
Rebecca, if you explain to us... 
Don't you get it?

660
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:29,333
Do you have any idea what it's like to be a woman in the military?

661
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,444
You're either a bitch or a whore.

662
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,814
And they're just waiting for you to fail,

663
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:34,452
to admit you can't hack it.

664
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:35,669
Well, then, go to jail.

665
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:37,039
That'll show 'em.

666
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,436
Be all you can be.

667
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,636
You're scared.

668
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,492
You are still scared
of Sergeant Scott.

669
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,070
I'm not afraid of him.

670
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,870
You're afraid of something.

671
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,160
I'm afraid they won't believe me.

672
00:31:58,036 --> 00:32:00,695
Ah, it doesn't matter if they believe you.

673
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:02,803
They'll believe me.

674
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,970
Call me later? Catch a movie?

675
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:09,669
Here you go.

676
00:32:09,703 --> 00:32:10,870
All right.

677
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:12,736
Hey, Earl.

678
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,137
Thanks for taking the time.

679
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,736
By the way, I'm a big fan.

680
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,803
Would you mind? Oh, no problem.

681
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,569
Bet this'll be worth a lot some day.

682
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:23,878
Oh, yeah.

683
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:26,879
Autographs, shoes, bobble heads.

684
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:29,333
Pro ball is big business.

685
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:31,170
See the chin thrust?

686
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:33,188
What? 
You thrust your chin out.

687
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:34,703
That's a sign of anger.

688
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,116
You do it whenever
you talk about your pro career.

689
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:39,736
I think it's 'cause you're angry you're not gonna have one.

690
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:42,415
Hey, Earl, catch.

691
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:45,142
We've seen that before, too.

692
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:46,044
You make that face

693
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,836
almost every time you catch a pass these days.

694
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:52,745
It's intensity. No,

695
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,003
actually, it's pain.

696
00:32:55,036 --> 00:32:58,687
Doctors call it the primal face of pain.

697
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:01,073
It's universal.

698
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,282
So what is it, Earl?

699
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:04,862
Carpal tunnel?

700
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:06,433
Arthritis?

701
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:14,999
Look, you know how many hours I've spent shooting free throws?

702
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:18,181
I've busted my ass on the court
since I was nine.

703
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:21,178
I'm raising my brother, trying to pay the rent--

704
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:24,870
a big pro contract was gonna change all that.

705
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,436
But you know who drafts someone with erosive arthritis?

706
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:31,170
Nobody.

707
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:32,822
So you took the bribe. Look,

708
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:34,803
I could've gone pro out of high school,

709
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:37,332
but the Athletic Association needs its big tournament,

710
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:41,003
so I gotta spend my last good year
playing college ball for nothing.

711
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:45,603
Look, Mr. Taft's check was the only payday I was gonna get.

712
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:49,862
You telling me you wouldn't have taken that money?

713
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:58,903
I told the post commander this matter was settled.

714
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,936
Sergeant Scott is vital to our efforts.

715
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:04,816
He's supposed to be on a plane
at 0100 hours.

716
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:07,253
I guess if the army's going to jeopardize the safety of women,

717
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,836
it should be done on time, right?

718
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,503
Private Metz was AWOL for five months.

719
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:14,036
You're sure her allegation has merit?

720
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,970
I'm telling you she's not lying.

721
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,780
Sergeant Scott.

722
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,551
I'm convening an Article 32 court-martial hearing next week.

723
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:28,377
Unpack your gear, son. Major Harris,

724
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:31,219
my client would like to avoid any unnecessary delay.

725
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,137
He wants to plead out?

726
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:38,974
Our mission on the Pakistani border is critical
to our safety here at home

727
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:41,269
and I have a responsibility to my platoon.

728
00:34:41,302 --> 00:34:44,663
So, yes, I'm ready to plead guilty to fraternization.

729
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:45,873
Fraternization?

730
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:49,203
Sergeant Scott had a consensual relationship with Private Metz.

731
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:52,143
Becky was my girlfriend, sir.

732
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:58,472
This photo was taken during the period when my client
was allegedly raping Private Metz.

733
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:07,612
Do you have others like this?

734
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:10,302
We have several, Major.

735
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:18,669
You still want to tell me she's not lying?

736
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:28,647
Isolate Rebecca Metz.

737
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:33,208
There's something not right about her smile.

738
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,603
She doesn't look happy.

739
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:36,417
Push in on her eyes.

740
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,770
Brows up, pulled together.

741
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:41,170
She's scared.

742
00:35:41,203 --> 00:35:42,536
Hi.

743
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:44,369
Yeah, it's a masking smile.

744
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:47,803
She's smiling but her eyes say she's afraid.

745
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:49,103
Very afraid.

746
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:50,603
Will you pull up the masking smiles? Yeah.

747
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:54,844
Miss South Carolina can't show fear to the judges;

748
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:57,320
Sarah Palin has the same problem with the press.

749
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,402
Rebecca Metz with her platoon leader.

750
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:01,336
Right, she doesn't want to be involved with Sergeant Scott,

751
00:36:01,336 --> 00:36:03,962
but he's her commander, she's got to do what he says.

752
00:36:04,236 --> 00:36:06,269
He wants sex, right?

753
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:08,855
She feels forced to give it to him.

754
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:10,237
She can't say no.

755
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,912
It's nonconsensual. It's rape.

756
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:14,770
Army psychologists have reported
several recent cases like this.

757
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,336
They're calling it "command rape."

758
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:19,503
It's comparable to sexual harassment,
but much more extreme.

759
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:20,603
When your boss makes advances,

760
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,870
you're scared of losing your job.

761
00:36:21,903 --> 00:36:24,261
But if it's your platoon leader,
you're scared of losing your life.

762
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:25,586
Sergeant Scott redeploys tonight,

763
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:27,627
we have to get back to Fort Meade.

764
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:34,214
They won't believe it was rape.

765
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:36,277
Sergeant Scott never raised a hand.

766
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:39,669
It doesn't matter that he didn't attack you physically.

767
00:36:39,703 --> 00:36:40,894
You were coerced.

768
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,206
No one's going to see it that way.

769
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,654
I never actually said no.

770
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:47,398
He was responsible for your safety.

771
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:48,736
You had to feel threatened.

772
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,770
I was terrified.

773
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:52,621
Everyone knew if you crossed him, he'd make you drive lead.

774
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,768
Drive lead?

775
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:55,669
Lead truck in the convoy.

776
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:58,812
It's the most vulnerable to a roadside bomb.

777
00:36:58,812 --> 00:37:01,503
I had a friend die that way.

778
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,342
I knew from the first time he came
into my tent that if I said no,

779
00:37:04,342 --> 00:37:06,503
I'd be driving lead for a month.

780
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:07,768
So you just took it.

781
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,303
You never said no?

782
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,884
Well, that's what you'll tell Major Harris.

783
00:37:13,884 --> 00:37:16,103
He'll never believe me. Sure he will.

784
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:17,836
We'll put you on a polygraph.

785
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,237
They love them over there.

786
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:21,770
He'll never say it that way.

787
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:23,556
Sergeant Scott never made me drive lead.

788
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:25,236
And he'll never admit he would have.

789
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:28,708
She's right. We still don't have any proof
that he was tying her safety to sex.

790
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:31,336
The truth isn't good enough for these people.

791
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:33,369
Who said anything about the truth?

792
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:47,782
Is your name Rebecca Metz?

793
00:37:47,814 --> 00:37:49,046
Yes.

794
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:53,113
And are you a private first class
with the 23rd Mountain Division?

795
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,689
Yes.

796
00:37:55,582 --> 00:37:59,113
Did you have a relationship
with Staff Sergeant Russell Scott?

797
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:00,713
No.

798
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:03,670
Private Metz, let me rephrase.

799
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,046
Were you physically involved with Staff Sergeant Scott

800
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,186
when you serving in Afghanistan?

801
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:10,647
Yes.

802
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,716
He forced me to have sex with him.

803
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:14,647
We had a relationship!

804
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,680
He ordered you to have sex with him?

805
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:17,847
No.

806
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,113
But he was my commanding officer,

807
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:20,936
I didn't have a choice.

808
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:24,046
Did you ever refuse to have sex with Sergeant Scott?

809
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,346
Yes... once.

810
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,847
He forced me to drive lead convoy for a week.

811
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,979
That's a lie.

812
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:37,013
If she's lying, it graphs above the red bar here? 
So you're submitting that....

813
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:38,050
That's right.

814
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,280
Machine says it's true.

815
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:40,513
Well, it's not true!

816
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:42,280
The polygraph says it is.

817
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:43,480
I don't care what the machine says.

818
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:46,410
She's making it up. I never made her drive lead!

819
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,214
You never made her drive lead?

820
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:51,360
No! I thought that duty rotates. You never made her drive lead?

821
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,339
I-I never made her drive lead! It's a lie!

822
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,413
Sergeant, you don't have to respond. So,

823
00:38:55,447 --> 00:38:58,013
as long she was in a relationship with you,

824
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:00,046
she never had to drive lead.

825
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,373
Is that right? Sergeant Scott...

826
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,513
Is that right, Sergeant Scott?

827
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:03,780
Sergeant Scott, don't...

828
00:39:03,814 --> 00:39:05,319
Is that right, Sergeant Scott?

829
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:06,847
You don't have to respond. Yeah!

830
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,246
Yeah, that's right.

831
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,146
What?

832
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,180
What?

833
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:17,180
Well, her safety was in your charge.

834
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,713
You traded her safety for sex.

835
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:21,380
Major Harris, my client doesn't understand...

836
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:22,982
Yes, he does.

837
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:26,014
What he did wasn't fraternization.

838
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:27,647
It was rape.

839
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,707
Arrest him under Article 120.

840
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:33,282
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

841
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:34,647
I'm a decorated soldier!

842
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,146
I didn't do anything wrong!

843
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:39,015
Yeah, it sounds good.

844
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:55,195
What do you want, huh?

845
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:59,346
I'm already suspended, they're taking away my scholarship, you hung me out.

846
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,412
You're the one who took the bribe.

847
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,799
Look, the system's broken, Earl.

848
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,411
And what am I supposed to do, huh?

849
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:07,845
How am I supposed to take care of my brother?

850
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:09,713
I heard you did pretty well on your Econ midterm.

851
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:11,604
So? You want a degree.

852
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:15,346
So I convinced Dr. Lightman to put our fee into a trust.

853
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:17,747
Probably not enough for four years at Carver,

854
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,430
but it'll get you through Maryland.

855
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,473
What if I don't want your money?

856
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:27,046
Then throw it away.

857
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:29,442
It's your call.

858
00:41:44,692 --> 00:41:46,595
How did she do it?

859
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:49,946
We both know Metz was lying about driving lead convoy.

860
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,979
How did she beat the polygraph?

861
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:02,313
Valium?

862
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:03,814
Yeah.

863
00:42:03,847 --> 00:42:05,814
Takes the edge off.

864
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:08,553
Mutes the emotional response.

865
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:11,480
You... You drugged her so she could lie?

866
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:14,379
Never let the facts get in the way of the truth.

867
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:19,380
You know, I wanted to... Yeah, I know.

868
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,046
Thanks.

869
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,322
For what?

870
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:25,071
You had a slight gratitude smile.

871
00:42:26,394 --> 00:42:28,280
What, you're surprised?

872
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:29,780
Really?

873
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,814
You know, just because I don't know your science

874
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:34,914
doesn't mean I don't know things.

875
00:42:35,906 --> 00:42:38,751
You know, when you don't know the science,

876
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:40,580
you don't see the whole picture.

877
00:42:40,613 --> 00:42:42,451
People can get hurt, you know?

878
00:42:42,451 --> 00:42:43,413
What was that?

879
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:44,447
What happened?

880
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,847
What?

881
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,079
Shame.

882
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:50,295
When you said people get hurt, you showed shame.

883
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:54,164
I don't know what you're talking about.

884
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,547
You're lying.

885
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:58,971
Get used to it.

886
