1
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,799
This must feel like slumming to you,

2
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:44,283
speaking at my lowly
graduate seminar.

3
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:47,231
Someone's got to set
your students straight about my work.

4
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,859
Just pointing out the flaws.

5
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,638
And you're doing a fine job.

6
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:52,153
Have you always been like this?

7
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,173
No, we're far more civil now.

8
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,295
I'd like to have seen Lightman
at Oxford.

9
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:00,369
Back when he was
a real student of psychology.

10
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,280
Are you sure you want me
sabotaging your students?

11
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,460
But I don't have
another lecture ready, so you're on.

12
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,169
- Fine.
- <i>People have to know.</i>

13
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,654
<i>Whether or not
their president's a crook.</i>

14
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:12,173
<i>I'm not a crook.</i>

15
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,624
<i>I've earned everything I've got.</i>

16
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,166
I love this guy.

17
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,305
You see how he's looking down

18
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:21,200
and he's nodding?

19
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,450
He's contradicting
his own statement.

20
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,479
He hesitates before saying
he's earned everything he's got.

21
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,773
And notice the crossed arms.

22
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:30,315
He's defensive.

23
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,526
Which means he's full of it.

24
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,179
He's not nodding his head.
He's looking down at his notes.

25
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,611
Being defensive
doesn't mean you're lying.

26
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:43,784
One of these things by itself
may not be conclusive,

27
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,165
when you put them together,
they add up to deception.

28
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:49,376
Or you're looking for things
to prove deception so you find them.

29
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,087
If Lincoln were showing in the same
behaviors, what would you say?

30
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,590
I'd say he was Nixon
in a Lincoln mask.

31
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,761
All right, let's do
a practical demonstration

32
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,180
and then you guys
can see for yourself.

33
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:02,556
Any volunteer?

34
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:05,056
How about you?
Mister...

35
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:06,128
Martin.

36
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:07,991
Martin Walker.

37
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:09,230
Right.

38
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:15,361
So, I've got 10 pictures.
Pick one,

39
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,738
lie about what you're seeing
or tell the truth,

40
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,619
Dr. Lightman will read you.

41
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:27,051
What about stakes?

42
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,372
I read your book, Dr. Lightman.

43
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:31,992
Without stakes,
it's hard to spot a lie.

44
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:33,982
There's no fear of being caught.

45
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:38,175
100 bucks says I can read you
like a book.

46
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,238
All right.

47
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:46,934
A pretty girl.

48
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,979
College age, I'd say.

49
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,315
Ponytail. Blonde.

50
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,558
Big eyes.

51
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:58,919
And pale, pink blouse.

52
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,576
You like the ladies, Martin?

53
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:05,936
Yeah. What's not to like?

54
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:13,132
You're talking out your ass,
'cause whatever you're seeing there

55
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,004
you don't like it.

56
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:33,748
What do you say now, Dr. Lightman?

57
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:37,601
Double or quits.

58
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:53,292
Guy tied to a chair.

59
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,060
He's soaking wet.

60
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,465
Being zapped with electric cables,

61
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:02,226
like you'd use to jump start a car.

62
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,483
Total rubbish.

63
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,328
That's it for today's class.

64
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,330
Our thanks to Dr. Lightman.

65
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:33,540
Always entertaining and fascinating.

66
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,630
We'll have to do this again.

67
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,718
A bad day for Lightman way.

68
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:47,012
Where are you going?

69
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:48,796
Did you put him up to this?

70
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:49,687
How?

71
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:52,624
Your technique is foolproof, right?

72
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:01,264
Here's the problem.

73
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:03,988
Martin Walker's a psychopath,

74
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,801
probably a killer.

75
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,049
Just thought you should know.

76
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:11,286
La <i>Lie To Team</i> presents:

77
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,313
Episode 211: <i>Beat The Devil</i>

78
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:41,275
In a healthy kid,

79
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,510
you would expect to get

80
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,517
arousal and revulsion.

81
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,409
What we got in Martin

82
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,798
was revulsion and arousal.

83
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:55,581
Revulsion can appear to be arousal.

84
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:57,958
Markers are similar.

85
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,877
It says so right in your book.

86
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:02,880
Those pictures aren't proof
of anything, Dr. Lightman.

87
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,300
We saw the same indicators
in Ted Bundy.

88
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,208
Bundy?

89
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:08,310
He was a good-looking fella,

90
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:10,677
killed about 60 women, give or take.

91
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:13,420
Dr. Lightman is prone
to the dramatic.

92
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:14,628
Aren't we all?

93
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:17,813
Please! Martin exposed
your science to be flawed.

94
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,563
Therefore he has to be punished?

95
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,898
Dr. Foster,

96
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,049
do you concur with your colleague?

97
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,861
I didn't see what he saw,

98
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:28,906
but reading facial cues
isn't my specialty.

99
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,574
It is mine,

100
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,273
and I suggest you bring him in
for psych evaluation.

101
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:37,998
Without something more substantial,
I can't justify that kind of action.

102
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:39,341
All right.

103
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:42,820
If the university isn't looking
into at least

104
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:44,954
one missing persons case,

105
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,007
I'll eat my shoes.

106
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:51,523
I think I'm on to something here.

107
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,680
A sophomore girl
went missing a month ago.

108
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,386
The police have no evidence
of foul play.

109
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,685
It's an open case,
and they don't have any leads.

110
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,521
Except the one I'm giving you.

111
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,124
I'll ask the police to talk to him,

112
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,274
but quietly.

113
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,652
In other words, you'll do sod all.

114
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:09,446
Just say it.

115
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,709
I haven't got a clue
what you're on about.

116
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,283
Fine. I'll say it for you.
You're mad I didn't back you up.

117
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,094
But Cal, I didn't see what you saw.

118
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:19,225
Beating you twice
doesn't make him a psychopath.

119
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,779
Once. He only beat me once.

120
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:22,382
Second time, I let him win

121
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:24,649
because I wanted to see
how much he got off

122
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:26,096
on the humiliating me.

123
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:29,924
All right, a lot of people out there
might enjoy doing that,

124
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,599
but they all know me.
He doesn't.

125
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,263
So yeah,

126
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:36,163
I'm going to need his medical files

127
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,475
and any psychological
profile that might exist.

128
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,577
You know that those
are confidential.

129
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,980
No time for ethics.

130
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,815
Cal, you're crossing that line.

131
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,150
Helen's crossed it.

132
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,280
One should not shag one's students,

133
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,107
especially not
the psychopathic ones.

134
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,277
I never said I saw aliens.

135
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:59,674
I saw an unidentified flying object.

136
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,524
Now, what is so loony about that?

137
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,585
School board is gonna say
there's a lot loony about it.

138
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,337
I'm not crazy, Miss Torres.

139
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,834
Frankly, corroborating your story
is gonna be a little difficult.

140
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,091
What did it look like?

141
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,291
The overall Gestalt
of the thing was...

142
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,431
like a hockey puck
or a jelly doughnut.

143
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,769
Were you drinking
or taking any medication?

144
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,439
I was as dry as the Sahara.

145
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,774
Would you describe
what you saw as extraterrestrial?

146
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:37,165
When the Greeks
saw lightning in the sky,

147
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,246
they attributed it to Zeus.

148
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,671
And when the Aborigines
witnessed Halley's Comet,

149
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:46,789
they thought it was a mighty shaman.

150
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:50,598
That's the trap
that always ensnares us...

151
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,549
the need to explain.

152
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,503
This UFO claim
seems like it's part of a pattern.

153
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,512
Last year,
you took the biology class

154
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,805
to the county morgue.

155
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,552
Then there was a 3am comet
gazing workshop you held on the roof

156
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:05,145
of the gentleman's lounge.

157
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,095
It was a strip club,
but it had the best view.

158
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,587
We're not here
to assess his lesson planning.

159
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:12,449
When I saw the UFO,

160
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:14,696
I called the local news.

161
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,174
I called the airport.
I called Maddox Air Force Base.

162
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,910
I got stonewalled.

163
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,246
Then somehow word got out

164
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,324
that I'm proselytizing about little
green men in the classroom,

165
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:26,569
which I'm not.

166
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,002
Conspiracy theory
to your close encounter?

167
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,965
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.

168
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,516
I'm seeing how he reacts
to an attack.

169
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:37,718
Lightman 101.

170
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,638
Is he showing any
markers of deception?

171
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,473
You really want to take this case?

172
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,888
What, is the guy an eccentric? Yes.
Of course. Big time.

173
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:46,102
And so am I.

174
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:48,897
Have you seen this shirt?
But I think he's being railroaded.

175
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,070
Could he have really been the only
person to have seen something so...

176
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:53,360
Extraordinary?

177
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:57,572
Listen,
I stood in front of the mirror,

178
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,034
I've asked myself
"is this the face of a crackpot?"

179
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,786
Well, maybe it is.

180
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,868
But this crackpot is one
hell of a science teacher.

181
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:10,224
I love my job
and I don't want to lose it.

182
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,022
We're gonna do everything we can.

183
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,187
I thought you were only here
to humor me.

184
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:27,853
What do you want from me?
Old habits die hard.

185
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:30,272
I'm writing down all the places
that we followed him to

186
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,358
and writing down every thing
that he does in each spot.

187
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,028
You better make a note.
He's trolling for a victim.

188
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,080
So's every guy in this spot.
He's 25, single.

189
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,583
He's out the door with that girl
in 10 minutes.

190
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,030
Any takers?

191
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,465
I'll give you a ride home in my car.
*** is good.

192
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,326
You should alert the local police
about this one.

193
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:05,960
And tell 'em what?
There's a guy going on a hot date?

194
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:07,392
Here we go.

195
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:11,104
- He made us.
- It's about bloody time and all.

196
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,607
You having fun playing Detective?

197
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,461
This is Ben Reynolds of the FBI.

198
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,280
Is he gonna give me
a parking ticket?

199
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,409
We can't have you hurting that girl,
now can we, Martin?

200
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:26,370
She's safe enough.

201
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,372
Now she is, yeah.

202
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,044
Hello, Martin.

203
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:17,671
You knew I was coming.

204
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,757
That's what predators do.
They check out their territory.

205
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,011
You killed that missing girl,
didn't you?

206
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,346
Of course not.

207
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:28,393
I'm harmless.

208
00:13:29,855 --> 00:13:31,059
Now I know I'm right.

209
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,772
I must admit, you had me going there,
just for a minute.

210
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:40,218
The police talked to me
today about the missing girl,

211
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,837
but you knew that.

212
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:46,062
What about that girl tonight?
And what were you gonna do to her?

213
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:49,487
I was just gonna give her a ride home,
like a good Samaritan.

214
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,815
Thanks to you, she had to walk.

215
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:54,749
I hope she made it okay.

216
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:59,991
So are you just gonna follow me
the rest of my life?

217
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:03,117
I won't have to.
You'll mess up.

218
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,369
You know
what my dissertation was on?

219
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,764
How patience is adaptive.

220
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,498
Hunters are at the top
of the food chain,

221
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,063
and they all take their time.

222
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:18,786
Patience...

223
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:22,903
I find is overrated.

224
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:24,355
I noticed.

225
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,930
You like to push...

226
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,158
to make things happen.

227
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:30,327
That's when people trip up.

228
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:31,908
Most people.

229
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:34,805
You're gonna lose this game.

230
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,071
- It's not a game, Martin.
- Sure, it is.

231
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:38,668
You love it just as much as I do.

232
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:40,713
I see it.

233
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,299
You're leaking joy.

234
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,255
I tell you what, you beat me,

235
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:50,764
and I'll even give you back
your 200 bucks.

236
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,687
Good chess players
think five moves ahead.

237
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,455
Great chess players
think one move ahead,

238
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,599
but it's always the right move.

239
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:16,027
All right, I want these everywhere.

240
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:17,961
Hallways, coffee shop,

241
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:19,711
bookstore...

242
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,234
Any empty space, all right?

243
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,855
Very subtle.
Plan to stick around for the lawsuit?

244
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,769
No. It's just where I want the man.

245
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:27,970
In a courtroom.

246
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,341
Really, Cal.
When did you become such a Fascist?

247
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:33,945
Pentagon, 2003, among other places.

248
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,070
It shows.

249
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:39,015
We both know this is not about Martin.
This is about us.

250
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,924
"Us" was 23 years ago.
I think I'm over it.

251
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:46,111
Interesting how you remember
the exact number of years.

252
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,612
Bloody fascinating, isn't it?

253
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:50,380
You cannot quantify behavior, Cal,

254
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:52,534
which is what you're trying to
introduce to people.

255
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,858
I provide a tool.

256
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:56,119
All right, people misuse that tool,

257
00:15:56,244 --> 00:15:57,497
it's not my fault.

258
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,042
Look at Martin, all right?
He is a loony.

259
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,504
If I'm right, you could be putting
these women in danger.

260
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,047
And if you're wrong...

261
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:07,299
I'll recycle.

262
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:12,316
One thing about Cal
is he's insufferable.

263
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,441
Sometimes.

264
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,559
Has he always been like this?

265
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,062
Only more so.

266
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,064
A word?

267
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,026
He is not someone for the long haul.

268
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:30,044
- We're not a...
- Just keep your distance,

269
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:33,658
or you could find yourself
a very lonely woman.

270
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:40,457
One time he brought in these kittens

271
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,209
and said we should dissect them.

272
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,378
And this girl Lisa completely freaked
and called the cops.

273
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,256
But he was just teaching us
to question authority.

274
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,426
Did Mr. Hickson ever
say anything about aliens?

275
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,721
He said he saw something
and asked us what it could have been.

276
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,864
And flying saucer
made it on the list?

277
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,768
Right underneath the magic brownies?

278
00:17:04,252 --> 00:17:05,899
You didn't think
that was funny, Andre?

279
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:11,213
'Cause that thing you did where you just
looked down and away, that's regret.

280
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,491
Ease up on the Jedi mind tricks,
okay, everyone? You don't know me.

281
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,600
Maybe you are the person
who told people

282
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,664
that Mr. Hickson saw aliens.

283
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,166
I didn't say nothin'
and I ain't on trial.

284
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,197
What's with the shame?

285
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:34,581
Did you see the same thing
Hickson saw?

286
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:36,306
I didn't see anything.

287
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,514
Look.

288
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,600
You can either sack up right now,

289
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:42,832
or you can spend the rest
of your life wondering

290
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:46,356
if what you saw was real and if you
could have saved Mr. Hickson's job.

291
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:53,394
It was real.

292
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,246
You like Mr. Hickson,
so you photoshopped it.

293
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,374
Look, he didn't forge it.
That's exactly what I saw.

294
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,544
Is the video real, yes or no?

295
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,261
If this is what you saw,
it must have been picked up on radar.

296
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,667
And not, then there's gotta
be an explanation.

297
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:21,808
Like the air force don't be lyin'.

298
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:26,438
We need to draw 'em out.
We need get something we can read.

299
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,939
How are you gonna do that?

300
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:30,108
Film at 11:00.

301
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:35,267
Martin should be home
any minute now.

302
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:38,116
It is so wonderful
you're considering him for the...

303
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,523
What do you call it?

304
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:40,862
Lightman scholarship.

305
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:45,470
It's our department's
most prestigious award.

306
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,851
Every winner has to have
a biographical profile.

307
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:53,038
Right? So...

308
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:56,790
Should we start
with early childhood?

309
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:01,264
Martin was a very happy child,
loved sports.

310
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,728
Any head injuries?

311
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,545
Trauma,

312
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:06,728
like that?

313
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:10,234
What we mean is,
did he have to overcome

314
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,567
any difficulties as a child?

315
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,953
Not really.

316
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:21,223
The people are here
from the Lightman scholarship.

317
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:25,497
No, mom. They're lying to you.

318
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,940
I don't... What?

319
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:30,770
He has a grudge, mom.
He wants to destroy me. Look at this.

320
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,738
They're saying I hurt a girl.

321
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:37,093
This is outrageous.

322
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,136
- I want you out of my house.
- Don't you want to know if it's true?

323
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,890
Mrs. Walker, a girl is missing.

324
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:48,186
You can't believe Martin
would ever hurt anyone.

325
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:49,771
She's not so sure.

326
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:50,665
Me?

327
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:52,398
I'd bet your house on it.

328
00:19:57,699 --> 00:19:59,433
We should be moseying along,

329
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,659
unless there's anything else
you want to tell us.

330
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,292
I've nothing to say to you.
I'm so sorry, Martin.

331
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,413
I really didn't know who they were.

332
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,687
It's okay, mom.
I know it's not your fault.

333
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:13,711
It's okay, mom. They're going.

334
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,691
You saw her
when I said he was guilty.

335
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:25,820
She crumbled.

336
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,541
She was taken by surprise, Cal.

337
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,769
Surprise, my ass.

338
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,900
She's scared to death of him.
She knows he's guilty, too.

339
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:37,110
Maybe you are seeing
what you want to see.

340
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,462
You buying his act, are you?

341
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:44,534
I think you and Helen have
a lot of unresolved issues.

342
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:47,381
I think you two were a couple
when you were her student,

343
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:50,021
and I don't think
you like your replacement.

344
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,801
You know, you're starting
to sound a lot like Helen.

345
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:56,087
I mean that
in the nicest possible way.

346
00:20:56,641 --> 00:21:00,008
When I'm sure you're right about Martin,
I will back you 100%.

347
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:02,272
Here.

348
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,349
Maybe this'll help convince you.

349
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:06,449
It was just laying about.

350
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:13,537
- He has a sister?
- Apparently, yeah.

351
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:17,817
There's no picture of her in the house,
though, not that I could see anyway.

352
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:19,611
What is this?

353
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:23,387
That is video of little Martin

354
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,200
and presumably an older sister.

355
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:28,286
And where did you get it from?

356
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,013
Borrowed it.

357
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:31,711
Is that the background?

358
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:34,042
Yes, and I didn't have
to break any laws to get it. Here.

359
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:35,960
Obviously, Martin

360
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,776
had a sister. Her name is Marcy.
She's 2 years older than him.

361
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,550
- What happened to her?
- She drowned in pool when she was 7.

362
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:45,620
Police report says that Martin witnessed
the whole thing. Excuse me.

363
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:46,721
Reynolds.

364
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:53,144
Well, Mrs. Walker lied
about Martin's happy childhood.

365
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:55,146
You seeing a pattern then?

366
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:58,232
Cal, he was 5.

367
00:21:58,563 --> 00:22:00,005
2 1/2 times the terrible 2s.

368
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,032
What was the name
of that hospital again?

369
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:03,404
All right, my man.

370
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:04,989
That was my buddy.

371
00:22:05,114 --> 00:22:07,158
I asked him
to keep his ear to the ground about

372
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,273
- any missing women.
- There's another one?

373
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,288
No, but a sophomore at Chesapeake
University was attacked 2 days ago.

374
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,061
Luckily, she was able to get away.

375
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:16,918
He thought there might be a connection,
so he decided to call me.

376
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,407
Have the police
shown her the poster?

377
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,298
No. She had a mental breakdown
and she isn't talking.

378
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,189
What exactly is happening?
Thank you.

379
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,462
I don't want to be on camera.
What are you...

380
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:30,693
Damn it!

381
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:32,255
I gotta go.

382
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:34,782
Man.
I am such a klutz.

383
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:38,001
Geez. I left my opposable thumbs
at home. Let me buy you another one.

384
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:39,107
No, it's OK.

385
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,730
No, really, it's not. Here. Another one
of what I just spilled and a...

386
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:44,153
raspberry tart.

387
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,742
You OK with raspberry?

388
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:47,615
Yes, sure.

389
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,926
A lot of action, huh?

390
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:55,270
No.
Usually just dull stuff.

391
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:57,956
Old ladies smuggling perfume.

392
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:01,629
Maybe dull is good. Whatever
you're doing now is stressing you out.

393
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:04,636
Yeah, it's ironic.

394
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:07,225
I'm usually the one to read people,
but you're right.

395
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,745
- I am stressed.
- Then you need to relax.

396
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:14,467
I'm going to a concert tomorrow night.
Mostly Vivaldi.

397
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:16,811
You want to come?

398
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,005
It doesn't have to be like a date
or anything.

399
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:25,786
You could meet me there.

400
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:33,697
No, yeah. I'd really like to go.

401
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,619
Let me give you my number.

402
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,337
Did I mention I know your boss?

403
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,239
What?

404
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:51,794
See, he thinks
I'm some kind of psycho killer.

405
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:55,192
I get women alone, attack them.

406
00:23:58,825 --> 00:23:59,937
What do you want?

407
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:01,606
To make a point.

408
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:03,805
And what point would that be?

409
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:07,169
If Lightman was right about me,
you'd already be dead.

410
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,575
So, to be clear,

411
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,787
the Lightman group

412
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,289
is putting its hard-won reputation
on the line

413
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,983
for a UFO sighting?

414
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,291
Now that we have a second eyewitness

415
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,256
and physical evidence,
we think that it's time that we got

416
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,010
some answers from our government.

417
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:29,967
Aren't you worried this could become
a national security issue?

418
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,596
If the Air Force
is telling me the truth

419
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,596
and they didn't pick up
an object this size,

420
00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:37,767
then we've already got
a huge problem.

421
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:40,237
Mr. Hickson is telling the truth.

422
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:43,290
When you know that,
why not bet the ranch?

423
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:47,068
I'm gonna show you a picture, OK?

424
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:51,697
Is this the man who attacked you?

425
00:24:53,873 --> 00:24:54,873
Valerie?

426
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:00,498
That's a yes.

427
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:02,959
The police interviewed Martin.

428
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:05,018
You want look at this case file?

429
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:07,217
They probably would let him go
with an apology.

430
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:09,850
Yeah, you got that right.
Dummies.

431
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:13,270
I thought you was off chasing UFOs?

432
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,471
Yeah, the office told me
where you were.

433
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,731
That's him.

434
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:18,250
This guy. He...

435
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,852
this guy,
he just bought me a cup of coffee

436
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
he was gonna take me to a concert,
but I was...

437
00:25:24,836 --> 00:25:26,649
How did you realize that
that was him?

438
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:29,402
He said he knew Lightman.

439
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,275
Said that if he was really the killer,
I'd be dead.

440
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,607
- Is that the girl he attacked?
- Yeah.

441
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:38,298
You OK?

442
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:41,011
Yeah, she'll be fine.

443
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:44,105
Now you're here,

444
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,058
make yourself useful.
Go in there and bond with Valerie

445
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:48,462
over being alive.

446
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:55,507
I understand, Valerie.

447
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:58,694
What happened to you,
it almost happened to me, too.

448
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:01,366
Look at me, Valerie.

449
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,221
This guy bumped into me
at a pastry shop.

450
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,508
By the time we got outside,

451
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,383
he felt like a friend.

452
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,279
And that's what he does.

453
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,990
He appeals to who we are,
like he sees us

454
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,628
when nobody else does.

455
00:26:21,018 --> 00:26:22,787
Look, I know this is painful,

456
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:25,342
but you're alive, Valerie.

457
00:26:26,244 --> 00:26:27,710
The next girl might not be.

458
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:38,525
He...

459
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:40,349
drowned me...

460
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:46,576
over

461
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,209
and over.

462
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:51,826
All that....

463
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:53,402
water.

464
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:55,805
I died...

465
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,157
3 times.

466
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,413
Bastard waterboarded her.

467
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,207
I'm so sorry.

468
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:15,078
And...

469
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:18,719
When I would come to,

470
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,263
his mouth would be on mine.

471
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:26,684
And then he would do it again

472
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:28,207
and again.

473
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:36,410
I begged him to just let me die...

474
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:42,140
But he wouldn't.

475
00:27:46,002 --> 00:27:47,362
Maybe he did.

476
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:54,967
Can you bring him in now?

477
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:57,163
Hell, yeah.

478
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:05,296
<i>Valerie identified you
as her attacker.</i>

479
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:06,960
<i>I'm sorry for her.</i>

480
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:08,944
<i>I really am.</i>

481
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:13,663
<i>But if the police believed her,
wouldn't I be under arrest?</i>

482
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:16,909
- <i>You stalked her.</i>
- Did Cal coach the girl,

483
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,280
get her to name Martin?

484
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:21,491
I know how manipulative he can be.

485
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:23,717
She was barely responsive.

486
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,445
Well, if you see her file,

487
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,332
she spent half her life
on antidepressants.

488
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:33,336
<i>Here's how it happened.
Valerie came on to me.</i>

489
00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:36,297
you should know that we're getting
a warrant to search your car.

490
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,456
If we find any evidence
that she was in it...

491
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:41,427
you will. I gave her a lift home
one night from the library.

492
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,846
Yeah, but see, the thing is,
she never made it home.

493
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,898
You tried to drown her 3 times.
Then you

494
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:49,137
dragged her into the woods
and tried to bury her.

495
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,423
That never happened.

496
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:53,365
She's obviously troubled.
Anyone can see that.

497
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,506
That's why you picked her.
She's troubled.

498
00:28:55,631 --> 00:28:56,912
She's vulnerable.

499
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:00,237
You prey on the weak, right, Martin?

500
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:03,573
All I was doing
was showing the girl some kindness.

501
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:06,421
No. She's the perfect victim.
You like to traumatize her,

502
00:29:06,864 --> 00:29:07,907
you break her,

503
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:09,418
she begs to die,

504
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:11,374
and she's just your type.

505
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:12,936
That's not true.

506
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:15,127
I like strong women.

507
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:16,885
Like Helen, you mean?

508
00:29:19,187 --> 00:29:20,549
She's a strong woman.

509
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,760
<i>Tell me, how does that work,
with you two?</i>

510
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,514
Do you play the woman

511
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,441
in that whole scenario, do you?
Who's the pitcher, who's the catcher?

512
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:31,633
Are you just following orders?

513
00:29:32,863 --> 00:29:34,438
You do what she says, is that it?

514
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,890
Right?

515
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:39,871
I wouldn't worry, though.

516
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:44,781
I'm sorry. Did you think what
was going on between you two was real?

517
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,409
Did you?

518
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,543
Well, take it from me, it's not.

519
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,954
I've been there.

520
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,614
No, she's had dozens.

521
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,253
- She gets bored, she moves on.
- Like hell!

522
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:07,767
I think we're done here,

523
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:09,849
aren't we, Martin?

524
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:11,934
If you say so.

525
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:20,568
Martin's gone.

526
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:21,861
You seen enough?

527
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:23,904
He never admitted to anything.

528
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,906
What, did you expect him to?

529
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,971
Must be frightening,

530
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,245
falling for a monster.

531
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:33,553
Okay, so you know.

532
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:36,000
I figured that's why you had

533
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,895
a problem with him,
the fact that he and I were...

534
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:41,302
well...

535
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,407
And now you know better.

536
00:30:43,981 --> 00:30:45,165
Well, you should.

537
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:49,096
Right, come with me.

538
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,348
- Where are we going?
- Scene of the crime.

539
00:30:58,728 --> 00:30:59,928
He tortures...

540
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,993
and kills young girls.

541
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:08,199
Every girl he tortures or kills

542
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,659
is on your conscience, Mrs. Walker.

543
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,830
I only let you in here because
Helen has been a friend to Martin.

544
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:19,141
Nonsense. You feel guilty
because you got a killer for a son.

545
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:29,169
How come there's no pictures
of your daughter anywhere?

546
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,504
Did he kill her?

547
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,809
Did he push her in the pool?

548
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,192
You can't face the truth, can you?

549
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,347
So you pretend she doesn't exist,
she never existed.

550
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,422
I mean, that's the game here.

551
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:49,365
Right?

552
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:55,854
Please.

553
00:31:56,986 --> 00:31:59,286
I put my trust in Martin, my faith.

554
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,670
I do care about him.

555
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,809
Now I need to know.

556
00:32:26,482 --> 00:32:28,627
That's one hell
of a Rogue's gallery.

557
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,198
World's greatest con men.

558
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,581
- Yeah, more like psychos.
- Yeah.

559
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,873
To live with themselves,
to deny their humanity, it's...

560
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,140
quite a trick.

561
00:32:44,143 --> 00:32:47,655
You know, if you can pull off
something like that,

562
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:51,482
it's not really hard
to fool the rest of us.

563
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,181
Your friend Loker told me.

564
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:01,309
Yeah.

565
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,647
I should have seen it.

566
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,265
Ah, kiddo. You probably
got him right.

567
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:08,736
Me too, for that matter.

568
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:13,198
- What do you mean?
- Well, I am a crackpot.

569
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:17,524
It's not all I am,
but it's the truth from time to time.

570
00:33:18,962 --> 00:33:21,655
And in a small enough moment,

571
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:26,056
even a cold-blooded
killer can be sincere,

572
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:28,297
seem charming even.

573
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,382
Now, how he got that way,

574
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,536
I don't think that a mystery
anybody can solve.

575
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:42,417
It must be hard being somewhere 30 years
and trying to make sense of all this.

576
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:45,433
What's hard is
they confuse growing old

577
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:47,008
with growing stale.

578
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,567
Mr. Hickson.

579
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,532
I'm Colonel Gorman.

580
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:53,396
You were looking for answers.
I've got some for you.

581
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:57,923
Is there some place we can talk
privately without big brother?

582
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,697
Ever heard the term
"shattered bone"?

583
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,170
It's Air Force code

584
00:34:04,295 --> 00:34:08,087
for a B-1 bomber that's hijacked
or missing with a nuke on board.

585
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,589
This is what your client
witnessed 2 weeks ago.

586
00:34:11,204 --> 00:34:13,842
That's Captain Eric Eeubauer,
decorated veteran.

587
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,844
Cracked, and broke radio contact.

588
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,062
We shot him down
500 miles off the Carolina coast.

589
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:22,309
This was not
a standard-issue aircraft

590
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:25,362
but this does seem like
a standard issue lie.

591
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:27,606
It might not have looked
like it on the ground,

592
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:29,685
but there's a flash drive

593
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,069
with cockpit video in the file.

594
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:36,865
So what do you want us to do?
To go along with some sort of coverup?

595
00:34:37,613 --> 00:34:39,017
I wouldn't call it that.

596
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:40,859
What happened

597
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:44,234
was a tragedy for the pilot's family

598
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:47,148
and an embarrassment for our base.

599
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:50,337
Are you nervous, Colonel?

600
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,632
This is a sensitive case.

601
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:55,175
I told my CO

602
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,299
that given your relationship
with the FBI we could trust you.

603
00:34:58,424 --> 00:34:59,972
I wish the feeling were reciprocal.

604
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:02,975
The best lies are covered
with half-truths.

605
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:06,729
I have no doubt, that you had a pilot
who cracked, who was shot down...

606
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,392
Everything in that file
happened as described.

607
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:17,584
You have no idea what was
in the sky that night, do you?

608
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,040
That's the best answer you're going
to get out of us,

609
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:22,165
Mr. Loker.

610
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,246
If your client's smart,

611
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,679
he'll accept it.

612
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:26,604
Smart?

613
00:35:28,437 --> 00:35:29,733
Or spineless.

614
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:39,068
The Air Force is never going to admit
to a violation of US air space,

615
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:41,275
not by a Russian MIG

616
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,301
or by a UFO,

617
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:44,970
you and I know that.

618
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:48,495
But we also know that
what Mr. Hickson saw was not a B-1.

619
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:55,288
So what there was a way
for the Air Force to cover its ass

620
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:57,946
and also save a teacher's job?

621
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:03,218
Look, Martin, it's over.

622
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:05,454
Let's not make a thing out of this.

623
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:09,026
- Lightman's behind this, isn't he?
- No.

624
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:11,401
- He isn't.
- I don't believe you.

625
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,590
You've been different
since that day in class.

626
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:19,225
He may have started me
thinking about us,

627
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,586
what we're doing, but that's all.

628
00:36:24,302 --> 00:36:25,808
You said you loved me.

629
00:36:26,557 --> 00:36:29,307
Yes, and I know I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry.

630
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,689
- That wasn't fair.
- That I was important to you.

631
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,358
Your work is important to me.

632
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:37,243
We can still be friends,

633
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:38,957
work together.

634
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,574
We still have that.

635
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,394
Let go of me!

636
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:48,330
Hello. Dezekis.

637
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:51,797
Dean Warren?
Yes, Dean Warren, one minute.

638
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:56,165
Okay, Helen.

639
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,843
Look, I understand.
Big age difference. I'm sorry.

640
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,358
Well done, luv.

641
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,525
All the right notes.

642
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:17,946
What now?

643
00:37:18,774 --> 00:37:21,780
With any luck, he'll come after you
with a vengeance.

644
00:37:45,534 --> 00:37:46,434
Oh, God.

645
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:58,127
<i>Don't worry, Professor Dezekis.
We have eyes on you.</i>

646
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,074
- Cal?
- <i>Helen.</i>

647
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,409
You sound off.

648
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:11,705
- Nice read. Very perceptive.
- I can be from time to time.

649
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:14,416
Can we talk later?

650
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:16,853
Yeah, it's a date.

651
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:24,326
I told you, Lightman.

652
00:38:25,628 --> 00:38:27,018
I'm always 5 moves ahead.

653
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,860
Welcome back, Lightman.

654
00:38:44,796 --> 00:38:46,246
You ready to die...

655
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:48,152
Again?

656
00:39:06,621 --> 00:39:08,364
You know if you kill me, right...

657
00:39:10,196 --> 00:39:11,765
They'll do you for murder.

658
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,991
I mean, right now you could probably
plea bargain it down

659
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:19,608
to kidnapping or forced labor
or something.

660
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,628
You know what you need?
A gun, but you don't have one.

661
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:24,809
I've got you thinking, don't I?

662
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:26,279
I mean, it's funny.

663
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:28,383
Because a minute ago,

664
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,427
you were in full control.
Now look at you.

665
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:35,406
You know, after I get done here,
I'm gonna take care of Helen.

666
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:38,070
And I'm gonna bury you side by side.

667
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:39,534
Be romantic.

668
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:42,238
There's a girl buried around here?

669
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:45,422
- How many?
- This is boring. Keep digging.

670
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,681
Oh, sorry. I'm stalling.

671
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:56,043
You do know I've got
a GPS tracker on the van.

672
00:39:56,168 --> 00:39:58,416
Have some dignity, for God's sakes.

673
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,291
Don't humiliate yourself.

674
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:05,444
You do the bloody digging. Go on.

675
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:07,281
You do it.

676
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:14,943
That means you'll die really soon.

677
00:40:15,068 --> 00:40:17,956
The shrink's gonna have a field day
with you. You know that?

678
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,675
I mean, what is it with you animals?

679
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:24,162
Did you push your
sister in the pool?

680
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:26,256
No.

681
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:28,967
She fell.

682
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:32,804
You didn't help her, did you?
You just watched her drown.

683
00:40:33,828 --> 00:40:34,628
Yes.

684
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,308
Why?

685
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:40,321
I wanted her bike.

686
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,460
<i>Drop the gun! Drop it!</i>

687
00:40:43,998 --> 00:40:45,775
<i>Drop the gun!
Drop it!</i>

688
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,464
It's like you said.

689
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:54,468
They only have me
on unlawful detainment at worst.

690
00:40:55,942 --> 00:40:58,217
She's buried somewhere here.
She's probably...

691
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:00,373
- before the road.
- There aren't any bodies.

692
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,865
When they rolled up, you looked,
towards the trees.

693
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:06,088
That's where your secret is?

694
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,881
- Sweep the area!
- Right?

695
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:11,187
You owe me 200 bucks!
You bastard!

696
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:28,264
In vino veritas?

697
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:32,180
That's the only truth
I'm gonna get apparently.

698
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:34,449
I just perpetrated a lie
on an entire school.

699
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:39,121
I thought the F88 was a good compromise.
It could have been what he saw.

700
00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:40,955
Yeah...

701
00:41:42,223 --> 00:41:43,542
but it wasn't.

702
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:48,255
You saved a man's career.
That's no small feat.

703
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:53,897
What do you think that is?

704
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:01,520
I don't think that's
a mystery anyone can solve.

705
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:10,797
So they dug up 4 bodies.

706
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:15,554
I didn't see it, Cal.

707
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:20,441
I mean, not at first anyway.

708
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:23,709
- I could have saved you some grief.
- That's okay.

709
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:26,626
Take it out of your wages.

710
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:31,889
You thought I was obsessing
on Helen, right?

711
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:34,342
It's not beyond
the realm of possibility.

712
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:36,678
You loved her, didn't you?

713
00:42:38,173 --> 00:42:39,623
We had our moments.

714
00:42:43,816 --> 00:42:46,855
It's not like
she's Helen of Troy or anything.

715
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:53,486
Fancy a quick bite?

716
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,373
Thanks.
I've got work.

717
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:04,048
- Another time then.
- Yeah. Another time.

718
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:07,292
I'm glad you're okay.

719
00:43:09,776 --> 00:43:11,176
- Night.
- Night.
