00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,450
The case of samantha burch,the 11-year-old
girl last seen leaving school two months ago,

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,250
has gotten a new burst of energy.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,850
Suspicions continue to swirl around
samantha's parents, brian and lorraine burch,

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,210
amid accusations that they killed their
daughter and claimed she was abducted.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,770
Just yesterday the burches
raised the reward for information

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,080
about their daughter's
where abouts to $100,000.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,330
And there are also reports they've hired
so-called deception expertdr. Cal lightman.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,040
Girl goes missing,supermodel's
in rehab, obama gets anew puppy,

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,180
and you guys make freedom
ofthe press the first amendment.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,350
I don't think this is what
ourfounding fathers had in mind.

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,210
Watch this, daddy.

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,380
- you adopted her five years ago?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,350
We waited so long for a child.

14
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,290
She made us a family.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,020
Do either of you have children?

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,840
Yeah, I do.

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,920
How anybody thinks that...

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,040
we could hurt her,I, I don't understand.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,110
You said there wasnew information?

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,230
A car ran a red light two days ago.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,140
The police gave usthat photograph.
It's from one ofthose traffic cameras.

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,180
Do you see there? That
is samantha's sweater.

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,260
Uh, lorraine made that. Someone has her.

24
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,830
That's why we raised the reward.

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,030
We re-mortgaged the house.

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,270
We've been gettinghundreds of calls from all
over saying they've gotinformation about sammy,

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,280
but the police saythat's going to
take weeks to talk to everybodyand...

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,130
she may not havethat kind of time.

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,340
So we thoughtthat you could tell
which of the tipsterswe should believe.

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,270
I mean, you could do that
faster thanthe police, right?

31
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,050
I need to ask you a question.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,210
Did you kill your daughter?

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,410
- Did you? Did you kill her?
- How can you evenask us that?

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,960
- Yeah, I know, you brought me here to help you.
- Are you serious?

35
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,680
So answer the question.
Did you kill your daughter?

36
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,190
- I'm not gonna answer that.
- No, listen.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,540
- Did you kill samantha?
- We didn't bring you hereso that...

38
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,050
did you killyour
daughter? Did you kill her?

39
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,210
No. No, no, no. No. No, no.

40
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,370
All right,I think we can help you.

You gonna be okay?

45
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,760
Sure.

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,170
'Cause I can do this one on my own.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
No, not a chance.

48
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,670
I know what you're thinking, and it's
not going to be a problem; I'm fine.

49
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,590
Dr. Lightman, can we ask you a question?

50
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,200
Anything from the burches?

51
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,110
Um, off the record?

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,580
Yeah, off the record.
Put the camera down.

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,100
It's my understanding that, uh, samantha
burch was seen with an unidentified male

54
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,330
leaving a restaurant
called the happy dragon.

55
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,350
Right now the police
are searching chinatown.

56
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,490
All right, thank you. Let's go.

57
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,880
Well, the burches
could use some privacy,

58
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,680
and the happy dragon could
definitely use the business.

59
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,410
Diane kretschmer, editor-
in-chief at ashmont press.

60
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,760
Dr. Foster explained
what this was about?

61
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,200
It's about her, right? Farida mugisha.

62
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,550
That's right.

63
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,990
What do you know about her?

64
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,080
Well, she's a, uh, peace
activist from northern uganda.

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,750
She was kidnapped by rebels when she was
in her teens, kept in the bush, and escaped.

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,970
I read her book. It's awesome.

67
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,820
- You published it, right?
- Yeah, and it's about to be huge.

68
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,020
This is just the kickoff
party for the tour.

69
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,720
Oprah's chosen her for the book club.

70
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,700
But there's a problem?

71
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:06,920
Last week we got a report that farida took part in
massacres carried out by the rebels that held her.

72
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,220
Took part how?

73
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,890
Carried a gun, pulled the trigger.

74
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,250
Her memoir doesn't mention that.

75
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,980
If the reports are
accurate, it's a disaster.

76
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,510
It means the whole book's a lie.

77
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,570
We're about to ship
half a million copies.

78
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,610
Now, is there any way that you can find out
if there's any truth to these accusations?

79
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,610
We'll have to talk to her about
what happened and see how she reacts.

80
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,730
And you'll be discreet?

81
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,160
Farida absolutely cannot know
that you're investigating her.

82
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,620
That won't be a problem.

83
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,330
Gillian foster.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,010
Don hughes, youth
investigation division at metro.

85
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,560
Detective.

86
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,600
Mr. Hughes is here to
welcome us to the burch case.

87
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,020
"Welcome" isn't the word I'd use.

88
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,370
Well, we won't get in
your way, detective.

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,760
Too late.

90
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,400
You work for the burches, right?

91
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,410
As far as I'm concerned,they're still
suspects. At puts youright in my way.

92
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,830
- Well, they didn't killtheir daughter.
- Really? Any other tips?

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,710
We wantto find samantha
as much as you do.

94
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,950
When a kid's beenabducted
this long, odds are she's dead.

95
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,540
You going to help me
findthis girl's corpse?

96
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,100
How do you knowshe was abducted?

97
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,890
And what aboutthe traffic cam photo?

98
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,750
Lorraine burch knit that sweaterfor santha off
of a pattern that soldup and down the east coast.

99
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,730
Could have been anyone.

100
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,340
Maybe she just ran away.

101
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,840
There's noevidence of abuse or neglect
in the home,no alcoholism or drug use.

102
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,870
Those are the usual predictorsof a
runaway, but samantha was adopted.

103
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,690
It's possible she hadattachment issues--
difficulty forming arelationship with the burches.

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,480
That could have made herrun away.

105
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,420
Uh, excuse me,the tipsters are here.

106
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,830
you want to stickaround for this?

107
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,120
This is going to take you forever
to listento all these people.

108
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,340
Fortunately, I don't have to.

109
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,260
Excuse me. Excuse me,
please. Excuse me, excuse me.

110
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,010
Uh, thanks for
coming,ladies and gentlemen.

111
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,600
Now, I know you've been told that the burch
familyhave put forward a $100,000 reward.

112
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,630
Okay, that rewardhas now been withdrawn.

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,760
what the hellis he doing? It
took us monthsto raise that money.

114
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,330
They're all leaving.

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,780
Some are leaving. Dr. Lightmanjust
eliminated the financial incentiveto lie.

116
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:20,020
Now, the police have arrestededward stentz in
connection with samantha burch'sdisappearance.

117
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,620
Anyone who can give me anyinformation on
edward stentz, could you please raiseyour hands?

118
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,050
You can all leave.

119
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,580
Who's edward stentz?

120
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,120
He doesn't exist.

121
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,380
The people who saidthey knew
something about him are overclaimers...

122
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,600
lying to getattention.

123
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,860
The rest of you, if you
could just follow me...

124
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,950
I didn't know sam that well.

125
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,720
We were in guys and dolls, but...

126
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,030
she was the lead, I was
justin the chorus, so...

127
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,820
it's okay. Deirdre,
you'renot in any trouble.

128
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,630
Okay, well,there was this
older boy-- walter grinwis.

129
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,620
Heas always hanging around.

130
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,450
He wouldn'tleave her alone.

131
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,380
How old is walter?

132
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,910
An eighth-grader, maybe.

133
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,850
When she told me about
thiswalter, I called the tip line.

134
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,500
We called the police when
we heardabout samantha.

135
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,770
The officer askedwalter some questions,
he thanked us for the call,that was it.

136
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,160
It's awful. Seems justlike yesterday
walter was taking the buswith her.

137
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,950
You do that a lot,do you,
walter? Take the busith sam?

138
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,330
I guess.

139
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,200
You were friends?

140
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,790
Don't have manyfriends, do you, eh?

141
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,190
I don't care. People are stupid.

142
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,620
Not sam, though, eh?

143
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,090
Where's that picturewe have of you
with samantha? Is it in your bedroom?

144
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,320
something's in yourbedroom, isn't
it, walter? Let's go andhave a look.

145
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,140
Hold on.

146
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,070
What do think you're doing?

147
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,110
Are you afraid your
son is hiding something?

148
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,730
No, of course not.

149
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,730
Hey, walter.

150
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,650
You kn how toplay hot or
cold yeah? Okay, am I hot?

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,890
This is dumb.

152
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,660
So I'm cold, right? Okay.

153
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,760
How about now? Nope, still cold.

154
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,660
Am I getting warmer, walter? Yeah.

155
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,990
Yeah, I am.

156
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,100
That's enough.

157
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,340
You need a warrant before
youcan look through his things.

158
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,600
No, I don'T. I'm not withthe police.

159
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,800
I want you out ofmy house right now.

160
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,720
Nice backpack, walter.

161
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,920
Where is she?

162
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,460
I don't care how you found this.

163
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,390
It's got to be bagged,taken
to the lab, and analyzed.

164
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,820
Can we just have aquick look in it?

165
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, let's contaminatethe
evidence. That'll help.

166
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,260
Detective, we need to see
walter'srelationship with the bag.

167
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,950
If he killedsamantha, it's a trophy.

168
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,720
Its contentswill provoke arousal.

169
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,390
If this kid hadanything to do with samantha's
disappearance,we can tell you right here, right now.

170
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,810
- That's interesting.
- What?

171
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,430
He's not showing anynegative emotion.

172
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,920
In fact, I think he's as surprised at
thecontents of the backpack as we are.

173
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,980
You've never looked in
there,have you, walter, eh?

174
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,820
Why is that?

175
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,910
It's not mine.

176
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,120
You were respectingsamantha's privacy.

177
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,260
Walter, did shebring this to you?

178
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,480
Ask you to keep it incase she needed it?

179
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,390
We're not mad at samantha.
We just need to find her.

180
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,930
I said I'd keep it.

181
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,930
She askeme not to tell
anyone. She trusted me.

182
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,010
That's a runaway kit.

183
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,460
Kids put them togethersometimes when
they're thinking about leaving home.

184
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,990
When d shegive it to you?

185
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,230
A couple of monthsbefore
she went missing.

186
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,690
I think she wanted to
getaway from her mom and dad.

187
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,650
- Why?
- I don't know.

188
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,110
She didn't talktoo much about it.

189
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,110
Bet she talked to her shrink.

190
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,900
"Christina knowlton."

191
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,030
Samantha saw meevery other week.

192
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,660
She had issues
stemmingfrom her adoption.

193
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,590
I told the policeeverything I could.

194
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,840
What was the sourceof the issues?

195
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,720
The dynamics werepretty complicated.

196
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,970
Well, she may have run away.

197
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,610
Did she talkwith you about that?

198
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,310
Not directly, no.

199
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,500
Indirectly?

200
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,400
I'm sorry, but I couldn't say.

201
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,880
Samantha'sin danger.

202
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,720
Her parents are desperate.

203
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,870
There must be somethingthat
you can tell us.

204
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,730
I have a colleague who was treating
a womanin an abusive marriage.

205
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,750
My colleague reportedit to the
police, they arrested the husband,

206
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,270
he got out on bail, d went home
and shothis wife in the head.

207
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,850
I'm sure youcan appreciate how I have to
be careful what informationleaves my office.

208
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,500
You saying samantha was abused?

209
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,500
I didn't say that.

210
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,310
Yeah, you did.

211
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,500
Um, club soda.

212
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,550
Cranberryspritzer, please.

213
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,760
You'd get your ass kicked ifyou
ordered that where I'm from.

214
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,180
I got my ass kickedwhere I'm from.

215
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,790
there she is.

216
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,210
- Farida mugisha,woman of the hour.
- Hello.

217
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,810
Eli loker. I loved your book.

218
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,710
- You have an incredible story.
- Thank you.

219
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,150
I mean, everything you've done...

220
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,460
changing the world through
peaceful resistance.

221
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,090
I mean, you're like gandhi.

222
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,990
Except you don't look
likea malnourished old man.

223
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,290
you're too kind.

224
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,050
You never turned to violence.

225
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,290
I guess a lot ofthe victims did?

226
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,600
We have to forgive them. Many
had no choice. I was lucky.

227
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,150
Lucky how?

228
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,190
I was never forced
toparticipate in the massacres.

229
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,880
That's really lucky, isn't it?

230
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,980
I'm thankful every day.

231
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,030
I don't think I'd havethe strength
to live with something like that.

232
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,170
Well, I should getback to our hosts, but
I'm speaking atseaver hall this evening.

233
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,170
I hope you'll come.

234
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,420
Oh, I look forward to it.

235
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,850
Bring yourook. I'll sign if you'd like.

236
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,110
I would like.

237
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,180
No shame when she
talkedabout the violence.

238
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,130
It's hard to believeshe killed anybody.

239
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,020
- Did you see anything?
- No.

240
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,830
We should go hear her speak.

241
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,230
Yeah, she wantedto sign my book.

242
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,890
- I think we had a connection.
- Oh, yeah.

243
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,920
'Cause ugandan womencan't
resist a guy with a girly drink.

244
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,360
Samantha did not run away.

245
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,150
Whatever you mayhave been told.

246
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,200
It's something we haveto
consider, mrs. Burch.

247
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,510
sorry, sorry.

248
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,920
Oh, I gotta take this. Yeah,
um, it's my daughter. Just a sec.

249
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,990
Hello? Absolutely not. 'Cause I said so.

250
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,670
No, I said absolutely not. We..

251
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,930
don'tbe such a bitch! Shut up! Stop it!

252
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,200
How'd we do?

253
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,590
- Sympathy, then horror.
- Oh, good.

254
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,310
Yeah, thanks, love. No, it was
finE. It was good, very good.

255
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,290
Well, dependswhen I finish. All right, yeah,
I love you. I love you, too. Yeah. Okay, bye.

256
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,320
So, what the hell was that?

257
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,380
Well, I'm not anabusive parent.

258
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,780
And it doesn't looklike you are either.

259
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,650
You think this is some kind of game?

260
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,560
- You think we abused our daughter?
- Brian.

261
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,980
I'm sorry, mr. Burch,
butwe had trule it out.

262
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,130
This is how you
peopletreat your clients?

263
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,380
I mean, this is a good
family. This is a happy family!

264
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,400
Samantha and I are very close.

265
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,000
You know what, I thinkyou're
telling the truth. I do.

266
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,440
But you, on the other hand,
there's somethingyou're not saying.

267
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,190
No, she's saying everything.

268
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,080
It's all right, mrs.
Burch. You n tell us.

269
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,620
You never saw what she was like
when she was alonewith me, brian.

270
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,840
A few weeks beforesamantha disappeared
she threw one of her tantrums.

271
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,300
And I tried to hold her.

272
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,530
I tried, but she was so strong.

273
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,040
And she... she pushed
me away. I don't know...

274
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,550
I don't know how this happened.

275
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,260
Go on.

276
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,280
She fell into the stove and her
shirt touchedone of the burners.

277
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,730
And it caught on fire
and it burned her back.

278
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,190
It was an accident. Samantha
felt guiltyabout it and I was...

279
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,940
I was so ashamed. So, we didn'ttell
you, and I went to the hospital alone.

280
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,990
it was an accident. I'm so
sorry, brian. I'm so sorry, brian.

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,390
But it wasn'T... it wasn't my fault.
It's not my faultthat she's gone.

282
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,710
It's not my fault.

283
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,160
It's okay. It's okay.

284
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,630
Sometimes adopted kidshave
trouble connecting.

285
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,550
Thousands of mothersgo through it.

286
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,030
It's nothing tobe ashamed of. Okay?

287
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,510
Given what happened at home,you have to
consider the possibilitythat samantha ran away.

288
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,800
Unless noneof it happened and
they're pullingthe wool over our eyes.

289
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,860
You know how many abusiveparents
I've seen fake tears?

290
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,910
- Ah, they'renot faking it.
- We'll see.

291
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,400
Still, if she wasburned that
badly, she needed more treatment.

292
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,800
I'll have my people checkthe
hospitals and clinics.

293
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,290
Thank you.

294
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,260
You know, you were very
goodback there, with mrs. Burch.

295
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,920
Very nurturing.

296
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,030
Maybe you should get a puppy.

297
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
I could talkto obama's people.

298
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,580
Alec has allergies.

299
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,930
Poodles. No fur. They have hair.

300
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,980
That's not what it's about.

301
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,020
I watched as they murdered
almost every memberof the village.

302
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,000
The rest of us theydragged into the bush,
where I was madea rebel officer's wife.

303
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,530
The horrors I saware beyond compare.

304
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,710
Rape. Torture.

305
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,360
Massacres carried outby child soldiers.

306
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,830
Northern uganda has
beenstuck in this nightmare...

307
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,890
no deception leakage.

308
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,530
She wasn't involvedin the massacres.

309
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,220
She seems pretty anxious.

310
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,850
Well, it's not unusual. She's speaking
in frontof a big group of people.

311
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,210
Thank you all so much for coming out
to supportpeace in northern uganda.

312
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,010
thank you for coming.

313
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,920
I hope my speech
wasn'ttoo long and boring.

314
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,370
Oh, no, no, no,we're fans.

315
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,360
Yeah, you looked a
littlenervous up there.

316
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,820
You'd think I'd be usedto public speaking
by now but I'll admit,my heart still races.

317
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,170
Oh, I-I brought mycopy of your
book. You promised to sign it.

318
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,490
Of course. This is for both of you?

319
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,760
Oh, no, no, no,we're not together.

320
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,410
No, we came together.
But it is not a date.

321
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,850
Well, it was niceto meet you both.

322
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,080
What?

323
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,290
We heard ms. Mugisha
speaktwice about the massacres.

324
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,980
When she deniedbeing involved there was
no increase inwhat we call manipulators

325
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,170
and no visiblemicroexpressions.

326
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,210
And what's that in english?

327
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
She said she didn't kill anyone,
and shewas telling the truth.

328
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,870
Great. That's it, then.

329
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,010
- I think we might want to take another look at her.
- Why?

330
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,070
There's something about her.
Something'S... something's not right.

331
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,750
Do you have any evidenceto support that?

332
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,600
No, but if webrought
her back in--

333
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,060
I don't have time for this.I came
in for your report. What is it?

334
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,440
There's no evidencethat she's lying.

335
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,050
That's what I needed to
hear. Thanks very much.

336
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,940
guess mugishagets to meet oprah.

337
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,830
What's it say?

338
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,250
"Eli, thank you for listening.
I hope to see you again."

339
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,020
And, uh... that's her phone number.

340
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,280
Thanks for calling us,detective.

341
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,790
Where'd you getthis prize, then?

342
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,290
Canvassingthe hospitals.

343
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,240
He was working as a nurse at
the free clinicin mount pleasant.

344
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,800
Seemed a little off, so we ran him.

345
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,730
Turns out, he was workingunder a false
name. Guy's a registered pedophile.

346
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,260
- Whoopsie.
- Why bring us in?

347
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,540
We haven't been able
toget anything out of him.

348
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,940
You guys havedone okay so far.

349
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,060
- He's got something for us.
- Let's hope.

350
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,340
No, I'm telling you.

351
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,920
He's trying not togive himself away.

352
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,390
This guy knows something.

353
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,570
*****IvesI haven't seen the girl.

354
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,720
Yeah, I know. I don't believe you.

355
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,150
- Well, I'm telling the truth.
- No, you're not;you're lying.

356
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,510
- No.
- No, you are. You're lying, yeah.

357
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,740
- I never touched her, all right?
- Now, that's the truth.

358
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,980
I don't thinkyou're even
attracted to her, are you?

359
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,700
But you have seen her. Right?

360
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,240
If I say I saw her,
they'll say that I hurt her.

361
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,100
Even you think I hurt her.

362
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,070
No, that'snot true. I don't
thinkyou hurt her. I don'T.

363
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,520
Now, you're sweating.

364
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,210
And you're frail.

365
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,930
Desperately tryingto control yourself.

366
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,590
What are you on?

367
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,630
I take medcoprogesterone.

368
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,190
That's for chemicalcastration, right?

369
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,560
You're doing thatto yourself?

370
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,740
I don't wantto hurt any more kids.

371
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,500
Good for you. That's nice.

372
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,770
So, where did you see her, then?

373
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,740
At the clinic. She has
a full thickness burn.

374
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,060
And she comes in every other
wednesday so I can treat it.

375
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,740
Keep taking the pills, kevin.

376
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,130
I got it.

377
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,170
Dinner was
wonderful--thank you.

378
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,420
Well, if you thinkdinner
was good, wait for the tour.

379
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,620
What are thesepictures?

380
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,550
Well, uh, the facesare speaking.

381
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,660
What are they saying?

382
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,390
They're tellingthe truth about
what each personis feeling.

383
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,150
That's what we do here.

384
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,590
We... we read faces and body
language,and we try to spot lies.

385
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,290
Look. Agony.

386
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,550
Contempt. Disgust.

387
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,200
They look the same on everybody?

388
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,440
Yeah, they're universal.

389
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,170
I don't believe it.

390
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,990
Well, I peed sittingdown till I was ten.

391
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,320
See? Your eyes widened: Surprise.

392
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,820
An americanpolitician, a
french president and you.

393
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,100
It's the same expressionusing
the same muscles.

394
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,690
That's remarkable.

395
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,540
What?

396
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,980
I was...

397
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,330
just imagining a thousand
thingsI want to do with you.

398
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,170
Let's go for a ride.

399
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,820
Not her.

400
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,760
It's been two hours.

401
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,440
You think we cantrust that pervert?

402
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,260
Yeah, in my experience, self-castrating
pedophilesgenerally tell the truth.

403
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,680
- Got another one.
- That's her.

404
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,660
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, lookat her eyes.

405
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,710
Samantha burch? I'm a police
officer. I'm hereto help you.

406
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,630
She's goingto run. She's going to run.

407
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,350
There she goes.

408
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,010
- No!No, let me go, let me go!
- We're not goingto hurt you. It's okay.

409
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,000
- Where is she?
- She's in with childprotective services.

410
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,390
Follow me.

411
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,150
Oh, my god. She's here.

412
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,130
Samantha. Let me see her.

413
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,110
oh, my baby. My little girl.

414
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,970
It's really you. It's really you.

415
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,700
Oh, samantha, thank god
you're all right--samantha.

416
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,160
My name is jessica, and I have
to get homebefore my curfew.

417
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,460
Sammy... sweetheart...

418
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,200
don't you recognize us?

419
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,810
My name is jessica, and I have
to get homebefore my curfew.

420
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,500
Now, samantha swallowedwhen
she saw her parents.

421
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,450
And she swallowed again when
she said her namewas jessica.

422
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,030
Swallowing is a signof strong emotion.

423
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,170
So, she recognizedher parents, she lied
about her name,and she knew she was lying.

424
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,120
She's too clean and
well fedto be a runaway.

425
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,610
Could she havestockholm syndrome?

426
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,110
It seems more likebattered
person syndrome.

427
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,140
No bruises, no cuts. No
signs of sexual abuse.

428
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,050
Yeah, butwith kids, just the threat of
abuse is sometimes enoughto control them.

429
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,730
We need her to name her abductor, right?

430
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,380
So, we have to break their bond.

431
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,380
You any goodwith kids, detective?

432
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,380
Elements of content-based
analysis. These arefoster's books.

433
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,890
Yeah, I borrowed a few.
Been doing some research.

434
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,330
Okay... into what?

435
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,440
Uh, mugisha.

436
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,640
I've been tryingto figure
out what felt wrong about her.

437
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,330
- What do you mean?
- Just... listen.

438
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,560
The rebels agreed to a cease-fire
a week before my birthday.

439
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,330
But without the support of the international
community, talks broke down by christmas.

440
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,440
"A week beforemy birthday,"
"talks broke down by christmas"?

441
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,440
Yeah, those detailsare
contextual embedding.

442
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,810
- Means she's telling the truth.
- Yeah, but later,there's a change.

443
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,450
I watched as they murdered almost
every member of the village.

444
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,650
The rest of us they dragged into the bush,
where I was made a rebel officer's wife.

445
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,590
No more contextual embedding.

446
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,290
- She's lying.
- The horrors I saw were beyond compare...

447
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,710
that's, uh, not bad for
a rookie,but it's wrong.

448
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,170
That's not a conversation.
It's a speech.

449
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,420
It's written, it's memorized.

450
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,460
You don't know whatyou're talking about.

451
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,250
All right, maybeyou should
just read up a little more.

452
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,150
She got nervouswhen you told her
what we do here--she touched her face.

453
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,610
- That's a manipulator.
- Oh, now you'rean expert on manipulators...

454
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,220
because six weeks ago, you
didn't even knowwhat that was.

455
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,290
Okay, you just don't seewhat's going on
here, because you've gota thing for her.

456
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,570
That's not true.

457
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,390
I saw that she didn't mention
detailsabout the atrocities.

458
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,950
Did you ever stop to think that
maybe she doesn't wantto remember?

459
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,560
I'm bringing this to foster.

460
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,950
You do whateverthe hell you want.

461
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,250
Samantha.

462
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,900
I know that you knowyour
name is samantha.

463
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,560
I know that you're scared.

464
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,610
What is he saying to her?

465
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,260
He's telling herthat you love her, but I
really think that sheshould hear that from you.

466
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,990
I've tried. She doesn't hear me.

467
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,740
I know it seemsthat way.

468
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:59,290
You reach out to her, and then she
rejects you, and you can'thelp but recoil.

469
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,040
You don't know what it's like.

470
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,640
You're not a mother.

471
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,900
No, but I was.

472
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,360
My husband and iadopted
a baby girl last year.

473
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,610
We brought her homefrom delaware,

474
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,990
and we bathed her androcked her
to sleep and built a nursery.

475
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,650
In delaware, the birth motherhas
60 days to change her mind.

476
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,800
We made it to day 57.

477
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,500
And I didn't getto keep my baby, but...

478
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,960
yours is right there. You
know, you need totalk to her.

479
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,890
What was your daughter's name?

480
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,880
Sophie.

481
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,090
I tried so hard.

482
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,620
Look, samanthaneeds to know that
you love her,no matter what she does.

483
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,620
I think youshould tell her.

484
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,320
Then maybe she'll tell uswho took her.

485
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,250
It's the onlyway she'll start
seeing you as her mother.

486
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,850
hey, samantha.

487
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,130
I'm here.

488
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,310
I'm right here.

489
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,730
You can say you'renot my daughter.

490
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,430
You can say you're not my sammy.

491
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,840
You can tryto push me away,

492
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,280
but I'm you're mother,and
I'll always find you.

493
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:22,140
I'm your mother. I love
you,and I'm not going anywhere.

494
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,770
Mom.

495
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,950
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

496
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,260
it's okay.

497
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,790
I was worried about heather.

498
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,650
Who's heather?

499
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,320
She's the other girl.

500
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,840
What other girl?

501
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,280
The other girl who was taken.

502
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,310
Who's heather? Do you knowher last name?

503
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,900
I can't tell you.

504
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,110
You afraid? What are you afraid of?

505
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,150
Samantha...

506
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,790
no one is goingto take you again.

507
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,100
We got you now, darling.

508
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,980
I could go outside... Or heather could.

509
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,250
But never at the same time.

510
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,770
Go out where?

511
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,480
We always had to be back by noon.

512
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,690
Where? Ba where?

513
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,180
She's still there.

514
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,000
We'll get her outof there safe,
honey. Just tell us where she is.

515
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,600
I can't tell you. I can't tell you.

516
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,500
You bring all your dates here?

517
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,540
Just the ugandanpeace activists.

518
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,430
Actually, I don'T... I
don't go outon many dates.

519
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,830
Why not?

520
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,970
People lie to you
withpolite conversation.

521
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,700
Then, when they finallyshow
themselves to you,

522
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,210
you realize you've spent
allthat time with a stranger.

523
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,230
I promise not to makeany
polite conversation.

524
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,660
What is it?

525
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,200
Uh, torres, the woman I
was withat your speech...

526
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,710
she thinks you're lying about...
well, it's hard to exp...

527
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,010
you touched your ear.

528
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,520
Does that mean I'm lying?

529
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,370
Are you?

530
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,650
What part of your story isn't true?

531
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,960
Is any of it true?

532
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,850
Who would make upsuch a terrible story?

533
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,000
Do you know how many
peopleare taken in my country?

534
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,800
Do you have any ideawhat
that does to a person?

535
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,170
You were nevertaken, were you?

536
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,830
They're children.

537
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,040
Children who have seenunspeakable
things. Made to dounspeakable things.

538
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,910
But it's a lie. It
never happened to you.

539
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,070
It happened. It's happening.

540
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,300
But nobody listeneduntil there
was a face. My face. My story.

541
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,000
Every lie has consequencesthat
you can't see coming.

542
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,180
Someone needed to speak.

543
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,010
I was educatedin the west. When
I talk, peoplelike you hear me.

544
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,990
My country is being torn
apart by violence and shame

545
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,690
and I would do anythingto
stop the killing.

546
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,940
What are you going to do, eli?

547
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,640
This other girl-- heather--
might be heather mahome.

548
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:20,190
Disappearedabout three months
ago. Foster kid, recently placed.

549
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,960
There were some similarities in their
cases, but whensamantha disappeared...

550
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,980
the press jumped in, and
nobodywas interested in heather.

551
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,470
Happens every day.

552
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,030
All right, it's past noon.
We have to find heather now.

553
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,380
I need to talkto samantha again.

554
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,600
Samantha...

555
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,760
I'm going to play
20questions, all right?

556
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,480
I can't sayanything.

557
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,600
That's all right,I'm
going to do the talking.

558
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:49,020
All right, we knowthe person who took you uh,
is an animal, so we'll countthat as question one.

559
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,100
Two. Is it someone you know?

560
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,900
Someone you know.
Three. Is it a teacher?

561
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,650
Not a teacher. Four.

562
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,050
Is it someone connectedto your family?

563
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,440
Someone who worksfor your family?

564
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,900
Six.

565
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,760
Is she your psychiatrist?

566
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,910
dr. Knowlton? Police. Open the door.

567
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,830
They're gone.

568
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,470
still searchingthe house.
Found samantha's sweater.

569
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,600
Also a bunch of picturesof this girl.

570
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,680
- What, another girl she took?
- Nope.

571
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,520
- That's dr. Knowlton'sdaughter.
- What?

572
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,450
Jessica. August 2006.

573
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,550
Apparently, she died two
yearsago-- some kind of accident.

574
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,860
- They're replacements.
- What do you mean?

575
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,160
Samantha and heather are stand-insfor
the daughter that knowlton lost.

576
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,300
They don't look anything alike.

577
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,580
It doesn't matter. It's about
heremotional connection to the girls.

578
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,850
Knowlton's using them to relive
the life she hadwith her daughter.

579
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:49,330
You think she took heather
somewhere she usedto go with jessica?

580
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,070
It could be more specific than that.

581
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,460
Think you can find
out wherejessica died?

582
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,410
everybody hold.

583
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,660
- Is she okay?
- I can't tell.

584
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,930
I'm not taking any chances.
I'll get a negotiator out here.

585
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,590
No, let us talk to her.

586
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,060
She's got a gun.

587
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,460
You looking to get shot?

588
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,810
Well, how long isit going to
take to get a negotiatorout here?

589
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,860
******

590
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,460
She's sleeping.

591
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,630
Did you drug her?

592
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,210
This is one of our favorite spots.

593
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,710
Jessica loves to swim.

594
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,910
Jessica's dead, dr. Knowlton.

595
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,140
I told her not to dive here.

596
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,140
But she wouldn'tlisten.

597
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,470
I know you don't wantto hurt her.

598
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,020
For years I've been
dealingwith troubled kids.

599
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,780
Every day I see the
parentsscrewing them up.

600
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,840
I understand.

601
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,800
No, you... you took
them for their own good.

602
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,570
No, you could do a
better jobraising them.

603
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,710
That's right.

604
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,920
I'm a good mother.

605
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,880
They loved living with me--they would
come back every time I let them out.

606
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,660
I'm a good mother!

607
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,130
I haven't talked to foster yet.

608
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,490
Well, I did.

609
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,570
She called the publisher.

610
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,670
They're probably pullingfarida's
book off the shelf right now.

611
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,690
I'sorry.

612
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,070
She could've writtena different book.

613
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,520
She didn't have to say
those things happened to her.

614
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,470
No, she's right. Nobody
would havepaid attention.

615
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,890
And the funny thing is she went out with me
even after she found outwhat I do for a living.

616
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,030
I think on some levelshe
wanted to get caught.

617
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,790
Or maybe she just liked you.

618
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,740
Well, I don't really care.

619
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,310
Hey, loker.

620
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,700
You just lied.

621
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,460
Yeah.

622
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,720
I just needed a
minutebefore I went home.

623
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,530
Sure.

624
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,150
Sophie's 13 months.

625
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,130
You know, she's probablywalking now.

626
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,170
Yeah, emily startedaround
that age, I think.

627
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,350
She's probably changing so fast.

628
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:56,860
Every now and then I see alittle girl on
the street, and I, uh, I think it's her.

629
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,850
And I have to...

630
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:10,800
fight so hard not to run up and hug
some, you know,stranger's little girl.

631
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,450
I'm sorry.

632
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,340
Don't be.

633
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,790
It's just, uh, alec doesn't
want to talkabout it.

634
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,010
Um, he says he can't, you know.

635
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,340
So we don'T.

636
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,730
I'm okay.

637
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,190
You can go.

638
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,820
No, I'm all right.
