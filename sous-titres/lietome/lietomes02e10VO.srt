1
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:04,058
Lying lands you right here.
Smack dab in front of me.

2
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,193
When it comes to lying,
I'm your man.

3
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:08,793
That makes Dr. Lightman
very special.

4
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:12,762
So, since you dragged me
away from my work,

5
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:14,699
who can tell me what a lie is?

6
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:17,768
When my mom tells my dad
he's not getting a big belly?

7
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,720
Yeah. Right. We learn
to lie from grown-ups.

8
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:23,639
They think you don't notice,
but you do.

9
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:25,428
Most of the time lying is bad,

10
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,715
Even if you're doing
it for a good reason.

11
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:29,964
life's easier
if you learn to tell the truth.

12
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,881
Lightman is miserable. What strings
did you pull to get him to do this?

13
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:37,088
I had Emily ask.
She tutors a couple of the kids.

14
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:40,605
Thought I could turn our class
problem into a teachable moment.

15
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:42,038
That'd be a help.

16
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,896
So, even if you're just thinking
of not telling me the truth,

17
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:49,521
I'll warn you. It's pretty hard
to keep a lie from me.

18
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:53,152
Go on. Go on, I dare you.

19
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:57,767
Clyde the turtle.

20
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:01,621
Which one of you stole Clyde the turtle
from miss Angela's classroom? Eh?

21
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:04,419
No takers?

22
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,869
All of you are innocent, are you?

23
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,967
We need to talk.

24
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:12,243
Boys and girls,

25
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,079
meet FBI agent Benjamin Reynolds.

26
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,553
Oh, hey, kids, how ya doing?

27
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,513
- Hi.
- Hi, agent Ben.

28
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:21,744
We need to talk.
Foster's waiting.

29
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:23,185
You, too. Come on.

30
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,602
All right.

31
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:27,828
Oh, and by the way,

32
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,256
whoever it is that stole
Clyde the turtle,

33
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:34,111
the turtle's...
they like lettuce,

34
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,243
Or is that tortoises?

35
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,115
I'm gonna work on that one.

36
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,628
Take a look at this screen.

37
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:44,038
This guy parked in front
of the treasury department.

38
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,356
That's like two blocks from here.

39
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:50,127
- How long's he been there?
- Little under 15 minutes.

40
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:53,731
Anybody consider this might
be a peaceful protest?

41
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:56,632
<i>A crazy farmer named Harold Clark</i>

42
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>Is driving up to Washington, D.C.
To blow you federal folks up.</i>

43
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,391
<i>He's got his tractor and trailer
packed with enough explosives</i>

44
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,359
<i>to blow up the whole town.</i>

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,461
So not a peaceful protest then?

46
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:10,648
- Who's the caller?
- We don't know yet.

47
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,937
Call was relayed,

48
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,610
but the subscriber didn't
convey. We're waiting to retrieve it.

49
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,129
Is there anything else?

50
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:19,865
- The fact that he actually has a bomb?
- That's what we need you all for.

51
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,582
So the question is,
is the threat real or is it a hoax?

52
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:25,196
- We need to get these kids out.
- We're not doing that.

53
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,404
Protocol is anyone
within the bomb radius

54
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,208
stays inside, away
from exterior windows.

55
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,640
In situations like these,
more people are killed

56
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:33,709
By flying glass
than the blast itself.

57
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,673
Plus, this guy, may be
waiting for people

58
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,264
to evacuate just so he can trigger it.
So, everyone, including those kids,

59
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:42,388
is staying right here
until we can figure this thing out.

60
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,850
I was hoping you were
going to say that.

2x10 - Tractor man

65
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:20,379
I've got us tapped
into the bureau's cameras.

66
00:04:20,462 --> 00:04:21,802
Tight as you can.

67
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,332
Tighter.

68
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:28,665
All right.
Come on, come on.

69
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:33,055
So, what do we know?

70
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,403
It's like the caller said,
the guy's name is Harold Clark.

71
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:39,164
He has... well, he had a family farm
right outside Fredericksburg, Virginia.

72
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:42,490
- But it's now in foreclosure.
- He definitely seems agitated.

73
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,320
No, he's anxious.

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,036
which I might be if
the President didn't take my call.

75
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,134
You know that's not gonna happen.

76
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:53,078
No, what I'm saying is I'm not
seeing mad bomber anxiety here.

77
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:55,673
Do you have agents
going on to this guy's farm?

78
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:58,075
- Yeah, from richmond.
- Where's Torres?

79
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:00,046
Do you think she's ready
to handle this?

80
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:03,607
No, but we seem to be under lockdown,
I will lower the bar. Where is she?

81
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,425
Helping set up her
cousin's Quinceanera.

82
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:07,215
Ah. Well, hold the cake.

83
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,484
Let's send her down
to the farmhouse.

84
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,286
Let's see what his family thinks
of this little field trip.

85
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,942
- What about the kids?
- I'm all over it.

86
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,379
OK, you guys, let's go. Quietly.

87
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,603
Wait. Come here, you.

88
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:24,486
Hand it over.

89
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,355
Yeah. Nice try, son.
That's how I got it.

90
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:29,320
We need you all in
the conference room.

91
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:31,178
- Why?
- Because it's awesome.

92
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,377
Come on.

93
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,021
Go after him. Go on.

94
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:36,119
Let's go.

95
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:40,776
- Is something wrong?
- We have a bit of a situation.

96
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:44,302
We just need you all away
from... any windows.

97
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:51,231
Hey, 8 third-graders
in a room with no toys and no puppies?

98
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:53,058
It's going to be chaos.

99
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:55,980
Speaking of puppies,
you like kids, don't you?

100
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:01,560
Boys and girls, this
is crazy uncle Loker.

101
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:04,743
He's going to be continuing
our education on lying.

102
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,607
- For how long?
- As long as it takes.

103
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:16,907
Torres is on road.

104
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:19,942
This is my boss, Asac Steele.

105
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:21,375
Dr Cal Lightman.

106
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:24,643
Bill Steele. Thanks for
letting us set up here.

107
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,381
All right, my office,

108
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:28,149
my science you're obviously after.

109
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:30,032
It's under my command. OK?

110
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:36,177
Where are we doing this?

111
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,860
I have some information
you need to hear.

112
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,208
All right.

113
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:43,995
Optical chemical sensors
are picking up traces

114
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:46,614
of ammonium nitrates
and diesel fuel from the trailer.

115
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,133
Aren't those pretty standard
farmyard smells?

116
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:51,375
Yes, but he could also have
an ANFO bomb big enough

117
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,470
to take out several blocks
of downtown D.C.

118
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,931
Collateral damage-wise there's
a pretty strong case here

119
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,240
for death by sniper,
wouldn't you say?

120
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,955
I mean, you only need to be
30% sure he's got a bomb,

121
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,513
then just kill him,

122
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,179
taking one human life

123
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,385
By saving thousands of others...
Including those kids in there.

124
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:10,221
You're the expert. That's
the call you're going to have to make.

125
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,602
What? Do I look like
an FBI puppet to you?

126
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:16,055
Your offices, your command,
you're the one who said that.

127
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:17,688
Yeah, I did say that.

128
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:19,863
All right. No, thanks.

129
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,243
Come on, look, look, look.

130
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:26,809
My boss is a really good guy,

131
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:29,031
But not equipped to figure
this thing out the you are.

132
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,491
We need to know.

133
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,509
Does that guy have
a bomb in a trailer or not?

134
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,086
All right.

135
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:39,067
if I'm going to do this,
I'll need to deal with him personally,

136
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,921
- can you put me through?
- We have our own negotiators.

137
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,007
Bombers have a messiah complex so...

138
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,424
Avoid discussion of the bomber's
present crisis,

139
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,945
in order to prevent him
from exercising his god-like

140
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,302
power to destroy and kill...

141
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:54,654
Yeah. I wrote that bit
in the manual.

142
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:55,887
Is that true?

143
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,853
Well, when you're ready...

144
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
All right.

145
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:11,824
<i>Hello.</i>

146
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:14,327
Harold, I'm cal Lightman.

147
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,412
<i>Do you have the president with you?</i>

148
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,673
Not right now,

149
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:19,624
But I'm calling at his request.

150
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,792
<i>Call me back when you got him.</i>

151
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:25,235
What do I know?

152
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:40,437
- Yes?
- Mary Clark?

153
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:42,198
Who are you?

154
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:44,782
May we come inside, ma'am?

155
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,442
My friends are here.

156
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,069
Oh, this won't take long.

157
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:53,603
<i>We are live outside the
treasury department annex</i>

158
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:56,272
<i>In northwest Washington, D.C.
Where a disgruntled...</i>

159
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:59,307
Has Harold ever talked about taking
action against the government?

160
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,438
- Mrs. Clark?
- He complained,

161
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,545
you know, like everyone
else about taxes and the economy.

162
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:10,258
I can't believe he's up there
in damn D.C. with his tractor.

163
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,718
You did not know that he
was going to go do this?

164
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,369
He talked about, um...

165
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:19,445
Maybe going up there
with a megaphone...

166
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:24,427
And calling out them bastards in the
treasury department, but not this.

167
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:26,897
It sounds like Harold's
pretty angry.

168
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,782
You're damn right he's pissed.

169
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,665
They took his family farm.

170
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,538
Three generations, they had it.

171
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:37,339
Ma'am, it's not a huge leap
from anger to violence.

172
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:39,370
Does he have a bomb in that trailer?

173
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,106
You listen to me.

174
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,079
Harold and I have been together
since sophomore year in high school. 

175
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:46,817
I know this man.

176
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,088
He would never hurt anyone.

177
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:50,506
You didn't answer.

178
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:53,433
No, he doesn't have a damn bomb.
He just...

179
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,139
He just wants to talk
to the President.

180
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:00,058
You don't believe that.

181
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,341
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
fear all over your face.

182
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,352
I'm not afraid of what
he's going to do.

183
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:10,485
I'm afraid of what you all
are going to do to him.

184
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,769
So, unless you have
a search warrant to be here,

185
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:16,502
I'd really like it
if you'd leave my home.

186
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:19,772
- I can get a warrant in 10 minutes.
- Then get it.

187
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:28,615
Reading emotions helps us
discover lies.

188
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:31,596
Who wants to tell me what
emotion this person is feeling?

189
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,600
This one and that one.

190
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:40,807
Contempt.

191
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,634
I don't think they
know what that is.

192
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:45,811
Is this really science?
It seems dumb.

193
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,772
We were supposed to
leave half an hour ago.

194
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,066
- Why are we still here?
- Now's when we have music class.

195
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:53,463
- Isn't this better than music class?
- No.

196
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:54,550
Dr. Cal!

197
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:59,569
They want to know why they're here
Instead of music class, as usual.

198
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:02,840
It's my fault. I told your bus driver
to pick up friends at the airport.

199
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:06,582
And the plane was late, so he's stuck
there, waiting for them. Sorry.

200
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,668
Are you allowed to do that?

201
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,365
I got permission
from your principal.

202
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,053
You know, someone in here
is definitely lying

203
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:18,386
about Clyde the turtle.
I can smell it.

204
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,634
Loker, get your guitar,
entertain the troops.

205
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,190
Oh, it's Torres. Hey.

206
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,779
I spoke to Harold's wife.
She's definitely hiding something.

207
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,783
- Did you ask her about the bomb?
- She doesn't believe he has one.

208
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,327
Who ever heard of a husband
keeping secrets from his wife?

209
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,780
The only thing I know for sure is
she doesn't believe he's violent.

210
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:48,874
<i>Well, keep after it, all right?</i>

211
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:57,827
Hello?

212
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:00,124
Harold, I've got a question.

213
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,886
Call me when you're ready to
let me speak with the President.

214
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,491
he wants to know about what.

215
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:07,224
Is it global warming?
Death penalty? What?

216
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:10,605
I want to talk about our tax
money being sent overseas

217
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,326
or bailing out banks,

218
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,397
but letting our farmers
choke on their own crops.

219
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,123
Somebody's got to stand up.

220
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:17,987
All right.
I'll pass that on.

221
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,375
In the meantime, could you
answer a question for me?

222
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,449
What is it?

223
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:24,385
All right. What kind of bomb
are we talking about?

224
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:25,251
What?

225
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,997
There's a rumor
that you're sitting on a bomb.

226
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:30,664
Is this you trying
to change the subject?

227
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:32,793
No, we spoke to your wife.
She was a little off.

228
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,511
I want the President.

229
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,860
Let me replay that.

230
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:40,436
What?

231
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:44,427
When you asked him if he had a bomb,

232
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,775
the left side of his lip tightened.

233
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:48,058
It's contempt.

234
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,646
- He's being deceptive.
- So you're giving us the green light.

235
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,210
What is it with you?

236
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:55,024
Why is it always red or green?

237
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,310
You want me to do what?
Pull the trigger?

238
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,445
Wait, let me explain
something to you.

239
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,864
I'm trying to save innocent
lives, your included.

240
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,282
All right?
There are no easy choices here.

241
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,195
So let's all act like grownups,

242
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,704
make the hard choices,
and salvage what we can.

243
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:11,863
Right, well, what I'm telling
you is that

244
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:13,800
he's being deceptive,

245
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,908
in his denial of having a bomb.

246
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:20,399
I don't know yet
what that means exactly.

247
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:23,163
It's good for me.

248
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:25,462
Do it and I'll prep the snipers.

249
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,879
So once you're in place,
concealed, and on target, sound off.

250
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:34,272
Let's follow all protocols on this.
No happy triggers.

251
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,810
Roger that, sir.

252
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,067
Do you guys have to
do this in the lobby?

253
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,581
We've got kids we've
managed to keep in the dark so far.

254
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:43,134
Until I give the word,
you are not authorized to shoot

255
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:45,116
Unless someone's in danger.
You got that?

256
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,535
- We'll be waiting for green light.
- Then get going.

257
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,703
Yes, sir!

258
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:57,516
A little mood lighting?

259
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,089
The ballasts on
the fluorescent lights interferes

260
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,307
with our video and
encrypted radio communications.

261
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,927
All right, we're good to go.

262
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,546
Now you've got some semblance
of a rapport with harold.

263
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,339
Keep him distracted
while the snipers move in, OK?

264
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:12,723
Oh, that's nice.

265
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,762
Remind me to renegotiate
my contract with you.

266
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:19,446
- We appreciate what you're doing, doc.
- Yes, I know you do.

267
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:24,909
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Harold. Me again.

268
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:26,741
I spoke with the president's office.

269
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:29,919
- <i>When can I talk to him?</i>
- You need to promise me,

270
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,871
that no one's gonna get hurt.

271
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,672
<i>I don't want anybody to get hurt.</i>

272
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:39,003
That was genuine.
So I'll work with that or I'm done here?

273
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,727
I believe you when you say that,
But I don't think you're telling me

274
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:45,807
the whole truth about the bomb.

275
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:47,550
<i>Quit stalling.</i>

276
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:50,134
Did you tell the president
what I wanted to talk about?

277
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:51,637
Yeah, I did. I told him.

278
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:54,644
But he wants to know what it is
that you want him to do.

279
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,646
<i>I'll tell him on the phone.</i>

280
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:58,814
Is your wife involved in this?

281
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:03,127
<i>No, no, this is all me.
Quit playing games.</i>

282
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:05,994
Right.

283
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:08,878
OK. Seats for,
we're going to have a concert.

284
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,928
How dangerous is it out there?

285
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:16,912
How dangerous is it in here?

286
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:18,685
I don't know.

287
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:23,176
But I trus Lightman, and it's my job
to keep these kids from freaking out.

288
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,610
What if their teacher
is freaked out?

289
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,042
Well, I'll help her, too.

290
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:31,264
But you've got to help me
with them first, OK?

291
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,657
Who knows the words to
"puff, the magic dragon"?

292
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,230
My mom said that song's
about illegal drugs.

293
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:46,372
I don't think that's ever
been definitively proven.

294
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,930
- Sniper teams moving in position.
- All right. Copy that.

295
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:53,014
You can go ahead and try engage him.
We're ready.

296
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,493
<i>You have the president?</i>

297
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:05,383
All right Harold,
a little reality check here.

298
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:08,758
Your situation is veering
from bad to worse by the minute.

299
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,214
<i>I'm getting cold, and I'm getting angry.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.</i>

300
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:16,437
Well, that's unfortunate,
because I'm the only person here

301
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:19,162
who has any desire to talk to you.

302
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,897
<i>I just want to talk
to the president.</i>

303
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:23,816
Let's start with the truth then.

304
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,901
What kind of bomb
are we talking about?

305
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,410
The bomb is rigged.

306
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,367
- How?
- <i>It just is, OK?</i>

307
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,212
<i>If you do anything to me,
you try to hurt me, the bomb goes off.</i>

308
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,894
And if I don't speak
directly to the president

309
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:50,718
before the sun goes down,
the bomb goes off!

310
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:56,183
<i>Look, man, all that can be avoided
if you just have the president call me.</i>

311
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,455
- Is he telling the truth?
- Yeah.

312
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,152
Yeah, I believe he is.

313
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,862
But he's also showing fear.

314
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:11,656
It's the kind of fear that you get
when someone's got a gun to your head.

315
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:13,658
Believe me, I've seen that.

316
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:18,536
You know what, zoom into
that tractor seat. Go ahead.

317
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,789
Yeah. Lower.

318
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,565
Lower, lower,
keep going, keep going.

319
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:24,543
Keep going.
Right ther!

320
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:29,465
Oh, god.

321
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,172
<i>We didn't see it before
because his jacket was in the way.</i>

322
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,142
Sniper one to base.

323
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,728
Sniper teams in position.
We're waiting for green light.

324
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,315
Just hold your position, sniper team.
You are not cleared to fire. Stand down.

325
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,985
Sniper one is clear. Standing down.

326
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,687
If this guy has a detonator
switch on his seat and if we fire,

327
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,207
that might detonate the bomb.

328
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,367
Let's use an LVB water disrupter.

329
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,952
Is that what I think it is?

330
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,037
It's a bomb we bring in
to kill his bomb.

331
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,331
Oh, this is just getting
better and better.

332
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,549
I found something on the 911 call
you should hear.

333
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,948
<i>There's a crazy farmer named Harold
Clark driving up to Washington D.C.</i>

334
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:14,468
<i>to blow you federal folks up.</i>

335
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,836
One more time.

336
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:19,522
<i>There's a crazy farmer named Harold
Clark driving up to Washington D.C.</i>

337
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:21,058
<i>to blow you federal folks up.</i>

338
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,060
All right,
just that last little bit.

339
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,021
<i>Blow you federal folks up.</i>

340
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,981
- Do you hear it?
- Yeah, he's smiling.

341
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,941
- What?
- The inflection of his voice

342
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,735
changes cause smile changes sound

343
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,571
of your voice by shortening
the voice resonance chamber.

344
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,180
He's smiling as he says
"blow you federal folks up."

345
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,997
Wait, you can tell someone's
smiling by listening to him?

346
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:40,776
You can't. We can.

347
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,749
He know something you don't
and he's laughing at you.

348
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:49,167
- So what is this, a practical joke?
- No, I think he's telling the truth.

349
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:51,284
He finds some kind
of sick humor in this.

350
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:53,929
- He may be connected to this.
- Yeah.

351
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:56,689
Harold is not working on his own.

352
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:59,695
We need to find this guy quick.

353
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:03,586
All right, yeah.

354
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:07,848
- Good, we're running out of time
- No, I get it, I do.

355
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:10,595
You're looking for someone to blame
in case this thing goes south.

356
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,717
That's why you set up
your command center in my office,

357
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,991
effectively putting my
finger on the trigger.

358
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:18,641
What do you say we make sure
before you go ahead and kill him?

359
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,816
Are you done?

360
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,338
Cause constitutionally speaking,
you don't have to be right

361
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:25,179
to use deadly force,
we just have to be reasonably sure.

362
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:28,207
And in a world full
of bombs and lunatics,

363
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,087
sometimes there's no room for
scientific certainty.

364
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,992
You're so scared of making huge mistake,
you're prepared to make a smaller,

365
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:37,132
yet potentially still tragic one.

366
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:40,613
You want this to end peacefully?
Give me proof and allow me to do that.

367
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:43,982
The 911 caller was just
id'd as Ron Jackson.

368
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,426
White male, 38,
lives near Harold in Virginia.

369
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,700
Boss, we've got time.

370
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:51,584
We should get Torres and one
of your agents over there right now.

371
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,536
In this situation stalling
and not making a decision

372
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,103
is same thing as making one.

373
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:58,596
I want to be certain of the truth
when I make my decision.

374
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,323
You better make it soon

375
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,401
The clock is ticking on that bomb.

376
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,043
Bomb? What bomb?

377
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,290
He had to go to the bathroom.

378
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:09,621
You're a big kid, right?

379
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:13,625
You're not going to turn into one of
them whiny little cry babies, are you?

380
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:15,798
All right.

381
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,055
Here's the truth,

382
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:25,111
Not far from here there's a man
who says he's got a bomb.

383
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:28,035
He's trying to get
some people's attention.

384
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,646
Now, maybe he has
and maybe he's lying.

385
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:34,389
But, in the meantime, you and
your mates, You're going to stay here,

386
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:35,940
just to be on the safe side.

387
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:37,763
You got it? All right.

388
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,829
Now, it's my job
to find out what's what,

389
00:20:40,913 --> 00:20:43,663
with this maybe / maybe-not
bomb type thing.

390
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,912
And I'm excellent at my job,
just ask Loker here.

391
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:50,228
And it's your job to be
a top-notch third-grader.

392
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,016
You up for it?

393
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:53,245
Huh?

394
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:55,921
You up for keeping this
a secret from your mates

395
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,712
So that they don't get all,
scaredy cat on you?

396
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:00,134
Good. All right.

397
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:02,552
Go pee then.

398
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,533
Excuse me.

399
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:20,511
- What can I do for you?
- I'm looking for Ron Jackson.

400
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:22,045
Is he your husband?

401
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,408
- Don't remind me.
- Wait, ma'am.

402
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,285
FBI.

403
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,952
Where is he, ma'am?
We need to talk to him.

404
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,250
Sorry, I thought you all
were bill collectors.

405
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:34,085
Where's your husband, ma'am?

406
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,315
Honestly, I got no idea.
What's he done now?

407
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,839
You know Harold Clark?

408
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:41,717
Yeah. I guess everyone
knows Harold now.

409
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:45,648
- How do you know him?
- Him and Ron run a farmers' co-op.

410
00:21:45,732 --> 00:21:48,667
They mostly get together, drink,
and bitch about things.

411
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:51,401
All right if we take
a look around, ma'am?

412
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:53,987
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' to hide.

413
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:12,887
Blasting caps for bombs.

414
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:26,065
All right, look, just hear me out, OK?
Maybe Jackson was an accomplice,

415
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:29,620
but he got cold feet, decided
to call 911, and give up the whole plot.

416
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:32,738
That doesn't explain
the smile behind his voice.

417
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:34,897
- What is that?
- Oh, that.

418
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:37,227
That's how these boys
plan to win this.

419
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:39,823
- It doesn't look like much, but!
- Here's the deal, OK?

420
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:42,952
We're going to place that container
of water near Harold's bomb.

421
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:45,823
There's a large quantity of C4
in the middle of the container,

422
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,493
which we will then detonate,
sending the water out at 72 million psi.

423
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,413
It will disrupt harold's
bomb before it can explode.

424
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,250
- And Harold's birdfeed.
- He won't even know what hit him.

425
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:01,383
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

426
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,678
What is that thing
coming towards me?

427
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,097
<i>It's an X-ray machine,</i>

428
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,549
we needed to map the bomb so we can
figure out a safe evacuation plan.

429
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:14,977
Tell me about Ron Jackson.

430
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:18,909
<i>You know about ron?</i>

431
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,194
Better still, tell me how
to disable the bomb so nobody gets hurt.

432
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:29,283
I don't,
I don't know how to stop it.

433
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,018
<i>It's not my bomb.</i>

434
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:33,446
Whose is it?

435
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:36,791
Is it jackson's?
Is he pulling the strings?

436
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:40,878
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

437
00:23:42,442 --> 00:23:44,590
He'll kill her if I tell
you guys anything.

438
00:23:46,751 --> 00:23:47,701
Kill who?

439
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:52,056
Look, you might as well tell me.
It's just us on the phone,

440
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:55,343
all right? I mean...
You're already in a very bad spot.

441
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:57,479
You do know that, don't you?

442
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,595
They have someone
in my house with my wife.

443
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,986
They're going to kill her
if I don't go through with this.

444
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:09,264
<i>I don't know what else to do.</i>

445
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,018
He's telling the truth.

446
00:24:17,096 --> 00:24:20,909
The Washington MPD
has coveraged 12 blocks area...

447
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:25,015
- It's us. Are you at the clubhouse?
- <i>Yeah, I'm working through.</i>

448
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,317
- Where's agent Irving?
- He's doing the search of the bar.

449
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,305
Give simple answers and don't let anyone
think what you're saying is important.

450
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:38,645
<i>Is there a man there named Dave Miller?
He would've been there all day.</i>

451
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,647
I'm going to call Irving
and tell him to get in there.

452
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,775
This man is probably armed
and he's willing to kill.

453
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:48,141
I did not know that.

454
00:24:48,475 --> 00:24:51,605
He's there as a threat against the wife
to force harold to go through with this.

455
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:54,910
- <i>That would certainly explain...</i>
- The fear you saw earlier.

456
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:58,914
OK, well, that sounds fun.
Hopefully, I can get tickets.

457
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:02,001
Reynolds has been on with agent Irving.
He's on his way. Just sit tight.

458
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:04,512
Cool. Let me know how it goes.

459
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:11,146
Shouldn't be more than a few minutes.
We'll get out of here.

460
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:13,009
What were they saying about harold?

461
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:15,176
Find out what kind of bomb it is?

462
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:16,538
No, no.

463
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:18,907
But I do have some bad news.

464
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:23,543
I don't think they're going to let
Harold talk to the president.

465
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:26,064
- Probably not.
- But I think I have a solution

466
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:28,716
To this whole thing and
you two know him well,

467
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,066
Obviously, so let me
just run it by you.

468
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:34,653
I have a friend who works in assemblyman
kincaid's office.

469
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:37,198
Maybe I call in a favor and
he can talk to Harold.

470
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:40,194
That's, uh... that's not
really the same thing.

471
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:45,641
But at least it's a phone call with
someone who works in the government.

472
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:47,918
Lady, quit wasting our time.

473
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:51,569
That's kind of the point, actually.

474
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,552
Put your hands over your head.

475
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:17,965
People lie all the time.
It must make you pretty cynical.

476
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:21,248
Sometimes, but you get to
see the truth occasionally.

477
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,710
Truth is, I'm really
scared right now.

478
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:27,434
I know.

479
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:28,903
Me, too.

480
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:31,424
Well, a little bit.

481
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:35,388
I just... I want another
chance, you know?

482
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,106
I'd do things different.

483
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:39,385
Is that a stupid thing to say?

484
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:41,037
No, not at all.

485
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,665
Oscar's acting weird.

486
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:53,619
Oscar, you OK?

487
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:57,493
Hey.

488
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:00,068
You know, when I was your age,

489
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,948
I had a crush on this
girl... older woman, really...

490
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:05,678
Sixth grader.

491
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:08,852
I was always worrying about it,
stressing out about it,

492
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:11,935
And then I realized there
was nothing you can do.

493
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:20,985
So, sometimes, when
there's nothing you can do,

494
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:24,621
You just have to believe
everything is gonna be OK.

495
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:26,254
And you write a song.

496
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:29,523
Can't be worried and write a
song at the same time?

497
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:33,698
I mean, you look to me like a guy who
can write some fantastic rhymes.

498
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:34,984
Am I right?

499
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:38,574
I can tell that about you.

500
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:41,055
I can see it on your face.

501
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:43,705
So, let's give it a shot.

502
00:27:43,948 --> 00:27:46,257
Your wife and your son
are safe, Harold.

503
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
Thank you.

504
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:49,898
Tell me about Jackson.

505
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:53,343
I don't know. He just put me in this
tractor and he told me to drive here.

506
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:56,474
He said if I got out of the seat,
it would trigger the bomb.

507
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:59,601
And he didn't mention
any other plan to you.

508
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:00,680
No, nothing.

509
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:04,260
I mean, I knew that he was
even angrier than I was.

510
00:28:04,343 --> 00:28:07,393
But I never thought in
a million years he would...

511
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,720
I'm a dead man.

512
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:16,389
Can I speak to my wife?

513
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:19,581
Yeah I'll work on that for you.

514
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,650
Sit tight, harold, all right?
I'll get back to you.

515
00:28:24,518 --> 00:28:27,790
You've to call off the disrupter charge
Until we can figure out what's going on.

516
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:29,283
Harold is just a pawn.

517
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:32,403
IRA used to do the same thing.
They'd coerce civilians to do the work.

518
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:36,029
There's nothing we can do for him.
He's sitting on a bomb we can't defuse.

519
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:38,212
Look, if he moves, call me back.

520
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:43,011
Jackson just turned his phone on.
We triangulated it to 15th and I street.

521
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,250
Hey, that is,

522
00:28:44,726 --> 00:28:47,393
right here,
Just outside the blast radius.

523
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:51,606
And near the hotel where secretary
Dobbins is holding his economic summit.

524
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:53,875
Jackson's credit card
was used to rent

525
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,598
- A white box van 4 hours ago.
- All right, I'm headed over there now.

526
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,981
Remind me what this guy looks like?

527
00:28:59,312 --> 00:29:01,924
- Let's get that out to all units.
- he's not gonna look like that.

528
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,118
I mean, he's probably gonna
be disguised or something.

529
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:08,867
You need to look for the posture
And the gaze of a... Terrorist.

530
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:12,838
- Why am I telling you this?
- Why don't you just come with me?

531
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,450
Take a look at that...
white box van, no plates.

532
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,427
Suspension's maxed out.

533
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:40,054
Yeah.

534
00:29:40,532 --> 00:29:43,351
So the terrorists have
their own delivery vehicle.

535
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:46,637
This takes me back.
He's gonna want to hide in plain sight

536
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,747
Could be in that crowd over there.
So he can keep an eye on his van.

537
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,238
Yeah, on the target.

538
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:52,771
You know how it is.

539
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:55,459
What happens if we spot him?

540
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,742
- That's the signal.
- All right.

541
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:02,439
Yeah, give me the bomb squad.

542
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,360
Hey, Jackson.

543
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,760
We've got Harold's
wife and son. They're safe.

544
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:48,767
You got the wrong guy.

545
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,474
You're Ron Jackson, right?

546
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,891
You've got a bomb in that van
back there.

547
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:53,974
Answer me.

548
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:58,161
What about harold's trailer?
Is that just a decoy?

549
00:31:01,115 --> 00:31:02,111
Answer me!

550
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:18,098
I know that's the trigger.

551
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:20,129
Jackson, put the phone down!

552
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,202
Put it down!

553
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:30,463
FBI!

554
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:49,576
All right, so you're all
officially songwriters now.

555
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:52,826
Nice work, and I want to thank Oscar
for these great lyrics.

556
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:56,183
- My pleasure.
- All right, here we go. And...

557
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,830
sing your part.
Help me out,

558
00:31:59,188 --> 00:32:00,538
all right? Good.

559
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,621
<i>I say I'm 10 when I'm 9 and a half</i>

560
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:11,965
<i>my uncle tells a joke

561

562

563
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:19,539

00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:20,841

00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:24,278

<i>but a lie's still a lie,

572
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:36,847
Here you go.

573
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:41,213
<i>I pretend I'm asleep

574
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,196
<i>I said I ate my chicken
but I just ate the skin</i>

575
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,840

577
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:53,404

- <i>white lie!</i>

578
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,772

<i>white</i>

597
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:48,976
Good work.

598
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:58,329
- <i>Command post.</i>
- We've got Jackson and the bomb.

599
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,748
Things are about to get
wrapped up here, too.

600
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,941
Did you get Howard out
of the tractor yet?

601
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:05,513
I can't risk the lives
of my bomb techs on this.

602
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,682
<i>There's no telling how many booby
traps there are in Harold's device.</i>

603
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:10,549
- Boss, listen...
<i>- Look, Ben,</i>

604
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,142
you did a great job?
But we're proceeding. I'm sorry.

605
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:17,356
If there are other
out there, they find out Jackson's dead,

606
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:20,039
They'll push the button
on Harold's bomb.

607
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:25,206
Hey, when I asked jackson
about harold's bomb, right,

608
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:27,932
He was defensive.
He was bluffing.

609
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:31,037
Can you tell me with 100% certainty

610
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,505
that there's no bomb on
Harold Clark's trailer?

611
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,655
Not yet.
Give me time.

612
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,808
We're out of time.

613
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:17,548
Hello?

614
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:19,981
Harold, we've got
Jackson and Miller,

615
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:21,662
And we took care of Jackson's bomb.

616
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,456
How's my family?

617
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:25,166
They're doing fine.

618
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:28,502
Thank you...
For saving them.

619
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:31,328
I can't take credit for that,
but I'll pass on your thanks.

620
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:33,963
The FBI still thinks you
have a bomb in your trailer

621
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:37,076
And they want to disrupt you
with an explosive device that could

622
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,209
kill you in the process.

623
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,138
I understand.

624
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:44,274
Harold, did you ever see the bomb?

625
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:46,520
Or were you just told
about a dead man switch?

626
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,732
I heard the click of the switch.
I never saw the bomb.

627
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,276
Ron said that he would
call and tell me how

628
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:55,488
to diffuse it if I just stalled
you guys long enough.

629
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,607
- That's not good enough.
- Yeah, no, I get it.

630
00:35:59,444 --> 00:36:01,619
Look, they should go ahead
and do it,

631
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:03,698
just to be sure.

632
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:07,518
<i>There are too many people around here,</i>
and if there is a bomb in my trailer...

633
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:10,576
I'd rather die than

634
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:13,464
than live knowing I may have
killed other people.

635
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:16,008
Yeah, we're not there yet.

636
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:19,408
Please, just let me talk to my wife
before they do it, though.

637
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,597
Please? So I can just say good-bye?

638
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:33,706
Honey, I hope you can forgive me.

639
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:35,859
What are you talking about?

640
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:38,076
I love you.

641
00:36:38,618 --> 00:36:41,015
I have always loved you.

642
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:43,097
And I want you to...

643
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:46,642
I want you to give bobby
a big hug for me.

644
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,530
I want you to tell him
that I am sorry.

645
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:53,602
I've always been very proud to
have you as a husband, Harold.

646
00:36:58,807 --> 00:36:59,907
Let's do it.

647
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:05,781
You know, you should leave
if you don't want to see this.

648
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:13,543
- It's about bloody time, Torres.
- <i>I got it.</i>

649
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:15,714
<i>- It should be ready to pull up.</i>
- All right.

650
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:18,681
- And?
- <i>I think you're right.</i>

651
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:21,642
<i>Is there a bomb in Harold's trailer?</i>

652
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:25,168
- <i>Yes, there is.</i>
- <i>Why should I believe you?</i>

653
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:28,126
Ron wanted to kill the secretary
of treasury and all those money men

654
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:29,364
when they evacuated.

655
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,035
<i>Even if that didn't work, he was going
to have Harold's bomb blow</i>

656
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:34,170
<i>just to get the message across.</i>

657
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:36,237
<i>So, yeah,</i>

658
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,299
<i>Harold's got a bomb, all right.</i>

659
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:40,499
- You see that?
- I see it.

660
00:37:40,582 --> 00:37:42,932
Right, he's lying through his teeth.

661
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,652
I mean, their only hope
of collateral damage

662
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,934
Is if the FBI
blows Harold up for 'em.

663
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:50,019
I mean, you're the puppet now.

664
00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:52,355
No. I can't take that chance.

665
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:54,292
I'm going to see Harold.

666
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,749
Ihave to go with Lightman.

667
00:37:55,878 --> 00:37:57,892
I said no.
I can't allow it.

668
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,010
Look, you asked me to make the call?
Well, now, I'm making it.

669
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,745
- There is no bomb in that trailer.
- If you're wrong, it's your ass.

670
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:08,079
Well, if I'm wrong, in 5 minutes,
I won't have an ass, will I?

671
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:10,748
- Are you telling me you're 100% sure?
- Yes.

672
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:12,926
But...

673
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:15,596
I'd clear the area,

674
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:17,088
you know?

675
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:18,996
Just in case I'm wrong.

676
00:38:52,576 --> 00:38:53,676
Hey, harold.

677
00:38:58,954 --> 00:39:00,521
Hey, how ya doin'?

678
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,554
I'm Cal Lightman.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

679
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:06,470
You're safe now.
You can come on down.

680
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:10,536
- Are you out of your mind?
- No, not right now,

681
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,915
but, in a couple of hours,
I'm gonna be really

682
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,145
very drunk.

683
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:16,480
Well, what about the bomb?

684
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,567
There is no bomb.
It's safe.

685
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:21,578
There's a bomb.
I heard a click.

686
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:25,641
Harold, this is probably your one and
only chance to walk away from this.

687
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:28,624
So, if I were you, I'd
definitely step on down.

688
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,628
Careful.

689
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,063
Here, let me give you a hand.
You're all right.

690
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:04,094
There ya go.

691
00:40:08,224 --> 00:40:09,224
All right.

692
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:13,005
Don't go near that one
because that one is a bomb.

693
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,490
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hang on a minute.

694
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,990
Good work.

695
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:53,149
Nice work.

696
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,155
No? OK.

697
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,623
I'm the one who stole clyde.

698
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,123
Oh, I know.

699
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,528
He's a turtle and he doesn't
like being in the classroom

700
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,278
At night all by himself.

701
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:07,930
I took him home
so he wouldn't be lonely.

702
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:11,465
OK. You know, I think that Clyde
likes being on his own at night.

703
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:14,848
I think he enjoys the quiet.

704
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:17,973
I say you bring him back into school
tomorrow, all right?

705
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:21,110
To the classroom.
But you sneak him back in.

706
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,350
No one needs to know a thing.

707
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,654
I think I should tell miss angela.

708
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:29,737
Really?

709
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:33,235
Oh, good girl.

710
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:35,512
I might have a job for you one day.

711
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:38,014
All yours.

712
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:40,673
Get out.
Don't miss your bus.

713
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:43,306
Go on, you guys.
I'll be right there.

714
00:41:57,742 --> 00:42:00,392
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

715
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:04,528
You all right?

716
00:42:06,438 --> 00:42:07,988
Anyone want a drink?
