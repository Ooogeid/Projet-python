1
00:00:02,798 --> 00:00:03,798
Victor?

2
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:07,673
Victor, I need your help
with something.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,773
Honey, I got water boiling.

4
00:00:10,747 --> 00:00:12,311
Dinner can wait.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,651
Want to help me out of this?

6
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:46,859
You get it hard
on an old man, don't you?

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,531
I do, don't I?

8
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:07,771
How did I get so lucky?

9
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,235
You didn't.

10
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,861
I'm using you for sex.

11
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,788
I love you, Clara.

12
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:15,442
I love you more.

13
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:19,161
I'll be back in an hour.

14
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,080
Where are you off to?

15
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:23,540
Strawberries.

16
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:25,874
Champagne.

17
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,177
Don't you leave this bed.

18
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:52,407
My God, Leo.

19
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,615
What am I going to do?

20
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,041
Did you kill your husband?!

21
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,562
No. I loved my husband.

22
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:09,685
If you're acquitted,
you'll be a billionaire.

23
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,985
- How does that make me feel?
- My client has no comment.

24
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,674
What's it like sleeping alone now?

25
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,259
By the way, how was the sex?

26
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,975
Get her inside.

27
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:20,473
What station are you from?

28
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,641
Your credentials?

29
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,143
A public street in a free country.
I don't need credentials.

30
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:26,543
You're no journalist.

31
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,522
Someone told you
to ask those questions.

32
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:30,357
I'm doing my job.

33
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,588
I think I can guess who for.

34
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:37,427
What are you getting off Mrs. Musso?

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,450
More sadness than guilt really.

36
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:42,866
The evidence is rock solid.

37
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:45,284
There's a partial print
on a syringe containing cyanide.

38
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,110
No sign of forced entry
in her apartment.

39
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,084
She is the primary beneficiary
of the will.

40
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,629
You got all that going for you, Crosby.
What do you need me for?

41
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,497
Never underestimate
the value of an expert witness.

42
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,717
Doc, you wanna do this?

43
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,714
How was the sex?

44
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,068
<i>Hello, Zoe.</i>

45
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,895
It's been a long time.

46
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,686
What do you need?
A reference?

47
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,773
I haven't had any trouble
getting offers so far.

48
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,786
You sent one of your minions
to ask vicious and personal questions

49
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:16,487
to my client just so you could read
her reactions on TV.

50
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,489
I can't hear you.
No, can you say that again.

51
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,533
Hear me now?

52
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,300
- Clear as a bell.
- Counselor.

53
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,005
I'd like to speak
with my ex-husband in private,

54
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,208
if that's all right.

55
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:35,059
Absolutely.

56
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:37,685
I'd like an answer by the end
of the business day, if you don't mind.

57
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,511
Otherwise, I gotta go to Rayder firm,
I don't really want to do that.

58
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:43,650
Fair enough.

59
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:51,096
Let me guess.

60
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:53,384
He wants you to be
his expert witness?

61
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,376
Your client is hiding something.

62
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,313
Probably of a sexual nature,

63
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,914
granted that is wishful
thinking on my part.

64
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,285
She's bringing that hand up to her face.
She's got a secret.

65
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,538
I will tear you apart on the stand, Cal.
And you know it.

66
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,097
Nice charm, that is.

67
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,125
You think
she didn't kill her husband?

68
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:13,562
- Yes, I do.
- What makes you so sure?

69
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,491
All the evidence is circumstantial.
And as for motive, there is none.

70
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,807
My client didn't want for anything.

71
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,621
It was a loving
and faithful marriage.

72
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:23,470
An alibi?

73
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:28,767
- How much is she paying you?
- Exactly what I'm worth.

74
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,494
Drinks are on you then.

75
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,814
Still... no alibi.

76
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,513
The trauma of finding
her husband dead

77
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:39,487
caused Clara to lose her memory
for the 40 minutes

78
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,573
between the last time she saw him alive
and when she discovered his body.

79
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:50,045
Look at it. I mean, really.

80
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:53,115
She is pushing
those tears out, she is.

81
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,543
She's faking it.

82
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,343
We both know
that this "science" of yours

83
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,220
has a serious margin for error.

84
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,933
It won't cut it in a court of law.

85
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:06,931
What will?

86
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,976
Tears for a dead husband
that left her $1.2 billion?

87
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,871
I know why you're doing this.
You're not going to get under my skin.

88
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:14,996
Or my skirt.

89
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,108
That's a lie, that is.
I mean the skin part.

90
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,744
Is this funny to you?
The most important case of my career?

91
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:23,545
I haven't even taken
the bloody job yet, Zoe.

92
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,239
Unlike you, I don't need to have studied
amazonian pigmies for 6 years

93
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:28,452
- to know that that's a lie.
- You want me to do this.

94
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,996
You don't know why you do.
But you do.

95
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,458
Did I say
"serious margin for error"?

96
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,643
I was being generous.

97
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,544
Or couldn't you tell.

98
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:40,229
It's going to be a shame

99
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:42,238
to disappoint you in the courtroom.

100
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,261
La <i><font color="#ff0000">Lie</font> <font color="#ffffff">to</font><font color="#ff0000"> team</font></i> présente :

101
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,288
Épisode 213 : <i>The Whole Truth</i>

102
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:16,333
<i>How can anyone think Clara
killed her husband?</i>

103
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,918
<i>I've been friends for 10 years.</i>

104
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,936
<i>There's no way
she could have done this.</i>

105
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,465
Gotta love how everyone comes out
of the woodwork on cases like this.

106
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,503
They've gotta get
their 15 minutes somehow.

107
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,552
By turning this woman's life
into a circus.

108
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:29,820
Yeah. We're all part
of that circus now.

109
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:30,995
Prosecution.

110
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,018
Foster, you're prepping witnesses.
You two, you get jury watch.

111
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,978
Read the jurors for the whole trial?

112
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,981
Track 'em individually, see what makes
them tick. But look at them as a group.

113
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,984
I wanna know which way they're leaning.
The leaders, the followers.

114
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:43,569
Well go on.

115
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,076
You're not just doing this
to push Zoe's buttons.

116
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,037
There's something else going on.

117
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:54,997
This is about justice, Foster.

118
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,041
There's something else.
Zoe-related.

119
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,169
Justice for a murder victim.

120
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,588
By avoiding my question,
you just answered it.

121
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,716
I just hope for all our sakes,
you know what you're doing.

122
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,529
Join the club.

123
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:11,353
Six of the jurors
look convinced Clara is guilty

124
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:12,916
just from the opening arguments.

125
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,601
You could see approval on their faces
every time the prosecutor talked.

126
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,604
Maybe. But these two
are for the defense.

127
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:21,278
And they've already emerged
as leaders.

128
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:23,984
Jurors 6, 7 and 11 were looking at them,
gaging their reaction.

129
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:26,356
Which way you two leaning?

130
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,027
Maybe he wasn't dying
fast enough for her.

131
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,116
The guy was 30 years older
than she is.

132
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,014
So?
So...

133
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:34,987
It can affect the power dynamic.

134
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:38,332
Imbalance of power in a relationship
can lead to victimization.

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,924
That struck a nerve.

136
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,252
That's interesting.

137
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:44,815
Studies show that the most
successful marriages

138
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,591
are the ones where husbands are at least
5 years older than their wives.

139
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:51,303
So, being with an older man
broadens your horizons, does it?

140
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,607
I'm sure Clara learned a lot
from Victor.

141
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,768
I'm sure she did,
about denture cream.

142
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,937
You're not listening, again.

143
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,524
What Torres is saying is that
she needs to be stimulated, challenged.

144
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,151
By experience.

145
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,863
So, who was this old fart then?

146
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,782
I was talking about Clara.

147
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,359
You weren't.

148
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:17,996
You connected with a memory,
which I proceeded to belittle.

149
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,904
Sorry about that.

150
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,134
You cannot sing
the praises of older men

151
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,926
and then not give up details.

152
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:32,835
Watch me.

153
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,395
All right.

154
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,025
- You couldn't take me one-on-one?
- Been there, done that.

155
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,064
I promise to play nice today.

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,110
Last time you said that
you left claw marks.

157
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:54,050
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, nothing but the truth,

158
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,159
so help you God?

159
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,910
- That's not possible.
- Excuse me.

160
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,348
No one can tell the whole truth,
your honor.

161
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,041
It's subjective. It's filtered
through our own experiences.

162
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,448
- That's the real truth.
- How about promising to be honest

163
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,298
to the best of your ability?

164
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,815
- Now, you're talking.
- Please, be seated.

165
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,910
- Thank you, your honor.
- Dr., your resume speaks for itself.

166
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,472
You're Oxford educated.
You're a doctorate in psychology.

167
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,541
And you're a consultant for the FBI.

168
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,561
As you well know,
the key question in this trial is:

169
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,147
"Where was Clara Musso
the night her husband was murdered?"

170
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,186
The defense wants us to believe

171
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:31,426
that the trauma of finding
her husband dead

172
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:34,364
has left Mrs. Musso unable to recall

173
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,677
the 40 minutes between leaving him

174
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,960
and discovering his corpse.

175
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:41,095
Dr. Lightman,
in your expert opinion,

176
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,082
does this claim of memory loss
pass the sniff test?

177
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:48,942
Could you elaborate?

178
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,965
It's been proven that some trauma...

179
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,241
warfare...

180
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,093
child abuse...

181
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:56,678
can cause memory loss.

182
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,514
- An experience with such cases?
- Yeah. Plenty.

183
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,059
I've worked with soldiers,
rape victims.

184
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:06,188
Memory loss is caused by degradation

185
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:07,564
or abuse.

186
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,359
Shock of a dead spouse,
that'd be a first.

187
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:13,070
How about a shock
of committing murder?

188
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,740
Killers have been known
to experience amnesia.

189
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:18,992
Forensic psychologists
Call it red out.

190
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,163
How common is it to lie,
claiming memory loss?

191
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,582
9 out of 10 people
claiming memory loss are lying.

192
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,042
Why do they do that?

193
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,337
It's easier to say:
"I can't remember".

194
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,663
Than tell the truth.

195
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,434
I have nothing further.

196
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:37,844
Your witness, counselor.

197
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,808
Permission to treat Dr. Lightman
as a hostile witness?

198
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,518
- Granted.
- Dr. Lightman!

199
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,668
I'm sorry.
Won't happen again, your honor.

200
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:47,646
Thank you.

201
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:52,067
Dr. Lightman was born hostile.
He also happens to be my ex-husband.

202
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,652
Guilty as charged.

203
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,777
But, you know, it was my loss.

204
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,616
Because truly she is an angel.

205
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:03,880
The prosecution has touted
your credentials.

206
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,848
Are we to understand
that you possess the gift

207
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,290
of being able to distinguish
between truth and lies?

208
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:12,044
No. No. 20 years of research
is not a gift, is it?

209
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:15,048
You and I know, it's a
bit of a curse, really.

210
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:16,814
Indeed it was.

211
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:20,470
In fact, do you recall
being jeered off the stage

212
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,753
while keynoting the Harvard global
psychology conference in 2005?

213
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:25,017
Yeah. I do. Yeah!

214
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:27,242
Yeah, and it's bonkers.

215
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:31,315
Right? Because I could have
sworn that they were cheering.

216
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:34,860
They called it pop psychology.
Voodoo science.

217
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,112
I think it's because
they're scared of me.

218
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,534
4 years ago when we were still married,
you accused my boss of sleeping with me.

219
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,745
- The gloves are off now!
- Objection your honor!

220
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,623
- That's immaterial.
- Dr. Lightman, last warning. Overruled.

221
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,522
Didn't it come out eventually
that my boss...

222
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,171
A man... was in fact... gay?

223
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,998
Yeah. Yeah, it did. Yeah.

224
00:11:57,572 --> 00:12:00,010
I was way off the mark on that one.

225
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,130
But I mean, I was jealous.

226
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:05,152
I was young,
I was head over heels in love.

227
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:09,144
By day I'm a scientist.
But by night, I'm fallible.

228
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:10,729
I'm only human.

229
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:14,566
I'm not questioning your humanity.
And certainly not your fallibility.

230
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,283
- That's a relief.
- You are here because of your expertise

231
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,780
in psychology and lying.
I'm challenging that.

232
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,644
Your flagrant manipulation
of the jury notwithstanding.

233
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,519
OK. But when you say that

234
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,079
your client is innocent,
you don't believe that.

235
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:30,381
Again, you misjudge my thoughts
because I know my client is innocent.

236
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:32,378
Why don't you want to hear
the science then?

237
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,206
Your testimony is limited
to scientific context

238
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,401
not specific opinions
on who's lying.

239
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,926
You want to hear the whole truth?
That woman over there,

240
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,345
- Your client, the black widow...
- Control yourself!

241
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,986
When she says she doesn't know...

242
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:46,848
Dr. Lightman.
Control yourself.

243
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,558
She's lying, and that's a fact.

244
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,228
Control yourself or I will have
the judge control you!

245
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,063
Her? Do me a favor, look at her.

246
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,097
She's having a tough time
controlling herself.

247
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:59,086
Marshall, please remove this witness
before I hold him in contempt.

248
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,406
look at her. Bulging eyes,
the guilt all over her face.

249
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,213
- I think it's the booze.
- Get him out of here!

250
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,149
Hello, darling.

251
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:25,576
What?

252
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,829
I hope that was part of
a careful plan in there.

253
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,599
Careful's for lawyers
and accountants!

254
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:31,799
I think it's very interesting of her

255
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,028
when I called her a black widow,

256
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:36,508
- She got a little pout.
- Her feelings were hurt.

257
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,433
- Surprising?
- Shocking!

258
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,874
I'm heading back to the office
to prep more witnesses. You coming?

259
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:44,360
No, I gotta see a man about a dog.
I'll catch up with you.

260
00:13:44,485 --> 00:13:45,535
OK. Behave.

261
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:58,917
You're right.

262
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:03,012
You need a lawyer?
No, I'm only joking.

263
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:05,142
- What judge you got?
- Denton. Why?

264
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,596
Denton, he's a complete softy.
He's a pushover.

265
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,904
He's a bleeding heart
liberal, vegetarian.

266
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:12,184
The most you're looking at there
is a slap on the wrist.

267
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,202
No. No. I didn't do anything.
It was that guy.

268
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,481
He mugged my wife.

269
00:14:18,086 --> 00:14:18,975
Really?

270
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,185
I'm sorry about that.

271
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,532
It's just luck of the draw.

272
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:27,115
Keep your chin up.

273
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:37,217
<i>That was my wife!
That was my wife!</i>

274
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,418
<i>Come on! Let me go!</i>

275
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:45,008
Shouldn't my lawyer be here if
you talk to me?

276
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,094
- Three's a crowd, love.
- Excuse me?

277
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,669
Don't get me wrong.

278
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:50,927
She's a terrific lawyer.

279
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,857
She's really top-notch.
And I mean that.

280
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,021
Seems there's a lot of chemistry
there between you and your ex-wife.

281
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,190
There's a lot of chemistry
in chernobyl.

282
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:05,987
You know what's interesting.
We both have something in common.

283
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,689
- Oh yeah.
- We both married up.

284
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:14,878
You really miss him, do you?
Victor?

285
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,777
You're the expert.

286
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:19,334
When I say I loved
my husband, what do you see?

287
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:22,361
Well, you can love a man
and kill him.

288
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:25,233
Or have him killed.

289
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:29,890
Look me in the eye

290
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:32,973
and tell me you believe
I killed my husband.

291
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:43,502
Tell me about those 40 minutes

292
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:45,731
you can't remember.

293
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,138
Find whoever murdered Victor and
I'll tell you whatever you want.

294
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:50,803
I see. You got someone in mind then.

295
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:53,428
Victor gave me more
than I ever wanted.

296
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,915
We were partners in everything.
All the charities.

297
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,897
I converted to catholicism so I
could share that with him too.

298
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:01,626
Why would I end that?

299
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,930
What the hell is going on?!

300
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:07,716
- I'm tampering with your client.
- Is he always this relentless?

301
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,552
To the point of self-destruction.
Officer!

302
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,816
You wanted your father's
money, didn't you?!

303
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,802
You were desperate and you wanted his
money, so you framed your stepmother.

304
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:18,927
The hell I did!
That's crazy!

305
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,749
See, that's wrong.
The worst thing you can do

306
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,742
is match
your questioner's intensity.

307
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:26,367
Instead give a firm,
deliberate answer.

308
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,514
Here, watch.

309
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:34,245
<i>The reforms I'm proposing would not
apply to those who are here illegally.</i>

310
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,521
<i>You lie!</i>

311
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:39,838
It's not true.

312
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:42,320
The president clenches his jaw,

313
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:43,972
slight hints of anger,

314
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:47,422
then he modulates his voice
and folds his hands. OK?

315
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:50,068
Now, Mr. O'Sullivan,

316
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,303
- did you murder Victor Musso?
- Certainly not.

317
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,677
Good. Simple. Direct. Truthful.

318
00:16:56,923 --> 00:17:00,473
See, I know how to handle myself
under pressure, Dr. Foster.

319
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:03,192
I was Vic's right hand for 25 years.

320
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:05,971
Riding his coattails for 25 years.

321
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:09,194
I was CFO for
a "fortune 500" company.

322
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:14,199
One last tip.
Women require more eye contact

323
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:16,409
than men to feel a connection.

324
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:19,826
So, I want you both
to focus your attention

325
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,998
on the female jurors.

326
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,209
Got it?

327
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,673
Anything to put
that gold-digger away.

328
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,339
Where was that loyalty
when your father was alive?

329
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,633
She came onto me, OK?!

330
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,525
Since it was my client
you illegally tampered with,

331
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,654
judge Quinn has given me the authority
to keep you in here or release you.

332
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:48,983
Oh yeah? You bought her
a drink or 3 then?

333
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,653
Give me one good reason
I should let you out of here.

334
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,904
One good reason?

335
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,739
- Just one.
- Well...

336
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:56,818
How about

337
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:58,941
you need me?

338
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,916
You know, a room like this in our house
could have saved our marriage.

339
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:09,102
Goodbye, Cal.

340
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,329
Your client's innocent, by the way.

341
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:18,621
I found out while
I was tampering with her.

342
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:20,265
Think I'll take a nap.

343
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:26,396
Don't pretend
you don't need my help!

344
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,903
- Why do you do it?
- Do what?

345
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:32,026
Keep forcing us together like this.

346
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:33,778
Paging Dr. Kinsey.

347
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:37,090
Do you want to switch to my side?

348
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:40,452
What? And stop all this fun we're
having here? You must be joking.

349
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,152
The fact of the matter is,

350
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:45,030
your client's innocent
and the jury are about to convict her.

351
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,774
- No, they're not.
- Yeah, they are.

352
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:47,667
Please.

353
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,998
- Fair enough. You're the boss.
- Stop it.

354
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:52,673
A little role playing
never hurt anyone.

355
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:55,042
I should let you rot in here.

356
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,302
Can't argue with you there, darling.

357
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:04,684
Marshall, here's the authorization for
what I'm sure will be a huge mistake.

358
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:13,943
<i>Clara didn't care about me or my father.
She just wanted his money.</i>

359
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:16,819
Let's pretend the jury's watching.

360
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:18,241
OK?

361
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,951
Now, tell them exactly
how Clara seduced you.

362
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:26,343
It was a week after
she had interviewed my dad

363
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:28,868
about the clinics
he built in Africa.

364
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,052
She was at our ranch.

365
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,815
I didn't know that they
had already become involved.

366
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,633
She wanted a tour.
I was showing her the wine cellar.

367
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,627
And that's when it happened.

368
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,180
All right. That was good
eye contact and posture, Damien.

369
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,808
But remember, fold your hands
to avoid fidgeting.

370
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,204
Got it.

371
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,619
How many times did you have sex?

372
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,556
Maybe 6 or 7.

373
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:56,245
The maybe undercuts your
credibility with the jurors.

374
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:59,107
Especially with these 2.

375
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:02,422
All right.
Give them a specific number.

376
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:03,559
Seven.

377
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:06,449
But when she found out
that I didn't have money

378
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:10,125
and that it was all in a trust
until I was 40, she dumped me.

379
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:13,538
The next thing I know,
she's engaged to my father,

380
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:16,172
and he is changing his will.

381
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:19,008
Where was the last place
you and Clara had sex?

382
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,763
I don't know.
They all kind of run together.

383
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:27,597
Let's get some caffeine.
It always helps me focus.

384
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:36,484
So, tell me what happened
in the wine cellar.

385
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:40,931
I was showing her my dad's collection,
and she asked to see my belt buckle.

386
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:43,449
And you took it off or did she?

387
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,118
She did.

388
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:49,645
Help yourself.

389
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,281
All right,
you just watch the images.

390
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:55,602
And we'll monitor your reactions
on the outside.

391
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:59,091
Give me the finger.
That's charming isn't it?

392
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,634
Are you this hands-on
with all your clients?

393
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,637
I'm not afraid to get a little dirty
when necessary.

394
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:09,809
So you say you didn't kill your husband.
I believe you're innocent.

395
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,478
I can't say this feels
like a vote of confidence.

396
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,774
Well, you still don't remember
what happened that night,

397
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,763
So,

398
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:20,653
a few faces from the case
might jog your memory.

399
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:23,587
Have fun.

400
00:21:27,017 --> 00:21:28,981
How is this supposed
to help jog her memory?

401
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:30,538
It's not.
It's nonsense.

402
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,249
But since she's lying to us
about those 40 minutes,

403
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,251
we're coming at it
from another angle.

404
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:37,003
Flag that one.

405
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,298
Contempt when she looks at Damien.

406
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,508
Your stepson says
you're sleeping together

407
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,122
the same time you're bedding daddy...
that can bring contempt.

408
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,972
In my country, a new member
of the royal family. Flag that one.

409
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:51,284
Push in on her hand.

410
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:55,674
Who's that woman she's reacting to?

411
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,274
That's Tanya Wilson.
It's a close friend of Clara's.

412
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,069
She comes to court every day
to support her.

413
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,860
That hand closing like that...

414
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,580
is anger.

415
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,313
What happened in the 40 minutes
you left Victor?

416
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:13,122
- <i>What I don't remember.</i>
- <i>That's bullocks, Clara.</i>

417
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,267
- Who killed your husband?
- You know I don't.

418
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:16,550
That's enough.

419
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:19,087
Too right it is.
You're lying. I can't help you.

420
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:30,560
Uncooperative witness...
That's common.

421
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,852
Uncooperative client...
That's rare.

422
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,383
Crosby hired us as experts.

423
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:36,562
Can't you just tell her
you're sure she didn't do it?

424
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,054
It's a matter of pride
for Crosby at this point.

425
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:42,204
You know, what passes
for truth in a courtroom

426
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,612
isn't necessarily the whole truth.

427
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,989
I love you too.

428
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:46,953
Out.

429
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,245
Clara was trying to hide her
anger toward Tanya.

430
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,663
I need some background.

431
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,083
Right. And we saw
Clara's contempt for Damien.

432
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:59,319
What does she say about her
affair with him?

433
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,254
She's adamant it never happened.

434
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,992
Damien came onto her. She said no.
It's he said, she said.

435
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:06,839
When I was prepping him, I asked them
about their last sexual encounter,

436
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:08,803
he just stood there
holding a pot of coffee.

437
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:11,082
He couldn't fill his cup
while giving the details.

438
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,244
Manual tasks are harder to integrate
when you're faking a story.

439
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,269
Yeah, but I believed him
the first time around.

440
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,730
What if his story is
an obsessive fantasy?

441
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:21,414
If he played it out
in his head enough,

442
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,193
he could have said it happened
without showing any signs of deception.

443
00:23:24,614 --> 00:23:27,390
So, Clara rejects Damien
for his father,

444
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,634
- who's shadow he lives in.
- It could have driven him to murder.

445
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,577
We need to get Damien back in here.

446
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:35,496
Now, that's dangerous.

447
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,476
You think I need more prep work
before I testify?

448
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:42,672
There are a few more techniques
Dr. Lightman wants to go over.

449
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,447
Anything for my father.

450
00:23:58,797 --> 00:23:59,797
You slut.

451
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,268
That's pure science.
How was it?

452
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:08,279
All right, come on.

453
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:09,979
Damien, you lied!

454
00:24:10,104 --> 00:24:12,101
You were never involved
with Clara were you?

455
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:14,538
- She seduced me!
- You're pathetic, Damien.

456
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,913
- You're pathetic!
- How could you do this?

457
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,832
We wanted to see how angry it made you
to see her with somebody else.

458
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,459
You think I killed my father?

459
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,044
You've been lying.

460
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,378
She is a gold-digger!

461
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,339
- How can you say that?
- It was your plan!

462
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,966
- I loved your father!
- No, you used him!

463
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,438
Let's go!

464
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:36,599
Come on. Let it go.

465
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,105
Fair enough.

466
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:42,441
I expected a little bit
more than a slap

467
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,899
from the world's most
notorious murder suspect.

468
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,402
Yeah. I guess I've been
respectable for too long.

469
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:50,446
I think I can help you with that.

470
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,359
Doc, Damien Musso called
my office this morning.

471
00:24:58,484 --> 00:25:00,402
He said
you all but accused him of murder.

472
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,659
Clara didn't kill
her husband, right?

473
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:06,003
I see. You switched sides.

474
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:08,412
How can I compete with legs,
cleavage & associates.

475
00:25:08,537 --> 00:25:09,674
You can't.

476
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,092
You must be cleavage.

477
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,636
Legs here is twice
the lawyer you're ever gonna be.

478
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,873
You know that affair Damien
said he had with Clara?

479
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,268
He was lying. Call him to the stand.
It's perjury.

480
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:24,438
- We had a contract, doc.
- I render my services as an expert.

481
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:28,151
We prepped your witnesses for you.
We read your jury. Job done.

482
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,750
It's going to be a long time before
you get any business from my office.

483
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,864
I'm devastated.

484
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,032
Really?

485
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,354
- I'll see you in there, counselor.
- You bet!

486
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:40,928
- That's interesting.
- What?

487
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,038
He's not worried
at all about Damien.

488
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,470
He doesn't give a toss about me
coming over to the other side.

489
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:49,039
If anything,
he's more confident than usual.

490
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:50,899
He's up to something.

491
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:55,136
Why did you hire a private investigator
to look into Clara's past?

492
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,349
I'd been friends with Victor
since we were 10 years old

493
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,672
in catechism at St. Bernard's.

494
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:04,562
When I realized Victor was
getting serious about Clara,

495
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,857
I wanted to make sure her
intentions were sincere...

496
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:11,360
As a friend first
and as a business partner.

497
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:14,530
And did the investigator
find anything criminal?

498
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:18,326
She reinvented herself though.

499
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:21,120
New name. New hair color.
New resume.

500
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:23,581
Breaking with the past
isn't always easy.

501
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:26,209
To your knowledge,
was Victor happy in his marriage?

502
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:28,961
Yes. But he didn't have
all the facts.

503
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,964
Reviewing the estate yesterday,
I discovered something...

504
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,330
Objection. Any information
he has about the estate

505
00:26:34,455 --> 00:26:36,274
should have been brought
forth in deposition.

506
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:38,596
Are you certain that you made
the discovery yesterday?

507
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,766
- Yes. I'm certain.
- No, he's lying, your honor.

508
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:46,229
He's been sitting on it.
So has the DA.

509
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:51,192
That's absurd. Your honor,
I move to clear the whole gallery.

510
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:54,528
Muzzle your ex, Ms. Landau,
or I will.

511
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:58,078
Proceed with your finding.

512
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:00,310
When I looked
at Victor's sub-accounts,

513
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:04,439
I discovered monthly withdrawals
of roughly $90,000,

514
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:06,874
Spread across the last year
and a half.

515
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,627
Clara was stealing from him.

516
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,093
He's not lying.

517
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:22,098
Motion for recess, your honor.
I need time to research these claims.

518
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,536
You can recall the witness
when prosecution rests, Ms. Landau.

519
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,293
- You're leaving?
- That jury's 12 to nothing to convict.

520
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:32,483
You're screwed.

521
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:40,806
If Clara stole money from her husband,
why did we switch sides?

522
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,508
Lightman screwed up?

523
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,170
Foster always says, the closer
you are to someone emotionally,

524
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:47,125
the harder it is to get a true read.

525
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,479
- Yeah, but Clara is a stranger.
- Zoe isn't.

526
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:52,408
Anything she touches, Lightman is
going to bring baggage to it.

527
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,106
Speaking of baggage,

528
00:27:54,231 --> 00:27:57,174
you want to unload some of your own,
like that memory that Lightman saw?

529
00:27:57,896 --> 00:28:00,503
What? What kind of age difference
are we talking about here? 10 years?

530
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:02,013
We're not discussing this.

531
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,597
Did you violate state laws?

532
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,208
Decency laws?

533
00:28:07,926 --> 00:28:10,479
It was a totally legal
and healthy relationship.

534
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,660
That's exciting. Come on.
Give me something.

535
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:15,069
What are you hiding?
At least give me his name.

536
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:19,483
Denise Watson.

537
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,168
Tanya Wilson, as I live and breathe.

538
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,792
Clara's best mate.
Why's she so angry with you then?

539
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:34,587
- I didn't know that she was.
- Really?

540
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:37,423
- How long have you two been friends?
- Don't have to talk.

541
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,035
That's true.
That's true.

542
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,259
But I'll see to that while you explain
to a jury why you got so scared

543
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:45,973
when Leo testified that Clara
was stealing from her husband.

544
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:48,657
I was scared for Clara as a friend.

545
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:51,439
Were you two in it together?

546
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,056
Were your robbing the old man blind?

547
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:57,036
As I was going through a tough time.
Clara was helping me out.

548
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:00,106
See, there's that fear again.

549
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,357
I think you're hiding something.

550
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:06,452
I think you're here just to make sure
she keeps her mouth shut.

551
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:07,995
Ridiculous.

552
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,288
I smell blackmail.

553
00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:11,537
Of a sexual variety.
What is it?

554
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,793
Is it you and Clara?

555
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:15,765
You and Victor?

556
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,047
Wait. Three's a crowd, right?

557
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,594
You and Victor...

558
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,906
and Clara.

559
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:26,456
What you got on him?
You got photos? You got video?

560
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:29,725
- You got dirty knickers?
- I had nothing to do with his death.

561
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:32,144
My money's on video.

562
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,392
I think you got a sex tape. About...

563
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:38,067
90 grand a month's worth.

564
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,887
Clara met him through me.

565
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:45,022
Her life was supposed to be mine.

566
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:46,867
It's not like they were
going to miss it.

567
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:48,869
Thanks for that.

568
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:52,248
Now, if you want
to stay out of jail,

569
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:55,459
I'm gonna need that sex tape.

570
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:05,761
It was Vic's 60th birthday, and I wanted
to do something he'd never forget.

571
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,931
In every other way he was conservative.
But this was a fantasy of his.

572
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:10,780
So, Tanya and I got together.

573
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,355
We were friends at that point
or so I thought.

574
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,349
So, those 40 minutes
that you claim you can't remember...

575
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:18,865
All right...

576
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,610
That's when you nipped out
to pay off Tanya. Yeah?

577
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:26,330
It was meant to stop.

578
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,579
But when I got there,

579
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,227
she said that the payments...

580
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:33,998
- were going to keep going.
- You couldn't tell your husband?

581
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,124
Or your lawyer?

582
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,003
It would have confirmed
what people had been saying.

583
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,916
And his reputation meant
the world to him.

584
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:44,504
You're willing to go to jail
to preserve that reputation?

585
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,013
True love.

586
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,723
I know.
It's absolute insanity.

587
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:53,435
I'm innocent, Zoe.

588
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:58,397
And I thought maybe you could
somehow make the jury see that.

589
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,169
Speaking of the jury,
we've been reading them,

590
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:03,777
and they're 12 to nothing
to convict.

591
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:09,533
It's one thing to say you're innocent.
But you gotta show them who's guilty.

592
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,037
- We know we can rule out Damien.
- Who else has access to your house?

593
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,988
The only other person
with a key was Leo.

594
00:31:15,113 --> 00:31:17,414
- He just smeared you in court.
- I was stealing.

595
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:19,874
He stands to benefit financially
if you're convicted.

596
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,420
He's the executor of the estate.

597
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,381
There is no way. Vic and Leo were
more than business partners.

598
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,967
- They were like brothers.
- So was Brutus and Caesar.

599
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:31,096
Put me back on the stand again.

600
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:33,986
What?

601
00:31:49,513 --> 00:31:50,806
Just ask, Loker.

602
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:53,702
So, you sleep with women too?

603
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,415
You just went
to a whole new level of blunt.

604
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:01,676
Well, it has serious ramifications.

605
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:04,046
My competition
may have just doubled.

606
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:07,321
I was curious, OK?

607
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:10,169
Denise was funny

608
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:13,264
and interesting.
And I liked her smile.

609
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,012
- I didn't make a life choice.
- Right.

610
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:19,159
So, just to confirm.

611
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:21,063
Not bisexual then.

612
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:23,482
It was experimenting, Loker.

613
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,444
And you know,
why can girls do it and guys can't?

614
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,281
Where's the fantasy in that?

615
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:36,829
Anyways, who really cares
what people do in their bedrooms.

616
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:38,706
Everyone.

617
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,261
So...

618
00:32:46,402 --> 00:32:47,402
This...

619
00:32:47,937 --> 00:32:48,882
experiment.

620
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,127
What were your findings?

621
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,701
Scientifically speaking.

622
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:08,152
You hold yourself out as an arbiter
of people's honesty,

623
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,571
yet time and again
you've reversed yourself

624
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,561
Yeah, well, scientists, see,
they admit their mistakes.

625
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:19,053
Ex-wives,
that's an entirely different story.

626
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:23,208
The fact is your science
is completely unreliable. You're a

627
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,002
glorified fortuneteller. A hack.

628
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:28,021
All right, let's see
if the jury agrees, shall we?

629
00:33:28,146 --> 00:33:31,050
The foreman, he's high as a kite,
and he has been all along.

630
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:34,428
That one, she's getting off
on Clara's misery, she is.

631
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,388
And those 2,
they're having an affair.

632
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,183
They're doing the dirty back
at the hotel. Both of them married

633
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,193
to different people.
And that one has got a serious

634
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:43,979
- foot fetish.
- Dr. Lightman,

635
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,482
- for God's sake!
- Well, no. My point is

636
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,209
I can read anyone here.

637
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:50,569
Right. Not just the defendant

638
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,737
or the judge.

639
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:54,220
If you're hiding something,

640
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:56,116
I'll know it.

641
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:59,620
And yet you never turn that scrutiny
on yourself. Why is that?

642
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,410
That would terrify you, wouldn't it?

643
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:05,084
To be striped bare the way you strip
the people around you.

644
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:07,391
I'm not a killer, counselor.

645
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:09,659
But neither is Clara Musso.

646
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:11,849
- Move to strike, your honor.
- Sustained.

647
00:34:11,974 --> 00:34:15,037
The real killer has been hiding
in plain sight all along.

648
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,179
He's in this very courtroom
as we speak.

649
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,514
Objection! Speculation!

650
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,265
Dr. Lightman, this court has
indulged you more than enough.

651
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:23,936
Step down now, please.
Please. Please step down

652
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,604
before I have you arrested.

653
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,471
If you're gonna arrest somebody,

654
00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:29,400
You should arrest Leo O'Sullivan.

655
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:31,854
He killed his best friend.

656
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:35,531
- Quiet everyone!
- You bastard!

657
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,075
I didn't murder Vic.
I'd never!

658
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,703
That's the truth, see.
You didn't murder him.

659
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,496
But you did kill him, didn't you?

660
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:52,713
What does that mean.

661
00:34:52,994 --> 00:34:54,928
Leo killed Victor
but he didn't murder him?

662
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:58,068
When he said he didn't murder Victor,
there was no sign of deception, right?

663
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,518
But when I asked him
if he killed his friend,

664
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:02,182
he flashed regret.

665
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:06,038
- Look, if I recall Leo to the stand...
- We crack the case.

666
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:08,939
He's right on the edge.
He just needs one more shove.

667
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,065
- Spit it out then.
- Well, since you asked.

668
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,666
When is killing your friend
a good thing?

669
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,422
Please be seated.

670
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:34,131
I thought I kicked your ex-husband
out of my courtroom, counselor?

671
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:37,781
Dr. Lightman is essential
for my client's defense, your honor.

672
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,582
He's just here to observe.
He won't be a nuisance to the court.

673
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:41,918
Well, if he is,

674
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:45,039
he will be the guest of the county
for the next 30 days.

675
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:46,977
Are we clear, Dr. Lightman?

676
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:49,679
- As a bell, your honor.
- Proceed.

677
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,735
Mr. O'Sullivan, I wish to remind you
that you are still under oath.

678
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,655
I'd like to apologize
for the previous outburst.

679
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,120
It's clear to everyone \in this court
how close you were to Victor Musso.

680
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:09,071
You were his best friend,
his lifelong confidant. And you,

681
00:36:09,707 --> 00:36:12,419
would do anything to protect him.
And his reputation.

682
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,462
That's true.

683
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:16,234
I'd like to show the witness
some photos, if I may.

684
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:17,758
- Objection!
- No. You can't.

685
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,260
There were no pictures submitted
during discovery.

686
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,133
Easy love, jury's watching.

687
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:24,056
- Sidebar, your honor?
- Please.

688
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:30,229
You can't let them see those pictures.
Everything Vic work for would be ruined.

689
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,190
If you try and stop this,
I'll do those 30 days with bells on,

690
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,234
after I finish blurting it out
to the jury.

691
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,154
These could do irreparable harm
to the reputation of the deceased.

692
00:36:48,784 --> 00:36:50,858
I don't know how this is germane
to the case.

693
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:53,823
It speaks to the accusation that Clara
was stealing from her husband.

694
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:57,381
I don't want to besmirch a good
man if I don't have to. But I do

695
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,550
reserve the right to present these
in open court.

696
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,844
I take your point, counselor.

697
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:04,100
- Please.
- Thank you.

698
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,351
You want to see Clara Musso
locked up for murder.

699
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,617
She betrayed a man who loved her.

700
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,981
She was sleeping with his son
for God sakes.

701
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:16,692
Thanks to Dr. Lightman,
that's been exposed as a lie.

702
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,117
- She was stealing from him.
- Which you knew about.

703
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:23,817
- And yet you never said a word.
- He was completely under her spell.

704
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:26,869
- I was protecting him.
- Well, I submit to you

705
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,592
that Clara was doing the same.
Protecting him.

706
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,541
And the money you say my client
was stealing from him Was in fact

707
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,862
being put to a good and noble cause.

708
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,338
Am I being clear enough here,
Mr. O'Sullivan?

709
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:41,792
Perfectly, counselor.

710
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,680
You also knew
she didn't kill her husband.

711
00:37:47,171 --> 00:37:50,370
But you thought she deserved to go
to prison anyway, didn't you? After all,

712
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:52,311
you had built a company
and a reputation

713
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,659
side-by-side with Victor
for 25 years.

714
00:37:54,784 --> 00:37:58,057
And overnight, your best friend
became a different person.

715
00:37:58,452 --> 00:38:00,527
- Clara had displaced you.
- No!

716
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:03,071
When it mattered, Vic called me.

717
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,573
There we go. Watch this.

718
00:38:06,307 --> 00:38:09,119
- Hold on to your seat, love.
- Like when it came to his health?

719
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,666
That's fear.
But without shame.

720
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:15,792
He's proud of what he did.

721
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:19,338
You didn't murder him, Leo.

722
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,507
He asked you to end his life,
didn't he?

723
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,635
Objection!

724
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,428
Overruled.

725
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,336
How was Mr. Musso's health just prior
to his death? You're under oath.

726
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:33,814
He was...

727
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:39,691
- Secretly very sick.
- That's why he wanted you to help him

728
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,777
end his life, to assist his suicide.
That right?

729
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,254
- Objection, your honor!
- The court is very interested

730
00:38:44,379 --> 00:38:46,070
in Mr. O'Sullivan's answer.

731
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,742
He had a degenerative brain disease.

732
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,175
Doctors gave him a month or two.

733
00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:54,928
You bought the cyanide

734
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,346
and the syringe.
He called you to his home.

735
00:38:57,471 --> 00:38:59,544
And you gave him that injection,
didn't you?

736
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,381
- Your honor!
- Take your seat.

737
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:06,321
Victor was devout.

738
00:39:06,651 --> 00:39:08,022
I mean, to him

739
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:10,354
suicide was a mortal sin.

740
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:14,977
I couldn't say no to my friend.

741
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,058
Which is why you never told him
that Clara was stealing.

742
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:20,156
Because he was dying.

743
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:22,567
Why break his heart on top
of everything else?

744
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:25,946
Do you have proof
it wasn't a murder?

745
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:34,454
- He left a video explaining.
- Now that

746
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:35,922
right there.

747
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,208
That is shame.

748
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:42,757
I think his widow
has a right to see that.

749
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,312
But I didn't imagine that

750
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:50,095
I'd meet a woman

751
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,906
who would understand me
so completely.

752
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:55,449
Our marriage was a gift, Clara.

753
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,988
Happiest 10 years of my life.

754
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:01,895
I wouldn't let anything
tarnish that.

755
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,490
Zoe says that Leo is

756
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:06,611
pleading guilty
to obstruction of justice

757
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,681
and manslaughter.
And they're working out a deal.

758
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:11,865
That's good then.

759
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:15,698
Thank you for everything.

760
00:40:17,768 --> 00:40:19,757
I should have trusted you sooner.

761
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,558
I could say the same thing.

762
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:29,275
I've got a meeting waiting.

763
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:39,674
She's a beautiful woman.

764
00:40:41,662 --> 00:40:42,773
She's my Leo.

765
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:46,536
What about Zoe?

766
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:49,706
To say you stopped loving someone
you once loved

767
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:52,022
more than anything else
in the world, I mean

768
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:54,560
that would be a lie.
But you move on.

769
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:56,472
Don't you?

770
00:40:57,531 --> 00:40:58,914
You have to move on.

771
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:04,408
She's my daughter's mum.

772
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:09,371
Sometimes sparring partner.

773
00:41:10,447 --> 00:41:12,529
Any other women populating
your life?

774
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:16,515
None you need to worry about.

775
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,509
I'm taking over Victor's businesses
and charities.

776
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:26,667
People are going to come after me.

777
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:29,798
They think I'm weak.
I need someone I can trust.

778
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,973
You got my number.

779
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,371
So, to speak.

780
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,991
My point is, right,

781
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:46,086
that the reason that we won
was 'cause the whole truth came out.

782
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:49,882
Which no, cause it doesn't
normally happen in a courtroom.

783
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:52,887
Why'd you take this case?

784
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:55,595
I thought it'd be a bit of fun.

785
00:41:56,232 --> 00:41:57,806
That's not it.
Not really.

786
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:01,749
It's your first time out there.

787
00:42:02,404 --> 00:42:04,053
It's a big national case.

788
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:06,523
You were protecting me?

789
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:09,314
That's so sweet.

790
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:11,736
And paternalistic and patronizing.

791
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:14,132
Yeah. You got a point there.

792
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:15,816
No, but look. If you get

793
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,368
a guilty woman off,
you're a punch line.

794
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,991
If you convict an innocent man,
you're a joke.

795
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,373
You've worked far too hard

796
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,611
to get where you are.

797
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:28,400
You deserve a bit of respect.

798
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:30,755
Not infamy.

799
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,687
Still waiting for you
to get what you deserve.

800
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,953
Well, I'm 2 steps

801
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:39,764
ahead of the hangman.

802
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,628
Emily's sleeping at a friend's.

803
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:48,815
What? The whole night?

804
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,540
- All right.
- I'll get the check.
