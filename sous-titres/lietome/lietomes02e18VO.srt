1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,850
Get up! Up! You got this!

2
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,469
Come on! Up, Orlando!

3
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,874
You got it. Move it around.

4
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,443
Go for the midsection!

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,321
All right.

6
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,287
Throw him!

7
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,975
Roll out of this.

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,962
Quit tippin' your punches out there.

9
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:49,159
He's leading with his egg, love.

10
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:51,509
Yeah, thanks. We got this.
Take a seat, Lightman.

11
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:56,743
Yeah, but,
trouble is his egg's empty.

12
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:58,399
He's dead from the neck up.

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,934
- No...
- He's going down.

14
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:07,245
Better help your friend, Simone.

15
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:22,025
Great win tonight,
but the celebration's over.

16
00:01:22,977 --> 00:01:24,839
I put people to sleep,

17
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:28,711
and tomorrow fight,
they call me Sandman.

18
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:30,075
That's original.

19
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:32,980
You fightin' tomorrow?
You got your next date, then?

20
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:34,844
<i>Si.</i> I need the money.

21
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:37,267
Come on. I'll drive.

22
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:38,994
No. You my father now?

23
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,725
- Give me the keys.
- I'll do it.

24
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,537
- I'm gonna drive.
- You ain't drivin'.

25
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,729
- Why you gotta push me?
- Give me the keys.

26
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,105
- Gimme.
- I got it.

27
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,266
I got it.
Why do you fight...

28
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:52,111
You scratched me!
Crikey! That hurts.

29
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:55,740
You fight like a girl, you do.

30
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:57,742
Everything cool down there?

31
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,578
No, we're fine.
It's all fine.

32
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,703
God.

33
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:08,658
I'll give you a lift.

34
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,005
I'm taking the bus.

35
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,698
Suit yourself.

36
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:15,847
<i>Papi!</i>

37
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,424
<i>Estupido!</i>

38
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,420
Open the door.

39
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:44,102
I can do it.

40
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:45,658
Come on.

41
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,919
Come on.

42
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,090
What do you...

00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:38,050
You should just quit your job,

48
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,014
let me take care of you.

49
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,905
You wouldn't respect me.

50
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:48,102
Besides, what would your friends
and family think?

51
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,149
You haven't told anyone about us,
have you?

52
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:11,073
You comin'?

53
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,338
Dave, your phone.

54
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:09,099
Bernerd bloody Dillon.

55
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:12,686
I suppose he was always gonna crawl out
from under his rock, right?

56
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:15,723
Assistant special Agent
in charge Bernard Dillon.

57
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:17,974
He's Reynolds' new nanny then?

58
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:20,694
And all things Lightman group.
In this country, we say, "Bernard".

59
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,525
You might wanna get that right.

60
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,636
Bernerd!

61
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:28,953
- Dr. Lightman.
- We need your help with a murder case.

62
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:30,663
Who do you want me to kill?

63
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,099
Very funny.

64
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:34,833
The kid's name is Raul Campos.
He's 20, from Peru.

65
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,920
He was found last night,
three gunshot wounds to the chest.

66
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:41,674
We took the case over
when it was clear

67
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,094
that the victim was participating
in illegal underground fighting.

68
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,846
His fight last night
was caught on a camera phone.

69
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,834
A chip with the video footage
was dropped off

70
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,788
to one of our field offices
anonymously.

71
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:53,324
Torres is looking at it now.

72
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,026
We suspected
businessman Ron Marshall

73
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:58,023
to be bankrolling these fights.

74
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,111
These underground fights are savage,
illegal gambling orgies

75
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,821
populated by animals.

76
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,115
Marshall's already slipped
through our fingers once.

77
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,866
Your fingers?

78
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,703
No, I mean, makes it personal...

79
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:13,455
to you, bernerd.

80
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:16,166
What happened between us
is old business.

81
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,170
I'm a professional with a job to do.

82
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,338
I've moved on.

83
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,173
Peachy.

84
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,867
We're gonna bring suspects
from the fight last night here.

85
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:30,360
We don't have time
for by-the-book FBI interrogations.

86
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:33,267
If Marshall even gets wind
of what's going on, he's out of here.

87
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,935
A witness saw the...

88
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,564
the victim Campos in a heated exchange
outside a bar with an older male...

89
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:42,526
forties, caucasian, 160 pounds,

90
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,652
about 5'8".

91
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:46,462
You keep me in the loop, then.

92
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:50,923
I've moved on, too, Bernard.

93
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,661
Right.

94
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:00,406
Follow me.

95
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:11,611
- How'd you find me?
- Marshall got somebody in DMV.

96
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,808
He also got Orlando,
thinks he's the one that killed Raul

97
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,707
because he lost the fight.

98
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:18,520
Look, Orlando's not a killer.

99
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,522
I need you to prove that.

100
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,067
You're certain he's innocent,
are you?

101
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,444
We were shootin' pool
at Connor's when Raul was killed.

102
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:30,055
Look, Simone, I know
I'm only a scientist, right,

103
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,920
but don't insult
my intelligence, all right?

104
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:34,933
I'm sorry. I just...

105
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:37,575
Orlando's innocent.

106
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,208
I swear.

107
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:45,047
Please, man.
Marshall's gonna kill him.

108
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:46,929
He's like a brother to me.

109
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:49,728
You tell Marshall that the FBI
are all over him

110
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:51,016
on this one, all right?

111
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:53,388
The last thing he needs
is another corpse on his hands.

112
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:55,258
That's it?

113
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,158
Best I can do. Good luck.
See yourself out.

114
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:00,672
It's the morgue.

115
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,150
Skin cells were found
under Raul's fingernails.

116
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,733
They're running DNA now.

117
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:08,990
Excuse us?

118
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,648
One minute.
I'll be right back.

119
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:17,198
So what's up?

120
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,910
The DNA under the dead
man's fingernails.

121
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,503
Don't tell me that's from Campos.

122
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:28,055
I was with him
the night he was murdered.

123
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,175
White male,

124
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,843
forties, lean, devilish good looks.

125
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,139
Ring a bell?

126
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:35,931
So you were at the fight?

127
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,957
We need to lose
the DNA results, Ben.

128
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:46,012
Excuse me? We?

129
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:48,867
At the very least,
we need to mismanage 'em.

130
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:51,947
So you think that I'm gonna interfere
with a federal investigation?

131
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,240
Not gonna happen.

132
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,077
- If you're innocent, just come clean.
- Well, I would,

133
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,234
wouldn't I, but that tosser Dillon,

134
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,581
he's got it in for me.

135
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,088
If he finds out
that I'm prime suspect,

136
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,045
he's gonna push for an arrest,

137
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,756
and I'm gonna lose custody of Emily.

138
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:14,233
I need a bit more time.

139
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:50,047
Any progress on that footage?

140
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,219
The clarity's terrible, so I'm trying
to enhance it, see if I can...

141
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,555
if I can get a better read
on the crowd...

142
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,099
see if anybody's showing
any hostility towards Raul.

143
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,434
Mind if I sit in?

144
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,522
It usually takes a couple hours,
so...

145
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,156
I'm gonna stick around for it,

146
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:11,693
let me know when it's done.

147
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:13,278
Will do.

148
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,241
Want me to take over?

149
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,316
Really?
No argument or...

150
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:27,582
Come on, Lightman.
Pick up.

151
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,692
Did you see where Lightman went?

152
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,130
He went that way.

153
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,170
All you gotta do
is look after your fighter!

154
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:38,470
That's what I'm tryin' to do!
That's easy!

155
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:42,327
Look, I'm tryin' to look after him!
Just do your job!

156
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,943
Am I interrupting something?

157
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,605
What about "do not disturb"
don't you understand?

158
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,771
You tell him about me?

159
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:52,985
I thought you said
you weren't interested.

160
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:58,505
Simone tells me that you read faces,

161
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,198
some sort of scientist.

162
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:02,286
That's why you come
to all my fights?

163
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:03,978
All right, Raul the upstart,

164
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:07,150
he gives Orlando
a kicking in the ring,

165
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:09,742
and Orlando does him in.
Is that it?

166
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,795
You haven't read his face yet.

167
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,547
You'd never ask.
Where is he?

168
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:16,091
That's not a good sign, your eyes.

169
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,510
You're the only judge and jury
he's ever gonna see?

170
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:21,179
- Get him out of here.
- Keep your eyes stiff.

171
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:23,515
I might not be able to control myself.
He's in there?

172
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:24,910
Business is business.

173
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:27,011
Wouldn't it be better business
if you found out

174
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:29,688
if Orlando was the real killer
before you did him in?

175
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:33,567
Shall we?

176
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,165
Shut up.

177
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
So,

178
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:54,680
anything I say, you're gonna
get the truth out of him, is it?

179
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,517
I don't need you to tell me
how to do my business.

180
00:11:57,642 --> 00:11:58,642
Got it?

181
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,183
Now look at me, all right?

182
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:09,603
Now, Simone says that you were shooting
pool there last night. Is that right?

183
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,647
I was at my girl's house, Lucia,

184
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,082
all night long.

185
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,652
She made anticuchos.

186
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,989
I'm sold.

187
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,383
Scientifically speaking, that is.

188
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,828
Explain the science to me.

189
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:29,081
What?

190
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,793
You don't think
I'd be able to follow?

191
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:35,828
Right. Look at him, all right?

192
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,620
He's not scared of you.

193
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,185
All right?
That's contempt, that is.

194
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:43,345
He thinks you're just another pansy.

195
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,355
You can't fight like a man.

196
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:50,117
There's nothing more that he'd like
to do than tell you that he killed Raul,

197
00:12:50,242 --> 00:12:52,500
if only to look you in the eye

198
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,523
and show you what a real man is.

199
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,732
Do you follow?

200
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:57,347
Boss.

201
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,016
What?

202
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:01,143
Boss, we got a situation out here.

203
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:02,977
Boss, it's serious!

204
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:05,784
I didn't kill Raul.

205
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,502
Don't get up.

206
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,221
Found her wandering in here.

207
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,132
- Says she knows you.
- Who, me?

208
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,551
That true?

209
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:26,555
I never seen her before in my life.

210
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:32,877
My name's Sabrina.

211
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:36,045
I heard
you were looking for fighters.

212
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,028
Who told you that?

213
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,865
We might have met her.

214
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:49,418
At that karaoke place in that dump.
What was it called?

215
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:50,912
- Hyattsville.
- There it is.

216
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,759
Yeah. Yeah, right.

217
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:56,063
Damn girl, you clean up good.
I barely recognized you.

218
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,317
You gotta see
the hand speed on this one.

219
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,130
Ridiculous, for real.

220
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,175
I don't meet fighters here.

221
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,803
You never came here, and you never
come here again. You got me?

222
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:09,373
Go.

223
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,562
Now what about Orlando?

224
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,436
Orlando stays with me.

225
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:24,059
Are you out of your tiny mind?

226
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,305
Not that tiny.

227
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,441
I just cut you
out of an incriminating video.

228
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,862
Someone filmed you on their cell phone
at the fight last night,

229
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:33,308
so I thought I'd come over here
and give you a heads-up.

230
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:36,451
- You could have called me.
- I tried, like, about 10 times.

231
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,151
Now the FBI's saying they're gonna
post a reward for any more footage,

232
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:40,754
so I don't know what you're up to,

233
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,080
but you don't have much time
before they find you.

234
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:44,968
Just let them find me, then.

235
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,856
You don't really mean that.

236
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:50,121
Look, I go to those fights
just to look at the faces.

237
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:52,457
Right. And you read "playboy"
just for the articles.

238
00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:53,607
Don't be daft.

239
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:57,384
Look at you.

240
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:00,315
You're all wired up
after your Sabrina act.

241
00:15:00,637 --> 00:15:02,108
Takes one to know one.

242
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,278
You're off this, Torres.
I mean that, right?

243
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:06,944
Did they come out yet?

244
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:10,030
Two of Marshall's men just left,
but he's still in there with Orlando,

245
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:12,118
who's a dead man
for something he didn't do.

246
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,748
No, he's not innocent in this.
He's up to his ears.

247
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:16,915
I'll see you
back at the office, right?

248
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,960
Pleasure's all mine, by the way.
No need to thank me.

249
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:22,850
You're off this. I mean it.
I mean it, Torres.

250
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,782
<i>Chesapeake boat charters.</i>

251
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:34,984
Receptionist stepped away.
No one saw me come in, so...

252
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,227
your secret is safe.

253
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,633
- What's the occasion?
- I have to cancel tonight.

254
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,766
Some potential foster parents
are coming to the youth center,

255
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:48,196
and I have to interview 'em.

256
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:50,264
I brought this...

257
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,561
to buy your forgiveness.

258
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,787
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:59,271
I'll make it up to you.

260
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:01,357
I promise.

261
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:19,993
<i>Forensics.</i>

262
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:23,248
- This is Agent Carl Washington.
- <i>How can I help you?</i>

263
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:27,347
I need you to pull that rush order
off of DNA sample 2699b.

264
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,723
- <i>Campos, right?</i>
- That's right. The Raul Campos case.

265
00:16:30,848 --> 00:16:32,277
<i>You need this asap?</i>

266
00:16:32,402 --> 00:16:34,733
We're checking right now to see
if the sample was contaminated.

267
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,911
- <i>I'm all over it.</i>
- All right. Thank you.

268
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,138
What are you doing here?

269
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:43,967
Was just looking for Lightman.

270
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:45,551
Yeah, you and me both.

271
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,964
We found the next of kin.

272
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:50,904
Raul was wiring money
to an aunt in Peru.

273
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,860
She said his brother's here
looking for him.

274
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:55,358
- Foster's waiting for you.
- I'll be right there, sir.

275
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,453
My brother left a year ago

276
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:08,085
after a fight with my father.

277
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,655
Nobody knows where he went.

278
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,123
<i>We all miss him.</i>

279
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,861
<i>So what did he
and your father fight about?</i>

280
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:22,059
I can't really remember.

281
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:26,208
I think you do.

282
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:28,542
Why don't you tell us?

283
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,008
He wanted to be a rich man.

284
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:34,773
That's why he came here.

285
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,101
My father was angry about that.
He called it irresponsible.

286
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,894
It bothered you, too.

287
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:45,335
It was selfish.

288
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,173
He wanted to walk away
from his obligations,

289
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:50,927
from his family.

290
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:53,822
I should have never
have encouraged him.

291
00:17:56,123 --> 00:17:57,364
How are you feeling?

292
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,084
Like my soul's been ripped away.

293
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,173
Just Marshall and the main guy.

294
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:14,467
You got a light?

295
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,757
- You clear the mess out of the office?
- We're good.

296
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,270
- You smell that?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

297
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,395
Fire!

298
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:33,810
Take that!

299
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:35,113
Put it out!

300
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,824
Come on!

301
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:41,645
You gotta be...
If that don't put it out, bring...

302
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,650
Right.
Get a move on.

303
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,410
Come on.
Get a move on.

304
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:57,216
Come on, come on.

305
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:58,341
All right?

306
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:00,567
Get him out of here.

307
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:08,605
Can I get three club sodas,
please, darling.

308
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:12,336
All right, Orlando,

309
00:19:13,992 --> 00:19:16,141
the reason I saved your ass...

310
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,241
All right, was so I could
ask you this question.

311
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,659
- Why'd you kill Raul?
- I didn't kill nobody.

312
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:29,000
Look at me when you say that.
Come on. I dare you. Look at me.

313
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,400
You see, save your breath.

314
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,876
'Cause your eyes just did
the talking for you.

315
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,264
I just accused you of murder...

316
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,886
You're worried
about what she's thinking.

317
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,603
Why is that? You think she killed Raul?
Is that it?

318
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:45,350
Yo, get real.
Why would I off another fighter?

319
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:52,617
You know, I think
she's got your nuggets...

320
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:55,306
in a vise, Orlando.

321
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,221
- You wanna talk to me about that?
- I just didn't...

322
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:02,846
Thank you, love.

323
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:04,927
I just didn't wanna let
her down, all right?

324
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,623
After all you done for me,
I just don't wanna disappoint you.

325
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,678
You know, I don't think
you're dead from the neck up.

326
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:16,922
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Did you throw the fight?

327
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,717
<i>Estas loco. Asabes?
Esta loco que estas hablando.</i>

328
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:21,975
'Cause I don't think
that was your plan going in,

329
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,888
but something made you go down.
What was it?

330
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,391
- You're crazy.
- Maybe we should get out of here.

331
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,434
- That's a good idea.
- Wait. Look.

332
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,895
I'm the only thing
between you and the feds,

333
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,313
let alone immigration.

334
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,982
All right, hang on.
Scooch up, gorgeous.

335
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:46,344
All right, fine.

336
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:49,956
Me and Raul, we were close.

337
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,201
We're from the same part of Peru.
<i>Asabes?</i>

338
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,984
You always tell me
hate your fighters, right?

339
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,880
- I didn't hate Raul.
- And look where it got you.

340
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:03,928
You don't understand.
I needed to help him, all right?

341
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,514
Yeah, something was
making him run hot.

342
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,792
I'm not just talking
about when he was drunk

343
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,727
and he was bragging
about beating you.

344
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,995
What was it?

345
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:18,568
He said it was the shining path,
the senderistas de Peru, all right?

346
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:20,945
They knew he was here,
and they were coming for him.

347
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:25,825
He said it was gonna be his last fight
before he left town. That's all I know.

348
00:21:27,914 --> 00:21:31,253
So you decided
you were gonna help him, right?

349
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:36,669
You take the count.
You gift him the cash. Is that it?

350
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:42,895
Good.

351
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:46,866
We're digging into Raul's whereabouts,
getting close to finding out

352
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:48,191
Just a second.

353
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:50,049
Asac Dillon.

354
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,839
What do you mean
our DNA request was pulled?

355
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:54,964
By who?

356
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:57,115
Put it back on.

357
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,776
Yeah.

358
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:06,613
For some reason, Agent Carl Washington
pulled our DNA sample off the rush list.

359
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:10,620
I had to put it back on the fast track,
but we may have a problem.

360
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:15,875
I'm gonna look into it.
You guys stay on your toes.

361
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Yes, sir.

362
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:23,796
<i>Come on! You got this!
Give it to him, baby!</i>

363
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:29,609
Hey, there's something weird
with this FBI footage.

364
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:32,139
- What?
- It jumped like it was edited.

365
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:33,434
It should be...

366
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:36,229
21 minutes, 43 seconds.

367
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,565
But on screen, it's 21 minutes,
36 seconds. We lost 7 seconds.

368
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,902
It's probably on the hard drive.
I'll find it.

369
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:46,429
I forgot. Lightman called.
He said he wanted you...

370
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:50,004
to get ready to present
your research on lowland gorillas.

371
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:52,150
- When?
- This afternoon.

372
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,124
I have at least 2
days more work on that.

373
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:58,042
Well, better get on it.

374
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,880
- What about this case?
- I'll cover it.

375
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,398
Go do your thing.

376
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:18,381
You've seen Lightman? I've got a person
of interest I can't hold too long.

377
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:21,455
I think he's at lunch, but if you...
I can start the questioning,

378
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,056
- stall till he comes back.
- OK.

379
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,827
These were taken

380
00:23:44,952 --> 00:23:48,652
from video footage of the illegal fight
you set up last night,

381
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:53,306
and it turns out it was at a warehouse
owned by a relative of yours.

382
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,552
I don't know nothing about a fight.

383
00:24:00,097 --> 00:24:03,357
Your uncle sold copper out of
that warehouse for 26 years.

384
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:06,380
- What's that got to do with me?
- We know about everything.

385
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:09,855
We put a pin in every location
where you funded a fight.

386
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,645
I never funded anything.

387
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:19,222
You know...

388
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:22,218
You're a dead ringer

389
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:24,608
for this girl I know.

390
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,594
I guess we all have a twin.

391
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:29,618
Yeah.

392
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:33,375
Apparently mine is
a very dangerous man.

393
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:40,665
Can we have a word?

394
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:53,423
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

395
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:56,702
- Marshall's lying.
- No... no, he's not.

396
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,497
Are you afraid of him?

397
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,541
No.

398
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:05,792
Damn it.

399
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:08,072
Where's Lightman?

400
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:12,858
No offense, but with a chess player
like Marshall, I need a pro.

401
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:15,003
He's not gonna read
anything different.

402
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:17,181
If you want me to try again, I will.

403
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,318
Fine.

404
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,894
Let's go.

405
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:43,450
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:49,422
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I was checkin' in, you know.

407
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:53,341
Why don't you just
come right out with it?

408
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:54,844
I didn't wanna...

409
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,693
- Intrude.
- Yeah. That's it. No!

410
00:25:56,818 --> 00:26:00,057
- Because that is not like you at all.
- Yes.

411
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:05,282
I'm seeing someone.
There. You happy now?

412
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:07,589
So you've got my back,

413
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,440
knowing my luck with men as you do.

414
00:26:10,565 --> 00:26:12,737
Is that what you wanted
to check in about?

415
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:13,821
No.

416
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:20,453
- Mostly yes. All right.
- Great. Thank you.

417
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:23,062
No, really, thank you.
I mean that.

418
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:25,944
But now can you try

419
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,730
and do your best

420
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:31,464
not to stick your nose
into my business?

421
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:33,432
Yeah. I can do that.

422
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:39,472
Turns out our witness
who saw the prime suspect

423
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,423
has a history of drug abuse,
putting his credibility in question.

424
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,062
- I need you to talk to him.
- I'll be right there.

425
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:53,277
- I need you to take this one.
- OK.

426
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:05,709
- Thought I gave 'em my description.
- You did.

427
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,488
After taking a few hits of meth,
it seems.

428
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:11,884
Were you strung out last night
when you saw Raul?

429
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:15,633
No, I swear.
I didn't have any money.

430
00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:23,613
You've had a couple of run-ins
with the law for drug possession.

431
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:28,312
Did you think giving an eyewitness
account would earn you some goodwill?

432
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,730
No.

433
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:32,657
Higher voice pitch.
That was a yes.

434
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:36,279
Did you really see a guy with Raul or,
was it made up to earn brownie points?

435
00:27:36,718 --> 00:27:38,518
I'm tellin' you I saw him.

436
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:42,174
Kinda looked like that guy.

437
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:47,616
The suspect looked like this guy?

438
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,166
Yeah.

439
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:52,726
You heard of the shining path?

440
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:56,255
What, the senderistas?
They're a guerilla group out of Peru.

441
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,770
Yeah. They make the vikings
look like little boys

442
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:00,745
looking for a good wrestle.

443
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,930
Raul was scared of them.

444
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,599
He thought they were
after him for some reason.

445
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,794
What are you doing?
What does this kid mean to you?

446
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,044
He was a good boy. He was a little
misguided perhaps, but... Yeah.

447
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:13,649
Kind of like you at one point?

448
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:17,028
- What, you my shrink now?
- No, I'm just saying.

449
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,446
You put your nuts on the boot end
of a criminal enterprise,

450
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:21,282
and I'm trying to understand why.

451
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:23,534
I have my reasons.

452
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,912
Well, dollars to doughnuts, Raul was
killed by somebody in the fight world,

453
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:28,606
- maybe even Marshall.
- No.

454
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:31,830
Raul was the ATM! Why'd you pull
the trigger on a good payday?

455
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:33,599
Answer could be on the tape.

456
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:37,124
By the way, Dillon put your DNA test
back on rush status.

457
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:39,425
The results should be
here in a few hours.

458
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:41,385
- Do I look worried?
- That's him.

459
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:43,733
That's him. That's the guy.

460
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:47,258
That's who was fighting
with the kid.

461
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:52,772
I think you've made
a terrible mistake, mate.

462
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:55,476
- I saw you with him.
- You saw me?

463
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,818
- Yeah.
- You absolutely positive?

464
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:59,320
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

465
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:01,801
You saw this face in the dark

466
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:04,402
with that astigmatism, did you?

467
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:06,827
- Who are you?
- This is Dr. Cal Lightman.

468
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,246
- He runs this place.
- Also live in this place.

469
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:12,249
So you're saying
you were here last night?

470
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:14,251
Oh, yeah.
I was with him.

471
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,088
Yeah.

472
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,258
- Come on. Let's go.
- Maybe it wasn't him.

473
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:32,858
Now, did you really
see an astigmatism?

474
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:33,983
No.

475
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:36,065
You're learning!

476
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,651
OK, so I saw something here.

477
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:47,906
Right there.
Raul flashed fear.

478
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:49,848
Yeah. He's...

479
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,542
Looking at something
to his left, right?

480
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,418
Yeah.
That would be you.

481
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:59,068
Park your mouth, Torres.
Put your brain in gear.

482
00:29:59,193 --> 00:30:02,693
let's look at the other people there,
preferably behind me.

483
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:18,232
Freeze it there.

484
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,965
Push in. Push in.
Push, push, push!

485
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,831
Right about now, all right,
the fight is getting really,

486
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:37,821
really good, and the crowd
is going bonkers!

487
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:40,087
All except for this guy.

488
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,258
His body language
is completely relaxed.

489
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:50,097
He's not there for a fight.

490
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:53,272
So how did your girlfriend
track this down?

491
00:30:53,397 --> 00:30:56,575
She called the charter
company, and... Thank you.

492
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,972
And pretended to be
her fiancé's assistant.

493
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,865
If I had to put money on it,
the guy charters a boat out

494
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,864
of Baltimore for 5 hours,
he's probably a drug smuggler.

495
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:14,622
So how long has your girlfriend
known her fiancé?

496
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:17,917
A few months.

497
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,252
She should be careful.

498
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:24,924
I don't know what I'm gonna tell her.
She's in love with him.

499
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,178
Look, you know,

500
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:31,940
if your girlfriend
can get that passport

501
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:34,183
and maybe his cell phone,
we can look into it.

502
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:45,092
- Sir, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Give us a minute.

503
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,097
- Have a seat.
- All right.

504
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:54,995
What's goin' on?

505
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,065
You impersonated Agent Washington

506
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,334
to delay the prime
suspect's DNA report.

507
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:03,014
Who are you covering for?

508
00:32:06,703 --> 00:32:08,175
I've got something for you.

509
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:10,094
Right there. This...

510
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:13,576
is a picture, from the fight.

511
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:23,315
Well, I'm in it.

512
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,904
You were at an illegal fight
just to study faces? Correct.

513
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:30,923
For you, no extra charge.

514
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,825
Did you know Raul Campos?

515
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,139
Not personally.

516
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:37,413
No, but I seen him fight.

517
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:40,799
Your interest in which
was purely professional.

518
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:41,924
100%.

519
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:45,796
90 percent. OK...

520
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,858
80, actually, percent.

521
00:32:50,598 --> 00:32:54,602
- Why didn't you tell me this earlier?
- Well, I... I misjudged you...

522
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:56,599
Bernard. I did.

523
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,384
I... because of the,
you know, history

524
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:01,952
between you and I, I...

525
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,045
you once wrote a report on me
based on a single interview session

526
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,093
which affected my
promotion schedule,

527
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:11,396
knocked me back easily 2 years.

528
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:15,619
No, I did do that. Yep. Which is why
I thought you were gonna come in here

529
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:19,538
and press charges and
strip me of my FBI contract.

530
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,334
And what about you?

531
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,837
He doesn't give a toss

532
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,255
about politics.
He's all about getting the job done.

533
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,341
"Big picture" Ben,
we call him around here.

534
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:35,197
Sir, Lightman just needed more time
to

535
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,056
canvass his fight contacts.

536
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:40,305
Right.

537
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,895
Now...
This...

538
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:47,449
Is the man you want.

539
00:33:48,282 --> 00:33:49,282
All right?

540
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:53,197
Now, Reynolds here already has my people
working on getting,

541
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,033
better resolution
on the license plate, so...

542
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:58,494
He's all over it.

543
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,079
Ah, you're a sight for sore eyes.

544
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,016
I thought you were working late.

545
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah. The foster parents canceled.
What are you doin' here?

546
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:30,188
I was just... I was
looking for an earring... that I lost.

547
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:34,863
I thought maybe you
were looking for this.

548
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,494
It wasn't where I left it.

549
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:45,461
Who's Marco Gianelli?

550
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:50,282
This passport is for work.

551
00:34:51,064 --> 00:34:52,506
That's all I can say.

552
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:55,175
It's for the youth center?

553
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,736
Yes and no.

554
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,931
Just tell me the truth.

555
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:12,131
I have to go.

556
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:16,238
I work for the DEA.

557
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:22,461
I'm an undercover agent. I've been
at Covington for the last 6 months

558
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,197
monitoring 2 ms-13 gangbangers

559
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,765
that we believe are part of a
new drug cartel in Mexico.

560
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,870
- Are you a real psychologist?
- Yes.

561
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:39,335
Look, I've withheld information,
but nothing that I've told you is false,

562
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:42,785
except meeting
of the foster parents.

563
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,395
Your real name, what is it?

564
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:50,147
Dave Atherton.

565
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,608
I'm just thinking...

566
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:57,791
About you and I, th-this...

567
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:01,835
- if this was part of your cover.
- No.

568
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:06,059
Absolutely not, Gillian.
The last thing that I expected

569
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:08,957
on this job was to fall in love.

570
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:15,149
And telling you everything
is incredibly stupid...

571
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:17,424
and dangerous.

572
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,096
But I don't wanna lose you.

573
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:27,376
You haven't.

574
00:36:42,873 --> 00:36:44,833
When do I get to meet
my brother's killer?

575
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,008
Real soon.
I'll be right back.

576
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,667
You sure?

577
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,386
It was a rental car
and his name is on the contract, so...

578
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,910
- Incoming.
- Dr. Lightman.

579
00:36:59,002 --> 00:37:01,385
We just got the prime
suspect's DNA back.

580
00:37:02,226 --> 00:37:04,137
You've got some explaining to do.

581
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,450
You concealed a personal
relationship with the victim.

582
00:37:10,785 --> 00:37:14,647
- Well, I was just trying to help.
- And you thought I was the dirty one.

583
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:18,460
No, I wasn't sure that you
were dirty, per se.

584
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,697
You know, I just...
I couldn't be 100% sure at the time.

585
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:25,075
How sure were you?
90%? 80%?

586
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:31,123
I didn't kill Raul,
you know, if that's where this is going.

587
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,167
- How can I be 100% sure?
- Find the real killer?

588
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,292
How do you explain the
fight outside the bar?

589
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:38,505
He was drunk.

590
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,316
- I was gettin' his keys.
- Don't take me for a fool.

591
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,386
Do you have any idea how overwhelming
the evidence is against you?

592
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:46,638
I'm not taking you for a tool.

593
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,881
- Fool!
- Whatever. Look, Bernard...

594
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,993
Just give me 10 minutes
in the cube with Juan.

595
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,610
So you came here to take
your brother back home.

596
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,110
Right? But you threatened him,

597
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,029
and then he ran away.

598
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,553
Why would I threaten my own brother?

599
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:05,828
I don't know.

600
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:11,247
You're a senderista, right?
You'd threaten your own grandmother.

601
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,029
I fight for the revolution.
So did my father, and so did Raul!

602
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:17,294
All right, calm down.
Calm down.

603
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:24,852
But Raul, he got away, didn't he?
He escaped.

604
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:29,848
Now, I don't know, but it seems to me
if you join the shining path,

605
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:32,142
that's a lifetime's membership.

606
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:36,480
You came here to remind him of that.
Or to, you know...

607
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,483
kill him if he didn't see sense.

608
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,401
I never found my brother.

609
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,557
You shot him... Didn't you?

610
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:50,494
You shot him in cold blood.

611
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,121
I was still looking
for him this morning.

612
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:55,706
<i>That's enough, Lightman.</i>

613
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:57,834
Mr. Campos, you're free to go.

614
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:02,042
Oh, what? Are you nuts?

615
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,507
I just hooked the bastard!

616
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:16,824
Juan.

617
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,438
Yes?

618
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:46,283
After the fight, right.

619
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:49,458
Raul was happy.
He was excited to go home.

620
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:58,691
Tell him that.

621
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:31,595
- He talked to Raul yesterday afternoon.
- All units, go.

622
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,995
Juan! Don't you move!

623
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,023
Don't move! Get on the ground.

624
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:46,818
Get on the ground.
Put your hands on the ground.

625
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:49,863
- Put your hands behind you.
- Juan!

626
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:58,835
Get up.

627
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:00,638
Let's go.

628
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:16,493
- Aye, aye.
- Hey.

629
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:19,184
Cal, you remember Dave, don't you?

630
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,226
Yeah. Uh, from juvie.

631
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,604
Right? Eh, Burns.

632
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:24,571
Dave Burns.

633
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,489
Right.

634
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:31,321
Did I get that right? Or did I make a
mistake, 'cause I'm terrible with names.

635
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,246
- You got it right.
- How are you?

636
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:35,700
I'm terrible with names.
I'm, you know...

637
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:40,831
Um, did I say something
there that surprised you?

638
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,375
Or is it... no, no.
I've got it right.

639
00:41:44,217 --> 00:41:47,420
No, 'cause it's been donkey's years
since she's had a bit...

640
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,798
of anything special in her life.
I mean,

641
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:53,616
not that there's anything wrong
with her. Far from it. I mean,

642
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,345
she's just a little bit...

643
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,981
- Awkward.
- Awkward is good.

644
00:42:00,404 --> 00:42:02,509
So you've had your fun, Cal.

645
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:05,702
All right. Just talk amongst
yourself for a minute.

646
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:09,577
Dave, do me a favor, all right?
She's my best friend, all right?

647
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:11,862
She's my best friend

648
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:15,073
and is probably the only reason
that this place hasn't gone under,

649
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,741
so you do me a favor,
you know. Just...

650
00:42:17,984 --> 00:42:19,952
handle with care, you know?

651
00:42:20,364 --> 00:42:22,514
Don't let him scare you off. Heh.

652
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:26,086
- I thought I told you to...
- talk amongst myself.

653
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,586
I got bored.
Really?

654
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:35,458
- Will you give us a second?
- Sure.

655
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:37,088
He seems nice.

656
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:40,672
- What?
- You OK?

657
00:42:41,284 --> 00:42:44,309
What, me? Yeah. I'm fantastic.
How about you? You okay?

658
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:47,981
Illegal underground fights, Cal?
You could have told me.

659
00:42:49,782 --> 00:42:53,694
You know, just because you share all
your dirty little secrets, all right,

660
00:42:54,077 --> 00:42:55,614
doesn't mean I have to.

661
00:42:57,974 --> 00:42:59,534
He's a good man, Cal.

662
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,912
That's all you need to know.

663
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,930
That's all I'm gonna share.

664
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,791
No, I got it.
No more questions, right?

665
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:11,008
I'm good.
