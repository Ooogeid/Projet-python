1
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:20,732
Let's hear it for the Sermonson
High School marching band.

2
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:21,771
Good job.

3
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:24,261
Great job.

4
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,321
It is my sincere hope this center will
become a beacon of academic excellence

5
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,698
in an underserved community
for years to come.

6
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:35,062
Clara, would you do the honors?

7
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:36,187
Of course.

8
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,333
Thank you, Mrs. Musso,

9
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,156
for your friendship and generosity.

10
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,775
You're welcome, governor.

11
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:50,749
Thank you, ladies.

12
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:52,929
For many years,

13
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,680
and I speak to you today
not as a politician

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,849
but along with my wife as parents.

15
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,811
Public education in America
has been in peril.

16
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,272
You know the refrain...
lack of funds, underqualified teachers,

17
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:07,882
negligent parents.

18
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,673
And to this I say,

19
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:12,154
no more excuses.

20
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:24,734
The guy in the denim jacket...
Do we know him?

21
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:28,003
Denim jacket. 11:00.

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,964
... vote for this great state

23
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:31,301
of Virginia.

24
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:32,842
Your car's waiting.

25
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:37,054
Thank you, kind voters of Virginia.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,813
Thanks very much for coming out.
Appreciate the support.

27
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,154
Great to see you.

28
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:55,239
Let's go get them.

29
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,800
Let's get out and vote?

30
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:58,496
Thanks for your support.

31
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,327
Thank you for the support.

32
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,653
Thanks for coming today.

33
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,136
The governor's hit.

34
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:36,017
There's no such thing
as an "assassin's gaze".

35
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:37,676
All right.
So I can report back

36
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:40,281
that you can't tell if Duane
Corey was acting alone.

37
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:42,703
Didn't say that.
He had an accomplice.

38
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,029
It was the governor.

39
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:45,998
What? Come on.

40
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,733
I know. It turns your stomach.

41
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:50,148
- The governor knew Michelle Daly.
- Of course.

42
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:51,635
She was a staffer.

43
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,924
He "knew" knew her.
Know what I mean?

44
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,176
Flirtatious, flared nostrils,

45
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:58,960
admiring look.

46
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:00,513
She really fancied him.

47
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,125
The FBI is paying you to find out
if the governor was acting alone,

48
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,226
not dig into
the governor's personal life.

49
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,771
He's paying me to poke around and find
the truth. I'm not a glorified cop.

50
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:11,357
Show Reynolds the situation.

51
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,238
The governor's in a tight race.
Too close to call.

52
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:17,703
A staffer who was clearly more than that
was shot dead.

53
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:20,241
Now the man's back up in the polls.
You can't ignore

54
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,809
that the girl was just a victim
of a 9-point bullet bump.

55
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,978
- Where are you going?
- To see the governor.

56
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:29,375
Brooks isn't just any old governor.

57
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,377
He's a close friend of yours.

58
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:34,672
I appreciate
this must be difficult for you.

59
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:37,675
As the majority stakeholder
in this firm...

60
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,135
I bet that you regret
saying that already.

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,322
Just go easy on him.

62
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:45,249
I respect this man a lot.

63
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,226
Someday he could be president.

64
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:50,603
Not with this girl's blood
on his hands, he won't.

65
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,552
La <i>Lie to team</i> presents:

www.u-sub.net

70
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,676
The Democratic process
is no stranger

71
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,472
to hardship and suffering,

72
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,766
but the death of Michelle Daly

73
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,883
is especially cruel
and incomprehensible.

74
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:33,902
Dr. Foster.

75
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,015
Or may I call you Gillian?

76
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,246
I see Clara Musso called
to give you a heads-up.

77
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:43,668
Which is why my will to win this race
is only strengthened by all our desires,

78
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,911
each and every one of us to stand strong
in the face of adversity.

79
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,730
So I invite all of you to join
my staff, my family, and me,

80
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:53,417
in our prayers for the family of Daly
in the wake of this terrible tragedy.

81
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:57,144
Which is why the governor
has decided to retain the Lightman group

82
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:59,072
to get to the truth
behind all of this.

83
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:01,717
Dr. Lightman, I've read all your books.
Big fan.

84
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,946
That's cobblers.
Try and change the subject.

85
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,304
Not with me.

86
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:06,972
Ladies and gentlemen,

87
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:09,369
the governor would like to invite you
to warm up your coffees

88
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:12,019
and grab some more pie
before he continues the question

89
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,439
- and answer segment of today's visit.
- Please. Help yourselves.

90
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:20,361
- I'm not sure I follow.
- Do your best,

91
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,602
for the dead girl in the morgue.

92
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:24,937
I beg your pardon?

93
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,409
No, don't beg.
It frightens the voters.

94
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,333
- Governor?
- Not a good idea.

95
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,459
This is Lightman being discreet.
If Michelle Daly's not enough

96
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,463
to haunt the governor for the truth,

97
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:39,088
Lightman is.

98
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,039
What do you want from me?

99
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:43,412
A 9-point bump in the polls

100
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:44,963
24 hours before the election

101
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:46,885
because a girl
took a bullet for you.

102
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,431
I want a bit more
than coffee and pie. Know what I mean?

103
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:53,727
My place or yours?

104
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,007
If it were a choice
between losing the election

105
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:59,584
and having Michelle back with us,
I'd gladly choose the latter.

106
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,666
My place, then.
Let's keep it official.

107
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:07,616
- Clear his schedule this afternoon.
- No more excuses.

108
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,318
<i>Brooks is a dog</i>

109
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:21,056
<i>that needs to be
taken out back and put down.</i>

110
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:26,556
That guy's a lone wolf.
No way he's gonna help Corey.

111
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,522
Don't lose hope.

112
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:29,847
We still have 42 more

113
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,795
videos of guys who claim
that they want Brooks dead.

114
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,130
Are you chatting online
while I'm over here

115
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:36,615
looking for an assassin?

116
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,619
- What?
- You have a new girlfriend?

117
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,775
- Just a friend who...
- Emily Lightman?

118
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:44,429
Please try not to judge.

119
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,439
You're cyberfriends with Emily?

120
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:49,116
Judgment all over your face.
Look, she friended me.

121
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,743
She's the boss's daughter.

122
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,334
- What am I supposed to do?
- Hit "ignore".

123
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:55,974
She's going to musicfest
this weekend.

124
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,226
As are half the kids in DC. So?

125
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:01,234
So it's a breeding ground
for negative group behavior.

126
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,463
Drinking, drugs.

127
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,475
Loker, I've been to musicfest.
You're blowing it way out of proportion.

128
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,159
You're not 16 years old.

129
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:09,679
Last year, 3 girls
got roofied and raped.

130
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,808
You should read some things that her
friends are writing about doing there.

131
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,870
If she were my daughter, I...
I should give Lightman a heads-up.

132
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:20,898
Look. How many friends
does Emily have on that site?

133
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,023
500 or 600.

134
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:23,746
Exactly. She probably barely knows

135
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:26,769
the kids who are writing all this stuff
on her site, if at all.

136
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:28,741
God.
What'd you do?

137
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:30,368
Nothing.

138
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,517
Told her I might be
going to musicfest, too.

139
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,192
What is wrong with you?

140
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,714
We got a confession.

141
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,582
- Out of who?
- Duane Corey.

142
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,983
The guy that security grabbed
after the shooting.

143
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,592
His cellmate came forward
about an hour ago.

144
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,663
Says that Corey was bragging
about trying to kill the governor.

145
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:49,301
Gave up his whole plan...
weapon cache, location, everything.

146
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:53,472
An inmate with nothing but incentive
to lie about Corey's confession.

147
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,427
Lightman thinks I should bring you two
to come check this guy out with me, so,

148
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:57,554
let's go.

149
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,826
<i>I love politicians.</i>

150
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,386
<i>I do.
I really do.</i>

151
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,709
<i>Are you comfortable?</i>

152
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,110
<i>Can we get on with this?</i>

153
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,154
Try to answer our questions
with as much accuracy as you can.

154
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,975
- I am comfortable in this glass box.
- A man in your position.

155
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,800
- Correct.
- Up in the polls.

156
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:17,357
Survivor
of an assassination attempt.

157
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:20,499
I would never exploit
a tragedy like this for a...

158
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,667
Bullet bump.

159
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
Now I said it, so you don't have to.

160
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,422
You're way off base, Dr. Lightman.

161
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,092
So, I have to ask,
why all the guilt, governor?

162
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,369
A girl died.

163
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:35,848
Looks more like fear to me.
What you frightened of?

164
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,475
Someone tried to kill me
at that rally.

165
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,644
But a girl died instead.
What was her name?

166
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:42,896
Michelle. Daly.

167
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:44,982
Separation of first and last name.

168
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,621
The personal with the formal.

169
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:49,223
So, she wasn't just any old girl to you,
was she, governor,

170
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:52,730
and don't tell me that all depends
on what my definition of "was' is.

171
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:54,835
She was one
of our college volunteers.

172
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,451
It was no secret she knew me.

173
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,290
<i>How well would you say you knew her?</i>

174
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,038
<i>Hardly at all.</i>

175
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,935
- We might've made small talk.
- Might've?

176
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,667
Could've been more than that.

177
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,419
- It wasn't.
- Declarative.

178
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:07,144
Commanding.

179
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:10,423
You wanted to make sure
it was never more than just small talk.

180
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,593
You sure it wasn't pillow talk?

181
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,261
Absolutely not.

182
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,263
Clarifying language.
Defensive.

183
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,006
There was a misunderstanding
that could've been misconstrued.

184
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:22,060
- Wires were crossed.
- Governor,

185
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:24,833
man to man, right, and Foster here.

186
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,193
Michelle was a beautiful woman.

187
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,279
Now, I know what it's like
to work with beautiful women.

188
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:34,948
He's talking about your friend
Clara Musso.

189
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,200
Yeah, and her.

190
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:39,210
We both know
that there are women out there

191
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:42,831
that are naturally
attracted to power.

192
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,531
Governor, out with it.

193
00:09:57,785 --> 00:10:00,185
There was one night
a few months ago.

194
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:03,852
I had just won the primary.
Alcohol was flowing.

195
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:07,593
<i>And I'd had a few drinks.
It had been a rough campaign.</i>

196
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:10,472
My wife had headed home early.

197
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,820
That seems like
the night in question.

198
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,188
Michelle and I wound up
smoking a cigarette together.

199
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,550
Shared it.

200
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:22,217
She complimented me on my win.
We talked for a long time.

201
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,522
Stealing away like that...

202
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:28,131
It made me feel young.

203
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,372
- It was innocent.
- But not to Michelle.

204
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:34,494
She was confused that
my wife had left early

205
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:39,313
and here was the governor enjoying
the taste of a young woman's lipstick

206
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:42,015
on the filter of a cigarette.

207
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:45,457
We both know that this
isn't about a confusion

208
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,651
of a young woman anymore, don't we?

209
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:52,932
You had sex with her.
That night. Admit it.

210
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:11,976
<i>It was one of those moments.
Everyone celebrating, schmoozing,</i>

211
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:15,730
and here she is,
showing me such simple,

212
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:17,663
- sure...
- Yeah.

213
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:21,388
- You took advantage of her, didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

214
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,200
Yet you were ashamed.
Why is that?

215
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:29,319
Trevor Addison walked in
before I could do anything I'd regret.

216
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:30,694
If he hadn't...

217
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,192
He and I decided then
to distance Michelle from me.

218
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,820
He reassigned her.

219
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:39,306
Why keep her around at all?

220
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:43,435
I wasn't about to cut a promising
career short just because I almost...

221
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,182
Could have...

222
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,343
Crossed the line.

223
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,095
Your future president's
more lucky than good.

224
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,360
He didn't cheat,

225
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:05,380
he had no reason to kill her.
Could we just leave him alone now?

226
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,602
He's explained his actions but not
the others who work on his behalf.

227
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,396
He's a governor, Gillian,
not a mob boss.

228
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:16,860
That sounds like a much better campaign
slogan than "no more excuses."

229
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,288
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

230
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,030
Corey, come on, man.

231
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,489
They found your gun right there
on the scene when they took you down.

232
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,301
You were caught red-handed.

233
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,476
<i>I'm telling you, it's not mine.</i>

234
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,002
- <i>So, what are you saying?</i>
- It's a conspiracy.

235
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:37,297
To frame you for
the murder of Michelle Daly.

236
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:40,568
- I didn't kill her.
- You didn't mean to kill her,

237
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,185
because you were aiming
for the governor, right?

238
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,911
There.
What you did with your nostrils,

239
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:48,225
that tells me that you want
governor Brooks dead.

240
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:52,216
<i>I didn't shoot that girl,</i>
and that gun is not mine.

241
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:53,397
Stop lying.

242
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,440
<i>I'm not. I'm innocent.</i>

243
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:02,406
I believe him.

244
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,639
That's fear.
Of this place.

245
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:06,910
Same as his.

246
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:09,016
- What?
- Corey didn't do this.

247
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:10,654
He said that he did, though.

248
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:14,167
To his cellmate, which, by the way,
why did you say that, Corey?

249
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:17,911
They think twice about raping
cold-blooded killers in here.

250
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:21,787
And you really believe
that he didn't do this?

251
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,343
I know he didn't.

252
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,530
<i>Take us back to
the night of the primary.</i>

253
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,556
<i>No messenger on that, in person.
Get a signature.</i>

254
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,766
Thank you.
The night of the primary.

255
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:38,066
When you found the governor
celebrating privately with Michelle.

256
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:40,193
Yeah, that night of the primary.

257
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,140
<i>I handled the situation, spoke with her
and found her a more suitable position.</i>

258
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:46,666
One chat with you
and she was out of the inner circle.

259
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,896
It's my job to insulate
the governor.

260
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:50,662
Very smooth.
Hence the strut.

261
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,166
Or is that just like a side effect
of being around all this office Totty?

262
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,421
So, how long did it take you
to get Michelle in the sack, then?

263
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,671
I'm a single man, Dr. Lightman.

264
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:08,331
I work 100-hour weeks.
Michelle was a beautiful, young woman.

265
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:12,162
Neither of you have ever been tempted
to mix business with pleasure?

266
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:16,291
Excuse me, but the woman you're sleeping
with was killed on your campaign trail.

267
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,608
You don't seem
too shaken up by that.

268
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,944
I cut Michelle's family
a check for funeral expenses.

269
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,885
- That's nice of you.
- For the terrible days ahead.

270
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,073
If you don't mind,
see that clock over there?

271
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:30,898
<i>19 hours until the polls
open and counting.</i>

272
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,915
I've got a question for you.

273
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:38,777
You know the man that was arrested
for the shooting, right?

274
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:42,797
How does a nutter like that
get through your security?

275
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:50,972
I like a man who can own up to
his own mistakes.

276
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:52,974
He cut a check.

277
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:58,300
Now you think Addison
had Michelle killed?

278
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:00,346
He used to be a lobbyist

279
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:02,603
for security contractors.

280
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:08,363
So Addison's sleeping with Michelle,
and let's say, for whatever reason,

281
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:11,154
he wanted to have her killed.
Why do it in such a public way?

282
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,786
it's two birds with one bullet.

283
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,539
Michelle's a goner
and Brooks is a winner.

284
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:19,528
<i>He gets one of his black ops buddies
to do the job. No one's the wiser.</i>

285
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,878
It's absurd, Cal.
He's not that kind of man.

286
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,090
So, what kind
of a man is he, exactly?

287
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,356
- He's tried it on with you, hasn't he?
- Please.

288
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,881
Eyes front, Clara.
This is important.

289
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:39,312
Hasn't he?

290
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:45,235
I can't say as I blame him, really.

291
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,486
Excuse me?

292
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,693
That was supposed to be
a compliment.

293
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,826
Compliment. That's funny.
It felt more like an insult.

294
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:55,056
He's a player.

295
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,331
Women like Michelle
are just a number to him.

296
00:15:58,612 --> 00:16:00,141
Women like Michelle and me?

297
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,085
No, because you
turned him down, right?

298
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,838
See? I told you I was good at this.

299
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:09,129
I don't think that Michelle
was the only woman that he was

300
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:10,728
polling on the campaign trail.

301
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:14,306
Brooks has tons of women working for it.
Let's not start a witch hunt.

302
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,601
Witch hunt.
Is that what you call them?

303
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:37,702
Lemmings!

304
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,873
All right. Who here,

305
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:42,542
apart from Michelle Daly,

306
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,879
has been shagging
the chief of staff?

307
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:57,390
Bingo. Lady in pink.

308
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:04,389
What made you suspect that Michelle
and Addison were also having an affair?

309
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:07,196
She went from part-time
volunteer to paid staff.

310
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:09,341
- Came out of nowhere.
- You see the advantage

311
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,014
of sleeping with Addison?
You know how the game's played?

312
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:13,934
But Michelle wasn't a game player?

313
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:15,301
Michelle was wholesome.

314
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:17,702
What? Meaning she was
naive and innocent?

315
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,581
She wore a promise ring.
Planned on saving herself for whatever.

316
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,250
"Whatever," said with
an edge of contempt.

317
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,003
She was a good person.

318
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:33,453
See, you had to control
every muscle in your body

319
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:35,706
from your head to your toes
to pull that one off.

320
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:36,800
It's true.

321
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,979
I don't doubt it. I'm talking
about the anger you feel for her.

322
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:43,186
As if she's to blame for you being here
in the hot seat with us.

323
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:48,135
How does Addison

324
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:52,654
get a promise ring
off a girl like that?

325
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,121
We all partied just as
hard as we worked.

326
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,175
She wanted to fit in.
She started off

327
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,430
with just the occasional
small glass of wine.

328
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,287
And then the wine turns to spirits.

329
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:04,686
It's OK.
We all make mistakes.

330
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:07,211
Michelle was a grown woman.
An adult.

331
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,548
I did not make her drink. I did not
steer her towards Trevor... Addison.

332
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,366
You're doing everything you can

333
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,818
to avoid the elephant
in the room, aren't you?

334
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:22,479
Elephant in the room?

335
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:25,061
Why a promising young woman
was murdered.

336
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:28,196
- They were shooting at the governor.
- You're a cop now, are you?

337
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:31,277
They had to shoot past the governor
to get to Michelle.

338
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,552
Let's treat it as murder for now.

339
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:37,451
See, there it is again.

340
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:39,755
Fear. And anger.

341
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,028
I'd feel the same way if I felt
I was being forced into a lie.

342
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,813
- I haven't lied.
- Smart.

343
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,583
True, too, technically.

344
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,071
Because you know how to
steer a conversation

345
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:51,496
and you know how to lie by omission.

346
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:54,919
I smell a cover-up.

347
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,755
I've been there.
I've done that.

348
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,440
I'm not involved.

349
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:03,502
I hear things,
but I didn't do anything.

350
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:05,433
Now what you're doing
is stonewalling.

351
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,854
You've gone from
gossip to accomplice.

352
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:13,504
After Michelle started
sleeping with Addison,

353
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:15,540
she started drinking even more.

354
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:18,531
At the commonwealth fundraiser
last month, she got totally bombed.

355
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,950
And she threatened to go
public with the affair.

356
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,977
Addison sent her home before
she could make a scene

357
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:27,016
and she drove up a curb where a man
was collecting bottles and cans.

358
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:29,501
Said she didn't even realize
she hit someone at first.

359
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:32,687
So, it was a hit and run?

360
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:35,696
Addison made her turn herself in
and then it just...

361
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,910
And I have no direct
knowledge of a cover-up,

362
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:41,262
but I'm guessing Addison
got the incident swept under the rug.

363
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:46,518
- And the man she hit?
- He died after a few days.

364
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:51,856
A drunk staffer kills someone leading up
to election, you make it go away.

365
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:54,288
In a close election,
you want more than that.

366
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,159
You want the girl to go away, right?

367
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,690
You know, a couple of my agents
found your little hideout.

368
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:06,002
The guns. Ammunition.

369
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,289
Plus, the crosshairs
you drew on Brooks's photo

370
00:20:10,414 --> 00:20:11,876
speaks to malicious intent.

371
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,704
I bought those
to protect the governor.

372
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,214
Brooks was in danger.

373
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,217
I'd have to agree with you on that.

374
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,140
You don't understand. I sent the e-mails
so staffers would tighten up security.

375
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,756
They're not real.
Brooks... he needs a guardian.

376
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:30,331
- Someone like me.
- Let me explain something to you.

377
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:34,578
You can try and play crazy for the jury.
That's not gonna fly in here.

378
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,254
From your collection.

379
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:41,383
- What the hell?
- He don't recognize the murder weapon.

380
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,124
Hey! This should be
in an evidence room.

381
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,730
Can you playback?

382
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,794
There. Instant genuine surprise.
He's never seen it before.

383
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,562
Because it ain't mine.

384
00:20:57,124 --> 00:21:00,599
Does he want Brooks dead? Yes.
Is he dangerous? You bet?

385
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:04,304
He's delusional. He thinks he's got a
special relationship with the governor.

386
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,325
The gun's a throwaway.
It's easy to file numbers off a handgun,

387
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,638
Anybody could have planted it
near Corey.

388
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:11,977
- The guy's a patsy.
- He's here on gun charges.

389
00:21:12,102 --> 00:21:15,047
So, he's gonna have to sit tight
till we can figure this thing out.

390
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:18,123
Whoever killed Michelle could
have known about Corey's threats,

391
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,733
made sure he had a clear path to Brooks
for shooting

392
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,958
so they could pin it on a Wacko.

393
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,199
Just a minute!

394
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:32,469
Oh, hang on.

395
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,464
Hello.

396
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:44,827
So, did he send you over here to
appeal to my better judgment?

397
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:46,152
No, he didn't.

398
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,968
That's good, 'cause
I've done everything.

399
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,333
That's what I told him.

400
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:55,772
- You hungry?
- Oh, you cook, too?

401
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:57,058
Oh, yeah.

402
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,451
Sure.

403
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,819
There's chicken masala.

404
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:04,072
So, be warned.

405
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:08,427
- Do you want a beer?
- Sure.

406
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:11,287
You know, I told the governor
that I owe my freedom

407
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,658
to your bull-headed, obnoxious,

408
00:22:13,783 --> 00:22:16,083
no-holds-barred way of doing things.

409
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,086
Up yours.

410
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:19,523
Right now?

411
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,097
Ooh, I say.

412
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:26,886
How's he doing?

413
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,921
The governor, I mean.
You know, behind closed doors.

414
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,437
He's distraught. We all are for Michelle
not just for his political career.

415
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:39,853
Oh, yeah. He's not broken up enough
to pull out of the race, though, is he?

416
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:42,819
Come on. A life of service
is all Brooks has ever believed in.

417
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,862
Ought to clean house.

418
00:22:44,987 --> 00:22:48,825
You talk about Trevor Addison, campaign
manager, on the eve of an election.

419
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,976
I'm talking about
the governor doing right

420
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:54,801
by that girl's family, you know,
and by the voters. Excuse me.

421
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:57,373
- Excuse me.
- Excused.

422
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,587
Thank you.

423
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,207
Well, I'm here to tell you that he wants
you to find the truth, no matter what.

424
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:10,082
Oh, what, so you appealed to his
better judgment, then, did you?

425
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,645
... Like you, he hasn't sp...

426
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,181
too hot for you?

427
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,430
It's good.
It's good.

428
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,071
Would you like another beer?

429
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:31,050
- Are you trying to get me drunk?
- Who, me?

430
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,503
No. Never. Absolutely not.

431
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:01,606
I couldn't find a recycling bin.

432
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,113
We know about
Michelle's hit and run.

433
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:11,407
That man's death
was an awful tragedy.

434
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,952
A tragedy that could kill a political
career, unless your name's Kennedy.

435
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:17,997
I'm paid to manage situations, Dr.
Lightman.

436
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,065
By squeezing the D.A. who's looking
for the governor's endorsement?

437
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,630
It was an accident,
and I tried to minimize the damage.

438
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:29,082
William Freeman.
That's the damage.

439
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,844
Yep. The dead man, in
case you were interested.

440
00:24:33,748 --> 00:24:35,048
I know his name.

441
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:39,437
After the accident, there was
nothing I could do for him.

442
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,669
He was hit near a stop sign.

443
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,388
It was very hard to see at night.

444
00:24:44,513 --> 00:24:48,517
That almost looks
like genuine remorse.

445
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm sorry the man is dead.

446
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,448
Must be a pain in the ass. I mean
cover-ups. Managing them, you know.

447
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,126
Michelle was a kid at
the beginning of her career.

448
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:01,791
I wasn't gonna let her go to prison
over a youthful indiscretion.

449
00:25:01,964 --> 00:25:03,764
Or let the press find out.

450
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:07,645
All right.
Full disclosure.

451
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,471
Check's in the mail.
You don't look fat in that dress.

452
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,917
Robin spoke with me about
your conversation yesterday.

453
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:15,179
I was gonna head to your
office after the polls close.

454
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,993
- With something that might help you.
- After the polls closed.

455
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:20,268
What I'm trying to tell you is...

456
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,685
Let Michelle Daly speak for herself.

457
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,325
<i>After my car hit the curb,</i>

458
00:25:31,677 --> 00:25:33,990
<i>I just...
I just took off,</i>

459
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:36,496
<i>'cause I didn't know what to do.</i>

460
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,912
<i>And I didn't know
that I had hit someone.</i>

461
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:42,136
<i>I really didn't.</i>

462
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:44,757
<i>I was drunk.</i>

463
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:50,454
Unusually matter of fact for someone
on the heels of a traumatic event.

464
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,782
No sadness.
No remorse at all.

465
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,962
I don't doubt that she was drunk but
I don't think she was driving that car.

466
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:00,137
Her confession is pure fiction.

467
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:03,507
She's covering up for somebody.

468
00:26:04,526 --> 00:26:07,361
Sad part is that whoever it was

469
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,444
had her convinced she was
doing the right thing.

470
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:14,492
- Hey! Eli, what's up?
- Hey!

471
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:17,729
- I was just thinking about you.
- You were?

472
00:26:17,854 --> 00:26:19,658
Yeah, and music fest.

473
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,522
Yeah, I'm really excited for p-funk.

474
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:25,923
Yeah, well, you're an old soul.
You're a very funky old soul.

475
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:28,592
- Thanks.
- I'm also a p-funk fan.

476
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:30,361
- Really?
- Sure.

477
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:32,444
So you're coming?

478
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,975
Yes, if your dad
lets me off work in time.

479
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,435
Cool. You can meet my friends.

480
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,182
- Yeah, your friends.
- Sure, why not.

481
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,650
Hey, listen to this.
They haven't even released it yet.

482
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:47,647
That's great.

483
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,603
Sometimes at these festivals, there can
be a diffusion of responsibility.

484
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:57,199
You must not be that big of a p-funk fan
'cause you do want to hear this.

485
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:01,392
I just mean that sometimes
inhibitions can go down.

486
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:04,895
And something that may not have
normally happened could happen.

487
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,189
Or, you know,
maybe... maybe it would.

488
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,854
All right, these guys.

489
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,383
Bad idea.
Keep your distance.

490
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,510
Eli, I barely know them.

491
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:21,055
Good. Then your distance will be kept
because from what I'm reading,

492
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,914
these guys are bringing an
entire pharmacy to the concert.

493
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,850
Ecstasy... Speed...
Roofies?

494
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,888
And you're worried something
might happen to me?

495
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:31,866
Well, I care about you, Em.

496
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,450
You're sweet.

497
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:37,800
- Good.
- And I care about you, too. Really.

498
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,116
Good. So, you'll be careful.

499
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,246
So careful.
Just relax.

500
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,804
Em, God, no, no.

501
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,044
I'm... I'm sorry. I just...
you kept IMing me and... never mind.

502
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,663
I was IMing you back to be polite.

503
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:00,288
No, Em, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like...

504
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:07,349
I'm so fired.

505
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:15,999
This a bit previous, isn't it?
Polls haven't even closed yet.

506
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:19,484
If you're looking for my husband, he's
at a press op for the next few hours.

507
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:23,507
Is that the one where they go in the
little booth and vote for themselves?

508
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:24,880
That's the one.

509
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:27,658
Something I said?

510
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,669
We don't believe Addison's
story about the hit and run.

511
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,033
What hit and run?

512
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:39,884
What was that?

513
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:41,607
- What?
- Between you.

514
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,145
- What was that?
- Nothing.

515
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,264
You shouldleave the
lying to the politician's wife.

516
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,812
She's had a lot more
practice than you have.

517
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:51,354
We believe that Michelle took the fall
in order to cover for someone else.

518
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:52,563
Someone else?

519
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:57,374
How much did the governor have to
drink the night of the fundraiser?

520
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:58,527
What?

521
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,906
No, 'cause I can see he likes to drink.
I can see that much.

522
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,998
I won't stand here while you
throw darts in the dark,

523
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:08,385
indict my friends and my husband
with your pseudo-science.

524
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,055
Look, Mrs. Brooks. Michelle
Bailey admitted to a hit and run

525
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,044
that she had absolutely
nothing to do with.

526
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,712
And now she's dead.

527
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,697
And you are a bully, digging through
a decent man's trash.

528
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:23,928
No one's perfect.
You'll find lies wherever you look.

529
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:30,032
How about you, darling? How'd you get
home that night? 'Cause you were there.

530
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,409
That was the night
I spilled wine on my dress.

531
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:34,534
Red wine. Pinot.
Argentinian.

532
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:38,651
- What vintage?
- Nothing special.

533
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:43,335
We should really leave the lying to her,
'cause she's much better at it than you.

534
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:48,496
Actually, Jenna and I left together.
I dropped her off at her house.

535
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:54,372
Janet's using Clara.

536
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:56,718
You're incredible.

537
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:58,826
Or the other way around, you know.

538
00:29:58,951 --> 00:30:00,506
- Incredible how?
- You know.

539
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:04,482
- It's that obvious, is it?
- Was it that good?

540
00:30:05,174 --> 00:30:06,687
- Honestly?
- No.

541
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:09,457
That's what they were doing
when we showed up.

542
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:11,889
- They were getting their stories.
- The Pinot noir.

543
00:30:12,014 --> 00:30:14,784
Yeah, I mean,
do they even make that in Argentina?

544
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:16,611
Alfredo Roca, 2007.

545
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:20,536
- Not just a pretty face, are you?
- Back to you and Clara.

546
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:21,726
Really?

547
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:24,273
She's up to something, I want
to make sure you're not compromised.

548
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,371
- It was just a t of fun between us.
- It was a little bit more than that.

549
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:28,501
Were you there?

550
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,682
I'm talking about
from her perspective.

551
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:32,655
You don't read faces, do you?

552
00:30:33,488 --> 00:30:35,461
Did I say incredible?
I meant impossible.

553
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:37,047
Thank you very much.

554
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:43,204
Let's say that Clara was driving the car
and she ran over the homeless guy.

555
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:45,766
- Are you accusing Clara?
- No, it's just theory.

556
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:47,518
I'm just posing a theory.

557
00:30:47,643 --> 00:30:50,704
The Brooks campaign might feel obligated
to help cover it up.

558
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,596
She is their biggest campaign donor.

559
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,042
I need to talk to you in private.

560
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,039
- What is it?
- So, it started... Emily,

561
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:04,069
she friended me on this website.

562
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:06,658
Up, 'cause I haven't got much time.

563
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:07,698
Right.

564
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,326
I was worried about these drugs,

565
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,161
- these boys...
- Excuse me?

566
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:16,746
I just felt that somebody
should be looking out for her.

567
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:18,297
Really?

568
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:23,632
I just think...
Emily kissed me.

569
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:27,259
Follow me.

570
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:36,852
So, you kissed my daughter.

571
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:40,105
No. She put her headphones on me
in the lab.

572
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:42,527
- I wanted to show her...
- You kissed her.

573
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:45,081
I was trying to help,
and she kissed me.

574
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:46,987
- How was it for you?
- What?

575
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,822
How was it for you? Was it good?

576
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,076
I just was trying to help her out.

577
00:31:55,585 --> 00:31:56,666
Enough said.

578
00:31:58,157 --> 00:31:59,347
What, Reynolds?

579
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,788
I guess Addison won't be around
to see the Governor be re-elected.

580
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,080
Come on. Everybody out.
Let's go.

581
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,180
He's not the suicide type.

582
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,385
He wrote the suicide note.

583
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,504
He e-mailed everyone
on the Governor's staff.

584
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:19,439
He admits
to covering up Michelle's hit

585
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:22,314
and run and that he hired the shooter
to kill her before she could talk.

586
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:26,193
We have to figure out
who wrote this.

587
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,271
Yeah, 'cause he didn't.

588
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,034
- You seen Lightner?
- He's in his office waiting for Clara.

589
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:41,531
Still fighting that fight, huh?

590
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:44,045
Don't let him fool you. He loves it.

591
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:47,580
How can you tell if this thing
is fake if it's been typed?

592
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:49,633
Word choice, repetition.

593
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,635
The use of passive or active voice

594
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,986
can tell you a lot about
the person who wrote this.

595
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:55,264
Let me show you.

596
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:57,748
"A person of my stature,

597
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,516
"someone in my position,
with regards to a subordinate"...

598
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:04,032
this is a person who is preoccupied
with power and status.

599
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:05,487
Power and status?

600
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,527
That sounds like the Trevor Addison
you were describing earlier.

601
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:10,546
It's all about the pronouns.

602
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:12,156
Women.

603
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,532
We use a lot more pronouns
when we write.

604
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:16,493
"I", "she,"

605
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,656
"they."

606
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:20,873
Men will typically name the person
or thing they're talking about.

607
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:24,293
So a woman preoccupied with power
and status wrote this.

608
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:30,716
Why?

609
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:34,928
Why, it's all there.

610
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:38,617
He covered up for the hit and runs.

611
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,687
You don't believe that, do you?

612
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,635
Another thing
or two about suicides...

613
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,106
slippery sorts like Addison,
they don't kill themselves.

614
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:48,609
- What, you think he was murdered?
- Michelle

615
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,392
and Addison, they both knew something
that got them killed.

616
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:55,479
I just hope to hell that you don't know
what they knew, love.

617
00:33:58,562 --> 00:34:00,638
You already know I do, don't you?

618
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,833
You didn't drive Janet home
that night.

619
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:09,077
You weren't even in the bloody car.

620
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,438
Janet killed that homeless man.

621
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:20,470
She was alone.
It was an accident.

622
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:21,832
She was drunk.

623
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,459
Addison made Michelle take
the blame,

624
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:26,438
and he pulled some strings
to make it go away.

625
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,150
All except Michelle, and that let loose.
That got taken care of yesterday?

626
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,786
Janet and I go way back.

627
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:34,024
If she knew anything
about Michelle's death, I would...

628
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:35,149
you'd know?

629
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,671
She'd tell you, right?

630
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:39,118
Even though you're the major stakeholder
in this firm?

631
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,864
That suicide note
was written by a woman.

632
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,592
Shake.

633
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,678
You lied to me.
You covered up

634
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,628
for the Governor's wife
at the 11th hour. I want my firm back.

635
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:03,392
She picked me earlier today.
She just needed a little more time.

636
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:05,547
Shake his hand.

637
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,676
I'll be your witness.

638
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:13,703
You know, these people...

639
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:16,113
they don't deserve your loyalty.

640
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,946
I think you're better than that.

641
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,319
I want to give you
a chance to prove it.

642
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,148
What are you doing here?

643
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,657
I told them.
Addison left too many loose ends.

644
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:04,682
- I don't want to be involved anymore.
- Honey,

645
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,290
no one's going
to take Clara's word over yours.

646
00:36:10,408 --> 00:36:12,419
Addison forced Michelle
to keep his secret.

647
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,592
When she wouldn't,
he had her killed.

648
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,924
She's lying.

649
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:18,258
Can you prove it?

650
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:21,635
The night of the fundraiser.

651
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,370
Addison rode home in my limo.
You can ask my driver.

652
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:25,682
Governor Brooks,

653
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,872
Michelle wasn't driving the car
that was involved in the hit and run.

654
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,979
She took the fall for someone else.

655
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:33,982
It wasn't Addison,
and it certainly wasn't me.

656
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:37,270
Addison's suicide note
was written by a woman.

657
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:38,862
It was a fake.

658
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,408
It could have been Clara.

659
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:50,156
Where were you the night
of the hit and run, Mrs. Brooks?

660
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,504
Clara gave me a ride home
from the fundraiser.

661
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,092
See, even he doesn't believe
that one.

662
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:04,263
Congratulations, Governor.

663
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:06,972
We have to leave now.

664
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:09,761
Even you can't be that stupid.

665
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,188
You must have sensed that something
was going wrong.

666
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:14,791
They said it was nothing.

667
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:18,002
The FBI are going through your
phone records and personal hard drives.

668
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:20,542
Are they gonna find something
about the shooter?

669
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,698
The shooter was a crazed,
lone gunman.

670
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:26,034
Is it the same one that you hired
to take care of Addison in the tub?

671
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:27,995
Are we gonna find him sitting

672
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,122
on the beach somewhere
counting your money?

673
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,878
Is there any truth
to what they're saying?

674
00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:42,703
What did you do?

675
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,880
I was the one holding
it all together.

676
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:49,099
I always have been.
You always said I was your rock.

677
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:51,394
I was your rock, Charles.

678
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:57,649
I didn't ask for this.

679
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,695
Yeah, you did, actually,
when you stopped asking questions.

680
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,996
What can I do to make this right?

681
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:12,672
You could step down

682
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:15,250
for starters.
Personal reasons,

683
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,904
whatever.
I don't care.

684
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:25,510
Your public's waiting for you,
Governor.

685
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:08,676
We could be a good team.

686
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:11,012
I got all the team I need.

687
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,143
I know you respect
the work we do here, Clara,

688
00:39:16,095 --> 00:39:17,154
but sign.

689
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:22,733
It's a pleasure doing business
with you.

690
00:39:22,995 --> 00:39:25,445
That's an assassin's gaze,
if ever I saw one.

691
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:28,098
You said there was no such thing.

692
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:47,615
Looking for this?

693
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:50,944
- What flavor is it?
- Pineapple.

694
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:52,393
Yeah, it is here.

695
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,666
So, you hit him?

696
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:57,801
- You kissed him.
- Now he'll never meddle again.

697
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:01,044
I mean, he may sue you,
but at least he'll never meddle.

698
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:03,174
So, what were you thinking?

699
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,931
- I don't know.
- That rings true.

700
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,031
Maybe kissing him
was a little extreme.

701
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:10,555
You reckon, do you?

702
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,201
Yeah, but that makes me the apple
that didn't fall far from the tree.

703
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:15,620
So, it's my fault, then, is it?

704
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:17,909
Yeah. It's good you admit this.

705
00:40:18,828 --> 00:40:19,875
My point is

706
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:23,722
that it's not Loker's fault,

707
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:26,063
right?

708
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:28,842
What?

709
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:34,807
You didn't.

710
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:37,517
You did, didn't you?

711
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:53,983
I know you were just trying
to look out for her,

712
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:55,621
right?

713
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:59,193
And I shouldn't have hit you.

714
00:41:01,388 --> 00:41:02,584
I was wrong.

715
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,096
Physical violence...

716
00:41:07,524 --> 00:41:10,108
Right... is very, very wrong.

717
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:13,678
Apology accepted.

718
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,972
Dad, come on.
Don't blow the apology.

719
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,269
I'm sorry.

720
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:25,903
- Probably should have seen it coming.
- What, the kiss?

721
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,785
No, the punch.

722
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:31,279
You're emotional wildfire
where Emily's concerned.

723
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:35,969
Bit of ice cream?

724
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:38,495
It's pineapple.

725
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:41,284
I like beer.

726
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,143
Go in. Help yourself.

727
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:47,187
First on the left.

728
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:00,687
What if I hadn't apologized?

729
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,826
Good girl.

730
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:09,177
Good girl.
