<i>Truthworteam</i> <i>Arcadya Global Team</i>

3
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:14,779
A&M!

4
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,553
You played great today.

5
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:36,801
I was doing what I'm good at.

6
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,300
You know what else
I'm really good at?

7
00:00:58,505 --> 00:00:59,551
Showtime, baby.

8
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:01,634
Get out the door.
Get out, man.

9
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:16,822
Hair of the dog?

10
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,501
Dude, that chick last night
was all over you,

11
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:23,601
and she was 5 kinds of hot.

12
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:25,626
You don't got to tell me.

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,625
Excuse me, Mr. McNeil?

14
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,482
- Can I have your autograph?
- Sure.

15
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,460
You should stay in school...

16
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:38,139
don't do drugs, recycle
and all that jazz.

17
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,725
Was she freaky?

18
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:42,727
She's freaky, uh?

19
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:44,877
Was she a little bit freaky?

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,617
Not in front of the kid, man.

21
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,441
Start with you. I told you.

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,743
- She's lot or little freaky?
- Man, she was a little bit freaky.

23
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:53,618
- You better stop...
- I'm sorry. C. McNeil?

24
00:01:54,117 --> 00:01:55,517
I'm sorry for you.

25
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,075
Maybe you can tell me your name too,
darlin'.

26
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:01,673
My name is Detective Ferro,
and you're under arrest

27
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,384
for contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.

28
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,384
What?

29
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:07,371
For what?

30
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,503
Some people call it statutory rape.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,851
Please stand up, sir.

32
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:18,066
What's going on?

33
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,019
Lie to Me
2x02 - Truth or Consequences

34
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,257
- Thanks a lot!
- That's good, you work for me.

35
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:57,750
You both need to see
my monkey sex tape.

36
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:58,844
Sounds like fun.

37
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,830
It's the most
interesting research I've done.

38
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:02,873
The female Bonobo,
she'll entice a mate

39
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:06,530
and sometimes attack
with no provocation whatsoever.

40
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:11,821
I'm familiar with the phenomenon.

41
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,158
We'll talk.

42
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,634
Chimpanzee sex later.
IRS case now.

43
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:20,403
Right, we're gonna go see the kook
waiting for us at his compound.

44
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:23,223
- Don't call him a kook.
- What do I call the leader of a cult?

45
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,560
The IRS thinks he's a tax fraud.
And even cults have rights.

46
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,041
Statutory rape.

47
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:31,476
The former hang 'em high prosecutor

48
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,754
isn't above defending the wicked
when the price is right.

49
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,178
My client had no idea
Susan Reed was underage.

50
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:38,467
She was on a college campus.
She had a fake ID.

51
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,636
She was drinking,
looks to be at least 20.

52
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,471
She goes to school
with our daughter.

53
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,057
Emily knows the girl, but
they don't travel in similar circles.

54
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,268
How does she feel
about you representing this guy?

55
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,980
- She understands my position.
- Which is?

56
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:52,982
If Cabe were white, these charges
wouldn't even have been brought.

57
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,234
Susan Reed came home late, intoxicated.
Her father went ballistic.

58
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:59,601
She broke down
and told him where she was.

59
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:01,831
- In a black man's bed.
- That's right.

60
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:04,073
Before Mr. Reed had even
hung up the phone with the cops,

61
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,779
my client was as good as indicted.

62
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,190
I don't know.
Underage girls and...

63
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:12,950
sex, it's really...
It's just not my cup of tea, love.

64
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:15,058
Hewlett County, Virginia
is twice as likely

65
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:17,834
to bring criminal charges
against blacks as it is whites.

66
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:20,256
And the A.D.A., Jay Putt,
I went to law school with him,

67
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,359
He's a pompous ass who isn't beyond
overcharging just based on race.

68
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:26,307
That is why Cabe McNeil is
facing trumped-up sex charges.

69
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:30,936
And he diddled a 16-year-old girl.
Let's not forget that little tidbit.

70
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,350
These charges cost him his future.

71
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:34,440
What do you want?

72
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,830
Sex charge
is a strict liability crime.

73
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:38,206
But if I can prove

74
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:40,775
that Cabe truly believed
that Susan was of age,

75
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:42,824
then I can use that
to mitigate the charges.

76
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,524
You really want to defend this guy,
or you're just taking this personally

77
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:48,057
because of the black and white leaves
on your family tree?

78
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,941
Both.

79
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,782
At least you're being honest.

80
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,464
But I'm not gonna blindly help
this guy.

81
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,628
Anything I find out, I'm gonna...

82
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:03,385
disclose to both you
and the prosecution.

83
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,560
Of course.

84
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,852
What happened to my client?

85
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:20,804
Cons here,
someone's in for kid-touching.

86
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,279
They don't ask for details.

87
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:25,991
- Did they let you see a doctor?
- I'm fine. Just want to go home.

88
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,335
First, I need you

89
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,926
to talk with Dr. Lightman.

90
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:30,455
What do you wanna know?

91
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,705
The truth.

92
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:34,985
Give us a minute?

93
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:47,769
My baby.

94
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,989
Who is that in there?

95
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:51,767
That's Cal Lightman,

96
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,019
and this is his associate
Ria Torres.

97
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,753
They're experts in deception
and witness veracity.

98
00:05:57,131 --> 00:05:58,618
They wanna help me help Cabe.

99
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,900
How old are you?

100
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:01,482
22.

101
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:03,833
How do you feel
about being locked up?

102
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:05,364
I was scared.

103
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,241
Tell me you enjoyed it.

104
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:09,210
- What?
- Convince me that...

105
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:11,787
being locked up was nothing.
It was breeze.

106
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:15,791
Jail was nothing.

107
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,434
I didn't sweat it.

108
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,486
What the hell is he doing?

109
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,219
He's trying to get a baseline
for when Cabe is telling the truth.

110
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:26,529
Cabe always tells the truth.

111
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:28,847
Did they give you any medication
for your injuries?

112
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,208
2 painkillers.

113
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,060
You like having sex
with little girls?

114
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:37,229
What?

115
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:40,406
Driver's permits, pigtails...
That kind of thing turns you on?

116
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,109
I thought she was in college.

117
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,767
That's enough.

118
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:48,324
I'm telling you
that I have the right to see my son.

119
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,284
- Calm down.
- Just let me... I am calm!

120
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,719
If I'm gonna help
a statutory rapist walk,

121
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:58,625
I'm gonna be damn sure
he's telling the truth, right?

122
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:00,440
I just want to make sure

123
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:01,594
my son...

124
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:03,448
is OK.

125
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:05,678
You OK, Cabe?

126
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,134
I'm OK.

127
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,175
I'm right out here.

128
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:12,051
We're getting you bailed out.

129
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:19,601
So you weren't sure she was legal.

130
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,084
I assumed she was.

131
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,944
High school girls
crash the parties a lot.

132
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,263
And you seek'em out?

133
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,552
That's not my thing.
Ask anyone.

134
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,242
I don't hang with the chicks
from Parker High and Lynbrook.

135
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,693
I didn't know she was from Lynbrook.
I thought she was my age.

136
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,609
How often
do girls from Lynbrook Academy

137
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:41,502
party at Virginia A&M?

138
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,669
Every weekend.

139
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:46,757
But Susan was talking about econ classes
she was taking, like she went there.

140
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:48,514
I swear.

141
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:51,187
The tells I normally pick up on,

142
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,597
painkillers might be masking them,

143
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,286
His facial injuries are restricting
movement, and the swelling...

144
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,039
- I don't know if he's lying...
- Cabe McNeil?

145
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,619
She's a kid.
Why would you do that to her?

146
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:05,940
She's a child.

147
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:07,409
My child.

148
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,114
You know what that makes you?
That makes you a rapist.

149
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,981
That's what that makes you.

150
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,618
Mr. Reed, I know...
I consider your pain sincere.

151
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:18,833
Our daughters go to the same school.
If someone came after my Emily,

152
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,624
I'd be as angry
and upset as you are.

153
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,918
You have no idea how this feels.

154
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:25,087
That's true.
But I can see it in your face.

155
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:29,216
Go home.
Don't make it worse for yourself.

156
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,457
Go home to your daughter.

157
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,056
- Who are you?
- Just a bystander.

158
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,756
I don't have a dog in this fight.

159
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,184
Don't just stand there.

160
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,687
Get your son out of here.

161
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:48,272
Just go home, Mr. Reed.

162
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,638
Just go home, sir.

163
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,089
That was interesting.

164
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:12,168
- Hi.
- Hi.

165
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:14,457
- Jamie Cowley.
- Dr. Gillian Foster.

166
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,929
- This is Eli Loker.
- Hi.

167
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:16,884
Hello.

168
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,809
Here's a copy of the court order

169
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,382
allowing us to visit your compound
and conduct our research.

170
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:24,730
It gives us 3 days to observe and
interview the members of your church,

171
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,185
and we will come and go
as quietly as we can.

172
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,770
How many disciples

173
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,129
live on your compound?

174
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,918
I share the property
with about 150 other believers.

175
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,999
The IRS has had difficulty
determining an exact number.

176
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,368
The children born into your group
don't get social security numbers.

177
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,435
They don't need one to know God.

178
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:49,794
- And God, would that be you?
- The Supreme Court is very clear.

179
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:53,852
The IRS cannot judge
any church's religious tenets.

180
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:58,709
Only whether your followers' beliefs
are sincere and genuine.

181
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,492
That's where we come in.

182
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,995
You have over 30 houses
on your compound

183
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:05,729
registered as individual churches.

184
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:09,066
God is everywhere.

185
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:12,052
30 churches,
that means 30 different tax exemptions.

186
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:13,512
The IRS calls it fraud.

187
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,973
Only if they can prove that...

188
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,881
any of my followers
aren't true believers.

189
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:24,206
You seem pretty confident
that they all are.

190
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:28,258
Take a look around.
Keep an open mind.

191
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:32,256
- You might find yourself moved.
- Come on, I'll show you.

192
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:36,828
Other than you, I've only seen
two other men your age here.

193
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:39,997
Those are Chris and Ken.
They helped found the church.

194
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:43,651
When our boys turn 16,
we encourage them to explore the world,

195
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:46,035
though they're always
welcome to return and...

196
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,152
the women tend to stay.

197
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:49,604
They care for us

198
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,781
and vice versa.

199
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:52,826
I'm curious.
How many of these children are yours?

200
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:55,309
Spiritually,
they're all my children.

201
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:56,874
Biologically,

202
00:10:58,262 --> 00:10:59,113
Twelve.

203
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,962
And in your...

204
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,919
materials,
you claim that you're a prophet,

205
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:08,611
that God is gonna teach, through you,
how to live a fulfilled life.

206
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,122
That's right.

207
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:11,654
So...

208
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:14,352
It's pretty intense, uh?

209
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:16,685
How exactly
do you communicate with God?

210
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,765
How does anyone?

211
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:20,823
Through prayer,

212
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:23,269
sometimes by looking
into a child's eyes.

213
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:25,726
I can see that you need convincing.

214
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,045
Why don't you stop by my sermon,
see for yourself?

215
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:31,148
You have to excuse me.
I have a realization class to teach,

216
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,072
but feel free to talk to anyone.
We're happy to cooperate.

217
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,235
We're not here to judge, remember?

218
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:44,143
How can I not judge someone
who creates their own harem

219
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,580
and tosses out the competition
when they hit puberty?

220
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,697
Judge him?
How can I copy him?

221
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:52,919
It's weird, I know,
but it's a free country,

222
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,651
and if the earth mamas wanna split,
there is no gate.

223
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,423
No one's getting hurt.

224
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,971
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

225
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:07,711
Is Susan the kind of girl
who'd make up a story like this?

226
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,311
I don't know her very well.

227
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:13,649
What kind of things do you hear goes on
at these frat parties, then?

228
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,717
I've never been to one,
so I couldn't tell you.

229
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:20,781
You wouldn't be
dodging my questions?

230
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:23,852
No, I'm not dodging your questions.

231
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,198
So, the girls
who go to these parties,

232
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,352
do they lie about their age,

233
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:36,238
- or are they on about it?
- I told you, I've never been to one.

234
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,618
But...

235
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:39,415
But what?

236
00:12:40,616 --> 00:12:42,015
No, you tell me.

237
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,687
I've been to A&M a couple of times,

238
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,212
but just like, bars, you know?

239
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,782
Excuse me?

240
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,731
It's not a big deal.
Where is mom?

241
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,623
She'll be home in a minute.
She drives like a quaker.

242
00:12:57,706 --> 00:13:01,135
Just... I'd never go to a frat party.
Those things get crazy.

243
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,419
What, as opposed to a pub?

244
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,701
Not a pub, dad, a bar.

245
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,752
A college bar.

246
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:10,085
And one with bouncers
and a million other people.

247
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:12,889
It's totally different
from a frat party.

248
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:16,526
And I don't even go to drink.
I just want to listen to the music.

249
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:18,839
Really?

250
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,060
Really.

251
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,511
So how'd you get in, then?

252
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:25,679
What?

253
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:30,605
- What's in the drawer?
- Nothing.

254
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,302
- What's in the drawer, darling?
- Nothing.

255
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,317
- Nothing!
- Excuse me!

256
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,298
Dad, please.

257
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:41,868
That's private.

258
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,552
- Dad, stop!
- Excuse me.

259
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,759
That's private, dad.

260
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:49,012
That's such a violation.

261
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,671
Your mom's a lawyer, sue me.

262
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:53,979
Come on.
You have no right to do this.

263
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,392
Dad, I'm serious.
Come on!

264
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:06,094
What these, Emily?

265
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:09,594
Or, should I say...

266
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,561
Kami Schwartz?

267
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:15,812
Everyone my age has fake Ids.

268
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,880
And your social calendar demands two,
does it?

269
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:25,989
Dad, that's just a jewelry box.

270
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,410
What'd I miss?

271
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:33,497
I hope, for your sake,
these are just tic-tacs.

272
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,989
You're using birth control pills?

273
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,515
Do you realize there's consequences
for your actions?

274
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,113
There's consequences to...

275
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:56,645
going to frat parties
and hanging out with older boys.

276
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,582
- There's consequences to having these.
- To not having those, too.

277
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,165
You just read me.

278
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:06,773
You swore you would never
do that, and you just did.

279
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,701
Don't go through my things,
ever again.

280
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,067
Well, that went well.

281
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:22,945
Don't be mad at her.

282
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:25,624
I'm not mad at her.
I'm mad at you for not telling me.

283
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,296
She thinks she can't talk to you
about that.

284
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:29,095
Why?

285
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:32,067
Because when you read her,
she feels like you're judging her.

286
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,426
I'm not judging her!

287
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,682
That's rubbish.
I'm not judging her.

288
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,562
Did you know that some of her friends
are already having sex?

289
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:39,925
Which ones?

290
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:43,569
Why, so you can forbid her
from seeing them?

291
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:49,526
Come on. You know
what we were like when we first met.

292
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:54,001
Look, Cal, I know in your work
you uncover all kinds of terrible things

293
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:57,437
that people do every day, but you can't
put all of those fears onto Emily.

294
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,544
And look. She's not on the pill yet,
and I hope it stays that way,

295
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:05,765
but I think it's best that she have them
for when she is ready.

296
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:10,924
Bloody hell.

297
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,400
24 years old.

298
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:17,726
Are you attracted to her?

299
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:20,683
Sure.

300
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:25,368
19.

301
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,486
What does she do for you?

302
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:30,927
Pretty hot.

303
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:34,784
18.

304
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,618
16 years old?

305
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:43,686
Find her attractive?

306
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:50,734
15 years old?

307
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,937
Find her attractive?

308
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:04,147
OK. When I showed him the photograph
of the 24-year-old in the brown panties,

309
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:07,314
he subconsciously licked his lip,

310
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:08,813
and his pupils dilated.

311
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,380
These are all signs of arousal.

312
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,864
Now, this is his response
when I showed him

313
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,367
the 16-year-old, the 15-year-old,

314
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:17,960
and asked him if he was attracted.
He said "No."

315
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,121
You lied, Cabe.

316
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:22,415
- My son is a good boy.
- That's right.

317
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,877
He knows he's not supposed
to be attracted to a 15-year-old girl

318
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,539
'cause society tells him it's wrong.
But I mean, look at her.

319
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,384
Ample breasts,

320
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:33,885
slim waist,

321
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,738
- ass that won't quit.
- Cal.

322
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:41,035
All physical attributes
that a heterosexual male

323
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:43,143
is biologically wired to desire.

324
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,140
There's nothing wrong
in wanting her,

325
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,228
especially since
she's 22 years of age.

326
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,236
I lied, sorry.

327
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:53,818
Now, for the good news.

328
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,237
When I asked Cabe
if he had ever knowingly

329
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,954
had sex with an underage girl,

330
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:01,923
he said no.

331
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:05,444
And he was telling the truth.

332
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,015
Out in the world,

333
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,188
7-year-olds can get

334
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,007
carpal tunnel

335
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,911
from texting and playing
video games all day long.

336
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:18,139
And our children

337
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,891
grow their own food,
make crafts, become self sufficient.

338
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,400
Hear his word choice?

339
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,884
"Out in the world?"
He defines his followers' universe.

340
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,066
He compares himself to buddha
and other biblical figures.

341
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:35,017
- You got a point.
- No, but his point is irrelevant.

342
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,713
He's using details
with special context,

343
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:41,202
like underneath
that huge oak tree and

344
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:42,996
behind the work shop.

345
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,790
It's contextual embedding,
a sign he's telling the truth.

346
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:50,211
So he really believes he's a prophet.
His religious beliefs are legit.

347
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:52,901
Well, to him and them.

348
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:54,350
But see that?

349
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,019
Not her.

350
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:03,079
- Why the rush to see us?
- So you and your expert can sign these.

351
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:05,722
- For what?
- Clearance from the state

352
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:08,018
and federal government
for you to watch child pornography.

353
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:11,477
Your client secretly taped
his sex romp with Susan Reed,

354
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,002
and then he put it online
for everyone to see.

355
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:17,022
That's enticing a minor and making
and distributing child porn.

356
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,802
What was a simple misdemeanor
is now 3 felonies.

357
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:29,959
<i>Hey, I hear the moaning stopped.</i>

358
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:32,003
<i>You stopped banging.
Let us in.</i>

359
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:43,196
The forensic team traced the source to
the wireless router in the frat house.

360
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,685
Susan Reed also swears she
told Cabe how old she was.

361
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:51,733
Cabe may have fooled you. I was thinking
he was a good kid in a bad spot.

362
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,066
He is a good kid.

363
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,884
Your case is falling apart, so let me
send this kid where he belongs.

364
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,869
Why, because he's black and he slept
with a white girl, he belongs in jail?

365
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:01,191
No, because she was 16,
and he put it online.

366
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,929
- This has anything...
- Jay, don't play victim.

367
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,955
Come on. I know your track record,
and how you treat black defendants.

368
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,862
I know how you treated me in law school.
I had one white, one black parent,

369
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:13,336
and I was the only Brown student there.
You never looked down your nose at me.

370
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,018
I'll see you at the grand jury.

371
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,230
- Why'd you made the film?
- I didn't.

372
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:26,683
But you know who made the film!
And you put it online anyway?

373
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,033
I didn't make any film.
This is the first time...

374
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:30,770
- You knew she was 16.
- No!

375
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,149
Yeah, she told you that she was 16,
and you brought her home anyway.

376
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,303
She never said she was 16!

377
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,610
<i>Dr. Lightman?</i>

378
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,196
Can you come into the lab, please?

379
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,078
What?

380
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,808
Look at this.

381
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:54,420
<i>You knew she was 16.
Yeah. She told you </i>

382
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,255
<i>that she was 16,
and you brought her home anyway.</i>

383
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,567
<i>She never said she was 16.</i>

384
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,221
You see what I see?

385
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:07,557
A tired man.

386
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,934
A guy who's losing control
over his emotions.

387
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:13,255
This case involves a girl Emily's age
who goes to her school.

388
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:17,400
Maybe you should let me talk to him.

389
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,770
Maybe you should remember
who's name's on the door.

390
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:22,144
- What?
- She might be right.

391
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,117
Says the woman who's bringing up
personal gripes from law school.

392
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,516
You didn't even let him answer. How
can you tell if he's telling the truth?

393
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,362
- If you don't even allow for a read?
- He is telling the truth.

394
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:35,543
He doesn't know anything
about the film,

395
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:37,837
unless you saw
some signs of aggression

396
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,407
I missed during my particularly
unprofessional session.

397
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:42,842
He's being honest.

398
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:45,929
Are we done here?

399
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:47,430
- Yeah.
- Good.

400
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,029
Come on.

401
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,406
- Where?
- Back to school.

402
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:55,993
Hell no.

403
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:59,609
Hey, I'm sorry, old man,
but Shady Acres is down the street.

404
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,488
I used to run this place
back in the day.

405
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:05,776
Look, see? Look. Class of '85.

406
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:09,804
- Blue and gold, proud and bold.
- You were Theta house?

407
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,351
Yeah, hang on!

408
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:13,931
There you go. That's me right there.

409
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:14,874
That's you?

410
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,835
- Damn.
- Yeah. Father time's a bitch.

411
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,660
Enjoy the party, brother.

412
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:23,583
- Keg's in the kitchen, right?
- In the kitchen.

413
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,942
I used to strip.

414
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,184
So this is college.

415
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:55,748
Guess I didn't miss much.

416
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,570
What did you find out?

417
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:00,724
Most of these guys
just talk a big game.

418
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:04,554
Once you mention anything about
aggression or voyeurism, they pull back.

419
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:07,564
Actually, I don't think
any one of these guys

420
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,314
could throw a decent hump at me.

421
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,566
You drunk?

422
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:16,613
Did you see anyone who, you know,

423
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,320
might be inclined to film
and distribute a sex act?

424
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:23,993
3 guys showed signs of arousal
when voyeuristic topics came up.

425
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,766
Round them up.

426
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,748
All right.

427
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,963
The simplicity of our lives,

428
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:33,572
the simplicity
of Jamie's teachings, it's all

429
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,600
- very...
- Simple?

430
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:40,806
Jamie's belief that he's a prophet that
can lead his people to a better life,

431
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:43,212
Do you share that belief, Catherine?

432
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,421
Of course.

433
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:57,545
Isn't that sweet?

434
00:23:57,877 --> 00:23:58,895
Did you make this?

435
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,230
What does it say?

436
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:04,650
They can't read?

437
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:08,321
Jamie's homeschooling stresses
ethics over standard academics.

438
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:10,599
They can't read,
and from what I can tell,

439
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,493
they spend all day making crafts
for Jamie to sell?

440
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,284
Do you think that's healthy?

441
00:24:15,674 --> 00:24:17,121
Not why we're here.

442
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:19,332
We'll take care
of our children our way.

443
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,875
And yours your way.

444
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:28,829
Men fathering children year-round,
kids not getting educated.

445
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:30,737
Yeah, like a quarter
of the U.S. population.

446
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,661
This doesn't bother you?
These children are not being cared for.

447
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:36,239
There are people out there
who'd want them, who'd love them.

448
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:38,641
We're here to find tax fraud.
No more, no less.

449
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:41,300
And no, wacky religions,
they don't bother me,

450
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:43,664
because they're no wackier
than the mainstream ones.

451
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:46,331
Do you really believe that
there's a man in the clouds

452
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:49,403
who will solve your problems
if you make a wish to him?

453
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,115
So being a scientist means
I can't believe in God?

454
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:53,832
Well, last I checked,

455
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:56,702
talking to invisible people
is usually diagnosed as schizophrenia.

456
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,039
Look at her son.

457
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,616
His body language is very open,
his arms behind his back,

458
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,727
- standing off to the side.
- Waiting where we have to pass.

459
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,630
I didn't catch your name before.

460
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:13,670
- I'm Zack.
- I'm Gillian.

461
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:17,932
Is there something
that you want to tell us, Zack?

462
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:21,549
My mom doesn't believe
in any of this.

463
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,355
Not in Jamie, his church,
none of it.

464
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,399
Then why does she stay here?

465
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:30,778
If she tries to go,
Jamie will take us from her.

466
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:42,771
- This would be my room.
- I see.

467
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:46,998
So, what's the plans?

468
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:48,744
No plan.

469
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:52,216
You ready to party, boys?

470
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,766
Take a hike, dude.

471
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,649
Which one of you made the sex film?
Who was it?

472
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:04,257
There's our man.

473
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:06,061
You two, hop it.

474
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:13,696
Your name?

475
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,364
Wayne.

476
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:17,783
Wayne what?

477
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:19,310
Wayne Harkey.

478
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:20,995
Hello.

479
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:24,207
Where's the sex film?

480
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:28,682
You made...

481
00:26:29,026 --> 00:26:31,195
a film with an underage girl.

482
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,086
If I have to ask you again, I'm going
to cuff you. You understand me?

483
00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:41,724
I didn't know what to do.

484
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,227
Or you couldn't stop watching it.

485
00:26:44,858 --> 00:26:47,063
I didn't know
she was in high school,

486
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,942
and I did not make that film.
I found it.

487
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:53,569
I just... I posted it online
as a joke to punk Cabe.

488
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,735
Real funny.

489
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:56,656
Look, I came up here for some beers,

490
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,511
and it was sitting on the desk.

491
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:00,284
I found it, all right?

492
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,794
The sex stuff was already on it.
I posted it, and I just...

493
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:04,413
I went outside for a brew.

494
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:08,868
I believe you.

495
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,636
Go on. Sod off.

496
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:16,014
What?

497
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:18,761
Give me the camera.

498
00:27:33,658 --> 00:27:36,988
I want to know how a video of you ended
up on a camera with a sex film on it

499
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,990
that I found at a fraternity house.

500
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,658
Look at me. Look at me.

501
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,396
Now, I found it at a fraternity house
that you told me

502
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,582
- you never went to.
- I didn't go there.

503
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,701
How did you end up on this camera?

504
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:53,782
It was outside school after a basketball
game, not at some college party.

505
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:57,510
See, I don't know what to believe
anymore. I really don't.

506
00:27:58,026 --> 00:27:59,802
You've got fake IDs,

507
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,710
and birth control pills.
What else are you keeping from me?

508
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:06,239
Look. Look at the date.

509
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:09,559
That was before the party,
which I wasn't even at.

510
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,981
Who are the girls on the video?

511
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:15,026
That's Dori and Kate.
They're seniors

512
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,863
that I hang out
with once in a while.

513
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,502
And that's Kate's camera.

514
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:22,158
They're really cool, and there are only
a couple of juniors that they'll even

515
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,179
talk to.

516
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,330
- Let alone bring along to frat parties.
- I've never gone with them.

517
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:28,349
Yet?

518
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:40,051
Do you believe that
Jamie Cowley's a prophet?

519
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:43,762
I was 19 and a user when I met him.

520
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:46,805
Jamie was handsome, and...

521
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:49,767
he cleaned me up.

522
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:53,229
He'll keep my kids.

523
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,978
And I cannot lose my babies.

524
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:03,371
I hate to bring up the obvious.
We have to report her to the IRS.

525
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:06,100
She clearly doesn't
believe in the church.

526
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:08,459
Her home is registered
as a place of worship.

527
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:10,376
Only because Cowley makes her.

528
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,473
That's irrelevant.
We just report the facts.

529
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:14,248
Ok. Fact,

530
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:17,129
we tell the government,
she's arrested for tax fraud,

531
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:18,506
she'll lose her children.

532
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,548
I'm not about to serve her up
when I can deliver Cowley instead.

533
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:24,138
I'm not going to lie to the federal
government about our findings.

534
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,371
{\I'm not going to lie. }I'm going to tell
them exactly what's going on there.

535
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:28,951
Laws are being violated.
We need to get those kids out of there.

536
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:32,081
So you're suggesting another waco.
You just bust down the door.

537
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,668
Women and children who
are just too scared to leave?

538
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,100
Well, they're not just going to
go in there and round them up.

539
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:40,791
We were hired to pursue
the tax fraud angle.

540
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:44,115
- Let's do our job.
- Except Cowley believes his delusions.

541
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:48,203
They won't be able to prosecute. All
we'll get is maybe a few scared women.

542
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,800
Then that's all we'll get.

543
00:29:58,512 --> 00:29:59,755
Which one of you's Kate?

544
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,132
And you are?

545
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:03,629
The man who found your camera.

546
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:04,921
Where did you get that?

547
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,172
Where did you leave it?

548
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:07,972
It's mine. Just give it back.

549
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,182
After you've answered a few questions.

550
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,401
Whatever, stranger danger.

551
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:14,900
Give me back my camera, or I'll call the cops.

552
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:15,812
Go ahead.

553
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:17,988
Tell them all about
filming your friend Susan while

554
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:19,400
she was in bed with Cabe.

555
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,000
Which one of you recorded it?

556
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,093
Neither of us. Susan did it.

557
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:30,828
Susan did it.

558
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,213
At least that's the truth.

559
00:30:33,485 --> 00:30:37,610
I told you we should have never brought
her along. She was being such a baby

560
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:39,502
- about the whole thing.
- What whole thing?

561
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:41,849
It's a lot more comfortable

562
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,674
talking to us than is the cops.

563
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:48,277
A bunch of us made a pact
not to have our first time

564
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,256
with a college guy
when we were in college.

565
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,314
High school boys are tools.

566
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:56,380
You go to A&M to have sex
with college boys.

567
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,780
And we picked a few juniors
we thought were cool enough to hang.

568
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:03,086
Susan was, totally petrified,

569
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,739
so I gave her my camera.
For proof.

570
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,157
You made her record it?

571
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:12,176
We made a pact. We needed proof.

572
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:14,456
After the deed,
she totally wigged out.

573
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,467
She ran out of the room
and left it there.

574
00:31:18,313 --> 00:31:20,134
You feel bad about any of this?

575
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:23,959
It's just sex.

576
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:27,969
Now, give up the camera.
It cost my dad, like, $400.

577
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:31,052
You tell him it's held by
county in evidence.

578
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,823
In fact, the cops, they'll be by later
today, and they'll tell him themselves.

579
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:40,606
My daughter's Emily Lightman.

580
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,800
You two stay away from her.

581
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:45,717
- Whatever.
- You stay away from her.

582
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:58,374
Mr. Reed.

583
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,564
You defend that boy.
You work with his lawyer.

584
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:03,330
You have the nerve
to come to my home?

585
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:06,007
I know it's hard for you.
I don't want to make it any harder.

586
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,342
You know what's been hard?
Let me tell you what's hard.

587
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:12,044
My wife dying 11 months ago
because the insurance carrier said

588
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:13,877
the treatment she needs
is experimental.

589
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,134
My plant shutting down so some
guy in Paraguay can have my job,

590
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:21,012
my baby girl on the internet
because some animal filmed ...

591
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:24,667
I promise you, it's not my intention
to bring you any more pain.

592
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:28,438
Right, Susan?

593
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,116
I spoke to Kate and Dori.

594
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:34,326
I think you need to talk to your dad.

595
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:36,511
I think he deserves the truth.

596
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:43,851
There's stuff I haven't told you.

597
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,509
Hey, you guys.

598
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:51,927
Is your mom home?

599
00:32:55,063 --> 00:32:55,931
Catherine...

600
00:32:58,983 --> 00:33:01,039
Hello, Ms. Foster, Mr. Loker.

601
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,749
I called the IRS today.

602
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:06,358
They assured me that you
wouldn't overstep your bounds,

603
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,486
that they'd hate to see
my civil rights violated.

604
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:11,030
But I'm sure
that's not your intention.

605
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,281
Of course not.

606
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,487
I can see that you have a
fondness for children, Gillian,

607
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:20,372
but I sense that you have none
of your own.

608
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:25,560
Perhaps the animosity I feel
from you is misdirected at me.

609
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:31,219
My seed flourishes...

610
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,299
Buddy.

611
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:37,215
While yours, doesn't.

612
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:44,855
I can help you.

613
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:46,566
You and I can pray together.

614
00:33:47,346 --> 00:33:50,388
Many of the female members
couldn't conceive in the outside world,

615
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:53,252
but when they came here, we prayed,

616
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:54,823
and they conceived.

617
00:33:56,252 --> 00:33:58,449
Your problem isn't biological.
It's spiritual.

618
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,334
I don't need you to help me pray.

619
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,752
Today's the last day
of your court order.

620
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:05,893
Gather your things. You're
no longer welcome here.

621
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:14,594
He must have looked you
up online or something.

622
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,711
It's a cold read.
It's a carnival trick.

623
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:27,882
I've taken all the facts of
this case into consideration.

624
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,694
And I've decided to drop all
charges against Cabe McNeil.

625
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:32,861
What?

626
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:35,728
The extenuating
circumstances of this case are such

627
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:37,955
He violated my daughter.
She's a kid.

628
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:39,506
He's a 22-year-old man.

629
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:41,515
He had a reasonable belief
that she was of age.

630
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:44,456
It was filmed!
It's out in the world forever!

631
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:46,559
The only one who
gets punished is my daughter?

632
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:48,805
- Come on!
- Mr. Reed. it was a tough decision.

633
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:50,967
This is the way
the system always works.

634
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,590
You're the prosecutor. Do your job!

635
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,677
The system has to make someone pay.

636
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:59,117
My job gives me
prosecutorial discretion,

637
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,681
and I am using it here.

638
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:03,475
Your daughter went to the party
with intent of having sex.

639
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:05,018
She lied about her age.

640
00:35:05,756 --> 00:35:07,484
- She filmed it.
- She's the victim!

641
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,681
In this case,
Cabe McNeil is a victim, too.

642
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:14,000
Come on, Susan.

643
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,948
Excuse me.

644
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:21,201
Jay, I don't know what to say.

645
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,786
How about "I'm sorry"?

646
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,296
Could you please get my
daughter's jacket now? Now?

647
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,763
I'm not a bigot, Zoe.

648
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:31,716
I filed the charges
because I follow the law.

649
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:35,230
And the only reason I had a
problem with you in school was

650
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:37,232
you made law review, and I didn't.

651
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:39,428
Jay, I am sorry.

652
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:41,263
Good job on the case.

653
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,256
Next time,
I'm knocking you in the dirt.

654
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:46,278
Mr. Reed. Hold on a minute.

655
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,800
Hold on a sec.

656
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:52,941
I think I know what
you're going to do.

657
00:35:53,662 --> 00:35:54,735
I'm fine now.

658
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:56,770
Your hand says otherwise.

659
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:58,739
Don't go off to Cabe.

660
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:03,615
It will just make
matters worse for yourself.

661
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:05,996
Think about your daughter.

662
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,461
She's all I'm thinking about.

663
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:27,239
- I thought you were done.
- We just have a couple more questions.

664
00:36:27,322 --> 00:36:28,810
Actually, just one more question.

665
00:36:29,304 --> 00:36:30,562
Are you ready to leave?

666
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:33,289
What's going on?

667
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:36,283
You need to leave here
before Jamie sees us.

668
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:38,889
No, actually...

669
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:42,081
I want you to leave.

670
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:43,433
What is that?

671
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,625
It's a safehouse. It's a licensed
non-profit for battered women.

672
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:49,624
They'll take you and your children and
find you a place to stay,

673
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,376
- they will never reveal your location.
- Are you out of your mind?

674
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:55,212
He'll find me. He'll bring me back
and make me a prisoner.

675
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,107
You already are a prisoner.

676
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,090
You're helping her kidnap the man's children.

677
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:02,302
- That is not the way to do this.
- The van's leaving in 30 seconds.

678
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,221
Come on. It's your last chance.

679
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:09,810
I'm going with or without you,
and I'm taking them with me.

680
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,009
Come on, guys.

681
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,483
Thank you.

682
00:37:17,072 --> 00:37:18,077
Go around.

683
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,654
Come on, guys. Around the car, ok?

684
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:26,882
Catherine, what are you doing?

685
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,793
Those are my children, Catherine!

686
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:33,208
Don't... Catherine, stay here!

687
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,519
That was a big mistake.

688
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:55,491
You aided and abeted the escape

689
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,224
of the only possible person
we could have prosecuted.

690
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:00,235
I have no idea where the van came from,

691
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,525
and I had nothing to do
with Catherine's departure.

692
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:05,032
Mr. Cowley tells a different story.

693
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:08,744
Mr. Cowley believes he's
a prophet sent from God.

694
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:10,344
He's delusional.

695
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:12,456
You don't play games with the IRS.

696
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:15,995
Mr. Loker,

697
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:18,485
you've been very quiet.

698
00:38:18,795 --> 00:38:20,654
you have anything to add?

699
00:38:28,446 --> 00:38:29,996
What Foster said is accurate.

700
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:38,755
You tell Lightman he's going to have

701
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,006
an auditor with a microscope
up his british keister

702
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:43,987
for as long as I have a job.

703
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,274
Why did you do that?

704
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:01,831
You got to have faith in something.
I'm putting mine in you.

705
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,033
Thank you.

706
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,938
Doesn't mean what you did was right.

707
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,901
Dc. Foster to the lab,please.

708
00:39:11,128 --> 00:39:12,415
I'll be right there.

709
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:19,729
Thanks. I appreciate that.

710
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:24,969
Reynolds called in a favor.
He's got a cop watching Cabe.

711
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,767
What's going on?

712
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:29,533
I need fresh eyes on this.

713
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:32,189
I think that the dad is going

714
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:34,996
- to take a run at Cabe.
- Do you really think he'd go that far?

715
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,748
He doesn't want blame his daughter,

716
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:38,584
He's directing all
of his anger at Cabe.

717
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,336
People have trouble accepting when
females are the sexual aggressors.

718
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:43,067
It's like the Bonobo chimp...

719
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:45,507
Not now, Loker.
Not now.

720
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,842
Play it again.

721
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,577
You're the prosecutor. Do your job!

722
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,400
Just play it again. Play it again.

723
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:56,685
No, let it play.

724
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,145
Make someone pay.

725
00:39:58,653 --> 00:39:59,761
Listen to his words.

726
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:02,452
The system is at fault.

727
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:04,901
"The system has to make someone pay."

728
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,737
- Oh, hell.
- What?

729
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,834
Call the police.
He's not going after Cabe.

730
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,379
Someone has to pay.

731
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:03,710
Did you see his face?
Yeah.

732
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:05,779
He's at peace.

733
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:31,696
Come in.

734
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,961
How you doing, love?

735
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,369
I'm just thinking about Susan.

736
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:43,201
She doesn't have a mom,

737
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:44,976
and now, her dad's in prison.

738
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,764
What's going to happen to her?

739
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:52,675
I don't know, love. I don't know.

740
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:55,762
She was just excited
that the older girls liked her.

741
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:57,963
I was excited that they liked me.

742
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:00,659
Now, a man's dead, and...

743
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,453
Susan doesn't have any family.

744
00:42:05,996 --> 00:42:07,864
How did all of this get so messed up?

745
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:12,779
See, this is what I mean
about consequences, love.

746
00:42:13,685 --> 00:42:14,739
Can't predict them.

747
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:19,744
And when it comes to you,
that's what scares me the most...

748
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:22,613
The unknown.

749
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,093
I'm sorry.

750
00:42:41,332 --> 00:42:42,500
It's all good.

751
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,160
I love you.

752
00:42:58,615 --> 00:42:59,742
I love you, too.

753
00:43:03,365 --> 00:43:04,332
Be good.
