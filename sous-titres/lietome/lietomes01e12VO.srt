1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,600
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,900
Uh, I wasn't paying attention.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,300
Are you okay?

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,900
Yeah.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,200
I, uh...

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,300
No.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,500
Not really. I...

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,200
I just lost a patient.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,300
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm- I'm studying to be a nurse.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,900
I was just gonna go grab some coffee,

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,000
Uh, clear my head.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,000
Somebody help me!

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,400
Help me, please!

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,700
Somebody help me!

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,400
It seems that a Copycat of serial rapist
Andrew Jenkins is on the loose.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,100
Andrew Jenkins has been serving consecutive life Sentences
at Utley State Penitentiary for more than a decade.

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,700
Now, Jenkins abducted, blinded and then
raped 12 women in the '90s.

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,300
In the past three months,

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,700
Six more women have been abducted, blinded and raped.

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,600
So what does Andrew Jenkins know about these new crimes?

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
When will this Copycat be caught?

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,800
And what is being done to stop him?

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,000
What's up, bitch?

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,500
Does anybody want to tell me why Mr. Genius
is ignoring the guy he's here to talk to?

26
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,200
I mean, what is he waiting for?

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,300
Andrew Jenkins is a highly skilled Pathological liar.

28
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,400
If we come at him head on, we'll get nothing.

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
If Jenkins has Intel on the Copycat,

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
It'd be good to get it before
another woman gets abducted.

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,300
Lightman wants Jenkins to make the first move,

32
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,700
And he will.

33
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,000
And what if he gets made?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He won't.

35
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,300
Agent Reynolds, if you didn't think we could do the job,

36
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,100
Why did the FBI bring us on the case?

37
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,500
Look, I've interviewed Jenkins five times

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,900
And I got zero on the Copycat.

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,000
So let me put it this way.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
I don't believe in Holistic Medicine,

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
But if the Chemo's not working,

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
I'll give Acupuncture a shot.

43
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Hey, man, you need a hand?

44
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,500
I think Acupuncture's about to pay off.

45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Hello?

46
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,200
If you change your mind, just give me a yell.

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,100
Name's Andrew Jenkins.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,500
Progress.

49
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,000
Patience is not one of your virtues,

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Is it, Agent Reynolds? No.

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Is that Jenkins' Fan Mail?

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Ten years of sickos and freaks worshipping him.

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
All right, take it all back to the office.

54
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,100
Odds are good the Copycat's in there somewhere.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,000
Good Luck.

56
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,400
Heard about you on TV.

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,700
You're that-- You got that Copycat, right?

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,900
Swelling chest, chin up, smile.

59
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,000
That's pride.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't get it, myself.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,500
I mean, you're just
another pervert who can't close.

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,200
Is that who I am?

63
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,300
What happens, you just,

64
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
you get... you get queasy when it comes
time to finish, is that it?

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
What are you in for?

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,200
I got an Ex-wife,

67
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Who sometimes
doesn't let me see my kids.

68
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,300
And a Cop took her side.

69
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,500
And a Jury said that I killed him.

70
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,700
This, um, this Cop...

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Does he jerk awake every morning
with your name on his lips?

72
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,900
Is your face the last thing he sees
every night before he falls asleep?

73
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,800
When he meets someone new,
hears the horror in their voice,

74
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,700
Who does your Cop think of?

75
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,200
Oh, wait.

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
That's-that's right.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
He's not thinking of anyone.

78
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,400
Take your point.

79
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,200
Thought you might.

80
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
What's on your mind?

81
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Nothing.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,300
Oh, come on.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,200
Ask.

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,600
I don't get it.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,300
I mean, I don't, I-I, I don't get it.

86
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,000
Why'd you have to blind them?

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
I mean, it seems a bit excessive, you know?

88
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,400
Oh, come on, that's an easy one.

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,800
No eyes, they can't identify me after.

90
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,800
How'd you get caught, then?

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
Busted tail light.

92
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,100
I had a girl in the trunk.

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
Almost talked my way out of it,

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,400
Even with her screaming back there.

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
You-you're that good, are you?

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
Yeah.

97
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,300
But you aren't.

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Excuse me?

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,100
Different costume, same game.

100
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Now you've lost me.

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,300
Who are you?

102
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,300
'Cause you're not a Cop killer.

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
That's what I keep telling my Lawyer.

104
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,900
No.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,300
You're a fraud.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,100
Who sent you in here?

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,900
Special Agent Reynolds?

108
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,500
Ah, damn it!

109
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Alert the guards in the laundry.

110
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,800
We got a situation.

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Lightman's supposed to be reading Jenkins.

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
It looks like it's the other way around to me.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,700
I-I've never seen anyone read Lightman
who hasn't had Deception Training.

114
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,500
I-I don't know what happened.

115
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,500
Well, it was worth a shot.

116
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,500
Cal Lightman. How do you do?

117
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,700
And you want to know what I know
about my friend, the Copycat.

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,400
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
How come nobody's tried to bribe me?

120
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
What would it take?

121
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,000
All good.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,700
- It's very Civil
- Right.

123
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,000
What would it take?

124
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,700
You know what I like?

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,400
Chocodiles.

126
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,500
I'd like a box a week.

127
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,900
All right, it's a deal.

128
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,200
Yeah, I'm gonna need that in writing.

129
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,000
You made a deal with a Pathological
lying serial rapist for Chocodiles?

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,600
Who's the Copycat?

131
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,400
Well,

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,900
You get an A for effort.

133
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
And effort should be rewarded.

134
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,200
3748 Woodlawn Road.

135
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,100
Good Luck.

136
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,400
What happened?

137
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
Jenkins played you, that's what happened.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,300
And while you were signing a contract for snack cakes,

139
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,500
Camille Halpern was being abducted from this house.

140
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,800
So Jenkins didn't lead us to the rapist.

141
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,800
He led us to another victim.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Lie To Me 01x12 - Blinded

143
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,200
All right, this is single mom Camille Halpern.

144
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,300
If form holds,

145
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,400
The Copycat will toy with her the first 24 hours,

146
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,100
And then he'll blind her and rape her.

147
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,400
And we're already down three hours.

148
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,000
What's he do before he blinds them?

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,300
He ties them up, gags them and forces them
to watch videos of his previous victims.

150
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,000
So right now,
Camille is watching what he's gonna do to her.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
Yeah, if we don't get to her first.

152
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, Cube's ready.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Nobody talks to Jenkins
but me. We clear?

154
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,200
I pulled strings all over D.C.
to get this bastard in here.

155
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
So I sure hope that this plan is a lot
more successful than your last one.

156
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,300
At least we know Jenkins
is connected to the Copycat.

157
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,900
That's more than you found out the last three months.

158
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Now, I told you where to find him.

159
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,100
You just got there late.

160
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,200
Agent Ben.

161
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,900
Thanks for the Hall Pass.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
Hi, Foster.

163
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,500
Follow me.

164
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,200
Oh, somebody doesn't like me talking to his lady.

165
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,500
I got to call the Deputy Director with the great news.

166
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,200
That's the guy that out-Lightman'd Lightman?

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,100
So now what?

168
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,000
You make the Puppet dance?

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,300
What?

170
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,900
I called Natalie Wright,
the woman attacked two weeks ago.

171
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,400
She's a wreck,

172
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
But she's the only Copycat
victim willing to talk to me.

173
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,300
I thought I might be able to get some detail
that could help us with our new victim.

174
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,600
So I'll be on my cell.

175
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,000
If you need me.

176
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,800
Cal...

177
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
No, 'cause normally, you add "if you need me."

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
You're pissed, right? Because you think

179
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,500
I blew it at the prison, right?

180
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,600
I'm not blaming you.

181
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Well, you're angry.

182
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,300
Because Jenkins is loving this.

183
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,100
I mean, this is the best day
he's had in over a Decade.

184
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,800
He's out of jail, he's getting all this attention.

185
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,400
We are fulfilling his every fantasy.

186
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,300
By "we," you mean me.

187
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,600
Is that it?

188
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,900
So you're a big deal, huh?

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,700
Fancy Offices, bevy of fine ladies.

190
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,900
Real step up from Cell Block two.

191
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,600
Do you know who the Copycat is?

192
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,200
No.

193
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,600
What's your mom's name?

194
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,700
Gina. No, it's Margaret.

195
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,400
Where were you born?

196
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Georgia.

197
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,700
No, Nebraska.

198
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,400
Where'd you go to school?

199
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
Didn't.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,600
So you don't count flunking out of, uh,
Southern Iowa State after one semester then?

201
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,800
What the hell is he doing?

202
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,400
I'm concentrating. Hey!

203
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,700
I could be following up on ten different leads right now.

204
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,900
So you're gonna explain

205
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,600
Why this isn't Jenkins taking one
more useless Polygraph test. Wow.

206
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Okay, where should I even start?

207
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,300
I'm monitoring Heart Rate, Skin Temperature,

208
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,400
Perspiration, Vocal Stress, Blood Pressure--

209
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,500
Which doesn't even begin to cover what Lightman
is seeing in there, and what the cameras are...

210
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,100
All right, all right, enough.

211
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,500
Who's the Copycat?

212
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Don't know.

213
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,000
Would you tell me if you did?

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,900
Sure. We're pals.

215
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,700
Hey, how's it going?

216
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,500
Jenkins is lying about everything.

217
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,600
He won't let us establish a baseline of what
he looks like when he's telling the truth.

218
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,900
Hey, looks like I found somebody
suspicious in the Fan Mail.

219
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,400
Every week this guy sends disgustingly
graphic drawings of Jenkins' Crimes.

220
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,900
Let me see that.

221
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Well, it's one sick puppy, but that's not our guy.

222
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,700
And how can you know that?

223
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,700
I can know that because he's
fantasizing about past actions.

224
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,000
You want to look for somebody
who's making plans for the future.

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Let me see that.

226
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,400
How is it I'm the unpaid intern and
you're the highly paid Professional?

227
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,500
Hey, you're the one Lightman's
got sitting in the front row.

228
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,400
So... I'll just put this in the "No" pile.

229
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,700
Who's the Copycat?

230
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,200
Who's the girl?

231
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,800
You're a distraction.
I had to ask Loker a question,

232
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200
And you've got me reading all this Fan Mail.

233
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,300
And what, so you're above that now, is that it?

234
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,300
No, no, it's just that you squaring off
with a Master liar is kind of once-in-a-lifetime.

235
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,100
Oh, and you think you'll learn something?

236
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,700
A woman gets raped, she gets blinded,

237
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,400
but at least you've been afforded
an education, is that it?

238
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,100
Or maybe you just don't want me
to see that you're struggling.

239
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,700
Oh, that's an interesting theory.

240
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,400
But incorrect.

241
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,100
And that Fan Mail you're so disdainful of--

242
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Well, the guy we're looking for
is in there somewhere.

243
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
And that's a fact, that's not a theory,

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
So go find him.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,500
Mm. "Or maybe you just don't want me
to see that you're struggling."

246
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,100
She's very perceptive,

247
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,800
You're little... protege.

248
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Who's the Copycat?

249
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,900
We can do this all day.

250
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm not gonna make your little machines beep.

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,600
There's no one who can stay with you?

252
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,800
I don't want anyone to see me.

253
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,100
W-Well, what about your parents?

254
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,700
My mom is gone.

255
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,100
My dad was here for a few days,

256
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,800
But it... just made things worse.

257
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,400
My friends do what they can.

258
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,900
I'm s...

259
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry.

260
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,800
I want to help you.

261
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,400
I know he has another woman, but I...

262
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
I can't remember.

263
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,900
He said his dog was missing,
and I helped him,

264
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,300
And then...

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,100
It's just gone.

266
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,800
And when I try to remember,
all I can think is...

267
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,800
No one will ever love me.

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,100
I'm... I'm 23 years old,

269
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,400
And my life is over.

270
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
My life is over.

271
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,000
OK so...

272
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,800
This is the girl he's got right now.

273
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,500
Any idea where he's keeping her?

274
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,000
No.

275
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,300
I'll take that as a yes, then.

276
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
Uh, DC?

277
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,700
Maryland?

278
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,100
Virginia?

279
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
The home for bad boys was in Maryland.

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
You probably know that.

281
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,700
You know, you'd think I'd have
all kinds of Horror stories,

282
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,600
But it was actually nice.

283
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,700
Had a dog.

284
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,600
Some of the guys from Gen Pop
get to Train seeing-eye dogs.

285
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,300
I signed up for it once, didn't get picked.

286
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,359
Why do you think that is?

287
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,700
You see, that was weird.

288
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
That was, 'cause that was the truth.

289
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,200
Why the sudden honesty?

290
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Am I boring you? Is that it?

291
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,500
It's too easy?

292
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,300
Lightman-- it's an interesting name.

293
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,000
I've been called a... Light Bringer myself.

294
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,300
You see, there you go again, that was the truth.

295
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
Might be getting somewhere.

296
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,700
Here's something else that's true.

297
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,500
I'm never... gonna tell you who the Copycat is.

298
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,300
Okay.

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,200
Okay.

300
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,100
Hey, Torres.

301
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,500
Do any of, uh, Jenkins' Fans
refer to him as "Light Bringer"?

302
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Yeah.

303
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
Yeah, yeah, one guy.

304
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,200
Um, it stood out to me,
'cause I went to Catholic school.

305
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Light Bringer's another name for the Devil.

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,300
It's here in the "No" pile.

307
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,600
What am I missing?
Pathological liars like pushing boundaries.

308
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,700
Jenkins has been in that
box all night-- he's bored.

309
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,280
He's flirting with the truth.
By telling you the Copycat's pet name for him?

310
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:17,149
Yeah the person who calls him Light Bringer
is very important for him somehow

311
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,600
He's important enough that

312
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
When the truth starts coming out,

313
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
It's the first person he thinks of. Here, got it.

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Milo Dodds.

315
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,300
Thank you.

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,300
You've been writing to Jenkins for years.

317
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,100
In fact,

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,100
You've written more letters than anyone.

319
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,200
We counted.

320
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,700
Is that illegal?

321
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,100
What do you know about the Copycat?

322
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,500
It's on the news.

323
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,500
That's an evasion.

324
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
He's hiding something.

325
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,800
Oh, yeah, and what are you hiding, Milo, hm?

326
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,800
Is it a woman?

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,900
Is it Camille Halpern?

328
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,300
The mother of a two-year-old little boy?

329
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,700
I'm not hiding anything.

330
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,600
That's a masking smile.

331
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,000
That's bad, that is.

332
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,100
So, tell me this.

333
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,900
What's your favorite part?

334
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,300
Is it the sizzle of the acid
as you pour it into her eyes?

335
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,900
Or is it the blood

336
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,100
Dripping down her cheek?

337
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,700
Blood, you like that?

338
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Blood flowing? Blood?

339
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,200
I didn't do anything.

340
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,100
Where is she?

341
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,400
I don't know. You sick

342
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Son of a...

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
Where is she? Where?! Where?! I don't know!

344
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,800
Whoa! Whoa! No!

345
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,700
In the room, in the room, in the room, in the room.

346
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,100
What room?

347
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,800
I didn't take her--

348
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,900
I just cut out the article.

349
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm a Collector.

350
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,100
Work with me, Milo.

351
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,000
- Come on, work with me!
- I didn't do it.

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
He's not the guy, let him go.

353
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Hey! Hey!

354
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Three

355
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
He's not the guy! Aah!

356
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,500
Two... Let him go!

357
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,100
Look. Look, look, look.

358
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,500
One... Look, look.

359
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
What the hell?

360
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,700
He's a Hemo-Phobe.

361
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,100
He...

362
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,500
He's afraid of blood.

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
And how would you know that?

364
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,200
When you started talking
about blood, he got woozy.

365
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,100
He... He got short of breath.

366
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,600
He's not the guy.

367
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
He couldn't even give the girl a paper cut.

368
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,600
So another dead end.

369
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,100
Well...

370
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,500
No, not exactly.

371
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Well, Milo Dodds didn't work out.

372
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,000
Is he gonna bring him here
and go through his sicko Memorabilia.

373
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,100
Hopefully, we'll find some new suspects.

374
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,900
Well, Jenkins is amazing.

375
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,600
You know, in-in kind of an Evil way.

376
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,300
I mean, he's, like, Dark Lightman.

377
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,700
Ooh, rewind.

378
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There.

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,300
Look at how he's folding the laundry.

380
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,500
Jenkins comes up, and he slows down.

381
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,300
He's concentrating too hard,
it's a dead giveaway.

382
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,700
He did screw up.

383
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,300
Couple of months ago,
you wouldn't have noticed that.

384
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,510
But now that you apparently
know everything you think.

385
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,400
It's more important to prove that I screwed up
than find a missing woman, is that it?

386
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
No, I wasn't trying... 
We-we were just trying to establish

387
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
A baseline for Jenkins.

388
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah, well, forget it.

389
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,900
Can you go back? Run it back?

390
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,900
Push in on the Guard.

391
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,600
All right.

392
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,100
Zoom in.

393
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
And let it play.

394
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
...What I know about my friend, the Copycat.

395
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,300
You see the Nostril flare?

396
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,800
Quick intake of breath.

397
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
When he thought Jenkins was gonna
open up about the Copycat

398
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,700
He panicked.

399
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,000
Like he was afraid of getting caught.

400
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
The Guard's the Copycat.

401
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,300
Could he have gotten to Camille before you?

402
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,800
Hey, where's the Guard?
Where's, uh, Calvo?

403
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,900
Oh, his shift ended a while ago.

404
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,000
They're here.

405
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,500
It's been 11 years since her attack,

406
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,100
And she's doing well now. Okay.

407
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
I can do this.

408
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,200
Okay, I just want you two to talk.

409
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,400
You know, maybe she can
help you remember something.

410
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,900
But don't push yourself.

411
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,700
Okay?

412
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,500
Okay. Okay.

413
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,700
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

414
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,500
Thanks for coming. Come on in. Sure.

415
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
Natalie.

416
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,400
Careful.

417
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,900
Uh, I want you to meet Michelle Russell
and her husband Paul.

418
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Hi.

419
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,700
Hi, Natalie.

420
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,500
You know, we can do this all day.

421
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,200
You know, it's over for you, Calvo,

422
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,900
You understand that, right?

423
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,900
So just tell me where Camille is, and I'll get

424
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,000
The D.A. to cut you a break.

425
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,300
It'll make me sick,

426
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,600
But I'll do it, for you.

427
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,100
It's a one-time offer, Calvo.

428
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,400
One time!

429
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey.

430
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,300
He's not your guy.

431
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,700
He's not your guy.

432
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,700
What the hell are you doing? He is the guy!

433
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,000
No, no. He-He showed shame.

434
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,500
Psychopaths never show shame.

435
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,200
Calvo called in sick four times in the last year.

436
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,400
And each time, the day after one
of the Copycat's victims was released.

437
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,300
And that's not a coincidence. No, no.

438
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,400
I think it's very important.

439
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
But he's not your guy.

440
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,100
It has to be him!

441
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Look, every time he takes another woman,

442
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,500
And every time a kid loses the mother
they once had and gets back a...

443
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,800
An empty shell, I think to myself,

444
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,900
"This is the last one. No more."

445
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,000
And every time, I've been wrong, but I know

446
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,800
I'm right about this. Okay.

447
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,300
Okay. Who did you lose? Who?

448
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,400
Did you lose your mum or...

449
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,300
What?

450
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,900
Did you... You lost someone? Hey. Hey.

451
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,300
Don't use that stuff with me, okay?

452
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,800
He is the guy!

453
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,500
Good news is, I think he can lead us to the rapist.

454
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,000
But you got to stop yelling at him.

455
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,600
Okay?

456
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,000
I appreciate you both making the time.

457
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Natalie needed to know that her life isn't over.

458
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,500
Oh, it helps Michelle, too.

459
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,135
Talking to other victims.

460
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Testifying at Jenkins' Parole hearing.

461
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,300
It's her way of fighting back.

462
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,700
She went to the Parole hearing?

463
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,100
That must have been tough.

464
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh, she handled it better than I did.

465
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,300
I took a shot at the guy.

466
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Oh, excuse me. Sure.

467
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,600
Where is she?

468
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,800
She's right here, to the right.

469
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,600
Okay. Um, she said there were
no sounds where she was kept.

470
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Nothing at all from the outside.

471
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,800
Like she was kept underground?

472
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,300
I'll let Agent Reynolds know that.

473
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,700
Okay, well, we're going to keep talking.
I'll try to get more.

474
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Thank you.

475
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,700
Tony, let me explain something to you, okay?

476
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,000
Dr. Lightman is the best friend
you have in the World right now.

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,600
He says that you're not the Copycat.

478
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,800
He says that you may be a victim, too.

479
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,700
Now, sit down.

480
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,100
Okay, now, Jenkins made you
deliver letters to the Copycat.

481
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,500
Am I right?

482
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
How?

483
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,400
Ok. The Copycat's victims.

484
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,400
Did he bribe you?

485
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,000
Did he threaten you?

486
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,700
So, he threatened you.

487
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,200
A shiv in the side?

488
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
Not now, Torres.

489
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,200
He threaten your family?

490
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I got two little girls, man.

491
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,900
You think you can match him, but you can't.

492
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,000
I was there. I saw him with you.

493
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,500
He's better than you.

494
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,600
Well, if he was better than me,

495
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,800
I wouldn't have been able to find you, would I?

496
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
And I can protect your family.

497
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,800
Whatever it takes.

498
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
All right, look, Calvo.

499
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
This is the girl he's got now.

500
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,700
You helped him take her.

501
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
Now, help us save her.

502
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
He gave me the letter.
He said if I didn't deliver it,

503
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,800
He'd come after my little girls.

504
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,100
So, you just did what he asked?

505
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,200
First, it was once in a while.

506
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,500
I would take the letter and put it underneath

507
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,300
The heavy trash can at Grant Park.

508
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,800
But I never see no one pick them up.

509
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,300
This is Reynolds.

510
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
I need a Surveillance Team.

511
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Hurry up! And then, suddenly...

512
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,500
Jenkins' Crime spree began all over again.

513
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,300
Those were my little girls, man.

514
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,700
I'm sorry.

515
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm sorry. Listen,

516
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,600
If you come through for us with this,

517
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,400
I'll put you and your whole family in
protective custody by the end of the day.

518
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,800
He gave me another letter today, man.

519
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
He gave you a letter today?

520
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,900
While you were here?

521
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,800
No, it couldn't be.
We were watching him every second.

522
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
There's no cameras in your bathroom, man.

523
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,100
That was hours ago.

524
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,500
I'm sorry.

525
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,100
Yeah, get a Unit over to Grant Park right now.

526
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,600
And if anybody even goes near
a trash can, you grab them.

527
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,000
You understand me?

528
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,900
Hey, Jenkins? Jenkins.

529
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
We got Calvo now.

530
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,000
We know about the letter.

531
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,500
So, we are going to find your little friend.

532
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,300
Good reading, that letter.

533
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,800
Might have mentioned a friend of yours.

534
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,000
Thank you.

535
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,500
Meeting Michelle,

536
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,200
It really helped.

537
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm glad.

538
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,300
You did some amazing work today, Natalie.

539
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,600
I'll visit you tomorrow, okay?

540
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,900
Can I give you a hug? Mm-hmm. Okay.

541
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,100
Thank you, Gillian.

542
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,300
Good night.

543
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,500
Hey!

544
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,500
No...

545
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,300
I d... I didn't see him.

546
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,800
Okay... He went that way. I just...

547
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,700
Ooh, you look good in black and blue.

548
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,900
Yeah, well, we're quite a pair.

549
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,200
Reynolds had a Team scour the area,

550
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,900
But he was gone

551
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,384
Jenkins was instructing him.

552
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:22,321
He was passing notes
through one of the Guards.

553
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,300
I told you I was going to Natalie's house
right outside the door to the Cube.

554
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,000
He must have heard us.

555
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,300
I'm sorry, love.

556
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,900
He wouldn't have gone this far
unless you were under his skin.

557
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,700
Not worth it.

558
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
You get hit, and it's okay?

559
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,200
I get hit, and suddenly,
it's time to throw in the towel?

560
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,600
You got to spend some time
with one of these victims.

561
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Then you tell me it's not worth it.

562
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,000
It's Torres.

563
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Hey.

564
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,200
Hey. How's Foster? Is she okay?

565
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,300
Well, yeah. She's okay.

566
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,400
Thank God.

567
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,900
So, I got an idea.

568
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,300
I want to bring in Michelle,

569
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,500
One of the victims that Foster's been working with.

570
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,000
Get her to talk to Jenkins.

571
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,900
Absolutely not.

572
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,300
Look, Jenkins gets off on the pain of his victims.

573
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,800
Maybe a face to face will get him excited,

574
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,700
Get him to give up something.

575
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,400
Oh, what? So you think that you can get
more out of him than I can?

576
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,900
You're pretty confident, aren't you?

577
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,100
Camille's got less than 11 hours
before this guy makes her feel sorry she's alive.

578
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,300
It's worth a shot.

579
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,100
He'll demolish you. Forget it.

580
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,400
Lightman just hung up on me.

581
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,600
He wouldn't even listen.

582
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,100
But I'm right.

583
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Hey, whatever you're thinking about doing, don't.

584
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
I need your help.

585
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,100
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

586
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,100
Andrew Jenkins.

587
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,300
I'm Ria Torres.

588
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,200
Lightman's little Protege.

589
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Has he given up on the game already?

590
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,700
He had another appointment.

591
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,900
But somebody else wanted to stop by.

592
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,400
Remember me?

593
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,400
Number 12.

594
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,300
Pink scrubs.

595
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,200
Does your boss know
you arranged this little reunion?

596
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,400
Yeah, he left it in a note
I found underneath the trash can.

597
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,800
Who is the Copycat?

598
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,900
You would have made a great nurse.

599
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,700
What's your mother's name?

600
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,800
What is this? What's happening in there?

601
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,300
It's Torres' idea.

602
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,500
She thought Jenkins might crack
if he was confronted with one of his victims.

603
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,200
And no, Lightman doesn't know about it.

604
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Is it working?

605
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,300
His Skin temperature is rising.

606
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,000
He's definitely aroused.

607
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,100
And that was totally not the right thing to say.

608
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,700
I should be on the other side of this glass.

609
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,100
She shouldn't be alone.

610
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,800
Who is the Copycat?

611
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't know.

612
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,300
Where did you spend your twelfth birthday?

613
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,600
You could have at least come up
with some different questions.

614
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,100
Keep going, Michelle.

615
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,300
Who is the Copycat?

616
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,400
Dr. Lightman.

617
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,100
Get out. Get out.

618
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,300
Ria, what's going on?

619
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,900
Daddy's home. Get out.

620
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,000
Now. All right.

621
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Michelle,

622
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm Cal Lightman.

623
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,200
I think what you're doing is very brave,

624
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,400
But I'm going to take over from here.

625
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,100
All right.

626
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,000
I told you not to... We've only got six hours.

627
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,200
What did I say? What did I say?!

628
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,700
What did I say?! I told you!

629
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,600
I told you not to do this!

630
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,400
She wanted to face him.

631
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,300
This has got nothing-- nothing-- 
to do with what she wants!

632
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,400
Do you hear me?!
Now, get back to work!

633
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,700
Get back to work!

634
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
Spicy, that one.

635
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,700
Now, the attack on my
Colleague was, uh, stupid.

636
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,500
Now, you played your hand.

637
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,700
Failed, by the way.

638
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,900
If at first you don't succeed,

639
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,700
Try, try again.

640
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,200
You know, he's still learning, that one.

641
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,100
But you're not just mad at me, are you?

642
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,400
Mmm. You're mad at her.

643
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,100
She showed you up.

644
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,100
No! No, no, no, no, no.
Whoa, no, no. We're good.

645
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,200
All good. All good.

646
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,300
The Copycat isn't copying anymore.

647
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,000
They found Camille Halpern.

648
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,900
She's dead.

649
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,600
The attack on Foster--

650
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,200
Was predictable.

651
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,700
I should have seen that coming.

652
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,300
Can't always be one step ahead.

653
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,300
Yeah, but I'm a man of Science.

654
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,500
Shouldn't have lost it like that.

655
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,100
You were trying to show off
for your little Protege.

656
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,300
Show you were still Number One.

657
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,000
But you got carried away, and...

658
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,500
Now she's walking all over you.

659
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,500
And I suppose your Protege
wouldn't act out like that, right?

660
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,200
He's comparing me to the Copycat.

661
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,600
Short leash.

662
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,800
That's the key.

663
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,400
When I first met Torres,

664
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,000
She was screening carry-ons
at the Airport for 12 bucks an hour.

665
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
Now barely four months later,
she's breaking up with me.

666
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,000
Maybe she likes me better.

667
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,300
No, I'm not talking about romance here.

668
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,600
This is the third phase
of the Mentor-Protege Relationship-Separation.

669
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Phase one-- Initiation,

670
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,500
Establishing shared interests.

671
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,700
Like falling in love.

672
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,000
Phase two's even better.

673
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,900
Mutual growth, high productivity.

674
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,400
Could go on for years.

675
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,300
And then one day,

676
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,200
The Protege surpasses the Mentor.

677
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,100
He closed.

678
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,700
Jenkins' heart rate is through the roof.

679
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,800
He's not a happy Camper.

680
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,200
Murder's all over the news.

681
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,200
He's even got a nickname.

682
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,100
He's the "Capital Killer."

683
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,400
He's more famous than you are now, so...

684
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,900
I should tell you,

685
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,000
Lightman asked me to get those photos made
when we first discovered that Camille was missing.

686
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
So Camille's not dead?

687
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,300
We don't know yet.

688
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,200
Lightman knew from the beginning
it was all a setup.

689
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
He planned the whole thing, all of it.

690
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Even letting Jenkins see through him at the prison.

691
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,600
Yeah, he set up a False Power Dynamic--

692
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,500
Build Jenkins' Confidence,

693
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,100
Lower his Defenses.

694
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Lightman played me, too.

695
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,800
He pushed me to disobey him,

696
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
'Cause he knew it would trigger Jenkins.

697
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,200
The long Con.

698
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
One of Lightman's favorite moves.

699
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,300
You knew?

700
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,800
No idea.

701
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,700
He is scary good.

702
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,600
Seems like I'm not the only one
going through a Breakup.

703
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,300
Too bad.

704
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,000
June would have been four years.

705
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,100
The fruit and flowers Anniversary.

706
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,200
He just gave us a time frame for the Initiation.

707
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,300
Well, thank you.

708
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,400
For what?

709
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,300
For what?!

710
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
The truth.

711
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:04,335
Hey Fanboy

712
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,100
I need to know if something big happened
in Jenkins' life, in June, four years ago.

713
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,700
Um, his Parole hearing.

714
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,200
I was there. I taped the whole thing.

715
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,200
Okay, I'm here at Andrew Jenkins'
first Parole hearing.

716
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,100
In just moments, Jenkins himself

717
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,800
Is going to walk into the room.

718
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,200
This is just weird.

719
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
I had to spend the day with him.

720
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
There's got to be something on this tape.

721
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,200
There's Michelle and her husband.

722
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,100
Can you imagine having to sit there and look
at the guy that did that to your wife?

723
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,300
That's Milo's Fan Club.

724
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,600
It has to be one of them.

725
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,800
Well, they might be working together as a Team.

726
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,100
Nice.

727
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,600
Go back.

728
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,000
Stop it there.

729
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,600
And on the husband.

730
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,000
And freeze it.

731
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,300
All right, Torres, what do you see?

732
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,000
Uh, something weird about
his anger towards Jenkins.

733
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,600
Yeah, onset's too fast.

734
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,800
What does that mean?

735
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,300
Real anger starts more slowly and then builds.

736
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,100
Fake anger has a more jagged onset.

737
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,900
Comes in stages.

738
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,000
And after the fake anger,

739
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
Adulation.

740
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,700
Oh, my God.

741
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,300
Husband's a Fan.

742
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,600
Do you know where Paul is?

743
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,500
He, um, he checks on his
empty listings every night.

744
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,200
He's a Real Estate Agent.

745
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,000
Can we, uh, can we have his addresses?

746
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,300
What's going on?

747
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,300
Paul Russell is not your husband's real name.

748
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,100
It's Leo Carter. He changed it
six years ago before you met.

749
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,300
I-I don't understand.

750
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,500
We found letters he wrote
to Andrew Jenkins in prison.

751
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
He wanted to tell him how much he hated him.

752
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,800
How he hurt me.

753
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,300
No. They were-- they were Fan letters.

754
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,600
From before you two even met.

755
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
That's not possible.

756
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,000
Michelle, we really... No.

757
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,900
He sought you out to be close to Jenkins,

758
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,000
And to be close to what Jenkins did to you.

759
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,700
So, um, so all those nights where he told me

760
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,700
That I should talk about-about what happened,

761
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,400
That it would help me, you're saying that he would...

762
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,600
He was enjoying it?

763
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,200
Michelle, you can help us find Camille.

764
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,400
In time.

765
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,300
The listings are in the
drawer next to the desk.

766
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,100
All right.

767
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,000
All right... Well, there's
over 20 houses here.

768
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,400
Have you got enough men
to get to all of them?

769
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,500
We only have to find the one.

770
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,400
Now Foster said underground, right?

771
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,100
That means the place
would have a basement

772
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,800
And an attached garage
so that he could drive right in.

773
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Houses shouldn't be too close together.

774
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,600
And he'd prefer a young, busy neighborhood.

775
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,000
The more going on, the less people notice.

776
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,600
63 Meadow Lane. McLean, Virginia.

777
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,800
Let's go.

778
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,700
It's all right. You're safe now.

779
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,369
Stop! Freeze!

780
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,300
Go home.

781
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,500
You used me.

782
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,900
You made it easy.

783
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,700
How did you know how to get to Jenkins?

784
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,100
In Prison, the first time I asked him

785
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,300
About the Copycat, he showed pride.

786
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,500
Also there was just the faintest hint of Anger.

787
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,100
So I knew he resented his Protege.

788
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,000
Right. The kind of thing only you would notice.

789
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,700
Yeah, well, I'm trying to teach you.

790
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
You let me think that Camille was dead.

791
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,100
Yeah, yeah, I did.

792
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,500
Couldn't afford anyone knowing that any part of this

793
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,800
Was a Con-- Jenkins would have read it.

794
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Reynolds knew.

795
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,500
Only about the photograph.

796
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,900
Are you jealous? Really?

797
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,600
How long till we break up for real?

798
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,500
Eons.

799
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,300
You've got loads to learn.

800
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,400
Hey.

801
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,600
This is my Assistant's notion of Whimsy.

802
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,300
Very cute.

803
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,500
Yeah?

804
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,900
Look, I just wanted to say thank you.

805
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,900
Hell of a job.

806
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,600
There's no Universal signal for gratitude.

807
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,000
Surprises some people.

808
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,300
Well, it's a good thing I can use my words.

809
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,200
Your Boss wants to put me on a retainer.

810
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,500
Well, even the Government
has a good idea once in a while

811
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,000
I'll make FBI cases my number one priority.

812
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,200
In exchange, they pay me handsomely

813
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,800
And give me full access to Federal Resources.

814
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,200
Well, good luck with that.

815
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,200
Including you.

816
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Excuse me?

817
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,700
They want me to have a man
with a gun around full time.

818
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,400
To protect the valuables, huh?

819
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,300
Guess I can't blame them.

820
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,600
I mean, you guys are a bunch of Scientist nerds

821
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,100
Running around poking your nose in people's faces--

822
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,600
Calling them Liars.

823
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,200
But I am not a Bodyguard.

824
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,400
I don't have anything like you in my toolbox.

825
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,100
And you're something that I clearly need.

826
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,700
Without you, we wouldn't have found
Camille Halpern in time.

827
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,600
Plus,

828
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,400
Foster could have been killed today.

829
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
I said yes.

830
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,800
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but I'm saying no.

831
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,200
No, you're not flattered.

832
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,700
You're angry.

833
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,000
But the decision's been made

834
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Above your pay grade, so...

835
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,000
Hey, hey.

836
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,600
Look, if this happens,
I work for the FBI. I don't work for you.

837
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,900
You actually believe that, don't you?

838
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,300
Welcome to the Lightman Group.
