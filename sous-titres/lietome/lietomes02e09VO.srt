00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,771
<i>the most powerful man
on the Las Vegas strip,</i>

6
00:00:15,854 --> 00:00:18,901
<i>the owner of the Nouveau

7
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:21,852
How are you?

8
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:23,696
<i>Let's meet the players.</i>

9
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:25,858
<i>First up is the lovely Poppy Wells.</i>

10
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,246
<i>Poppy brings a sizeable
chip stack and quite a view</i>

11

12
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,032
<i>And here comes the Russian playboy.</i>

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,341
I appreciate your help,
Mr. Tostevin.

14
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:40,853
I get paid for my services, kid.

15
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:42,632
No thanks required.

16
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,169
Get a good night's sleep.

17
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,497
The hard work starts tomorrow, OK?

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,524
<i>In his sixth final table appearance,</i>

19
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:55,060

23
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:29,454
<i>And last, but definitely not least,</i>

24
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:31,833
<i>the lone amateur to make it
to the final table,</i>

25
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,510
<i>the golden boy
from Evergreen park, Illinois.</i>

26
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,054
<i>Where's that, you ask?
No one knows.</i>

27
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,099
<i>This kid came out of nowhere
to sweep through the early rounds</i>

28
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,082
<i>in a merge as chip leader.</i>

29
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,355

Where is the guy?

33
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:06,221
Missing.

34
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:11,130
And you lot are the prime suspects
in his disappearance.

35
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,968
I'll be damned.

36
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,764
- Never thought I'd live to see it.
- See what?

37
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:22,975
The day they let Cal Lightman
back in Vegas.

If you don't cooperate fully
with Dr. Lightman,

43
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,439
you won't be at the final table
when we go live in 32 hours. You got it?

44
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:02,948
They're all yours.

45
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,967
Professional liars.

46
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:09,073
That's a treat.

47
00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:11,697
I think I'll start
with Jake first, actually.

48
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:14,778
I'd like to see his room,
meet the missis.

49
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,614
There is a time pressure here, and if
anyone from the final table is involved,

50
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,038
folks'll say the championship is rigged.
I could lose all to another casino.

51
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,954
- Worst case, I lose my gaming license.
- We can't have that, can we?

52
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:28,162
Here's the deal. You find Jake,
get him to the final table,

53
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,167
There's a half a million bonus
in it for you.

54
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:32,878
Why is he so important to you?

55
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:34,600
I just told you.

56
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:54,809
So what's the history
with these two?

57
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,921
Ellis had Lightman banned
from Vegas.

58
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:58,827
The entire city?

59
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,329
Cal won a lot of money
from some very important customers.

60
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:03,576
His scientific abilities
weren't considered sporting.

61
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:07,029
You ban somebody from an entire city,
that's personal.

62
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:10,866
Well, there may have been a situation
with Ellis' girlfriend at the time.

63
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,085
Vegas doesn't bring out
the best in Cal.

64
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,802
Keep an eye on him while we're here

65
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,215
and don't let him gamble, OK?

66
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,562
Why? So he won't win?

67
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:22,653
He wins at poker,
but it's no fun for him.

68
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,269
- What's his game?
- Roulette. Unpredictable,

69
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:26,775
purely driven by chance,

70
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,830
and the worst odds in the casino.

71
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,237
God, I miss this.

72
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,729
Think I'll put a bet on...

73
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:48,203
I did not bring you here
to indulge your bad habits,

74
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,247
and you will be stopped
if you try to leave.

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,293
- You don't want your mates to find out?
- It's Vegas. They already know.

76
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,502
But it's better for us
if you keep a low profile.

77
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,337
That's my cue.
I'll see you suckers later.

78
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,658
No. Where are you going?

79
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,704
A free private plane ride to Vegas.
My mama ain't raised no fool.

80
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:08,196
And as far as I can tell,
there's no crime here, so...

81
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,225
I brought you here to work.

82
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,728
Yeah, I'll work when there's
something for me to do.

83
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:15,351
But until then,
right now I'm feeling lucky, OK?

84
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:16,946
I'm not done with you yet.

85
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:19,916
Say it: "But I'm done with you."
Say it loud.

86
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:22,196
But I'm done with you.

87
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,938
Good.
Now, take this.

88
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,200
Put it all on double zero
on the roulette.

89
00:05:26,572 --> 00:05:27,785
- All of it?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:29,745
The whole thing?

91
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,747
Don't let Foster find out?

92
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,125
All right?

93
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,869
- Do you believe that guy?
- Let's go, Lightman.

94
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,302
Your husband is a star.

95
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,071
Jake would never just leave us.

96
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:48,486
He loves us.

97
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:49,886
Please find him.

98
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,810
I think you should call the police.

99
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,855
If you say that's necessary, but I think
you're qualified to find him yourself.

100
00:05:58,354 --> 00:05:59,900
This one told you not to, right?

101
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:03,112
Macey didn't think it was necessary
once I hired you.

102
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:04,613
Here's the thing.

103
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:08,534
He doesn't want the police involved
because you're husband's a commodity,

104
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,769
One he's put a lot of effort
into packaging.

105
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:12,716
He wants him back
at the final table, but

106
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,270
without the bad publicity.

107
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,792
He said the police
wouldn't take me seriously.

108
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,487
People wander off
in Vegas all the time,

109
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,337
he said.

110
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:22,098
Well, that bit's true...

111
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:23,340
too.

112
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,814
I just wanted us all to be clear
on our motives here.

113
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:33,340
There's a young man missing.

114
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:36,395
Let's focus on that and not on Ellis
or anything from the past.

115
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:40,107
One job in Vegas isn't going to turn me
back into an inveterate gambler.

116
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,251
Of course not.

117
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,069
But you have to understand the pull
that this town has on you.

118
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,321
- Things change.
- But people don't.

119
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,725
You're smothering.
There's no smothering in Vegas.

120
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,651
Tell me about the last time
you saw your husband.

121
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:55,061
Two nights ago.

122
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:59,501
He'd been running practice hands
for hours, and I was going to bed,

123
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,421
and he said he had to run to the lobby
and meet one of the other players.

124
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:04,270
That's it.

125
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,925
You're right. I don't think
your husband would leave on his own.

126
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,588
He loves us so much,
me and the baby.

127
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:12,181
Also, he loves this.

128
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,941
You are some of the best liars
in the world, right?

129
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,108
You have to be,
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

130
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:27,488
I've got to tell you up front,
it's not gonna be a fair fight.

131
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:30,449
You can dodge all you like,
but come down to it, I'm gonna win.

132
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:34,035
Just ask Mason what it's like
to tangle with me.

133
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:36,705
It used to be a lot more fun
in the old days, Cal.

134
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:40,292
In my experience, a young guy like this,
about to win a couple of million bucks,

135
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:43,981
either finding himself in God
or losing himself in a woman.

136
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,574
- Search the bunny ranch.
- The old-timer's got a point there.

137
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:50,929
I'll be right back.

138
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:54,936
Here.

139
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,740
- You are a winner, my friend.
- Nice work.

140
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,208
- It was double zero?
- Nah, I wasn't feeling that.

141
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,881
I put it on 14,
my mother's birthday.

142
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,903
I told you to put it all
on double zero.

143
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:06,915
So you'd rather lose with your number
than win with mine?

144
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,974
- Something like that.
- That makes no sense.

145
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,222
Go back, do it again.

146
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:14,639
Go on, buzz off.

147
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:20,886
Let's start with you.

148
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:24,753
What did you do?

149
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,214
The kid's no threat.
Why would I do anything to him?

150
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,968
An empty chair at the table
earns you an extra 500 grand,

151
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,723
plus a better shot to win.

152
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:35,013
Everyone here wins or loses
millions every day.

153
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:36,391
No big deal.

154
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,350
- Vas thinks he's unbeatable.
- I am.

155
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,193
How many investors do you have?

156
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,021
I don't need money
from other people to back me.

157
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:44,806
That's why I'm the best.

158
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:46,859
Yeah, even after 5 vodka tonics?

159
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:53,291
What does it say about you lot that

160
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,284
an Illinois farm boy

161
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,891
can come out here
with no experience,

162
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:59,114
no investors,

163
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,545
no craft, and slaughter you?

164
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,802
So I'm leaving work early,
maybe get a pedicure on the way home.

165
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:18,443
- It's good we're not in Vegas.
- I can catch up on my reading.

166
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,168
I have a date tonight.

167
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,769
A third date.

168
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:24,992
Come on.

169
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,463
Sorry, Doug.

170
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:29,756
With a girl?

171
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,287
A human girl?

172
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,201
You're so...

173
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,448
Not funny.

174
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:43,762
- Foster's sent us a video to score.
- One file shouldn't take too long.

175
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,946
I hope your date's patient.

176
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,350
You feeling a little
guilty there, Poppy?

177
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,543
Am I feeling guilty?

178
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:04,913
Or sad?

179
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,064
They're quite similar, aren't they?

180
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:10,192
Jake is my friend. Shouldn't I be
feeling sad that he's missing?

181
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,986
- What happened to him?
- Do you miss Vegas?

182
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,328
No, I lied.

183
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,338
Yeah, just a little bit.

184
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,793
- Don't tell anyone, right?
- You can trust me.

185
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:32,529
Tell me the truth.

186
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:34,967
Can't you see the truth?

187
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,580
You can't, can you?

188
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,639
You can't read me and you like that.
You like my poker face, Dr. Lightman?

189
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:45,162
The truth.

190
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,631
Jake's had 3 months to imagine playing
at this table and everything it means.

191
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,138
His life is gonna change.
He just wanted to talk to somebody,

192
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:53,797
somebody's who's gonna tell him
it's all gonna be OK.

193
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,696
He trusted you.

194
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,389
So I met him at a little place
down the strip,

195
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:01,618
made him feel better
for half an hour, and left.

196
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,105
How many times in the last 3 months
did you manipulate his confidence

197
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:07,243
in the guise of being his friend?

198
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,918
I wouldn't manipulate him.

199
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,881
Excellent. That's righteous indignation.
It's also total nonsense.

200
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:16,842
I think you worked him.

201
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,935
I think you'd do everything you could
to convince him that

202
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:22,913
winning was more of a curse
than a blessing to get an advantage

203
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,266
at the final table.

204
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:25,534
I mean...

205
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:27,894
It's brilliant,
as far as strategies go.

206
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,397
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

207
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:34,735
You had to. You needed me to trust you,
so you shared a half-truth.

208
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:39,376
A call just came in
to the production phone.

209
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,372
Go ahead, Bob.
Play it back.

210
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,189
<i>We have Jake Hartman.</i>

211
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,514
<i>We will return him for $2 million.</i>

212
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:50,737
<i>This is a very small amount of money
compared to what the casino earns.</i>

213
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,941
<i>We'd advise
that you not tell the police.</i>

214
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,088
<i>We will call back in 3 hours.</i>

215
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:57,855
Mrs. Hartman, kidnapping
makes this a federal case,

216
00:11:57,938 --> 00:12:01,412
and I've got the Las Vegas FBI
field office running at full speed.

217
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:03,401
Why would anyone take my husband?

218
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,812
Most likely it's someone who knows
that Mr. Ellis is willing to pay

219
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:08,435
to have Jake at the final table.

220
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,270
Mr. Ellis is going to pay?

221
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:12,493
2 million dollars?

222
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,829
The money is being bagged
as we speak.

223
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:17,242
And I'll be analyzing
the ransom call.

224
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:19,614
We're gonna find who did this.

225
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,782
We're gonna do everything
to get your husband back.

226
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:25,603
Where's Dr. Lightman?

227
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,459
Why $2 million?

228
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,140
I mean, Ellis is willing
to pay it, but

229
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,187
$2 million?

230
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,179
Is that rage?

231
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:53,105
But you're upset that Ellis is willing
to drop 2 million to get the kid back?

232
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:54,734
Is that it?

233
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:56,471
How long is this gonna take?

234
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,027
Me and my boys, we have
a club opening to get to.

235
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,691
All this guy cares about
is cash and parties.

236
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,156
- No respect for the game.
- That's not true.

237
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,810
I also care about fame.

238
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:08,261
And girls.
And, of course, vodka.

239
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:15,877
Go lose some money.
Go on, buzz off.

240
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,552
Hello, beautiful lady.

241
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:26,388
It'll never happen.

242
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,832
She's too good for you.

243
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,058
The way she walks,
she's too good for anyone.

244
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,838
That's not nice, poppy.

245
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,153
Nice isn't fun.

246
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:37,274
Look at that!
That's what we call a macro-expression.

247
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:40,176
She may as well stick her tongue
down his throat.

248
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,460
No, she wants something from him.

249
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:44,742
Well, maybe she's just
attracted to him.

250
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,992
You are such an innocent.

251
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,620
Tell me, this girl that you're dating,
Where do you take her?

252
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:52,426
Tonight, Luigi's.

253
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:55,031
Last week, Meridiana,
the week before that...

254
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:58,150
No, you're doing this all wrong.
How don't you know this?

255
00:13:58,432 --> 00:13:59,882
OK, I know a lot...

256
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:01,627
About dating.

257
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,343
You think you are getting
lucky tonight, don't you?

258
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:07,345
Well, you are not.

259
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,678
100 $ says she's dating you
for the 5-star food.

260
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,909
OK. If we're gonna bet,

261
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,165
I want your office for one week.

262
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,149
Well, in that case,
I want your ant farm.

263
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:25,201
It's a bet.

264
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,082
I'm letting Amadeo go.

265
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:35,520
No, don't do that.

266
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:38,391
The ransom call is loaded
with syntactical anomalies.

267
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:41,652
I'd expect more use of idiom
for 1 thing and it seems almost edited.

268
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:44,341
I think the person we're looking for
first language isn't English.

269
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:46,218
I'm getting nothing from him.

270
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,490
What are you getting

271
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:50,065
- from her, other than lust?
- Excuse me?

272
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:51,473
She's still a suspect.

273
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:55,143
She's the female equivalent
of roulette. And you like the view.

274
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,204
It's a very nice view.

275
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:00,593
You're smothering again.

276
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:05,116
Amadeo, wake up, wake up.

277
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,810
You can go.

278
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,528
Are you seriously keeping me here?

279
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,912
Yes. You should consider
that a compliment, mason.

280
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,949
- Adios, amigos.
- Adios.

281
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,582
I'm happy to stay near Ms. Foster.

282
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:19,393
Yeah, I'll bet you are.

283
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:21,586
The kidnappers just called
with the ransom drop.

284
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,170
All right, let's go.

285
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:43,147
That's our guy coming out
with the ransom money.

286
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:47,256
All right, the bag is in place.
Let me get a ready from everybody.

287
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,957
- <i>Ready.</i>
- <i>Ready.</i>

288
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:50,253
<i>Ready.</i>

289
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,708
Listen up. The kidnappers
will know notice

290
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,870
there's surveillance cameras
covering this whole area.

291
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,508
They'll have a strategy.

292
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,630
Keep your eyes open.
Stay focused.

293
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,518
Before I forget...

294
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,721
You're a big winner.
Congratulations.

295
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:09,968
- Double zero, right?
- Yeah, double zero.

296
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:14,063
What number did you bet on?

297
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:16,046
23.

298
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,010
Hey it's M. Jordan and L. James' number.
What do you want me to do?

299
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:20,744
I told you double zero.

300
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,899
Listen, do you not get
that I'm Mr. Lucky?

301
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:25,400
Do you want to lose?

302
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,403
You do not walk up to a roulette table
and just bet it on double zero.

303
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,863
You gotta feel it out.

304
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:30,981
Nonsense.

305
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,075
Well, this stack of money in my hand
says otherwise. Hold up.

306
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,663
What are Amadeo's boys doing here?

307
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,040
Yelling a taxi?

308
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,195
Oh, listen up.
I did some digging.

309
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:44,961
The day before Jake disappeared,
Amadeo switched rooms.

310
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,838
His new room
is right next to Jake's.

311
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,965
Amadeo's not involved in this.

312
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:53,094
It looks like you
just got played, doc.

313
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,963
These have gotta be
the dumbest kidnappers.

314
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,099
Move in, move in.

315
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,046
Get out of the cab!
Freeze! FBI!

316
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:06,701
Put your hands on the roof.
Turn around!

317
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:08,786
Put your hands on the roof!

318
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,859
Amadeo Valdez!

319
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:19,482
Open up!

320
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:21,662
Open up!

321
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:27,712
Put your hands up!

322
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:29,965
Put your hands where I can see them!

323
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,300
- Put your damn hands up.
- What is this?

324
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,826
You know what the hell this is.
Cuff him!

325
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,265
Why are you doing this?

326
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:08,882
What?

327
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,463
He's meticulous.

328
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:17,262
Footage of the other players.

329
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:19,324
He's been studying them.

330
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:21,933
Fixing onto us
to pick up the ransom?

331
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,127
You're not too swift.

332
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:38,711
- Who's in the next room?
- Jake. I told you that already.

333
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:41,882
Not that one.

334
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:43,621
That one.

335
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,725
You know what my
favorite poker phrase is?

336
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:49,597
I don't know.
All in? Open limp?

337
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:51,188
The nuts?

338
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:52,778
On tilt.

339
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:55,234
It's so expressive.

340
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:59,179
- You want a pull. It's Amadeo's.
- I don't drink.

341
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,224
Yeah, you do.

342
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,392
Only an amateur lets frustration
Interfere with his game theory.

343
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,595
You think?

344
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:07,769
Here.

345
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:09,854
Have a drink.

346
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,650
I insist.

347
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:20,181
That's right. It's water.

348
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,861
Oldest trick in the book.

349
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:24,045
But Amadeo sold you, didn't he?

350
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:26,767
- He's a liar.
- Yeah

351
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,289
He's a fantastic liar, actually.

352
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:32,588
When you thought he's partying next door
he's wearing noise-reduction headphones,

353
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,839
mapping out a strategy
for every possible hand.

354
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:38,676
Amadeo knows every play
at that final table inside and out.

355
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:41,554
But you're the one
he considers a threat.

356
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,097
Guess I'm flattered.

357
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,865
Fake drinking,
constant talk of partying.

358
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:48,021
Changing his room to torture you
with hideous music.

359
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,938
It's all calculated
to drive you nuts.

360
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:52,696
He wanted your tilt
at the final table.

361
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:55,408
But you tilted ahead of
schedule, didn't you?

362
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,654
So has Lightman broken down
the old man yet?

363
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,611
<i>No, but he will.</i>

364
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,242
Maybe I can be the hero
of the day, then.

365
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,260
This...

366
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,490
Was taken earlier this afternoon.

367
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,122
Watch Mason's hands.
Now you see the cell phone,

368
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,543
now you don't.

369
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,238
<i>And now you do again.</i>

370
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,977
Ta-da.

371
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,935
We've got it all on video.

372
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:34,899
You palmed Amadeo's cell phone & texted
his boys to pick up the ransom bag.

373
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:39,946
I'm not making it
to the final table, am I?

374
00:20:40,595 --> 00:20:42,088
No. Afraid not.

375
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:44,659
Come on, it was a prank.

376
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,903
I messed with Amadeo,
he messed with me.

377
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:51,153
You faked a kidnapping to give yourself
a leg up to win $8.5 million.

378
00:20:51,237 --> 00:20:53,487
That's not a prank. That's a crime.

379
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,180
It wasn't about the money,
though, was it?

380
00:20:58,264 --> 00:21:01,069
You didn't think that Amadeo deserved
to sit at the final table with you.

381
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,335
He's a punk. He doesn't take
the game seriously.

382
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:08,308
Well, that's what I thought, anyway.

383
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:11,076
He played this old gambler
but good, didn't he?

384
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,896
Who did you get
to make the ransom calls?

385
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,530
Some drunken tourist.

386
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:16,775
Gave him 1000 $.
People will do anything

387
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,569
for the almighty dollar
in this town.

388
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,624
I got a question for you.
It's a yes-or-no question.

389
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,437
Did you have anything to do
with Jake's disappearance?

390
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:28,642
No. 40 years ago that boy was me.

391
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:31,507
Hell, even I'm rooting for him.

392
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:35,316
Let's go, Mason. Come on.

393
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:41,513
Not to be smothering,

394
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,540
But are you OK?

395
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:48,051
- Why wouldn't I be?
- You've known Mason a long time.

396
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:50,179
No, I knew him a long time ago.

397
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:53,896
That's a completely different thing.

398
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:56,811
I mean,
he took a gamble and he lost.

399
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,076
His choice.

400
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:03,285
Speaking of gambles...

401
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:08,064
She's roulette.

402
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,567
Stay away.

403
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:21,905
- You enjoying the show?
- Very much.

404
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,661
Why this Ellis
is having you followed

405
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:27,776
because he doesn't want you
fleecing his big customers?

406
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,847
You really that good
at harpooning whales?

407
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,323
I used to be.

408
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:34,157
We should play sometime.

409
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:36,932
My guess is we already are.

410
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:41,686
If your friend Foster
as suspicious as you?

411
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:43,216
More so.

412
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,530
- She doesn't like me.
- Not at all.

413
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:49,701
She fears women like you
bring out the worst in me.

414
00:22:51,422 --> 00:22:52,322
Promise?

415
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:03,929
What is it?

416
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,499
I'm not quite sure.

417
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,469
Fancy a field trip?

418
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,764
Is your bodyguard still out there?

419
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:16,555
How you doing? You all right?

420
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:44,312
Do you still keep your ladies down
at the bar at the Nouveau Royale?

421
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:46,246
You do? How many you got?

422
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:48,258
I'll take 3.

423
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,344
Yeah. You send them up to,

424
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,370
The 28th floor.

425
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:56,839
There's a guy there.
He's in a gray suit and he's a meathead.

426
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:58,573
And just tell him that,

427
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:00,919
He's getting married tomorrow.

428
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:02,303
Yeah. How long?

429
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:05,683
Yeah, 15 minutes.
15 minutes, yeah.

430
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:08,532
That's good.
All right. Yeah, we'll talk.

431
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,515
All right, put it on my account.

432
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,509
What are we gonna do for 15 minutes?

433
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,190
You only take me to the best places.

434
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:44,162
The note with this address on it,
do you think it came from Jake?

435
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:46,035
I don't know. Do you?

436
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:49,542
Can we ever just have
a normal conversation?

437
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,749
Oh, God. What is that smell?

438
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:18,599
Oh, my god.

439
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:31,571
You got the note early this morning?

440
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,792
In your room?

441
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:34,532
And then you got some prostitutes

442
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,243
To cause a distraction so you could
sneak out of the hotel?

443
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,245
Kind of ingenious, don't you think?

444
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,163
Why can't you take it easy?
We're in Vegas.

445
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:44,876
I just think it's a bad idea
to antagonize Ellis.

446
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,335
Among other bad ideas.

447
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,003
I was happy to help.

448
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,297
She was.

449
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:55,399
- Dr. Foster, thank you for the call.
- Sure.

450
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:57,891
How was it with the ladies?
Was it good?

451
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,025
Is it Jake?

452
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:02,988
Abe.

453
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,276
It's Abe Tostevin.

454
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,653
He was the best poker coache
in the country.

455
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,280
- So what happened?
- He died.

456
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,059
Abe had a knack
for pissing people off.

457
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:20,189
A few years ago
Vegas became untenable.

458
00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:23,623
He worked with most of the greats
until he nosedived.

459
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,189
The question is, what's the connection
between Jake and Abe?

460
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:27,645
Maybe he was coaching Jake.

461
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:30,087
Abe wouldn't show his face
near the championship.

462
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,548
Well, in addition to Jake Hartman
being a missing person,

463
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,133
he's now also a murder suspect.

464
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:45,295
You cared about him.

465
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:48,064
He gave me the only advice
I ever needed.

466
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:50,445
T - O - T - T.

467
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,068
Tatas on the table.

468
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,377
Won me a lot of pots.

469
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,576
OK, now, look at the contraction

470
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,329
of the orbicularis oculi
pars lateralis.

471
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:05,131
With the smile,

472
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,958
there,

473
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,690
That's classic action unit 6.

474
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,395
She's so into me.

475
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:18,596
But, looking for someone
better to talk to. That's bad.

476
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:21,741
All right. Come here.

477
00:27:21,825 --> 00:27:24,725
I'll show you something
that'll blow your mind.

478
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:31,691
The lip lick.

479
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:35,287
The universal signal
For "I want you."

480
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:36,958
Case closed. I win.

481
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:41,117
I'm gonna let you in on one
of the true rules of womanhood.

482
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:42,627
Cool.

483
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:46,414
If a guy's boring you, like you want
to stick a fork in your eye boring,

484
00:27:47,194 --> 00:27:51,294
A good lip lick can rattle him enough
to change the conversation topic.

485
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:59,020
I was going on
about the herd mentality

486
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,095
In the Kenyan elk population.

487
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,836
I'm not getting your office
for a week

488
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:05,961
Nope.

489
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:10,290
Ingrid's not dating me,
she is dating my restaurant choices.

490
00:28:10,484 --> 00:28:11,484
Yep.

491
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:22,478
Treat them well.

492
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,047
Abe Tostevin is dead.

493
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,011
I thought that this was about Jake.

494
00:28:37,136 --> 00:28:38,194
Yeah, it is.

495
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,558
How'd you feel about
Abe being back in town?

496
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:41,843
I felt nothing.

497
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,012
I didn't know.

498
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,971
I met him once in Monte-Carlo.

499
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,431
You mean drunk?

500
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,184
- You ever see Abe and Jake together?
- No.

501
00:28:49,357 --> 00:28:51,856
But I saw Abe 2 days ago.
We had lunch together.

502
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,536
you could have told me that earlier.

503
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,900
- You didn't ask before.
- Anything else?

504
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,703
Your partner makes me
light in the head.

505
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,689
Well, I have to begin
my pregame ritual, so...

506
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:09,333
Why don't you come and have
blueberry pancakes with me?

507
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,356
You're not going anywhere. Sit down.

508
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,003
That's a bit naughty, isn't it?

509
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:20,296
Hitting on Foster here while
your girlfriend's sitting right there.

510
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,219
You two are
sleeping together, are you?

511
00:29:25,393 --> 00:29:27,392
Occasionally, but it
doesn't mean anything.

512
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,016
She sleeps with everyone.

513
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,975
This gets better and better.

514
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,394
This is not a sideshow.

515
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:33,566
Move on.

516
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:36,064
Oh, I get it.

517
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:39,668
I get it. You guys...
You are the best liars in the world.

518
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:41,307
Congratulations.
Terrific.

519
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:42,735
I'm bowled over.

520
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:44,887
Someone tell me something.

521
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,921
Vas and I, we have
a 10 grand prop bet

522
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:51,265
On whether he can get
your partner into bed.

523
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,665
Which is now off.

524
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:06,927
Arrest Poppy.

525
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,950
- For what?
- Murder.

526
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:12,350
You're joking.
He's joking.

527
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,233
Can I talk to you?

528
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,319
She's a murderer.
Arrest her.

529
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,731
You sure this isn't one of
your double zero bets?

530
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:20,104
Reynolds.

531
00:30:22,045 --> 00:30:24,560
All right, come on, stand up.

532
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:26,796
Put your hands behind your back.

533
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:30,925
You're under arrest
for the murder of Abe Tostevin.

534
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:40,655
you probably want to call a lawyer.

535
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,425
Of course, you wont be able
to make bail till Monday.

536
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,867
After the final table.

537
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,290
Cal, I know you're mad at me,
but don't do this.

538
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:49,223
Mad? What, should I be mad?

539
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,422
I know I'd be mad.

540
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:51,896
Are you gonna stop this?

541
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:54,810
You started it.
You're gonna have to stop it.

542
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:57,638
Fine.

543
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:58,986
Fine.

544
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:01,978
Jake wanted Macey to know he was OK,

545
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:05,196
But he didn't think it was safe
to call her, so he called my cell.

546
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:07,428
Truth at last. When?

547
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:10,019
An hour before we got together.

548
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:14,148
So I stopped a guy in the casino, told
him to take that note to the front desk.

549
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,250
To be delivered in the morning when you
planned to be with me, above suspicion

550
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:21,545
I was gonna tell you all about it
after the championship was over.

551
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,755
How thoughtful.

552
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,898
Why is Jake hiding?
What's he so afraid of?

553
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,301
No idea.

554
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,387
You seemed genuinely surprised
When you saw Abe's body.

555
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,769
Jake just said he saw
something awful.

556
00:31:32,894 --> 00:31:35,264
That's it. I didn't know it was Abe.

557
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:39,596
If Jake called from wherehe's holed up,
a trace will lead us right to him.

558
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,493
You let Jake's wife
carry on thinking

559
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:44,527
he was, what, dead or worse.

560
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,571
You really are a hawk with
a bunny rabbit

561
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,887
The golden boy missing
from the final table

562
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:52,422
That's worth at least
an extra $400,000.

563
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:55,621
I studied the numbers
and made my decision.

564
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,039
Same as always.

565
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,302
Jake? It's me, baby.
Let me in.

566
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,639
What are you doing?

567
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:16,112
It's all right now.

568
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:27,023
All right?

569
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,698
I just wanted it to be over.

570
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:33,494
Which part, the fame or the fortune?

571
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,608
As soon as I made the final table,
my life changed.

572
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,939
knowing you were about to win
$1.5 million,

573
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,323
that really sucks.

574
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,294
I didn't know who to trust.
Everyone's different.

575
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:46,068
Is that you talking
or is that Poppy?

576
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,583
I just want our old life back.

577
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,481
- I don't even know this Abe guy.
- But you knew where to find his body.

578
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:55,957
I stumbled across it.

579
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:58,851
Also you stumbled across
the trunk of his car?

580
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:04,636
You know we found
the murderer, right?

581
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:06,400
You did?

582
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:11,071
No, I lied.

583
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,991
When I lie, sometimes I do this.

584
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,310
You... When you lie,

585
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,762
You do this.

586
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,167
I think Poppy got close enough
to you to figure that out.

587
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,841
The others, I don't know, maybe.

588
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,405
That little move,
the right cards in your hand,

589
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,266
You could make, what?

590
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,260
8 and a half million?

591
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:35,451
That's why Abe was here.

592
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,573
To coach you, help you win.

593
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,189
I don't care what you think you know.
I'm not risking my family's safety.

594
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,233
And I don't know anybody named Abe.

595
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,573
Stay tuned for more of
the poker world championship...

596
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:51,749
All right, cut.

597
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:53,308
Excuse me.

598
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:55,435
Do it again.

599
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:58,202
If you wanted me in handcuffs,
You could have just asked.

600
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:00,607
We found Jake.

601
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:02,882
He was hiding out.

602
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:06,395
He saw Abe's murder.
He just got scared.

603
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,350
So, who did it?

604
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,503
What do you care?

605
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:12,630
It's nothing to you, right?

606
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:15,177
It turns out Jake
doesn't know who did it.

607
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:17,463
He just freaked out.
He...

608
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,350
His wife wants him to play
the final table.

609
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,518
But I don't think he'll budge.

610
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,368
I'd say too bad, but...

611
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:26,843
Poppy, you're up.

612
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:38,033
Stay tuned for more of
the poker world championship.

613
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:45,212
- What if she doesn't take the bait?
- She will.

614
00:34:45,337 --> 00:34:48,419
Maybe there's time for ben
To run to the casino while we wait.

615
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:51,391
So, the betting you two
have been doing,

616
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:52,766
You up or down?

617
00:34:54,512 --> 00:34:56,217
You think I didn't know?

618
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,971
Gillian, your {gotta
learn to embrace this town.

619
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,310
It was just a couple of
bets for old times' sake.

620
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:08,137
Vas.

621
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,042
It was you, wasn't it?

622
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:17,213
- What are you talking about?
- We had a deal.

623
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:19,545
You and me, first and second place

624
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,120
At the final table.

625
00:35:21,968 --> 00:35:23,268
The deal stands.

626
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:25,372
Not if you killed Abe.

627
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,875
<i>I told you he didn't know about us.</i>

628
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,543
<i>The bastard could read you
like a book.</i>

629
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:33,338
<i>Why do you think he asked you to lunch?
Old times' sake?</i>

630
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:35,047
<i>He cared about me.</i>

631
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:38,635
<i>He was coaching another player.
He wanted information.</i>

632
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,590
<i>- Are you really that stupid?
- Are you?</i>

633
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,935
<i>You just kill a man because you think
maybe he knows something?</i>

634
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,481
Yeah. Going to cost me $15 million.

635
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:52,232
You really did it?

636
00:35:52,928 --> 00:35:54,178
<i>You killed him?</i>

637
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,737
<i>Not me. One of my investors
from Moscow.</i>

638
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,656
I'm calling the police.

639
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:01,909
We're good.

640
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,831
She's in trouble.

641
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,216
Hold it right there, Vas!

642
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
Stop!

643
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:24,535
You hold it right there!

644
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:44,783
Have you had enough?

645
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,227
Stay still.

646
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,584
So how did you know she'd go there?

647
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:02,594
It was in her own best interest.

648
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:04,616
Some people don't change.

649
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:08,183
So you knew she had information.
And you still slept with her?

650
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:10,408
That's not why I slept with her.

651
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:11,923
You all right?

652
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,795
We're live in 2 hours.

653
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,180
Perfection, people.

654
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:19,111
Oi!

655
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,230
Ellis.

656
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:23,715
I want double.

657
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,785
My bonus for bringing Jake
to the final table, double it.

658
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,537
He says he's not showing up.

659
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,105
Oh, he'll show up.

660
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,165
Abe was killed by the Russian

661
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,518
and his mafia investors.

662
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Why?

663
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:38,755
'cause he was coaching Jake.

664
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,887
You already knew that, didn't you?

665
00:37:45,978 --> 00:37:48,528
That's why you brought
him back to town.

666
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,511
I paid for his ticket out.

667
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,960
Yeah. Yeah. And you paid
for mine, too.

668
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:55,415
Yet here I am, 'cause you need me.

669
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,184
Well, I didn't need Abe.

670
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,876
You didn't want him to coach Jake,
Just give him edge?

671
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:01,893
I don't get involved on that level.

672
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:04,229
Because the integrity
of the championship

673
00:38:04,354 --> 00:38:05,429
Is paramount.

674
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:06,604
Yes, it is.

675
00:38:07,228 --> 00:38:08,228
Oh. Right.

676
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:11,111
Golden boy from
evergreen park, Illinois,

677
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:12,811
wins the tournament.

678
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,569
Next year, every hayseed in America

679
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:17,044
is going to be plopping down
20 grand to enter.

680
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:19,463
I didn't bring Abe back to Vegas.

681
00:38:19,785 --> 00:38:21,985
See, you hired me as a lie expert,

682
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,900
And then you lied to me.

683
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:25,761
Double it.

684
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:35,135
Medium triple latte.

685
00:38:35,657 --> 00:38:36,563
Thanks.

686
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,831
How long you been watching that?

687
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:41,038
Not long.

688
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:45,294
I lied.

689
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,034
- She likes you.
- Nice try.

690
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,042
But I saw the lip lick.

691
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,406
Thetrue rule of womanhood.

692
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,817
Loker, there's no such thing
as true rule of womanhood.

693
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:00,092
I made it up.

694
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,633
You were doing that
really super-annoying

695
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,890
Smug guy thing.

696
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:06,165
I was pissed.

697
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:08,303
And I wanted the ant farm.

698
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:09,589
I am smug?

699
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:14,062
Well, how do I know
you're telling the truth now?

700
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:22,442
Not only is she laughing,
She's looking right into your eyes.

701
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,060
She's being polite.

702
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:29,035
This isn't being polite.

703
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,194
Her pupils were dilated.

704
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,231
Well, she did...

705
00:39:39,598 --> 00:39:40,616
Touch my knee

706
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,518
At one point.

707
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,459
So you think I should...
Call her and...

708
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,767
Definitely.

709
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,778
Crazy things happen in the desert,

710
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,487
And we've seen our fair share,

711
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,384
With our final table
already cut down from 5 players

712
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,783
to just 3.

713
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,027
<i>Let's get started
and introduce them to you.</i>

714
00:40:15,152 --> 00:40:16,619
<i>It's not easy being leader,</i>

715
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:18,682
<i>And that's true of our
current chip leader,</i>

716
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,865
<i>The lone amateur
at this final table.</i>

717
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,677
<i>The golden boy from
evergreen park, Illinois.</i>

718
00:40:24,348 --> 00:40:26,804
<i>Where's that, you ask?</i>
No one knows.

719
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:29,140
This kid came out of nowhere{\to
sweep through the early rounds}...

720
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:30,265
Hey, Ben.

721
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,553
Hey.

722
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,598
Hey, wow. You...

723
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,590
- You look great.
- Yeah, you, too. I mean...

724
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:41,820
The dress, the shoes,
the whole thing.

725
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:42,945
Lovely.

726
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:45,067
I thought I should
embrace the Vegas.

727
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,986
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Jake Hartman!</i>

728
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:08,132
I'm not letting you
spend your last night here,

729
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,043
Looking like that,
watching other people play poker.

730
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,761
I'm not interested in gambling.

731
00:41:13,024 --> 00:41:15,514
Do you really think that that's
all this town has to offer?

732
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:18,266
Just wait and see.
I'm gonna blow your mind.

733
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,099
I'm gonna go get the car
and I'll met you out front.

734
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:30,304
First-class service
for you all the way.

735
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:31,469
Just for you.

736
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:32,661
And now,

737
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,532
The 23rd poker world championship...

738
00:41:35,657 --> 00:41:37,156
Shuffle up and deal!

739
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,855
- How you doin', Gordie?
- Living the life, Dr. Lightman.

740
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,519
I'm told you got a one-night
pass to the casino.

741
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,444
One million dollars
compliments of Mr. Ellis.

742
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:21,702
All of it on double zero.

743
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,214
Hi, Foster.
