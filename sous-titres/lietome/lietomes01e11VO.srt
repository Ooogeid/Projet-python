1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,600
You good with that, old man?

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,910
So anyway, last night, went to a movie.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,530
We went to this, like, uh, little Italian
joint, had some drinks, whatnot. It was nice.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,120
- This that polish girl?
- No, she's Czech. Her family's Czech. She's nice.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,930
We connect, you know, emotionally.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,800
- And otherwise, too.
- Otherwise.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,960
- I remember otherwise.
- Yeah? How long you been divorced?

8
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,290
- Six years?
- Seven years.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,400
Best years of my life.

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,580
It's a red backpack.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,450
That's him.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,440
police department! Hold it!

13
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,960
Metro police! Open the door now!

14
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,170
I'm going around back!

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,980
- Hold it!
- Hold it right there! Stop!

16
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,780
Come here.

17
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,230
- did you hear it?
- Roof.

18
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,110
Go.

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,010
Come out! And put your
hands where we can see them!

20
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,270
Hold it!

21
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,050
I'm gonna go check on
him. You call it in.

22
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,100
- Call it in, all right?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,860
Okay.

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,920
Thanks for dinner, cal.

25
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,280
Oh, uh, sure.

26
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,250
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

27
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,830
Don't wait up. I'll be
at work till midnight.

28
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,180
See ya.

29
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,210
- You got a work night?
- Yeah. Deputy director's in Jakarta.

30
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,770
Um, it's 9:30 in the morning there.

31
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,100
All our clocks run on his time.

32
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,790
Oh, that sucks.

33
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,820
Still looking for your glasses?

34
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,010
Yeah, I can't believe they weren't in the
restaurant. I thought I brought them with me.

35
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,360
- See you.Must be at home.
- See U.

36
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,390
Take care. Bye.

37
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,670
Hey, Alec.

38
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,620
Uh, waiter gave me those.

39
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,930
Oh, thanks.

40
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,590
Hello.

41
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,700
This is, uh, Christine tackett.

42
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,590
Uh, cal Lightman. I
work with Alec's wife.

43
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,050
You're state department?

44
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,050
No, no, just a friend.

45
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,900
Well, it's nice to meet you.

46
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,360
- You, too.
- Thanks.

47
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,530
Might want to invest in a spare pair.

48
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,430
those cops are criminals!

49
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,380
They shot that boy in cold blood!

50
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,920
They need to be charged!

51
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,230
- Are we gonna let these police kill our young men?
- No!

52
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,520
- Are we gonna let these cops kill our young men?
- No!

53
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,120
No! No! No! No! No! No!

54
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,290
I didn't realize we had a night shift.

55
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,930
This is about the kid who got shot?

56
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,810
Dr. Lightman. I'm Corey strong.
I'm from the mayor's office.

57
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,640
He's sorry that he
couldn't come down here.

58
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,850
Off the sidewalk.

59
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,820
Hell with that! We ain't going nowhere!

60
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,180
Let's move inside.

61
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,090
No justice, no peace!

62
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,160
No justice, no peace!

63
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,050
Eric Kuransky.

64
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,300
Adam Duke.

65
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,220
They're detectives in
the eighth district.

66
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,290
- Decorated detectives.
- Thank you, captain hoopes.

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,200
Anyway, they were chasing a drug dealer up on the
roof when they found this kid named Andre Ricks.

68
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,210
Now Andre's in the hospital with
two gunshot wounds and a broken back.

69
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,740
Now, Duke and Kuransky say
Andre was pointing a gun at them.

70
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,430
Yeah, because he did.

71
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,300
You were there?

72
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,530
No, but I trust my men.

73
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,010
That's nice.

74
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,130
Andre's father says these two are lying,
and that his son never even owned a gun.

75
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,370
Right, and of course we
should trust the kid's father.

76
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,640
Maybe we should.

77
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,750
Was a gun found at the scene?

78
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,340
Yeah, in the alley a few
feet from where Andre fell.

79
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,460
And it wasn't planted
there; it was the kid's gun.

80
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,180
You got your head up your ass.

81
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,380
Excuse me?

82
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,540
You've got your head up your ass.

83
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,370
Great.

84
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,520
Mayor brings in a guy to investigate,
and he's already on your side.

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,080
No, he's got his head up his ass, too.

86
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,080
'Cause only three people know
what happened on that roof:

87
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,170
The ones who were there.So excuse us.

88
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,010
We're gonna talk to someone useful.

89
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,110
I've been on the job, uh, four years.

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,430
Made detective a year ago march.

91
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,790
Yeah?

92
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,170
I never fired my gun at a person before.

93
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,130
First time for everything.

94
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,000
How you feeling? You look pretty calm.

95
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,640
I guess it's not real yet.

96
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,710
Eight years on a homicide
squad in St. Louis.

97
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,220
Four years in narcotics before that.

98
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,520
This was a good shoot.

99
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,240
You ask what you got to, but I'm
telling you, there's nothing wrong here.

100
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,670
Eric went out the door first. I was...

101
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,300
sorry, no. That's not right.

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,490
I went out first. Eric followed me.

103
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,860
Did you identify yourselves?

104
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,780
Absolutely, no question.

105
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,100
When did you first see the gun?

106
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,440
Uh, as soon as the kid stepped out.

107
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,720
How far away from Ricks were you?

108
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,500
Maybe ten feet.

109
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,850
So how far?

110
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,170
14, 15 feet away.

111
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,630
Sure about that, right?

112
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,250
I know where I was.

113
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,420
I'm sure you do. How far is it
from your bathroom to your bedroom?

114
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,000
20 feet.

115
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,220
Hear that pause?

116
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,940
He had to think to measure a
distance that he walks every day.

117
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,440
Yet, when I asked him about how far
he was from Andre Ricks, no pause.

118
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,510
He prepared his answer. Look at this.

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,620
- Did you plant the gun on Andre Ricks?
- Excuse me?

120
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,400
Did I plant the gun? No. No, I did not.

121
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,680
Look, he said he didn't
do it. What's the problem?

122
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,450
Soft voice.

123
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,650
It drops away when you lack confidence
in what you're saying. He's lying.

124
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,610
These cops are not lying.

125
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,840
Oh, you're half right.

126
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,490
I don't understand.
You just said they were.

127
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,620
I said this cop's lying. This one isn't.

128
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,660
As far as we could tell,
Adam Duke didn't lie once.

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
But they're telling the same story.

130
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,330
So how can one be lying and
one be telling the truth?

131
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,960
I can't tell you that yet, but what I can
tell you is whatever happened up on that roof

132
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,310
is not what you guys think.

133
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,550
Get those interviews uploaded.

134
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,630
Fine. Night.

135
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,520
stay with him.

136
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,800
What time is it?

137
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,560
Mm, a little past 3:00.

138
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,690
I'm sorry I had to take off earlier.

139
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,710
Lightman doesn't
believe in office hours.

140
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,630
It's okay. Hope you don't mind I stayed.

141
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,980
No. Glad you did.

142
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,910
I need a shower.

143
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,830
You know, I could, uh, make sure
you don't slip or fall in there.

144
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, somebody called. They, uh,
left a message. I didn't pick up.

145
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,180
Can you play the machine?

146
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,750
Uh, hey, it's me.

147
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,640
- Loker?
- Couldn't sleep. I thought you might be awake.

148
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,730
okay, sorry.

149
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,590
- What's that about?
- See you at work.

150
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,800
He's a little freaked out.

151
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,250
He did something bad at work.

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,970
And then he lied to our boss about it.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,620
- And now I am his therapist.
- Wait.

154
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:58,220
So he did something that could get
him fired and told you all about it?

155
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,830
He was scared.

156
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,760
He made you a part of his mess?

157
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,140
He just needed to talk to somebody.

158
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,420
I mean, isn't that what friends do?

159
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,700
Confide in each other?

160
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,550
You know what a real friend
does when he's got a secret?

161
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,490
He keeps his mouth shut.

162
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,270
So do you have secrets
you're not telling me?

163
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,710
Lots.

164
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,190
Because I... am a very good friend.

165
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,070
I was really hoping there would
be some clarity by this morning

166
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,770
we're still trying to figure out
what these men are telling us.

167
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,720
Kuransky looks like he's lying.

168
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,140
But he's also highly emotional.

169
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,010
I've seen fear, anxiety, some paranoia.

170
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,100
Which means...?

171
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,640
He could be suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder.

172
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,820
You want to tell me how?
Because he didn't fire his gun.

173
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,930
It can be brought on by repeated
exposure to violent events.

174
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,220
If he's been a cop for over ten
years, I mean, he's seen a lot.

175
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,070
Okay, so if he's got PTSD,
does that mean he's not lying?

176
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,120
Nope. We need to establish a baseline.

177
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,560
I want to see what these guys look
like when they're not stressed.

178
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,160
I want to see their service records, and
I want video of them interviewing suspects.

179
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,880
I don't have time for
a psychological study.

180
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,310
What I needed was an answer.

181
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,280
Thanks for your help.

182
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,120
I heard there was another anti-police
demonstration in the eighth ward.

183
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,980
- How many arrested?
- Eighteen.

184
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,440
- How many ended up in hospital?
- Four.

185
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,420
All right. You give us what we
want, we'll get you the truth.

186
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,040
It's the only way to stop more
people getting hurt, right?

187
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,360
Fine.

188
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,730
Look, there's a simple answer.

189
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,930
Duke is telling the truth.
Kid pulled a gun on him.

190
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,270
Kuransky's lying to back up his partner.

191
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,950
No. That doesn't explain
why Kuransky is so agitated.

192
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,180
There's something
else going on with him.

193
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,690
Hey, it's time for that staff meeting.

194
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,870
- That's yours.
- No, actually, it's yours.

195
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,210
Wait. Since when do
we have staff meetings?

196
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,910
Uh, let's not spend too much
time on this. We're being sued.

197
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,680
Some of you worked on
the Joseph Hollin case.

198
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,100
He was the banker whose daughter ran a
ponzi scheme with his investors' money.

199
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,540
They're suing everybody that was involved
in the failed attempt to recover his assets,

200
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,830
and that includes us.

201
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,170
So, our lawyer is going to want
to talk to you individually.

202
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,870
The damages could run into hundreds of
millions, which I don't happen to have,

203
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,910
so do your best to answer the questions
as truthfully as possible. All right?

204
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,530
Come here. Come here.

205
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,040
You know how to lie
to the lawyer, right?

206
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,830
What do you mean?

207
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,300
Don't answer too quickly.

208
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,000
Short response time,
that's a dead giveaway.

209
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,760
And, uh, remember something that
you got wrong. Correct yourself.

210
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,640
Don't look him in the eye too much.

211
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,580
Include irrelevant details.

212
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,370
And if you feel nervous,
take a couple of these.

213
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,260
Muscle relaxants?

214
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,540
Lawyer should be pretty easy to beat, but u never
know if Lightman's going to look at the tape.

215
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,940
I-I-I cannot believe you are
asking me to cover for you, loker.

216
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,570
You're the one who blew the
Hollin case. You lied about it.

217
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,830
You're the reason we're being sued.

218
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,600
It's not just about me.

219
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,340
If what I did gets out,
Lightman is in serious trouble.

220
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,090
The investors will bankrupt him, and
they'll turn this place into a day spa.

221
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,880
So I shouldn't lie to save your ass.
I should lie to save the company.

222
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,430
Sarcasm aside, yes.

223
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,490
You haven't been lying long enough
for you to be any good at it.

224
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,490
Mr. Ricks.

225
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,000
What was Andre doing on the roof?

226
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,050
He goes up there to smoke cigarettes.

227
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,230
I don't allow it in the
house, so he goes outside.

228
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,950
Sometimes he ends up on that roof.

229
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,460
He likes it up there because
you can see the river.

230
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,890
You're his brother, right?

231
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,880
Antwon.

232
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,200
How you doing, Antwon?

233
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,820
- Something you want to tell us?
- No.

234
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,970
Well, the idea that Andre just pointed
a gun at somebody, it's ridiculous.

235
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,710
I mean, that boy never
held a gun in his life.

236
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,090
I think Antwon would
disagree with you there.

237
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,450
Wouldn't you, eh?

238
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,610
What are you talking about?

239
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,120
You got something you're
trying not to tell us?

240
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,810
If you know something, say it.

241
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,890
He had a gun.

242
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,650
He was getting jumped by
the conlin terrace crew.

243
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,660
He got scared.

244
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,040
So he got a gun to protect himself.

245
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,250
Just because Andre had a gun doesn't
mean he pointed it at Kuransky and Duke.

246
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,150
Yeah, well, we can't
dismiss the possibility.

247
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,690
We need to talk to Andre.

248
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,770
Well, is there any chance
of that happening soon?

249
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,900
No. He's unconscious.

250
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,170
Uh, how's it going with the detectives?

251
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,560
I've been looking over
months of suspect interviews.

252
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,120
Kuransky is lying everywhere.

253
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,240
Places he's been, cases he's worked.

254
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,770
Also, his anxiety when he
talked about the shooting...

255
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,600
that wasn't from PTSD.

256
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,990
Okay.

257
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,660
There's definitely something
going on with this guy.

258
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,270
I just don't know what it is.

259
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,350
All right, well, keep digging. I'll
be back as soon as possible, all right?

260
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,600
Dr. Lightman.

261
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,110
Special agent Owen
finnegan with the FBI.

262
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,230
We need to talk. Please get in the car.

263
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,220
- Why?
- I'll explain shortly. Please get in the car.

264
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,050
Am I under arrest?

265
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,890
No, but I am authorized to compel you should
you not choose to accompany us voluntarily.

266
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,110
Please get in the car, sir.

267
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,460
Dr. Lightman, you were given access to top
secret material when you were consulting with CIA.

268
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,350
So I'm going to trust you with some
information that you shouldn't have.

269
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,600
Sit down.

270
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,930
You know special agent Kuransky?

271
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,400
Ah, you see, I knew there
was something wrong with you.

272
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,310
Kuransky is one of several special agents
undercover in the metro police department.

273
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,070
Why?

274
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,880
We believe a small group of terrorists
have infiltrated law enforcement in dc.

275
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,700
There's a network of sleepers, individuals
linked to al qaeda inside the police force,

276
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,440
who are helping to plan a strike.

277
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,800
Adam Duke is a member of this network.

278
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,130
His real name is adamat
duka. He's Albanian by birth.

279
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,640
And as you may know, al qaeda is believed to funnel
money through groups in Macedonia and Albania.

280
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,760
He says he changed his name to break
with his family, but that's not true.

281
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,710
He's still in contact with
relatives back home.

282
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,090
We estimate three to five sleepers
like Duke are inside the police force.

283
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,040
That's why he hasn't been arrested yet.

284
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,130
We want Duke to identify the others.

285
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,280
I've been partnered with
Duke for 16 months.

286
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,320
I am inside his head.
I will get those names.

287
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,170
- What's your source?
- We can't tell you that.

288
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,710
- What's the target?
- We can't tell you that.

289
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,250
But we do believe it will happen
soon, very soon if we don't intervene.

290
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,860
That's why you got to
back off the Ricks case.

291
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,680
Everyone in the department
knows you're looking at me and Duke.

292
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,790
If the other sleepers think you're on to
who Duke really is, they will kill him.

293
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,000
Then we have nothing.

294
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,540
If Andre Ricks
recovers--if--

295
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,530
he could go to jail for a
crime he may not have committed.

296
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,490
And you're telling me to back off because of
a terror threat that you won't even describe.

297
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,910
- It's a bit of a joke, really.
- No, it's not.

298
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,590
This is real. These people want to
inflict major casualties on this city.

299
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,700
And if that happens because you got in
the way, that's gonna be on your head.

300
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,810
Right, I've got a question for you.

301
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,910
Did Andre Ricks have a gun in his hand

302
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,550
when Adam Duke shot him?

303
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,310
I told you that already.

304
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,920
Ye that shoot was good.

305
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,130
You see, there's the problem.

306
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,200
You're still lying.

307
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,560
I'll see myself out.

308
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,360
You know, the fact that
Kuransky is undercover could explain

309
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,280
why he appears to be
lying about the shooting.

310
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,880
How?

311
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,990
Well, sometimes undercover cops can
develop symptoms of dissociation.

312
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,240
I mean, pretending to be somebody else
can make them anxious and paranoid.

313
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,820
And it could look like they're lying
even if they're telling the truth.

314
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,040
Yeah, maybe he's just a bad liar.

315
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,770
I think we should keep digging.

316
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,710
I don't think we should be
pushing it on this one.

317
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,400
- What, are you FBI now?
- No.If they're trying to stop a terrorist cell,

318
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,280
then, yeah, I want to be
careful about getting in the way.

319
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,880
"National security" is
just their favorite bogeyman.

320
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,280
This whole sleeper
cell thing smells fake to me.

321
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,340
Not every threat is a lie.

322
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,850
You know, a plane flew into the
pentagon. My husband was there.

323
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,120
I remember that day, cal.

324
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,170
And I would do almost anything to
prevent that from happening again.

325
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,090
Well, I'll tell that to Andre Ricks.
I'm sure he'll feel the same way.

326
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,390
- That is not fair.
- Not fair to him.

327
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,450
You can't take the
government at their word.

328
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,470
Unless they're right.

329
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,750
And if an attack is really being
planned, then everybody's at risk.

330
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,620
it's Torres.

331
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,120
A gas station in
anacostia got robbed last year.

332
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,530
This image was released by
metro police from the security camera.

333
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,750
Recognize the face?

334
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,550
Andre robbed a store?

335
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,440
Yeah, I guess he had a
gun and knew how to use it.

336
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,410
- Get that cleaned up.
- Yeah.

337
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,210
Hey, a paralegal's looking for you.

338
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,300
- I think the lawyer wants to talk to you.
- Now?

339
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,280
Yeah, I guess so.

340
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,800
I will just be a minute.

341
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,330
Oh, I'm wexler, by
the way. Martin wexler.

342
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,420
Do you need to swear
me in before we start?

343
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,050
No, no.

344
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,470
- This, uh, this isn't a formal deposition.
- Okay.

345
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,260
Uh, will there be one later?

346
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,320
Not necessarily.

347
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,510
Depends on what you say.

348
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,070
Do you have a problem with that?

349
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,940
No, no.

350
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,110
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

351
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,450
Listen... ria.

352
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,580
I'm just here for the facts.

353
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,620
You give me the truth, we're good.

354
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,190
If you don't, we're not.

355
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,400
It's really that simple.
Do you understand?

356
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,930
There's no problem.

357
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,410
You cleaning this up?

358
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,720
Yeah, already doing it.

359
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,990
All right, then blow it up. And again.

360
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,190
- That's the kid the cops shot.
- Yep. Yes, it is.

361
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,560
It's an interesting case.

362
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

363
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,180
You can talk less.

364
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,850
What do you see?

365
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,610
nothing.

366
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,850
Exactly.

367
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,880
No contempt, no fear, not even
pleasure. That's a face at rest.

368
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,230
Doesn't look like the face
of someone robbing a store, is it?

369
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,750
Cops photoshopped Andre's
face on someone else's body?

370
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,490
They're framing him?

371
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,020
Nah, it's not the cops this time.

372
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,680
That's done with some
very good equipment.

373
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,210
That looks like the FBI to me.

374
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,350
Cal! Good god. Could
your posture get any worse?

375
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,300
You're a walking question mark.

376
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,760
How's tRicks at the CIA?

377
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,170
Less amusing since you stopped coming by.

378
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,870
I miss your special
gift for pissing people off.

379
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,060
So... what's so important we
had to meet right away?

380
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,960
The FBI said there's terrorists inside
the dc police department. Is that true?

381
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,480
Why would you want to ask about that?

382
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,230
'Cause I think they're trying to frame
a kid to shut down an investigation.

383
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,160
Is this the kid that
got shot by the two cops?

384
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,430
Yeah.

385
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,640
Who's trying to frame him?

386
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,140
Special agent by the name of finnegan.

387
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,400
Falsified some evidence.

388
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,900
I know finnegan.

389
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,360
He's the straightest arrow in the quiver.

390
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,770
If somebody's
doctoring evidence, it isn't him.

391
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,090
What do you know about these sleepers?

392
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,160
Cal, you need to steer clear of this one.

393
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,410
You know better than to tell me that.

394
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,870
Why you so scared, Fletcher?

395
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,880
I read the intel. Threat is real.

396
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,400
This isn't hussein and his
disappearing weapons of mass destruction.

397
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,190
This is a network financed by
people who want to hit us hard.

398
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,900
Half of Langley's stocking up
on duct tape and plastic sheeting.

399
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,470
What's the target?

400
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,770
Theory is they're going
after government buildings.

401
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,480
State department, supreme
court, who knows?

402
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,090
Maybe the CIA.

403
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,020
So the FBI is telling the truth?

404
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,660
Sleepers inside the police department?

405
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,200
I don't know.

406
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,000
But what I do know is you
should stay out of it.

407
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,850
Whatever's gonna happen to this kid is nothing
compared to what could happen to this city.

408
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,630
People could get hurt,
cal. A lot of people.

409
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,960
Just to be clear,
you didn't like the fact that

410
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,730
your boss was making a
deal with Joseph Hollin.

411
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,680
Well, I thought it
was the wrong thing to do.

412
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,550
But that's not my call to
make. That's Dr. Foster'S.

413
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,530
Right, right.

414
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,110
And when exactly did you find out
that the deal had been blown up?

415
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,650
Tuesday M... uh, no,
sorry. Wednesday morning.

416
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,710
I saw it online just
before I came to work.

417
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,770
That was the first you heard of it?

418
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,270
- That's right.
- Yeah. Okay.

419
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,240
Did you blow up the deal?

420
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,480
No.

421
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,030
Did you go to the sec
against Dr. Foster's wishes?

422
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,740
No, I didn't.

423
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,330
You're a logical person. You already
admitted you didn't want it to happen.

424
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,770
Yeah, and the reason that you know
that is because I just told you.

425
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,750
Pretty stupid of me to do
that if I blew it up, isn't it?

426
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,520
Okay. Good. That's all I need.

427
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,230
- That's it?
- Yes. Thank you very much for your time.

428
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,890
All right, thank you.

429
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,050
- The income projections you asked for.
- Oh, yeah.

430
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,230
And you got a call from Corey
strong in the mayor's office.

431
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,050
Said he couldn't reach you on your cell.

432
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,860
That happens all the time.

433
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,990
- Stay in touch.
- I will. Thanks.

434
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,030
Who's that?

435
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,120
Just an acquaintance.

436
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,250
- Oh, yeah.
- Where have you been?

437
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,610
talking to a friend
about a terrorist threat.

438
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,810
He says it's real.

439
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,900
Oh, this could get complicated. I
just got a call from the hospital.

440
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,630
Andre Ricks is conscious, and
he's willing to talk.

441
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,280
All right.

442
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,810
still can't feel anything below my waist.

443
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,170
Doctors keep telling
me to wiggle my toes.

444
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Any luck?

445
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,450
- Not yet.
- Okay.

446
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:58,140
Look, I've got to ask you a couple
of questions, all right, Andre?

447
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,560
- Yeah.
- Okay.

448
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,770
You owned a gun, right?

449
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,960
- Yeah.
- Where is it?

450
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,110
I threw it away.

451
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,620
It was stupid to get it.

452
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,730
When you went up on the roof,
did you have a gun on you?

453
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,840
No.

454
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,120
Told you, it's gone.

455
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,360
All I had up there was my
phone and my cigarettes.

456
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,050
Do you remember what
happened when you were shot?

457
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,410
Not really.

458
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,700
I remember people
shouting from far away.

459
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,070
Then I woke up here.

460
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,800
Did you see the lip pout when I
asked if he had a gun on the roof?

461
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,460
He seemed genuinely hurt by the idea.

462
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,610
Now, you wouldn't see that
if he was lying, right?

463
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,450
He could've denied owning the
gun altogether. He didn't.

464
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,380
Nah, he's telling the truth.

465
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,880
I don't think he was
armed when Duke shot him.

466
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,140
We need to call the mayor.

467
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,230
This kid could do 10, 20 years.

468
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,350
Yeah, but if we do say something,
what happens to the FBI investigation?

469
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,430
That's not our concern.

470
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,230
You want me to lie to the mayor?

471
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,040
Yeah, but we ha veto consider it, cal.

472
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,550
Van pulls up in front of a
building, and there's an explosion.

473
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,480
I mean, your contact
said the threat is real.

474
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,950
Look, there's always gonna
be another bad guy.

475
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,530
There's always gonna be another
kid they're gonna want to sacrifice.

476
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,270
Ricks was unarmed.

477
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,670
He's the victim here.

478
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,460
Call the mayor.

479
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,310
Hey, uh, loker.

480
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,100
You know where ria is?

481
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,270
She might be downstairs getting a latte.

482
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,380
Well, I got tickets to the wizards
game, but I got to go to work.

483
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,200
- Can you give them to her?
- Yeah, sure.

484
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,040
- She deserves something nice.
- What you mean?

485
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,730
Oh, nothing. Just,
she's good people. Solid.

486
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,740
She did it, didn't she?

487
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,850
She covered for you with that lawyer.

488
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Um, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

489
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,700
I told her not to cover for your ass.

490
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,310
But I guess she didn't listen.

491
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,220
That's a bit harsh.

492
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,400
Can I talk to you for a second?

493
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,820
You don't get it, do you?

494
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,670
If this thing gets out, you
are both gonna get fired.

495
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,480
Now, you're Mr. Ivy league, and you're gonna be
okay, but ria, she's going back to the airport.

496
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,070
She's gonna be scanning luggage and taking it
from passengers with bad attitude all day long.

497
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,620
She has so much more to lose than
you that it's not even funny.

498
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,820
But doesn't matter to you, right?

499
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,290
'Cause you think she's good people.

500
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,010
So Eric went out the
door first. I was...

501
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,340
sorry, no. That's not right.

502
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,650
I went out first. Eric followed me.

503
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,790
Turn on the TV.

504
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,740
Hey, I don't see any
signs of deception in Duke.

505
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,570
If he's a spy, I mean,
how's he hiding it?

506
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,690
Turn on the TV.

507
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,290
What we are saying is this is
a cover-up, pure and simple.

508
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,350
Why won't the authorities let
Kuransky and Duke face their accusers?

509
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,870
No, that's not right. No, I spoke to
the mayor. Why isn't Duke in custody?

510
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,970
The FBI's holding him. They won't
turn him over to the dc police.

511
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,610
National security.

512
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,210
Uh, as soon as the kid stepped out.

513
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,130
And how far away from Ricks were

514
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,210
maybe ten feet.

515
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,210
What?

516
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,170
They're not gonna
get anything out of Duke.

517
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,650
Why?

518
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,260
You said Kuransky was
suffering from dissociation

519
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,920
because of being undercover, right?

520
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,500
Yeah, yeah. Being
undercover is hard to take.

521
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,360
Right. Was it a problem for Duke?

522
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,950
No, not at all.

523
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,800
Well, if he's a terrorist, he's
been undercover longer than Kuransky.

524
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,150
So his symptoms should be worse.

525
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,650
Maybe they got it wrong.

526
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,140
You know, maybe he's not a terrorist.

527
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,770
I mean, that would explain why he
didn't show any signs of deception.

528
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,830
He wouldn't have been lying.

529
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,830
I've looked at over a dozen interrogations,
and there's no sign of deception in Duke.

530
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,990
Here it is. This is the oneI've been
looking for. It's Duke questioning a neo-nazi.

531
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,600
I say this country is a whore bitch--
de-christianized, mongrelized, obamanized.

532
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,300
The streets are sewers
filled with human trash.

533
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,720
The cities reek with moral decay...

534
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,180
look at Duke. See that contempt smile?

535
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,330
He's offended.

536
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,690
Yeah, if he were a terrorist
obsessed with attacking America,

537
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,560
he wouldn't hate this
guy. He'd agree with him.

538
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,270
Maybe he's not a sleeper.

539
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,700
The FBI's have been
investigating Duke for over a year.

540
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,160
How could they get it so wrong?

541
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,080
Haven't you done enough?

542
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,330
You already destroyed an undercover operation
we spent years putting in place.

543
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
It put the wrong man in custody.

544
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,370
Why? Because Duke doesn't
have a personality disorder?

545
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,770
Because he looked irritated
when some skinhead yelled at him?

546
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,000
Give me a break.

547
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,130
You've been interrogating
Duke. What have you gotten?

548
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,440
You've been on him for hours.
You got nothing, right?

549
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,980
You're starting to worry, starting
to think you might have screwed up.

550
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,260
Can see it in your face.

551
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,380
You can't afford to make a mistake here.

552
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,190
Damn it.

553
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,750
How did we get it wrong about Duke?

554
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,710
Well, you may have had some help.

555
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,190
A photoshopped picture of
Andre Ricks was given to the police.

556
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,430
I don't know anything about that.

557
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,690
I believe you.

558
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,370
Then you got a bigger
problem here than Duke.

559
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,430
One of your people has gone rogue.

560
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,760
Sorry about the wait.

561
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,240
What am I doing here?

562
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,730
Finnegan just said,
"show up. "What is this?

563
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,730
- Yeah, I wanted to talk.
- About what?

564
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,540
Sit down.

565
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
About spies.

566
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,310
See, there's two kinds of spies, right?

567
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,280
There's the spies
that gather good information,

568
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,090
and then there's the spies that
spread bad information.

569
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,280
Yeah. I think you're one of the latter.

570
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,580
What are you saying?

571
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,600
Well, you said that Adam
Duke was a terrorist.

572
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,960
In fact, the whole case against
him is based on what you've said.

573
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,110
- He is a terrorist.
- No, he's not.

574
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,970
Which means that you are either incredibly stupid,
or you're giving bad information to the FBI's.

575
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,980
You accusing me of
working for the other side?

576
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,110
You saying I'm al qaeda? I got
a picture of Osama in my wallet?

577
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,790
- I didn't say it.
- What the hell are you saying, then?

578
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,500
See, that's good. You're pretty good.

579
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,140
I mean, I'm not seeing any
fear. I'm only seeing anger.

580
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,560
I mean, that photograph, though, that
you sent to the police of Andre...

581
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,570
that was crude. That showed desperation.

582
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,530
If you think I've been bought off, you
check my bank account. I got nothing.

583
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:35,010
That's true. But you did
have something. Didn't you?

584
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,900
You used to have something.

585
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:44,040
You had... a daughter.

586
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,670
Specialist Jacqueline Kuransky.

587
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,970
To hell with this. I'm not doing this.

588
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,270
Hey, not until your boss
tells you to. Sit down.

589
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,110
"On October 14, 2005,specialist
Jacqueline Kuransky

590
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,690
was killed by enemy fire while
on patrol in Tikrit..."

591
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,270
well, that's not true. Is it?

592
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,570
She was killed by friendly fire.

593
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,890
We have the file.

594
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,940
But not that they'd admit it. I mean...

595
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,220
what's their line?
"Under investigation"?

596
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,020
Now you're getting angrier.
That's good. I can understand that.

597
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,540
I mean, if somebody did this to my
kid, I'd want to tear their head off.

598
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,730
- She deserves the truth.
- Yes, she does.

599
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,970
She died wearing their uniform.

600
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,090
- She deserves the truth.
- Yes, she does.

601
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,360
You want to get back at people you
think killed your daughter.

602
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,560
I understand that. That is basic.

603
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,250
They lied.

604
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,150
They lied about everything.

605
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,610
They lied about how
long she would be there.

606
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,350
What she would do, what kind of
armor her truck would have...

607
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:26,220
they even lied about how she died.

608
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,090
All they did was tell lies.

609
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,590
Well...

610
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,580
I can lie, too.

611
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,440
There you go.

612
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,250
Kuransky gave us four more sleepers.

613
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,110
- Were they police?
- No.

614
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,160
- They were EMTs. Paramedics.
- Why them?

615
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,770
It was planned as a double attack: An
initial explosion produce casualties;

616
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,250
then the ambulances
would arrive, driven by sleepers,

617
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,350
and stuffed with more explosives

618
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,160
we would have waved those ambulances
right in without thinking twice.

619
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,610
Because Kuransky had us convinced
that the terrorists were police.

620
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,880
He told the FBI that I was a terrorist?

621
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,370
What does this have to
do with the shooting?

622
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,480
Well, Kuransky's story depended
on you being on the police force.

623
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,570
And when you shot Andre Ricks, he
knew you could get arrested,

624
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,510
so he had to make the
shooting looked justified.

625
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,980
That shoot was good.

626
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,520
No, it wasn't.

627
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,920
When Kuransky got to the
street, he saw Andre wasn't armed.

628
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,120
So he put a gun on him.

629
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,180
He had a gun on the roof.
I was there. I saw it.

630
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,540
No, what you saw was this.

631
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,910
His cell phone.

632
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:04,690
You saw a gun because you believed
he had on but it wasn't there.

633
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,900
Put your hands where we can see them.

634
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,940
Hold it!

635
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,640
Listen to me, detective.

636
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,950
Before you say anything, you
talk to a lawyer.

637
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,580
How is the kid?

638
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,880
Doctors say there's no lasting damage to
his spinal cord, so he should recover.

639
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,960
Tell him, uh...

640
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,080
tell him I'm sorry.

641
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,680
My office.

642
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,690
Before you say anything, it was me.

643
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,140
I-I blew up the deal. I went to the FCC.

644
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,480
I lied to foster about it.

645
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,260
I still think it was the
right thing to do.

646
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,770
But no one else was
involved. It was just me.

647
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,770
- I knew that.
- You did?

648
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,170
Yeah. Yeah, I've known that all along.

649
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,700
Why didn't you say anything?

650
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,220
'Cause I decided to run a test.

651
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,480
What kind of test?

652
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,110
The lawsuit. That was a test?

653
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,730
You lied to everyone in the office
so you could treat me like a lab rat?

654
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,020
No. No, I was testing Torres.

655
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,690
Why?

656
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,990
'Cause I could tell she
knew what you'd done.

657
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,080
I mean, there's no surprise there, but,
you know, we have a lot of secrets here.

658
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,530
So, I wanted to see if she
could keep one under pressure.

659
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,570
Are you going to fire
her for not turning me in?

660
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,770
No, I'd have fired her if she
had. Loyalty's crucial here.

661
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:20,020
But, you, on the other hand...
what you did is inexcusable.

662
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:26,380
And involving her is selfish,
disrespectful, and it's plain stupid.

663
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,050
I'll empty my office.

664
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,240
No, you can stay.

665
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,560
You can stay, but from now, you'll be
paid what you're worth, which is nothing.

666
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,510
You're an unpaid intern.

667
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,940
It's that or you can leave.

668
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,400
- So, what's he going to do?
- I don't know.

669
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,410
Didn't hang around to find out.

670
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:05,610
- Loker isn't the only one who lied.
- Oh, yeah?

671
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,710
That woman who came in yesterday?

672
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,100
That's Alec's sponsor.

673
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,550
He had a problem with cocaine
before we were married.

674
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,630
But he's been in recovery since, yeah...

675
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,920
a couple of months ago, he
started using again.

676
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,190
And he's just trying to stay clean.

677
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,770
How's he doing?

678
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,090
Some days are good, some... not so good.

679
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,950
Well, if there's anythingI can do...

680
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,550
you didn't just happen to find Alec's
glasses the other night, did you?

681
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,870
You thought he was having an affair.

682
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,760
I was afraid you were going to get hurt.

683
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,040
You were protecting me?

684
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,230
Something like that, yeah.

685
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,320
You know...

686
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,850
the line we talked about?

687
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,630
You know, the line we have to draw
because we see things people are hiding?

688
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,800
Things they don't want us to know?

689
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,500
I think we should respect the line.

690
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,180
I think it's best for both of us.

691
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,260
Good night, cal.

692
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,980
Good night.
