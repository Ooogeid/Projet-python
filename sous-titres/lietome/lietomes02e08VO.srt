1
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,630


2
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:19,134


3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,686


4
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:22,813


5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,402
- Put down your weapons!
- US Forces!

6
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:35,826
Just one more!

7
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,720
- Stay where you are!
- Don't shoot! I'm American!

8
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:41,075
- I'm on your side.
- American?

9
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:43,091
I know what you're looking for.

10
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:49,881
How much?

11
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,911
Relax, dad.
It's a write-off.

12
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,756
It's a rip-off, more likely.

13
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:57,264
- It's gorgeous, Emily.
- It's for the Christmas party.

14
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,767
You know, the one you're throwing
for your fantastic staff?

15
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,853
Who you've always said
are like family to you.

16
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,592
You're in this together, aren't you?
This is a conspiracy, right?

17
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,235
Dad, I'd like you to meet
Rick Massey.

18
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,361
Oh, yeah?

19
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:12,621
I'm Gillian.

20
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,790
Right. You're with me.
You, too.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,169
Not too much on the lights
and that, right?

22
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:28,662
Dad.

23
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,740
I'm sure he likes you.
I wouldn't worry about it.

24
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,393
So, deputy assistant

25
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,020
to the President
for National Security Affairs?

26
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:48,774
- What's that mean? CIA?
- I work for the President.

27
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,995
I'm going with NSA.

28
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:55,197
I need you to boot up
your satellite link system.

29
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:58,576
What I'm about to tell you
is classified,

30
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,660
top secret.

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,954
Nearly ten hours ago in Afghanistan,

32
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,020
30 miles from the Pakistan border,

33
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,539
two recon marines were separated
from their platoon

34
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:08,252
during a skirmish with the Taliban.

35
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,337
They haven't been seen since.

36
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:13,256
Lieutenant Williams from Wisconsin,

37
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:16,594
Sergeant Hart from Arizona.
This is Hart's third tour of duty.

38
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:19,430
Williams' wife just gave birth
to a baby girl.

39
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,941
Key in the code JHK...

40
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,646
... 34ZY.

41
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,645
Within an hour of their disappearance,
predators, drones

42
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,523
and special missions units were deployed
in the search for them.

43
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,733
46 minutes ago,

44
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,943
one team found something.

45
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:37,031
Franko James Vincent from Baltimore,
so he claims.

46
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,575
- 34 years old.
- Oh, my God.

47
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,162
Or is this...

48
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,037
It's another John Walker Lindh?

49
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,835
An American who went over
to the Taliban?

50
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,212
Don't know yet.

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,205
All we know for sure is
he's given up a Taliban compound

52
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:57,510
in the Gremen Valley, where he swears
they're holding the two marines.

53
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,668
Well, I get what you want from me.

54
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:01,576
Transmit.

55
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,264
Ready.

56
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,390
You say you know where the Taliban
are holding two US Marines?

57
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:12,073
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

58
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,600
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

59
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,047
All right.

60
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:20,225
The part about not wanting to die,
that's true enough.

61
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:22,034
When did you join the Taliban?

62
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:25,544
<i>I was an aid worker,</i>

63
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:26,587
<i>and...</i>

64
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,944
<i>teaching school
when the war broke out.</i>

65
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,736
<i>And I got very sick in a village</i>

66
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:35,502
<i>and they saved my life.</i>

67
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:36,482
Just...

68
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:38,926
That's enough. That's enough.
Stop there.

69
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,114
No denial about being Taliban.

70
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,490
Well, the delay's not helping.

71
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,017
But, I wouldn't trust him
as far as I could throw him.

72
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,519
He's lying, then.

73
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,397
You'd need to bring him here for me
to get a proper read. Sorry.

74
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,839
While we mount a mission
to rescue those marines,

75
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:57,903
we'll have to treat him
as an operational asset in country.

76
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,442
No, if you think you're going
to send me to Afghanistan...

77
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:08,038
You do think you're going to send me
to Afghanistan, don't you?

78
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,055
And there was I,
dreaming of a white Christmas.

79
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,283
When could I be there?

80
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:48,996
Have a helicopter on the roof
that'll get you to Andrews in 20,

81
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,326
wheels up in 30.

82
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:52,833
And, Gill?

83
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,511
Not a word of this
to Emily, all right?

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,937
- What's that?
- It's secret Santa.

85
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,076
You pick a name and you get
that person a gift. There's a $20 limit.

86
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:09,142
- It's for the Christmas party.
- All right.

87
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:14,271
I've got to go away for a few days.

88
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,861
- Where?
- Just out of town. I won't be long.

89
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,961
The Christmas party's in 3 days.
You'll be back in time?

90
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,904
I wouldn't miss that for the world.

91
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,530
- Liar.
- No, it's...

92
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,722
fairy lights and...

93
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:27,295
really...

94
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:30,788
crappy music, and...
and goodwill to all men.

95
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:32,744
Right up my alley.

96
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:37,002
- Where's your boyfriend? Dick?
- Rick. Funny, dad.

97
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:39,129
Did I scare him away, did I?

98
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,507
For your information,
he went home to study.

99
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:43,155
Really?

100
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,344
All right.

101
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,649
In that case...

102
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:52,560
Here.

103
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,158
Get the best

104
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,825
Christmas lights for your tree

105
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:59,000
- that money can buy, all right?
- All right.

106
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,404
Dad, where are you going?

107
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:03,070
They need me in Florida.

108
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:08,459
- What happens if I pick myself?
- Then you put it back and pick again.

109
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,160
And besides,
somebody already has you.

110
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,568
- Who?
- It's a secret.

111
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,336
Why are you...

112
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:20,901
Well, dear...

113
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,302
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

114
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:30,347
This is going to be the best
Christmas party ever.

115
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:34,626
What?

116
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:37,229
You can't go to that place again.

117
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:40,733
I have never been to Afghanistan
in my life.

118
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,621
You know what I'm talking about.

119
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:46,155
Two missing marines, love.

120
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,273
Fear's healthy.

121
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:51,515
Don't forget it.

122
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,881
Right you are.

123
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:56,670
Bye, darling.

124
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:16,295
<i>Foxtrot 31 delta.</i>

125
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,641
<i>Tango one romeo
headed for your 20, over.</i>

126
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:22,672
<i>Zero alpha, copy, bring it on.</i>

127
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:52,668
This way, doc.

128
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,474
"Doc" I like that.
I do, you know? I do.

129
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,510
Right this way.
Watch your head here.

130
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:09,767
- Festive.
- The more I make, the better they get.

131
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,094
Welcome to the North Pole, Dr. Lightman.
John Parks, team commander.

132
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,670
How do you do?

133
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,725
Look, I see you're wondering
what idiot came up with the plan

134
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:19,111
to send me over here.

135
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,194
So, we have something in common.

136
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:24,044
Charlie team at altitude,
waiting for your go-order, boss.

137
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,773
Now, all you and I care about
are my 12 soldiers in the air,

138
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,946
ready to halo into the Taliban compound
our new friend here says

139
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,611
are holding those two marines.

140
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,393
Wait. You already
sent the mission over

141
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:36,451
before I even had a chance
to talk to you?

142
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,752
I moved my team
within striking distance.

143
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,312
I do my job, you do yours.
Final decision's mine, period.

144
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,307
No disrespect, but we don't have
a lot of time to screw around

145
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,145
before they start cutting heads off.

146
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:50,222
Okay, do me a favor, will you?
Just hold on the go-order

147
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:52,411
till I've had a chance to talk
to your new friend here.

148
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:54,700
I'll do my best not to screw around.

149
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,543
We gave him a shave, cleaned him up.

150
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:59,705
- Looks like one of us now.
- Sat-link eyes to your people.

151
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,462


152
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:09,631
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

153
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:12,621
Up.

154
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:18,959
Cheers.

155
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,647
Say hello to the folks back home.

156
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:30,485
I'm serious.

157
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,508
Say hello to the folks back home.

158
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:35,389
Hello.

159
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,838
He felt that.

160
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,377
Deep sadness at the mention of home.

161
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,084
What are those?
Paper snowflakes?

162
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,126
When Lightman asked him if he believed
in Santa Claus, I saw a flash of hope.

163
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,326
Where's home for you?

164
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,095
What?

165
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:52,841
Where's home for you, Franko?

166
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,375
1276 Bayview, Baltimore, Maryland.

167
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,638
Blurts out an address,
like he memorized it by heart.

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,834
I lived with my aunt.

169
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:01,142
Aunt Wendy.

170
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,769
- I'm sorry?
- Wendy Perriman.

171
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:05,122
My aunt.

172
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,356
Is that supposed
to mean something...

173
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,757
My Aunt.

174
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,391
Bayview what?

175
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:13,024
Bayview...

176
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,262
Avenue? Bayview...

177
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,491
Terrace? Boulevard?

178
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,451
- Street? What is it?
- Avenue.

179
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,842
<i>'Cause you seemed pretty sure
about every other detail, </i>

180
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,538
<i>except for that
one small thing so...</i>

181
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:26,840
Bayview Road, Baltimore.

182
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:29,322
And the natives
pronounce it "ballmer."

183
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:33,674
You know, I'm not buying much,
if any, of the whole aid worker,

184
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,173
Aunt Wendy story.

185
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:38,220
I mean, why lie about your Aunt Wendy
unless she's part of some

186
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,583
cover-up, some...

187
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:41,390
What is it?

188
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,313
CIA?

189
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:46,311
That struck a nerve.

190
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:47,972
All right.

191
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:48,897
Moving on.

192
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,526
<i>How do you know where the Taliban
are holding these two marines?</i>

193
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,611
Why give up that information?

194
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,172
Because I'm an American,

195
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,322
not like you.

196
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:58,907
Ex-CIA,

197
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,254
rogue lunatic... I mean, whatever it is,
any idiot can see that you've...

198
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,724
You've grown some deep...

199
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:08,292
hatred of all things Uncle Sam.

200
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,731
You know what I think?
I think you're just...

201
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:12,300
a traitor...

202
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,213
trying to save his own skin.

203
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,595
What's your Taliban name, Franko?

204
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,614
This close to the border
with Pakistan,

205
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:27,726
the Taliban never moves
more than ten miles

206
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,767
with prisoners
in the first 48 hours,

207
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,233
and only at night.
The place I told these soldiers about

208
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,362
<i>is the safest place to hide that close
to where the marines were captured.</i>

209
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,906
He said the first half of that
with extreme confidence

210
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,076
<i>because it's probably true.
But he used the word "safest,"</i>

211
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,103
inferring that the Taliban have more
than one place they hide out.

212
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,790
Where else might the Taliban
be hiding?

213
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:50,431
Nowhere.

214
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,461
Your shoulder begs to differ.

215
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,963
All call signs, stand by for go.

216
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:01,946
He's lying.

217
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,557
He's sending you
to the wrong location.

218
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,644
<i>Charlie one, over target area now.</i>

219
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,563
- You're sure he's lying?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:14,274
Well, 70%.

221
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,602
At best, he's sending you
to an empty compound,

222
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:18,612
at worst, it's an ambush, right?
Sit down.

223
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,455
70%?

224
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,576
It's not an exact science. If it was,
you'd have Bin Laden by now, right?

225
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,567
<i>Here Charlie One, do you copy, over?</i>

226
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:30,082
Abort.

227
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,774
Do it, Mo. Now.

228
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,921
Abort.
Say again, abort the mission.

229
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,356
- You better be right, Dr. Lightman.
<i>- Abort mission, copy.</i>

230
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,836
Forget it.

231
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,351
No way in hell.

232
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:53,746
I get that you're a scientist,
but this is no place for experiments.

233
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:58,055
He's definitely hiding something.
Whatever it is, it's buried it deep.

234
00:12:58,138 --> 00:13:00,346
And there's a connection
to your government somewhere.

235
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,447
I'm telling you,
you gotta let me dig it out of him.

236
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,060
You mean to tell me this
maggot's some sort of spy for us?

237
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:06,219
Yeah. CIA,

238
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:07,763
or related.

239
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,541
And either he's protecting
some long-term deep cover operation,

240
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,287
or he's just been out here too long
and he's flipped to the other side.

241
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,353
Those are just theories, doc.

242
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:19,064
Look, you already proved smarter
than that when you axed plan A.

243
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:22,676
Don't give up on me now or I'm on
the first donkey out of here, all right?

244
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:25,562
Whatever he is, whoever he is,
I don't care.

245
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:28,432
I need accurate intel from him,
and I need it yesterday.

246
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:33,270
No, you're right. Sod the science.
Give me a weapon.

247
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:36,769
At least I'll get home in time
for my daughter's party. I'm serious.

248
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,400
Weapon please.

249
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,330
Please. Ed.

250
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,367
State department? Pentagon?

251
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:48,827
Defense.

252
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,112
Special deputy operations and plans.

253
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,715
I'll be observing Dr. Lightman's
progress with the prisoner.

254
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,752
Top secret news sure does spread fast
in this town.

255
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:00,016
- Welcome.
- Cute.

256
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:00,976
This way.

257
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:17,856
He's ready for battle,

258
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,701
and he's smart enough

259
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:21,877
to know when to live
to fight another day so...

260
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:23,945
He's a warrior.

261
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:25,927
He's not a martyr.

262
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:29,618
These are 3 of the boys you tried
to lead to the wrong Taliban compound.

263
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,028
What was it?

264
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:35,152
Was it an ambush?

265
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,992
Was it an empty compound?

266
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,477
Empty compound.

267
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,089
That's something, I suppose.
Eh, lads?

268
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,525
We keep hearing this story

269
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:49,065
about you being a CIA agent
who got boned.

270
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,232
That you got sent out here
years ago,

271
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:52,386
left for dead.

272
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,148
- Is that right?
- If I don't get home to Texas, boy,

273
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,107
my wife is gonna take my daughter
and move back to Michigan.

274
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:01,255
Look, this is my last tour.
After this, I'm done.

275
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,485
Is it true you got boned by the CIA?

276
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,403
Still don't understand what you did.

277
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,490
- What'd I do?
- You went over to the enemy, you punk.

278
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,468
Attempt at anger.

279
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:20,961
No, wait.

280
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:22,546
Now, I get it.

281
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,353
I see your shame.
I see it.

282
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:26,967
It was either join them or die.

283
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:31,012
<i>I mean, these 3, they might not
do what you did, but I might.</i>

284
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:35,183
I'm a natural born coward, me. My blood
runs as yellow as the next man's.

285
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,740
Lightman just called him a coward.

286
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:39,249
How is this helping get
our marines back exactly?

287
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,027
Lightman just called him a coward
because he's about to present him

288
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,927
with an opportunity for redemption.

289
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:44,891
Watch.

290
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,917
But what you've got in
common with these guys

291
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,366
is that it's all about
living to fight tomorrow,

292
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:53,743
right, in the hope that someday soon
you get to go home.

293
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:00,141
If that's not on the cards,

294
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:04,212
then all that remains is
the last fight... you fight.

295
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,908
And then the question becomes...

296
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,095
which side of the fight are you on?

297
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,075
He's thinking about it.

298
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:17,810
Oh, God. I'm... crap. I'm so sorry.

299
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,312
Uh, here, let's...
quick, before it stains.

300
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:23,518
<i>There is another
hideout in the area.</i>

301
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:26,484
- But first, I have...
- First you have what ?

302
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,917
A condition.

303
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,379
It's a very common power play
for someone who feels

304
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,279
backed into a corner
with nothing to lose or gain.

305
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:35,731
You have a what ?
What do you got ?

306
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:40,970
Every time you ask me a question,
I get to ask you a question.

307
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,669
The truth buys you the truth.
You lie, I lie.

308
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,547
All right.

309
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,757
But first, you show me on the map

310
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:53,543
where the Taliban are
holding these two marines.

311
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:54,734
All right ?

312
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:10,506
OK, here.

313
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,280
There's two caves

314
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:14,908
with a tunnel that connects them.

315
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:17,161
It's been there for over 200 years.

316
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,414
Why didn't you tell us about
this place to start with ?

317
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:25,086
He's been with the Taliban too long.
You're still the bloody enemy.

318
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,734
Me, on the other hand...
I'm all that's between you two.

319
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:35,350
I'm really sorry about this. I needed an
excuse to talk to you away from Komisky.

320
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:38,635
We need to figure out some signals
or this is gonna get expensive.

321
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,406
Komisky's no stranger to Franko.

322
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,740
- You saw that, too ?
- Another thing I saw... he's careful

323
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:45,900
to keep himself off the sat-link cameras
hidden from Lightman and Franko.

324
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:48,817
Have you heard from
my dad in the last 24 hours ?

325
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:51,468
Yeah. Yeah. Why ?

326
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,825
He always calls to check in
when he's out of town,

327
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:57,826
and he hasn't this time.
His phone goes straight to voicemail.

328
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,161
Sweetheart,
he's really swamped right now,

329
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,861
and he'll call as soon as he can.

330
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:03,624
Guys, we're minutes away from...

331
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,459
Hi Em, how's the party coming ?

332
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,767
What are they minutes away from ?
Minutes away from what ?

333
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:12,193
He will be back before
you know it, ok ?

334
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:15,145
I gotta go, Em, all right ?
We'll talk later.

335
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,785
<i>- Charlie 3</i>
- That's it. That's the cave.

336
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,167
Bloody better be.

337
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:28,732
Tell me.

338
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:31,700
- Am I ever gonna get home?
- We don't have time for this game.

339
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:34,529
It's not a game.
It's a test of trust.

340
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,613
Right ?

341
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,017
Well, if you ever do get home,
you're pretty much screwed.

342
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,401
It's the right cave.
I'm 100% certain.

343
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,347
Charlie one, target confirmed.
Move, move.

344
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:51,629
<i>Charlie 1, copy, out.
Stand by...</i>

345
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:55,197
Contact !
Contact !

346
00:19:00,428 --> 00:19:03,393
Man down ! Man down !
Man down !

347
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,896
You and your science just let this
bastard lead us into an ambush.

348
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,767
Check for Charlie 3.

349
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:12,953
Charlie 3 is hit.

350
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,587
No! Back off !

351
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,830
What did he just say to you ?

352
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,124
He said, "kill me now,
it would be an honor."

353
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,834
You meant it, didn't you?

354
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,250
Who are you now ?

355
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:32,378
My Taliban name is Khaled.

356
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,464
My name is Mo... short for Mohammed.

357
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,509
<i>Zero, Charlie one,
Charlie three's hit bad. Wait. Out.</i>

358
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:41,700
Did you or did you not
send my men into an ambush?

359
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:42,931
I did not !

360
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,099
I told you it was a Taliban hideout.

361
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,268
Did you expect it to be guarded ?

362
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,549
Maybe you underestimate your enemy.

363
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,050
No, wait! No, wait!

364
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,893
He's telling the truth.

365
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:59,112
<i>He was as shocked as you are
by what happened.</i>

366
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:03,182
<i>You're not going to kill
an unarmed man in cold blood</i>

367
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,370
<i>just out of sheer</i>
frustration, so knock it off.

368
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,069
All right ?

369
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,484
You know that man ?

370
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:16,978
- You know that man ?
- I've never seen him before.

371
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:19,989
- Do you know that man ?
- I've never seen him before.

372
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:25,889
- Foster, who you got in there ?
- Ed Komisky, defense department.

373
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,435
<i>Hi, Ed. I see you've met
my friend Franko,</i>

374
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,688
a little bit ago.
There you go.

375
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:32,888
Amaising !

376
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,917
Is he one of the ones
who sent you here?

377
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,036
Is he the one that sent you here?

378
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,795
What did he tell you ?

379
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:52,960
Did he tell you, you gonna be a hero ?
Did he tell you, you gonna be patriot ?

380
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,600
Is that... what then?
Then what ?

381
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,850
That's between you and him ?

382
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:02,354
I'll be very happy to set up that face
to face meeting, but right now,

383
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:05,389
we've got some mess to clear up.
Move. Move.

384
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:06,848
Kill the feed.

385
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,933
<i>Kill the feed !</i>

386
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,936
What, he's shutting us out?
Get him on the sat-phone.

387
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,001
Order him to give us eyes back.

388
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:16,858
If you think Lightman is gonna jump
because you bark, you don't know him.

389
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,153
<i>- Trust me.</i>
- Call me if he comes back online.

390
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:22,889
You know Franko, don't you ?

391
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:26,809
The only reason I'm here is because
I want to see those two marines

392
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,078
- returned home alive.
- Us, too.

393
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,167
Look at you.
Look at you.

394
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:36,276
A minute ago, you said
you were willing to die

395
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,549
by this man's hand,
it would be an honor.

396
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:41,773
Now look at you.
You'd anything you can to get home

397
00:21:41,857 --> 00:21:44,469
just because of what you saw
on that sat-Link.

398
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:48,578
Zero, Charlie 1, over.

399
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,019
Casualty, Charlie 3.
Chest wound.

400
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:57,054
If he calls in an air strike,
in a matter of minutes,

401
00:21:57,138 --> 00:21:59,735
lot of people are gonna die.
Doesn't matter what side you're on.<i></i>

402
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,611
When I got here,

403
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,740
you thought I was here
to help you, didn't you ? Didn't you?

404
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:09,616
There's another way in.

405
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,064
Where ?

406
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:12,456
When did you get hooked ?

407
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Let's go !
Hurry the hell up.

408
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,968
What ? What ?

409
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,690
On war. On this.

410
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,380
You get high on being in the middle
of it all. Don't you ?

411
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,803
I can see it in your face.

412
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,175
Why are you doing this ?

413
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,969
Ok, you know what ?
There is no other way in. They're dead.

414
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:28,808
Look, I told you, you lie, I lie.

415
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,732
All right, Bosnia, 1994.

416
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:36,748
I didn't see direct action,
but I was

417
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,334
I was this close to it.

418
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:43,355
You get lucky just one time.
You survive, right ?

419
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:46,990
It's the rush. There's no...
There's nothing like it.

420
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,450
It's delusions of immortality.
Right ?

421
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:51,645
You're enjoying this.

422
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:57,667
Now it's your turn.

423
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,627
You owe me the other
tunnel to that cave.

424
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:04,835
- Tell them to go left.
- No. You tell them.

425
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,898
- You tell him !
- Tell them to go left about 100 yards.

426
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:10,628
There's a rock with an arch in it.

427
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:15,234
- This doesn't work, he's done.
- Yeah, so am I.

428
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,425
- Mo what's this ?
- Look at that.

429
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:21,374
This isn't just
a test of trust, is it ?<i></i>

430
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:25,939
You're playing this game because
you think if this mission goes south,

431
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:28,399
then you're not
the only one to blame.

432
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:30,536
But ...
if it succeeds,

433
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:35,580
I'm gonna become
your brother in arms, right ?

434
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,408
I'm gonna be more likely to help you
somewhere down the road, right ?

435
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:44,172
Don't hold your breath.

436
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:47,825
Ms. Lenox,

437
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,515
What do you know about Ed Komisky ?

438
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,932
Mr. Komisky is a hangover
from previous administrations.

439
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,740
Man's more like a pentagon ghost.

440
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:59,500
We're beginning to think that he was
involved in some sort of operation

441
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,635
which abandoned this man
Franko in Afghanistan.

442
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,941
Are you aware
of any such operations ?

443
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,552
- You don't want to think about it ?
- I know no operations involving Franko.

444
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:11,260
No records exist of CIA
or any other agency's involvement.

445
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:14,650
But he could be an agency asset
that you have never heard about ?

446
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:17,683
I understand what you're asking.
But I'm not sure I can get

447
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,621
any answers quicker than you can.

448
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:22,597
Franko's Aunt.
I need her here as soon as possible.

449
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:25,046
- Can you do that ?
- Lightman's back on line.

450
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,533
- He needs our eyes and ears
for this next part. - We never...

451
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:29,761
Had this conversation. I got it.

452
00:24:34,811 --> 00:24:37,538
If I help get these marines out,
I want my story told.

453
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:40,683
- That's above my pay grade. Dream on.
- It's right at my pay grade,

454
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,449
if your story's true.

455
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:46,508
That's the back entrance into the cave.
They're gonna hit a tunnel.

456
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:49,318
And they can go
one of two directions.

457
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,115
Left ?

458
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:53,860
Left is bad.

459
00:24:53,944 --> 00:24:55,674
Charlie one, move right, over.

460
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:57,495
No, wait !
Wait a second !

461
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,756
<i>If this is a back way into
it's also a back way out.</i>

462
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,716
We mount a frontal assault. That way
they'll try and haul ass out back

463
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,401
with the prisoners.

464
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:08,365
That's what I'd do.
How about you ?

465
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:13,929
<i>Hold, positions, Charlie 1,
hold positions. Set evac charges.</i>

466
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,347
Stand by for enemy, over.

467
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,909
That's not Florida.

468
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:20,533
- How did you get in here ?
- You lied to me. He lied to me.

469
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,147
<i>Charlie 1, hold positions.
Set evac charge.</i>

470
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,923
Stand by for enemy. Over.

471
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:34,934
<i>Dad ?</i>

472
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:36,667
<i>Emily.</i>

473
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:37,953
<i>Dad ?</i>

474
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,270
Dad !

475
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:48,260
Did he just get...

476
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:51,226
No, he didn't.

477
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:59,056
<i>Charlie 1, move to
alternate cave entrance now.</i>

478
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,351
Charlie 3, Charlie 3,
Zero alpha, over !

479
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,228
How'd the Taliban find us?

480
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,916
They got his radio when he was hit,
used it for directions to find us here.

481
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,125
<i>Fire support, confirm position. Over</i>

482
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:13,988
<i>Moving through tunnel now.</i>

483
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:17,630
<i>Going firm at tunnel intersection.</i>

484
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,096
<i>Contact ! Contact !
Marine prisoners and Taliban !</i>

485
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,498
<i>Taliban dead.</i>

486
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:29,795
<i>Evac complete. We have two marines
and rescue team complete.</i>

487
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,673
- <i>Setting evac charges now. Over.</i>
- Copy that.

488
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,901
Alpha whiskey 1, standing by,
waiting for your signal. Over.

489
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,920
<i>I confirm we need medic on board.
Over.</i>

490
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:47,188
It's a direct hit.

491
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,150
The radios are dead for good.
They're out there on their own now.

492
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,860
Wait.
What about us ?

493
00:26:53,462 --> 00:26:56,246
- You got any contingencies ?
- In case of loss ...

494
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:01,214
of comms during contact with the enemy,
we have 20 mins to haul ass out of here.

495
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:02,567
What happens in 20 mins ?

496
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:06,064
Smart bombs turn this place into
a parking lot, and everything in it.

497
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:08,562
So the only way that you can
get out of here is if you lure

498
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:11,003
the enemy into the kill zone,
which happens to be ?

499
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,250
- Copy that.
- Thank you very much.

500
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,925
All right, you wait here.
If I'm not back ....

501
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,970
in 18 minutes,
you leave by that door.

502
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:21,514
You know how to use that ?

503
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:30,558
- Not bad for a scientist.
- I've had my moments.

504
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:37,703
Torrific.

505
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,615
We've got 17 minutes.

506
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,618
You want to tell me
about your moments ?

507
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,407
That game's over now.
I mean...

508
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:48,165
besides, you're the one who
wants his story told, so...

509
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:50,707
How badly you want to hear it ?

510
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:54,374
All right,

511
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:56,614
answer's probably gonna stay
in this room anyway.

512
00:27:56,697 --> 00:27:57,865
Ask your question.

513
00:27:57,948 --> 00:27:59,510
What did you do in Bosnia?

514
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,761
Intelligence.

515
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,056
You seem like you don't wanna talk
about it, why is that?

516
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:07,893
- The past is the past, right?
- I can relate to that.

517
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,570
I know that you're trying to get
some common ground between us,

518
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:13,353
all right, Khaled but...

519
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,651
I didn't betray my country.

520
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,195
You betrayed something.

521
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,864
I betrayed myself, how about you?

522
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:25,623
Mr. Komisky, a moment of your time?
You too, Torres.

523
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:30,750
My real name is
Specialist Glen Welsh.

524
00:28:32,907 --> 00:28:34,941
What branch of the military
were you in?

525
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,507
Back to Bosnia, your betrayal.

526
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:41,802


527
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:43,841
Sarajevo.

528
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,190
'94.

529
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,809
We were interrogating...

530
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,307
a Serb officer
about his sniper positions.

531
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,640
- We?
- MI6, British intelligence.

532
00:28:54,272 --> 00:28:56,322
And I didn't believe him, so...

533
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,390
we changed his clothes
and chocked him out into sniper alley.

534
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,372
He lasted about 4 seconds,

535
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,530
got about 18 feet-ish.

536
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:07,078
His information was accurate.

537
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:08,745
But he's the enemy.

538
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:13,376
I'm a scientist.
I'm not an executioner.

539
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:15,669
War got the better of you, too.

540
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,129
Yeah, now your turn.

541
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:21,092
I was aiming for special ops.

542
00:29:21,316 --> 00:29:22,766
Before I got there,

543
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:24,061
'99,

544
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:27,350
I got in a bar fight.
They threw me in the brig for 3 years.

545
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,583
Manslaughter.

546
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,102
I could tell you
my drinks were spiked, but...

547
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,853
- what would you care?
- Right.

548
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:36,997
Two years later,
and this is right after 9/11,

549
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,068
I got jumped in the brig

550
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:41,497
and was thrown in the hospital.

551
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,447
Somebody had knifed me in my back.

552
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:46,951
- That's when they offered me a way out.
- That man you saw on the SatLink.

553
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,634


554
00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:53,833
Ms. Perriman.

555
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,432
Franko's Aunt Wendy?

556
00:29:56,515 --> 00:29:57,515
Franko?

557
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:58,763
He's alive?

558
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,773
Where is he?

559
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:10,424
And they moved you

560
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:13,348
straight from the brig hospital
to a training facility, right?

561
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:14,431
Where?

562
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:16,777
Somewhere out west.
I don't know exactly.

563
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,940
They didn't tell me.

564
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,359
It looked a lot like this hell hole.

565
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,934
They trained you to do what?

566
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:25,934
They taught me Pashto.

567
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:29,076
They put me through their own brand
of special ops training, then they...

568
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,912
they dropped me
in the middle of Taliban territory,

569
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,959
posing as an aid worker
with Shia sympathies.

570
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,086
They said they're gonna be watching me,
that they'd have my back

571
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:41,964
and that they'd pull me out
when the time was right.

572
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,960
All right, but they didn't.
They never came back for you, right?

573
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,415
They betrayed you,
so you went over to the other side.

574
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:48,548
Is that it?

575
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,974
Did you ever kill
any American troops?

576
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,518


577
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,799
- That's a bloody lie.
- No!

578
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Look,

579
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:01,541
you try...

580
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,611
to shoot over their heads,

581
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,248
but those bastards...

582
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:07,526
they just keep shooting back.

583
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:11,097
What?

584
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:13,726
What are you doing?

585
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,586
Hold still!

586
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,804
Hold still!

587
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:28,055
How did the people that put you here,
to know how to find you?

588
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:29,515
How were they tracking you?

589
00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:31,229
I think I know.

590
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:34,684
Hold still!

591
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,102
If I'm right,
this is gonna prove your story's real.

592
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:40,116
What the hell are you doing,
Lightman?

593
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,816
All of you, help me hold him still!

594
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:44,099
Hold him still!

595
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:46,070
We gotta go.
Right now!

596
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,364
- Not until I've done this!
- You listen to orders!

597
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,158
I often have orders from the president.
Did I forget to mention that?

598
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,776
Now hold him still.

599
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:55,416
Give me the pliers.

600
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:06,574
My sister, Peg,
died giving birth to Franko.

601
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:10,065
I raised him
just like he was my own.

602
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,359
Have you two met before?

603
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:15,933


604
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,480
What elementary school
did Franko go to?

605
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,483
Who was his first girlfriend?

606
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:28,821


607
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:32,275
I believe you really did have a sister
who died in childbirth,

608
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:35,160
which is what makes your story
believable, to the Layman.

609
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,592
- It's not a story.
- Do you carry a picture of your nephew?

610
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:41,033
I imagine over the years
of not knowing

611
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:44,602
where he is or if he's even alive,
it might be a great comfort to you,

612
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:46,880
- a symbol of hope to have...
- That's enough.

613
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:49,175
You don't have to answer that.

614
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,178
They came to me after 9/11.

615
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:57,100
My sister's death didn't have to be
for nothing, they said.

616
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,976
She's definitely telling the truth.

617
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:03,105
I can tell you want to get this out,
so please keep going, Ms. Perriman.

618
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:05,566
Someone from the CIA did come to me.

619
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,470
I guess it was...

620
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,615
like an acting role, for my country.

621
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:14,700
You gotta understand,

622
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:16,726
I wanted to do something.

623
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:18,621
We all wanted to do something.

624
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,551
Including you, sir.

625
00:33:25,592 --> 00:33:26,795
I believe that.

626
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,540
But you sent a man into Afghanistan
to infiltrate the Taliban.

627
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:33,723
Then what? You forget about him?
Or you just leave him there to rot?

628
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:35,656
- Or worse.
- We lost him.

629
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,463
The battery in his tracking device
died.

630
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:39,058
- The battery?
- It happens.

631
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:43,514
Know how hard it is
to find anyone out there?

632
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,105
I've heard.

633
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:48,186
We kept waiting for him to show up,
and when he didn't,

634
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:49,652
we assumed he was dead.

635
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:50,745
So...

636
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:52,078
please,

637
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:55,532
take your sanctimonious judgment
and park it somewhere else.

638
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:06,795
Snow.

639
00:34:07,024 --> 00:34:10,503
If we don't get out of here, it'll be
the last white Christmas we ever see.

640
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:12,122
Not until I've done it, hold on.

641
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:14,927
Hold still!

642
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:18,784
There.

643
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:22,694
It's a tracking device.

644
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,129
- Two-year battery life.
- He is one of ours.

645
00:34:25,212 --> 00:34:27,459
Why didn't you tell us
who you were in the beginning?

646
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:28,542
Orders.

647
00:34:28,742 --> 00:34:30,192
I disobey, I'm dead.

648
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,366
The only person I reveal my identity to
is the man with the code. Nobody else!

649
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:37,445
The code was Aunt Wendy.

650
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:41,954
That's a reason.
But it's not a real reason, is it?

651
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,681
You can do better than that.

652
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:46,083
And these bastards caught me,
and they beat me.

653
00:34:46,891 --> 00:34:48,377
Yeah. I was Taliban.

654
00:34:48,812 --> 00:34:50,012
That's better.

655
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:51,797
Who are you now?

656
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,580
You're the expert.

657
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:55,551
You tell me.

658
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:01,852
You tell your mom?

659
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:02,279


660
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:03,696
Why not?

661
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:05,829
Same reason you didn't tell me.

662
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:08,554
Don't you think you should tell her?

663
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,057
He can tell her when he gets back.

664
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,950
Move out!
Let's go, go!

665
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,639
Let's go!
Move, move!

666
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,209
Move, go!

667
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,458
Lightman, you're out of here!

668
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:35,800


669
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:37,674
We saw it on your face earlier.

670
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:40,652
You've got orders never to let this man
leave this room alive, don't you?

671
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:42,806
Am I right?

672
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:49,841
These men remind you
of what you wanted to be,

673
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:50,624


674
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:54,039
So now it's about a last fight you fight
and which side of the fight you're on,

675
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:56,237
And if you finally get...

676
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,370
to do what you came here
in the first place to do.

677
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,584


678
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,621
I need 45 seconds of fight out of him
to clear the tunnel.

679
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,599
Here.

680
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,762
Where's home?

681
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:22,891
1245...

682
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,180
Glenview Park, Iowa City.

683
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:26,183
Say it again!

684
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,801
1245 Glenview Park,

685
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:29,266
Iowa City.

686
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,312
Nice job, doc!

687
00:36:59,547 --> 00:37:00,597
Not really!

688
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:15,027
That's him.

689
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:23,017
Heard you helped get us out.

690
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Thank you.

691
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:26,055
No, thank you.

692
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:58,605
Dr. Lightman.

693
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,991
The real Aunt Wendy.

694
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:07,344
Please,

695
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:09,247
don't do this.

696
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,955
This is a matter
of national security.

697
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:16,265
What story
did you people tell specialist Welsh,

698
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:17,544
Franko's, family?

699
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:19,421
Killed in action?

700
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,525
Died in the brig?

701
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:24,003
Died in the brig, nice one.

702
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:25,636
I was serving my country.

703
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400


704
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:28,583
Our country,

705
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,766
you mean.
It's our country.

706
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,463
It's time you let that one go, mate.

707
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:35,395
You go public with this,
you'll be breaking the law.

708
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,868
I'm not going public.
I'm gonna tell a man's family

709
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:40,233
- the truth about their son.
- You know what I mean.

710
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:42,015
You know...

711
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,667
sooner or later you got to stand up
and be counted for our mistakes.

712
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:48,700
Your man, Franko, he went over...

713
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,480
to the Taliban.

714
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,530
That's a big mistake, but...

715
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,108
in the end...

716
00:38:54,991 --> 00:38:56,541
you know what I mean...

717
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:01,178
Mr. Welsh?

718
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,918
What's going on out here?
Who are you?

719
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,092
Who is it, hon?

720
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,130
Do you mind if if come in
for a minute?

721
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,639
There're things I'd like to tell you
about your son, Glen.

722
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,639
Glen?

723
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:13,809
Do you mind?

724
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,556
Happy holidays.

725
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:23,004
Dr. Lightman...

726
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:28,699
Would you let me do the talking?

727
00:39:29,988 --> 00:39:31,743
Just so long as it's the truth.

728
00:39:47,164 --> 00:39:48,164
He's late.

729
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,970
Midwest is snowed under.
Delays everywhere.

730
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:54,458
My mom's stuck in St. Louis.

731
00:39:55,787 --> 00:39:57,128
What are you gonna you do?

732
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:26,984


733
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:29,217
Hello, darling.

734
00:40:34,386 --> 00:40:35,386
I know.

735
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:36,718
I know.

736
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:41,188
You shouldn't have had to see that.

737
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,816
I was scared, dad.

738
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:50,530
- I was really scared.
- I know.

739
00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:55,347
Me, too. Me, too.

740
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:04,349
Is it...

741
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:06,148
naive to ask you,

742
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,424
beg you really,
never to do anything like that again?

743
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:12,634


744
00:41:14,744 --> 00:41:15,794
Well, yeah.

745
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,687
It's a little bit.

746
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,580
- Let's share some of that.
- All right.

747
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:40,266
It's beautiful.

748
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,290
Darling...

749
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:47,984
Are you OK?

750
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:50,528
I'm not sure.

751
00:41:51,124 --> 00:41:53,074
Good. You're not meant to be.

752
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:56,480


753
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,118


754
00:41:58,498 --> 00:42:00,316
- You look nice...
- Thank you.

755
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,207
Ish.

756
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,061


757
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,316
I got you a secret Santa.

758
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:19,662
I'm watching you.

759
00:42:21,145 --> 00:42:22,145
Oh, man.

760
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:24,853
Don't mention it.
