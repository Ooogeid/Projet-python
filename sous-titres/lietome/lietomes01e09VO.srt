1
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,500
Tragedy has struck the small town of Frostburg, Maryland,


2
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,930
where a factory under construction

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,200
has suffered a devastating collapse.

4
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,700
A FEMA spokesman on the scene refused to comment,

5
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,630
but Channel Eight News has learned that

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,360
two construction workers have been killed,

7
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,000
while others may still be buried alive

8
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,330
beneath tons of concrete and steel.

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,060
For now, all of Frostburg can only watch

10
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,330
and wait as the rescue effort proceeds,

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
and emergency officials try to determine

12
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,300
the cause of the collapse.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,860
Everybody just calm down.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,560
Everybody just calm down.

15
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,360
My construction company's built a dozen of these eco-buildings.

16
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,600
We've never had anything more than a minor injury. What are you implying?

17
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,730
Don't look at me. City Inspections found no evidence

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,700
of any sequencing issues in the construction!

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,900
Well, maybe you missed something!

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,630
If you took the proper safety

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,300
- precautions, how would something like this have happened?  - Oh, no.

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,600
No, I am not going to take the fall on this.

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,700
What the hell is that?

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello?

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,130
Is this thing on?

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,500
Who the hell are you?

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,860
Dr. Lightman, thanks so much for coming down right away.

28
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,760
Stevens, right?

29
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,700
Dr. Lightman is here to assist FEMA in the rescue efforts.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,900
"Assist"? How?

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,230
He's a deception expert.

32
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,260
He's worked with FEMA on half a dozen cases.

33
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,900
I want you to give him your full cooperation.

34
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,430
Who's lying?

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
Well, you're all pointing fingers and shifting blame,

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,200
which is typical of a disaster rescue operation,

37
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,530
which is going to guarantee you won't find your men.

38
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,860
We've pulled out nine men, two in body bags.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,130
three are still missing,

40
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,030
Blunt, Denman and Kisker.

41
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,130
How long they been gone?

42
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,760
15 hours. No sign of them.

43
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,160
Yeah, we're not going to find

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,560
any sign of them standing around here talking either.

45
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,930
Who are you?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,860
Kevin Warren. I own Green City Construction.

47
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,160
Those are my men buried down there.

48
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,400
They're my men, too.

49
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,100
Those missing men are all from Frostburg.

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,730
Meredith Fallon. I'm the mayor.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,960
This is the city engineer, Mark Boulware.

52
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,500
We've been focusing our search here.

53
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,630
Southeast quadrant, 2B.

54
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,960
That's where the missing men were last seen.

55
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,630
Collapse brought down six stories of concrete right on top of them.

56
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,260
In our experience, if we don't get to them

57
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,630
within 24 hours, the odds of finding them alive go way down.

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,500
Well, then you'd better move fast, don't you?

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
So who do you want to talk to first?

60
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,000
I need to talk to whoever saw them last.

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
I have an early meeting tomorrow

62
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,800
that I need you and Loker to take on your own.

63
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,960
Did you find Dr. Lightman?

64
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,560
FEMA confirmed he's at the disaster site.

65
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm heading out there now while there are still

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,760
one or two people he hasn't had time to alienate.

67
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,200
Better drive fast.

68
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,360
Dr. Foster?

69
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,030
- Dr. Foster?  - Yes.

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,260
Dr. Lightman is waiting for you.

71
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,700
Come this way.

72
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,730
Yeah, we were all on the same sub crew.

73
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,360
Been working together since we built these foundations.

74
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,360
And you left the men just before the collapse?

75
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,600
Yeah, like, two, three minutes at the most.

76
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,300
We were laying down rebar,

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,030
Southeast Quadrant, and I had to take a leak.

78
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,130
Uh, I was in and out of the john

79
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,760
and then I felt the ground shaking.

80
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,230
And I hit the dirt.

81
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,960
I thought, you know, these guys are trapped down there,

82
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,460
and I can't even get to them.

83
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,500
I can't imagine what you must be feeling right now.

84
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,460
But I don't think you have any troub

85
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,300
imagining how you're feeling right now.

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,600
- What?  - I think you've imagined this while story

87
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,130
you're telling.

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,400
- Are you calling me a liar?  - Your eyes

89
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,330
are calling you a liar; we just work here.

90
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,500
When people feel genuine guilt, they always look down and away.

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,160
You were looking straight at us.

92
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
The search team hasn't been able to find the men

93
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,460
where you said they were.

94
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,330
Look, we're just trying to understand

95
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,360
what happened here.

96
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,360
It says here that you were hurt on a construction job

97
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,460
earlier this year.

98
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,930
It had you out of commission

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,160
- for almost three months.  - Yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,930
I almost broke my neck on a nonunion contract.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,060
I was lifting pylons.

102
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,130
Um...

103
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,230
What expression do you see?

104
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,430
Expression?

105
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,600
What emotion do you think

106
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,700
this person is feeling right now?

107
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't know. Angry?

108
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,760
No, surprised.

109
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,560
And... in this one?

110
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,400
- Embarrassed?  - Happiness.

111
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,430
And... this one?

112
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,260
Disgusted.

113
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,300
Correct.

114
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,260
You're having trouble recognizing

115
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,500
every emotion except disgust.

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,660
It's a pattern we found

117
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,800
sometimes with people who are

118
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,100
addicted to opiates.

119
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,030
You can recognize disgust,

120
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,160
because you see it over and over from your friends and family.

121
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,200
I'm guessing that after you ran out

122
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,400
of pain meds for your neck injury,

123
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,700
you started self-medicating.

124
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,830
Hey, I've done tons of drugs.

125
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,100
I understand completely.

126
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,300
Mr. Spaly, did you lie about where you were before

127
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,260
the collapse because you were getting high someplace else?

128
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,330
Hey! Who's that?

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,300
- Who's that? And who's that?  - Kisker. That's Denman.

130
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
- And who's that?  - I know their names.

131
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,700
They're missing, Mr. Spaly.

132
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,200
Okay, look, I came up.

133
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,160
I went to my locker and I got my stash.

134
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,760
All right, I was... I lost

135
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,660
track of time, but I wasn't gone

136
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,000
from down there more than an hour!

137
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,130
So you saw the men in the Southeast Quadrant

138
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
an hour before the collapse?!

139
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,000
This entire operation has been focused

140
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,600
on 2B in the SE Quad based on what you told us!

141
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,160
They could be anywhere,

142
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,400
on any level!

143
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,430
Hold the work!

144
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,260
Stop! Hold the work!

145
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,600
30 seconds of silence!

146
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,630
Now! Bring the dogs back in!

147
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,100
Hey, we've got some banging over here!

148
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,200
They're down here!

149
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,900
Let's hope the dogs aren't lying, too.

150
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,960
# Turn back the clock #

151
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,630
# Give me some time #

152
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,100
# I need to break out #

153
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,500
# Make a new name #

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,800
# Let's open our eyes #

155
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,130
# To the brand-new day #

156
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,360
Thank you for meeting with me.

157
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,960
What can we do for you today, Mr. Kachani?

158
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,030
I've read about your marriage experiments,

159
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,060
and I had my people do a little research

160
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,160
into the work you do here.

161
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,700
Okay.

162
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,360
Long and short is, I'm about to ask

163
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,060
my girlfriend, Nadia, to marry me.

164
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,700
Oh, mazel tov. It's a good thing you're starting young.

165
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,400
It took my father five times to get it right.

166
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
Affair, alcohol,

167
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,500
green card problems, affair...

168
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,500
So, when my company, Networker, went public,

169
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,760
I did, uh... well.

170
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,630
Yeah, I'd call banking four-and-a-half billion dollars doing very well.

171
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,000
Before I propose to Nadia,

172
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,000
I have to know if she loves me for the right reasons.

173
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
What makes you think she doesn't?

174
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,560
Nadia grew up with nothing.

175
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,330
Her father was a short-order cook, in and out of work.

176
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,360
She's struggled 

177
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,360
- student loans, credit card debt...  - So?

178
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,500
So, right after my company went public,

179
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,000
my partner's wife left him

180
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,560
and took their two-year-old daughter.

181
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,760
She used the little girl against him for a huge settlement.

182
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,230
So what is it you'd like us to do?

183
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,500
Nadia says she had no idea who I was before we met.

184
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,430
I just want to make sure she's telling the truth.

185
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,260
Dr. Lightman does deception detection

186
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,300
for the FBI, TSA, police...

187
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,900
We don't snoop

188
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,360
into people's personal lives.

189
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,260
But thanks for coming in.

190
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,730
Your Web site's incredibly useful

191
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,900
for reconnecting with girls

192
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,860
who rejected me in middle school.

193
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,330
Look, just do your boss a favor,

194
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,130
and make a decision after you look.

195
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,330
I think that's the micro expression for "holy crap."

196
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,760
We're dropping fiber-optic

197
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,860
cameras into the collapsed structure,

198
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,530
and the crawler drills

199
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,530
will be boring through the debris

200
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,760
to create a hole through which we will then pull out the men.

201
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,330
Mayor Fallon.

202
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,460
And we have every reason to believe that Mr. Blunt,

203
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,600
Mr. Denman and Mr. Kisker are alive.

204
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,400
And the drills are the best way to reach the men?

205
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,760
They've been down there for19 hours now.

206
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,560
We have to reach them as quickly as possible.

207
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,660
No expense will be spared to save them.

208
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,900
And I want to reiterate that

209
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,300
no wrongdoing has occurred

210
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,000
in the construction on this site.

211
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,030
You know, I'm going to let you handle the questions.

212
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,860
I really need to get back to the family.

213
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,700
Excuse me, I'm going to get back to the families.

214
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,030
How long have they been down there without water?

215
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,430
Do you think you're going to find more bodies?

216
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,400
Mayor Fallon, hi. I'm Gillian Foster.

217
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,300
I know who you are.

218
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,230
We really appreciate your help here.

219
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,660
Hi. Any idea how this happened?

220
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,960
No.

221
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,200
You lied when you said

222
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,400
there was "no wrongdoing" on the site.

223
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,400
Why was that?

224
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,930
Oh, that was just...

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
That was just what?

226
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,560
I pressured the Green City Construction

227
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,130
to hire more Frostburg workers than they needed.

228
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,030
None of our men would have even been there

229
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,060
- if it weren't for me.  - How did you pressure them?

230
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,300
Permits and zoning.

231
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,200
I helped them clear some bureaucratic hurdles.

232
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know what

233
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,260
things are like for you DC folks, but things have gotten

234
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,330
real bad for Frostburg with the recession.

235
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,000
The site was going to bring

236
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,560
a whole new industry here;

237
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,200
our Silicon Valley, thousands of new jobs.

238
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,360
If I can help with anything else,

239
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,900
please call my office.

240
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,660
Thank you.

241
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,460
We've got video!

242
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,700
There they are!

243
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,030
Blunt!

244
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,960
They're alive!

245
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
Can I see that?

246
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,260
- No.  - Can I? Thank you.

247
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,030
Yeah, it's them.

248
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,600
It's Blunt, Denman and Kisker.

249
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,100
That's Kisker. His leg's crushed.

250
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,460
There's a lot of blood.

251
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,230
I can't really feel my toes.

252
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,430
Oh, my God. Baby!

253
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,460
Someone's got to help him.

254
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,760
We are trying Mrs. Kisker.

255
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,030
We rigged a tourniquet on it,

256
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
but he's not doing so good.

257
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,300
Jered, are you hurt?

258
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,060
I'm okay, Valerie.

259
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,860
We're all banged up a little,

260
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,230
but we're okay.

261
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,660
And I love you, Valerie.

262
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,460
All right, let's get you back

263
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,930
to the staging area. I will keep you updated.

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,130
- I'm staying here.  - I'm sorry. We have to bring you back to the tent.

265
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,100
Dr. Lightman.

266
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,400
My men need engineers

267
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,630
and rescue workers, not a couple

268
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,700
of freak show shrinks pointing fingers.

269
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,860
She's the shrink.

270
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,700
I'm the freak show.

271
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,060
I'm sorry, we normally wear labels. Hello?

272
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,360
Hello, yeah, we're here.

273
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,760
Can you tell me what happened?

274
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,430
The sub roof just started coming down.

275
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,160
Once we heard it, we went to the elevator shaft,

276
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,430
but we couldn't get there in time.

277
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,860
Is there any way you can get over there now?

278
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,330
We've tried,

279
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
but the substructure floor between here and the shaft

280
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,060
is just too unstable, it could give out.

281
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,560
He's right.

282
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,060
We haven't even completed that substructure floor yet.

283
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,630
That man could bleed out down there.

284
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,730
We have to drill faster.

285
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,000
Listen, guys,

286
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,960
I promise you, we're going to get you guys

287
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,560
up from out of there, okay?

288
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,030
You just sit tight.

289
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,000
The drill should reach you in a few hours.

290
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,360
We're going to do whatever it takes.

291
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,830
You're going to be rescued.

292
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,100
Did you see that?

293
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,560
- Yeah.  - See what?

294
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,800
Hey, um, Mr. Blunt?

295
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,230
Yeah? What is it?

296
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,800
Mr. Blunt, can you hear me?

297
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,900
We lost the feed. All right, we lost the feed.

298
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,160
Can you trace the line?

299
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,560
Guys, talk to me.

300
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,300
I need to know why we got cut off.

301
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,960
We've got men down there, and we need to communicate with them.

302
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,260
All right, give me some minute, we're working on it.

303
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,060
Can you rewind it back to the point

304
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,860
where they'd just been told they were going to be rescued?

305
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,800
Uh, these two men

306
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,030
are showing joy and relief.

307
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,430
Yeah, freeze there.

308
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,260
Can we push in on this man?

309
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,800
Okay.

310
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,400
Lips stretched.

311
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,130
Can you pan up to the eyes?

312
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,800
Eyelids retracted.

313
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,560
- Fear.  - That's concealed fear.

314
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,130
Well, he's buried under 50 tons of concrete and steel.

315
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,160
What the hell were you expecting?

316
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,760
Relief.

317
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,700
I don't expect a man who's just been told

318
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,400
he's going to be rescued to show fear,

319
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,230
and everyone else is showing relief.

320
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,360
Maybe he doesn't believe he can be rescued.

321
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,900
Post traumatic stress can stifle almost

322
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,230
any positive emotion.

323
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,930
Maybe, uh...

324
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,060
Mr. Blunt doesn't want to be rescued.

325
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,630
Who wouldn't want to be rescued?

326
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,330
Someone who caused the collapse in the first place.

327
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,930
You think Blunt might've intentionally caused the collapse. 

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, that would explain the look of fear.

329
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,660
Best explanation we've got.

330
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,160
This is unbelievable.

331
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,130
How long has Jered Blunt worked for you, Mr. Warren?

332
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,430
About six months.

333
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,760
Any problems?

334
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,930
Did he threaten violence against the company?

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,600
Yeah, he confronted me a few times.

336
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,160
In fact, he sent a threatening letter to my office,

337
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,460
- complaining about overtime.  - Why didn't you fire him?

338
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,460
Well, believe me, I tried. The union blocked.

339
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,030
Why would Blunt

340
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,000
sabotage the building while he was still inside it?

341
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,530
Well, maybe he got trapped down there.

342
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,400
Can you replay the video again?

343
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,360
Okay.

344
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,530
We're up.

345
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,630
We're all banged up a little, but we're okay.

346
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,760
And I love you, Valerie.

347
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,700
Wait, freeze it! Freeze it!

348
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,900
Look at that.

349
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,300
There's charring on the concrete.

350
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,600
Burn marks from an explosion.

351
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,560
Damn.

352
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,860
What's wrong?

353
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,730
Blunt could have used

354
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,130
explosives to try to blow up the building.

355
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,400
That could have caused the collapse.

356
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,500
If he did this,

357
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,630
he could be trying to sabotage

358
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,860
our rescue efforts, too.

359
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,960
There could be more explosives down there.

360
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,600
What about my other guys?

361
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,730
We need to get them out of there.

362
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
They're trapped right here,

363
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,260
in the Northwest Quadrant.

364
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,930
If they can get across to the elevator shaft here,

365
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,900
- they'd be protected from another explosion.  - No way.

366
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,330
This floor's too unstable to get there. They'd never make it.

367
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
We're getting ready to send rescue workers down there.

368
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,960
If there are undetonated explosives,

369
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,400
I can't move forward.

370
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,200
Dr. Lightman, can you find out from Blunt if he

371
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,530
did this so we know if it's safe to get these men down there?

372
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
If you get the live feed back up, I can talk to him directly.

373
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,060
We have to get it back up then.

374
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,200
We won't get anything from Blunt that way. He's not going

375
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,560
to admit to blowing up the building when he's

376
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,060
still down there with his crew.

377
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,130
Then what the hell are we going to do?

378
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,700
'Cause we're just wasting time here,

379
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,100
and Kisker's down there bleeding.

380
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,530
Violence in the workplace

381
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
correlates to domestic violence.

382
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,200
A guy doesn't blows up a building

383
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,900
without that anger spilling over at home.

384
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,330
We should talk to his wife.

385
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,930
My father would have been proud of these men.

386
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
When he was mayor, it was his dream

387
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,430
to try to bring industry to our city,

388
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,300
and we're fulfilling that dream.

389
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,760
And I am proud of our strength in this difficult time.

390
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,360
And once we get the men out...

391
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,560
Excuse me. Is Valerie Blunt here?

392
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,560
... we'll rely on each other to get through this...

393
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,630
Thank you.

394
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,960
... just as we always have.

395
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,730
I know you're concerned, and I'll take questions

396
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
one at a time. Please...

397
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,860
We met in high school.

398
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,960
I was a cheerleader and Jered was

399
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,330
a third-string running back.

400
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,660
Ridiculous, right?

401
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,030
But we fell in love.

402
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,360
Are you still in love?

403
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,830
Of course.

404
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,300
I mean, you know, it's...

405
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,700
it's not perfect. It's...

406
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,830
It's a marriage.

407
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,360
I can't believe this happened after everything else this year.

408
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,060
You and your husband have been through a lot?

409
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,000
Uh, no.

410
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,960
No, no. I just mean, um...

411
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,500
with how hard it is to...

412
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,630
to find work around here for anyone.

413
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,760
Maybe he's just crazy.

414
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,830
What?

415
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,600
Your husband, maybe he's just bonkers.

416
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,800
Wha... what are you talk... I don't know...

417
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,160
He was arguing with the company,

418
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,530
he was constantly getting into fights, right?

419
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,800
What my partner is dancing around here is

420
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,300
that we think your husband just lost it

421
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,000
and blew up the building.

422
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,360
- Jered would never do that.  - What are you doing?

423
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,760
This isn't appropriate.

424
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,860
There's something she's not telling us.

425
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,200
- We're wasting time.  - I'm sorry.

426
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,100
I'm sick of watching you coddle these women.

427
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,130
Well, I'm sick of you derailing this investigation.

428
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,330
You know, you can be a bitch sometimes.

429
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,660
Who the hell are you people?!

430
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,900
Stay away from me!

431
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,100
You almost didn't sell it.

432
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm going to have to hit you harder next time.

433
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,200
You know, you take a little bit too much pleasure in that one.

434
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,030
Valerie Blunt was disgusted when you slapped me,

435
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,830
but she wasn't afraid.

436
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,860
She showing no heightened sensitivity to violence

437
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,030
between a man and a woman.

438
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,130
I think it's unlikely she was abused.

439
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,460
So you don't think her husband could have blown up the building?

440
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,430
With no violence at home? It's hard to believe.

441
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,860
It's Loker. Give me a second.

442
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,560
Yeah?

443
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,230
Take it.

444
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,160
Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,530
- What was that? A job?  - Yeah.

446
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,060
You going to tell me what it is?

447
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,400
I don't need your permission to take on a case.

448
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,760
That depends on the case, doesn't it really?

449
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,600
It'll be fine, I promise.

450
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,360
That usually means I'm getting screwed.

451
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,800
Usually.

452
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,100
Isn't that the head of Green City Construction?

453
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,730
Warren? With Mrs. Blunt?

454
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,000
Less than a foot and a half between them.

455
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,960
A flash glance from her before a quick turn away.

456
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,130
They've been intimate before.

457
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,230
You know, Valerie Blunt

458
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
was hiding something when you asked

459
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,660
if she and her husband had problems, eyelids fluttered.

460
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,630
There was something she didn't want to say.

461
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,300
Maybe her husband wasn't the perpetrator.

462
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,760
Maybe he was the target.

463
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,960
So Warren sleeps with Blunt's wife,

464
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,500
and then buries him alive?

465
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,060
If you would think I would have

466
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,930
anything to do with this, you are completely

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,960
out of your mind. Why would I sabotage

468
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,000
my own job, my own company?

469
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,530
For, for woman? And I got

470
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
ten guys on this crew at least who can tell you

471
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,730
exactly where I've been on this site

472
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
every minute of the last three days.

473
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,800
I haven't been down to the substructure for weeks.

474
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,530
But you and Mrs. Blunt had an affair, right?

475
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,200
It wasn't an affair.

476
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,930
They were separated at the time.

477
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,830
And he'd hardly

478
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,660
spoken to her for six months before they broke up.

479
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,500
Why did your relationship end?

480
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,360
I just wasn't into it anymore.

481
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,300
You know, I told her

482
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,130
I just wasn't really feeling it, you know?

483
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
That's a lot of anger you're showing

484
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,860
for a woman you don't care about.

485
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,100
Men usually reserve that kind of anger for women that they love.

486
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,060
I don't know why it ended, okay?

487
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,560
I thought we were on cloud nine.

488
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,300
We both felt like we were kids again.

489
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,960
We were out to dinner one night, she got a phone call

490
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,060
from Blunt; she spoke to him for about five minutes and she

491
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,330
bolted out of the restaurant, I don't know.

492
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,100
She went running back to him, just like that, so...

493
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,000
- You believe him?  - Well, he's pretty confident about his alibi.

494
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,400
And he used similes and metaphors

495
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,030
when he was talking about Valerie Blunt.

496
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,860
"We were on cloud nine. We felt like kids again."

497
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,630
People don't use that kind of language when they're lying.

498
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,660
What do you think Blunt told her that brought her running back?

499
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,430
There's something going on between them.

500
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,700
And we still don't know why he showed fear when he

501
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
found out he was going to be rescued.

502
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,760
I need to know what else Loker found on the footage.

503
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,900
It's hot down here,

504
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,730
but there's still air.

505
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,000
Can we zoom in on his left cheek and forehead, Sylvia?

506
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,400
Oh, there's that thing again.  What is that?

507
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,530
Contempt? Could be contempt.

508
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,160
Its unilateral.

509
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,960
Hey.

510
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,900
I need to borrow Michael. We're going to go meet

511
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,830
our billionaire's girlfriend, Nadia Dawson.

512
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,530
- Wow.  - Yeah.

513
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,000
Easy, tiger. She's only into guys making ten figures.

514
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,200
Maybe she really loves him.

515
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,400
Yeah, right.

516
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,800
What makes you so sure?

517
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,800
The female hanging fly.

518
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,160
What?

519
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,100
The female hanging fly.

520
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,230
She'll only mate with a male

521
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,460
when he brings her a caterpillar as a food offering.

522
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,330
The bigger the offering, the more time she will have intercourse with him.

523
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,860
For insects, it's food.

524
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,730
For us, it's money.

525
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,300
She's a female hanging fly.

526
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,730
Okay, you need to get out more.

527
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Look, I don't care if she's into him for his money,

528
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,100
as long as she is up front about it from the beginning.

529
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,100
Yeah, well, it's not always so easy to be open about money.

530
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,430
I always tell women exactly how much I have in the bank

531
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,430
on the first date.

532
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,860
And you wonder why you never get a second.

533
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,600
Good luck.

534
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,960
Dr. Lightman's on the line.

535
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,830
Hey.

536
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,300
So it's a contraction of Blunt's orbicularis, corrugator

537
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,230
and frontalis muscles.

538
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,500
I'm thinking contempt.

539
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,660
Maybe he did try to bring down the building after all.

540
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,500
No, that's not contempt.

541
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,730
Well, what is it?

542
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,860
Mr. Blunt's a very sick man.

543
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,830
I wouldn't feel too well either

544
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,400
if I were buried under a building.

545
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,900
He is sick long befor he was buried.

546
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,730
Almost got the feed back up.

547
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,200
How's your husband?

548
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,560
How'd you know...?

549
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,030
Don't do that.

550
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,200
Can you still hear us?

551
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,200
Yeah.

552
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,630
We hear you. Got it.

553
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,760
How's Mr. Kisker?

554
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,660
He's not good.

555
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,500
You need to get us out of here.

556
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,630
Mr. Blunt, I need you to tell us something.

557
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,160
What is it?

558
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,730
On the video footage we got of you back here,

559
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,130
I noticed something a little peculiar.

560
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,060
You have a rippling contraction

561
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,200
of your facial muscles.

562
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,760
I don't understand.

563
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,900
Well, you haven't been well, have you?

564
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,000
- What do you mean?  - Your muscle contraction

565
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,560
is a symptom of late-stage multiple sclerosis.

566
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,000
No. I don't know what you're talking about.

567
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,330
When you and your wife were separated...

568
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,060
something that you told her over the phone

569
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,530
brought her running back to you.

570
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,100
Are you sick?

571
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,260
Mr. Blunt,

572
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,760
it's okay.

573
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,700
Mr. Blunt, your friend could bleed to death.

574
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,400
I never meant for any of this to happen.

575
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,700
But we got no savings.

576
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,830
I don't have insurance.

577
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,760
Doctors say I got... I got a few years.

578
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,960
I didn't want to leave Valerie with nothing.

579
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,200
When you were told you were gonna be rescued,

580
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,300
you looked scared.

581
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:57,230
What were you afraid we were going to find out?

582
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,500
I was working near the elevator shaft.

583
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,260
My hands have been shaking a lot, and I...

584
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,400
I didn't, um...

585
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,830
I was trying to hold on to my blowtorch

586
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,060
and I couldn't and it fell...

587
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,460
from B-1, two floors down to B-3.

588
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,260
The tank must have exploded.

589
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,330
I didn't realize I was putting you guys in danger, I swear.

590
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,200
Hello. Can I help you?

591
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,060
Are you Nadia Dawson?

592
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes.

593
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,330
Hi. I'm Christina Lopez.

594
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,330
- I was three years behind you in North Columbus.  - Ah!

595
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,860
You played softball for Ms. Sleevi?

596
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,000
Pitcher, right?

597
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,530
Yeah.

598
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,160
Yeah. She always said you had the best pickoff move.

599
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,000
That is so funny.

600
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,960
Are you staying here at the hotel...

601
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,460
- Uh...  - I'm sorry, what was it, Christina?

602
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah. I was just here for a meeting.

603
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,200
You been working here a long time?

604
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,200
Almost a year.

605
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,100
It turns out Georgetown

606
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,660
actually wants you to pay for classes, so...

607
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,030
Oh.

608
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:28,130
How weird running into someone from N.C. High... here.

609
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,500
Ms. Sleevi would always say,

610
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,300
"You got four bases,

611
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,330
three strikes, two teams, but only one winner."

612
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,100
So what brought you to D.C.?

613
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,500
Um, well, my boyfriend started a company that's based here.

614
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,600
It's one of those

615
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,330
social Internet sites the kids are into.

616
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,600
Oh, which one?

617
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,130
It's called Networker.

618
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,730
You're dating the founder of Networker?

619
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,600
Yeah.

620
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,600
Wow, how'd that happen?

621
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,060
What do you mean?

622
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,730
I mean, it's just a long way from North Columbus.

623
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,360
Yeah, I guess so.

624
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,800
How'd you meet him?

625
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,260
Yeah, it's the funniest thing.

626
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,360
I obviously had heard of the company,

627
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,800
but I had no idea who he was.

628
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,560
I just saw this adorable guy standing right here at the bar

629
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,830
trying to get a drink.

630
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,200
Yeah, that is funny.

631
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,700
It must be strange to come from North Columbus

632
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,360
and now to be with someone so well off.

633
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,100
Take a look at this, Mr. Kachani.

634
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,700
"You got four bases, three strikes,

635
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,730
two teams, but only one winner."

636
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,400
That's Nadia telling the truth.

637
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,860
She's talking with her hands,

638
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,360
what we call illustrators.

639
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,230
But when she's asked if she knew who you were when you met...

640
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,960
Yes, the funniest thing.

641
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,130
I'd obviously heard of the company,

642
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,830
but I had no idea who he was.

643
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,600
I just saw this adorable guy standing there at the bar.

644
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,400
No more illustrators.

645
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,500
Her hands are in her lap.

646
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,660
It must be strange coming from North Columbus

647
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,700
and now to dating someone so well off.

648
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,260
Instead, she touches her watch and... her earring.

649
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,700
Manipulators.

650
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,630
When you see illustrators decrease

651
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,530
and manipulators increase... scratching, licking the lips,

652
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,600
or in this case, touching jewelry, it's a sign of lying.

653
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,200
I can't believe this.

654
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,160
Whatever she told you,

655
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,300
she knew who you were when you met.

656
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,260
You have my check.

657
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,660
Mr. Kachani...

658
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,860
- I don't want to see any more.  - Mr. Kachani...

659
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,800
I thought he was coming back in tomorrow.

660
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,100
He said he couldn't wait.

661
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,360
What did you tell him?

662
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,830
The truth... she's after his money.

663
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,900
That's not the whole truth.

664
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,200
It's all he wanted to know.

665
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,860
Yeah, but that's not all we found out.

666
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,560
We're sure it was an accident?

667
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,800
Of course it was.

668
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,200
We knew that a man intentionally

669
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,360
do harm to the building.

670
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,100
Mayor Fallon is right.

671
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,200
We've ruled out the possibility of explosives.

672
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,060
Should be able to reach the men within the hour.

673
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,230
What was the exact cause?

674
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,030
Detonation of a blowtorch acetylene tank

675
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,730
dropped through the substructure by Mr. Blunt.

676
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,230
That man doesn't believe a word he just said.

677
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,230
No, he doesn't.

678
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,400
The specifics of the collapse pattern are consistent

679
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,900
with Blunt's description.

680
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,830
Maybe he knows what really happened.

681
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,860
Hey, Stevens.

682
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,600
You got a problem.

683
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,330
The city engineer doesn't believe

684
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,060
that blowtorch caused the building to collapse.

685
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,730
Of course he does. He said so.

686
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,160
The engineer is lying.

687
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,030
He knows something about how this collapse happened.

688
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,230
Come on. Five minutes ago you told me Blunt caused the collapse.

689
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,530
Who the hell am I supposed to believe?

690
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,860
Well, so you're not to believe?

691
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,500
That guy.

692
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,230
I've been in love with the same woman for 30-plus years...

693
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,660
Thanks for coming back in, Mr. Kachani.

694
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,530
I don't understand why I'm here.

695
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,930
Well, the fact that Nadia knew who you were before you met

696
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,630
isn't the only thing we learned when I talked to her.

697
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Okay.

698
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,130
Look at this.

699
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
... and the way he hates breakfast food,

700
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,960
and how frustrated he gets in traffic.

701
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,530
I don't know, I just love everything about him.

702
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,230
I... I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

703
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,860
There.

704
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,230
That's an illustrator.

705
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,930
There she is telling the truth.

706
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,500
She does love you, and your money.

707
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,130
You're lying to yourself if you think you can separate the two.

708
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,900
She lied to me.

709
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,730
Well, why are you in love with Nadia?

710
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,800
She's charming, she's intelligent and...

711
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,160
oh, wait for it...

712
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,900
she's beautiful.

713
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
How's her beauty any different from your money?

714
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,160
I don't know.

715
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,300
Exactly.

716
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,560
Just be honest with her.

717
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,760
And yourself.

718
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,660
And get a prenup.

719
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,730
I don't know what you're talking about.

720
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,200
I didn't shrug my shoulders.

721
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,160
Yeah, you don't believe the blowtorch caused the explosion,

722
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,360
- do you, Mr. Boulware?  - Yes, I do.

723
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
What's he doing?

724
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,500
11 beats every five seconds.

725
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,830
That's 132 beats per minute.

726
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,830
What are you talking about?

727
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,300
Your carotid artery is pulsing

728
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,730
132 beats per minute.

729
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,400
Your heart's racing.

730
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,800
Why are you so tense?

731
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,930
Maybe you found something in your inspections

732
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,030
that could have caused the collapse.

733
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,100
I didn't find anything.

734
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,200
Now that's the truth.

735
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,630
Now you're telling the truth.

736
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,960
So I'm thinking, maybe you didn't find anything,

737
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,160
because you didn't do the proper inspections.

738
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,000
There are three men trapped

739
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,960
underneath us.

740
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,630
And if you know there's a problem

741
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,800
and something happens to them...

742
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,030
it's going to be your fault.

743
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,100
My wife and I were three payments behind on our mortgage.

744
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,330
We were gonna get foreclosed.

745
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,860
I don't know where the hell

746
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,860
- the money came from.  - Money?

747
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,430
And a note.

748
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,100
- From who?  - I don't know.

749
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,730
It just said to skip the inspections

750
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,260
and sign off on the approvals.

751
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,500
Well, why would someone pay you off?

752
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,160
What was it they didn't want you to find?

753
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,030
Look, usually these inspections are proforma.

754
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,130
I'm sure someone just wanted to move things along faster.

755
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,160
Mr. Boulware, you don't believe that's all it is.

756
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,460
Now you're minimizing... you're playing down

757
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,760
your responsibility for what's gone wrong.

758
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,960
You don't want to admit how big a risk

759
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,530
you really took with these men's lives.

760
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,230
But you need to tell us, what is the worst thing

761
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,260
somebody could be trying to hide on this site?

762
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,560
There.

763
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,630
There.

764
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,660
What were you thinking?

765
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,700
As soon as the drills allow us to pull them through,

766
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,130
we're gonna get your husband out of there.

767
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,660
Please. He's everything.

768
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,730
Just get him out of there.

769
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,300
Hey, Stevens! You have to.

770
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,530
- We will, Mrs. Blunt, I promise.  - Stevens!

771
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,160
You have to stop the drilling.

772
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,760
What are you talking about?

773
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,160
Tell him.

774
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,630
We can't drill... there could be methane gas down there.

775
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,160
Methane? If there's methane down there, Blunt's blowtorch

776
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,000
could've ignited it, causing the explosion.

777
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,460
The drills could set off another one!

778
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,030
Environmental testing was done on this site months ago.

779
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,430
There's no signs of any gas.

780
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,300
No, he took a bribe; proper inspections weren't done.

781
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,600
- What?  - I went back over

782
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,900
the old geologic surveys.

783
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,800
Decades ago, this entire area was a landfill,

784
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,900
and there could be methane seeping up from it.

785
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,860
How could you have signed off without the inspections?

786
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,830
Just stop the drills and do the testing!

787
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,200
Methane testing takes hours.

788
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,200
These men have been trapped for almost a full day.

789
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,200
One man is dying down there.

790
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,630
We could lose him while we do this testing.

791
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,130
Someone paid this man not to do his job.

792
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,100
You don't care who or why?

793
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,330
I'll let the cops deal with him.

794
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,760
I'm not wasting any more time.

795
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,660
I am saving these men; we are drilling.

796
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,800
- Eight to one.  - What? 

797
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,800
Eight to one.

798
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,900
Average ratio of firefighter deaths in the U.S.

799
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,130
compared to every other country with the same training,

800
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,860
- effectiveness and equipment.  - So what?

801
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,530
We have a Hero Complex in this country.

802
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,000
Our firefighters rush in too quickly,

803
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,930
trying to live up to the expectation that they're heroes,

804
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,530
and more of our men get killed.

805
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,360
Step back.

806
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,430
And that is an order!

807
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,830
Now!

808
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,430
Almost! Ten more feet!

809
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,130
Power up to 800 rpm's!

810
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,630
You guys all right?

811
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,430
It's hard to breathe... the air's getting thick.

812
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,800
Is that the methane?

813
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,500
It could explode; the drills could set it off.

814
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,000
You got to tell me what's going on.

815
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,100
This is the city engineer.

816
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,330
I think there's a pool of methane

817
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,360
seeping up from underneath you.

818
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,660
Methane?

819
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,360
Is there any place they can get to where they'll be safer?

820
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,160
You need to try to get to the elevator shaft.

821
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,100
You need to go now.

822
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,730
Come on, Blunt!

823
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,130
Tell my wife... I love her.

824
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,160
If the drills hit that methane...

825
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,630
We got to stop the drilling.

826
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,760
Stop the drilling!

827
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,830
Stop the drilling!

828
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,060
I don't hear anything!

829
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,830
I got nothing!

830
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,530
Can you hear me?

831
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,360
Yes! Yes! We got one!

832
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,800
Come on, come on.

833
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,860
Where is he?

834
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,430
Where's Jered?

835
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,400
Blunt let us go first.

836
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,660
He didn't make it into the shaft, and, uh...

837
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,800
with the fires...

838
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,930
I'm sorry.

839
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,030
I'm so sorry.

840
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,430
FBI is here.

841
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,130
What do you want to do?

842
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,360
You talk, I'll watch, okay?

843
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,660
Okay.

844
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,430
Kevin Warren?

845
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,700
Yeah. You have the right

846
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,360
- to remain silent.  - What?

847
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,830
Anything you say or do can be used against you.

848
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,800
Are you kidding me? Wh... What is this?

849
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,730
You found out there was methane underneath this site,

850
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,560
and you knew it would derail this project.

851
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,660
- That's crazy.  - And you tried to bribe

852
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,960
- the city engineer to sign off without proper inspections.  - Oh, this is crazy.

853
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,130
I would never do anything to risk my guys' lives.

854
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,860
And if there was methane, I didn't know about it.

855
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,960
That's the truth.

856
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,730
I know you didn't,

857
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,160
because you showed true surprise when you were accused.

858
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,600
Everybody here was surprised,

859
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,530
outraged...

860
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,500
except for one.

861
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,900
One person was relieved.

862
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,400
When a guilty person

863
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,260
sees someone accused of the crime that they committed...

864
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,100
they show relief.

865
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,930
Your father tried to bring a factory to Frostburg

866
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,560
when he was mayor, and he couldn't.

867
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,600
Is that how you found out about the methane?

868
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,000
I never thought anything like this could happen.

869
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,800
I didn't. I didn't.

870
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,360
We needed the jobs.

871
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
I'm sorry.

872
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,930
Hey.

873
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,230
I thought you could use a real drink.

874
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,900
And a bath.

875
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,230
Well, I can't help you with that.

876
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
Why do people always think

877
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,100
they're the only one with a secret?

878
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,460
Human nature, of course.

879
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,830
If the mayor had told the truth,

880
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,930
or Blunt...

881
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,560
had been honest about his illness...

882
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,360
hmm, none of this would've happened.

883
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,930
If the lies... hadn't come together.

884
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,960
They always do.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
