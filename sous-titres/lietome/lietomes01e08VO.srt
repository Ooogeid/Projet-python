1
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,260
See, in science class,

2
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,830
we like to call it "momentum."

3
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,060
You just need a little momentum, dad.

4
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,430
Traffic sucks.

5
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,160
You're avoiding the conversation.

6
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,660
I mean, have you even taken a woman out

7
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,330
since you and mom split up?

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,230
It's not your department.

9
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,660
I'm just saying, you know, you need

10
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,300
to stop dwelling in the past, you know?

11
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,230
You need to forge on, fight the good fight.

12
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,230
Where'd you get this crap?

13
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,300
Oprah, mostly.

14
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,600
Where you going?

15
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,100
Hey.

16
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,300
Hi, guys.

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,160
What happened here?

18
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,360
An accident.

19
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,000
A woman was playing around and fell.

20
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,360
It was an accident, was it?

21
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,860
Yeah.

22
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,600
So not an accident, then.

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,230
Was it a murder?

24
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,260
Move along, pal.

25
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,800
Not a murder.

26
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,560
A suicide?

27
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,060
It was a suicide.

28
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,460
Oy!

29
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,360
Dale!

30
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,260
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,500
Come with me.

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,630
It's been a while.

33
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,800
Zoe tells me you're well.

34
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,500
Yeah, well, she always thinks I'm well.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,500
Still overcharging the city and everyone else

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,160
for stuff that's unusable in court?

37
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,030
You still offering my wife

38
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,060
unsolicited marital advice?

39
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,960
- Ex-wife.  - Ex-wife.

40
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,860
What are you doing here, Cal?

41
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,100
What's the U.S. attorney's office doing

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,000
investigating a suicide?

43
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,000
We're not investigating.

44
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,860
We're just asking questions.

45
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,200
A girl jumped off this bridge.

46
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,130
Her sister jumped off three days ago.

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,930
Two sisters jumped off the same bridge?

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,030
We're asking questions, that's all.

49
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,900
You know, two girls generally don't kill themselves

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,900
in exactly the same way, I mean, during the same week

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
without a reason.

52
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,460
People kill themselves cause they're depressed.

53
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,160
Not always, and not in pairs.

54
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,500
What if something else happened to these sisters?

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,930
Something like what?

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,060
What if somebody did something to them?

57
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,130
Have you talked to the family?

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,500
Yeah, I already did.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
They came over from India to claim the bodies.

60
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,400
But we don't need you stirring them up,

61
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,100
so stay out of it, okay?

62
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,400
Okay.

63
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,100
Come on. Let's get you to school.

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,330
So you know what happened?

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,600
Not yet, no.

66
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,860
But you're gonna find out.

67
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,530
Yeah.

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,160
Didn't you used to study suicides?

69
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,130
Still do.

70
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,400
Don't know why you're so interested in this, Cal.

71
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,800
That's Jaya. She's 18 years old.

72
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,300
And Dhara, she's 20.

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
They were so young.

74
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,700
They were our Aasha.

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,500
It's your hope, right?

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,230
You know Hindi?

77
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,700
Just a bit.

78
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,860
And you work for the police?

79
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,360
Sometimes.

80
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,160
I was told the police weren't going to investigate.

81
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,330
You have any idea what kind of work

82
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,960
your sisters were doing over here?

83
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,130
My sisters came to America two years ago on travel visas,

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,900
but they stayed to work and send money home.

85
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,000
I understand how you feel,

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,400
and if there's anyone to blame for this,

87
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,760
I'll find them, okay?

88
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,760
Louise Mason, November 25th.

89
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,930
I want the weekend to go home to my children.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,400
It's my husband's birthday, and well, we always celebrate.

91
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,300
Are you feeling better?

92
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,530
Every day. Much better.

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,730
How have you been sleeping?

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,760
Very, very well.

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,200
Um, probably getting at least eight hours a night.

96
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,530
And how's your appetitive?

97
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,160
Really good.

98
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,830
I'm eating well,

99
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,130
and I can't wait to have chocolate cake.

100
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,600
That's wonderful, Louise.

101
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,230
Tell me, how do you feel

102
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,630
about seeing your family again?

103
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,830
So much joy. I know I'm going to cry when I see them again.

104
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,600
I miss them terribly.

105
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,730
I'll bake a chocolate cake just like I do every year.

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,860
And I'll put a dozen perfect flowers on it. 

107
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,030
What have we got?

108
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,300
Uh, we finished uploading the cell phone footage

109
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,860
of your suicide victims.

110
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,530
Okay.

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,660
What was that in there?

112
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,200
Nothing much.

113
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,030
That lady looked so sad.

114
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,130
Yeah.

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,760
I don't want to be on the tape, Dhara.

116
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,030
- Put it on the others.  - You wanted that.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,460
I still don't understand what we're doing

118
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,800
investigating these suicides.

119
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,300
Well, two sisters jump off the same bridge

120
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,600
I think that's enough. within the same week.

121
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,360
We're gonna find out why.

122
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,730
There, you see that?

123
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,460
Eyes down and away.

124
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,030
That's shame. 

125
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,260
There it is again.

126
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,930
Yeah, shame on the other sister, too.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,930
Exactly the same expression. 

128
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,100
You know, agony

129
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,060
is what we normally see in suicide victims.

130
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,300
Shame is something else.

131
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,830
Maybe they're ashamed because of the pain

132
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,930
that they'll cause their family

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,300
if they kill themselves.

134
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,230
Maybe they're ashamed of something they did

135
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,200
or something that was done to them.

136
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,000
We found the immigration office

137
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,430
where the Ashraf sisters got their visas renewed.

138
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,460
Northeast division.

139
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,960
Good.

140
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,330
Yeah, I had the feeling

141
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,800
that those girls were gonna stay illegally.

142
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,500
They're here on J-1 travel visas and wanted to renew.

143
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,230
Any idea where they were living, Mr. Personick?

144
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,260
Nope.

145
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,300
How about work?

146
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,730
Well, there's nothing in the file.

147
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,600
Used to be nannying and cleaning for the aliens,

148
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,160
but now everyone wants to go aboveboard with their domestics.

149
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,530
So how do these aliens find jobs?

150
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
Yeah, the Koreans usually head to the nail salons,

151
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,260
the Russians to the waxing places

152
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,230
and the Indians to the restaurants.

153
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,660
Is there anything you're not sharing with us

154
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,760
about these sisters?

155
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,060
No.

156
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:57,930
You're lying.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,230
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,160
What's your wife's name?

159
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,330
What?

160
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,530
Your wife, what's her name?

161
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
It's Beth. Why?

162
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,130
Cause I'm gonna call her, and I'm gonna tell her

163
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,330
the world's leading expert on lying thinks you're cheating on her.

164
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,430
Want to get me that number?

165
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,300
Yeah, sure.

166
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,860
I'm not cheating on my wife.

167
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,930
That's true, but then she's never gonna look at you

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the same again, is she?

169
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,860
This is ridiculous.

170
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,200
The only reason I'm talking to you is because

171
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,200
PD asked my boss to do them a favor.

172
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,630
Will you excuse me, please?

173
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,200
All right, Beth Personick. We'll be in touch.

174
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260
All right, wait.

175
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,830
Wait.

176
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,400
I saw them onstage at the Naked Veil.

177
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,200
- They were stripping?  - Look, I saw them

178
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,560
dancing a few times.

179
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,000
They must have worked there for a few months.

180
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,660
So why'd you lie to us?

181
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,360
Sometimes I go to the clubs during work hours, all right?

182
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,400
You're not gonna call my wife, are you?

183
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,760
That's too bad about those girls.

184
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,830
When was the last time you saw the Ashraf sisters?

185
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,500
Jaya, not since they quit a year ago.

186
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,930
I didn't speak to her, but I saw the older one,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,630
Dhara, on the street maybe four or five months ago.

188
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,000
How long did the sisters work here?

189
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,760
Uh, six months. Look, I wish I could help,

190
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,100
but I really don't know much else about these girls.

191
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,630
Here's the thing, right?

192
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,700
A lot of my work is filming people without them knowing it.

193
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,900
You've got, you got one of the best

194
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,960
camera systems on the market up here,

195
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,500
filming everything these girls are doing on this stage.

196
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,160
They didn't know you were filming them?

197
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,760
What is this, some kind of Internet feed?

198
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,230
That's it, right? That's what it is?

199
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,500
You know, pornography is illegal in India.

200
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,260
One of the few things they outsource here.

201
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,360
Did the Ashraf sisters know you were filming them?

202
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,060
I'll tell you what.

203
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,900
Let's tell all the dancers in this place

204
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,260
exactly what you're up to,

205
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,800
see how they react, eh?

206
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,200
I was only testing out the web site

207
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,660
when the sisters worked here.

208
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,530
But you were filming them, right?

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,200
Until they quit, yes.

210
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,200
Jaya and Dhara did not want to be so famous, I suppose.

211
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,400
Shame, too, because they could have made a lot of money

212
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,600
for all of us.

213
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,060
Were they ashamed when people at home

214
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,200
found out what they were doing?

215
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,460
They came in screaming bloody hell at me.

216
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,960
Their brother had called from Calcutta

217
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,400
to say that he had seen them naked on the videos.

218
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,030
He told those girls that

219
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,960
they were dead to the family and could never come home.

220
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,400
They're terrible to women back there. Barbaric.

221
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,430
Oh, yeah, spoken like a true feminist.

222
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,530
Yeah, hi.

223
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,830
Department of Health?

224
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,060
I'd like to report an outbreak of syphilis.

225
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,230
Yeah. There you go, love.

226
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,560
Yeah, I'm in a strip joint, Naked Veil in Southeast.

227
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,160
I wouldn't stand for this blackening of our name.

228
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,700
Did you threaten your sisters

229
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,930
after seeing them on the web site?

230
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,030
They disrespected the memory of our father.

231
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,960
Okay? Every man in India could see

232
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,560
what only their husbands should see!

233
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,660
Well, they were filmed without their knowledge.

234
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,730
And they were sending money home to you.

235
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,160
Instead of comforting them,

236
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,560
you gave them enough rope to hang themselves with.

237
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,000
Jaya and Dhara meant everything to my father.

238
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,560
He trusted me to take care of them when he died.

239
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,660
I think you killed them.

240
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,160
No. No!

241
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,460
I prayed for guidance.

242
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,330
God answered. He told me I must make amends,

243
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,200
so I called them and begged forgiveness.

244
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
They granted it to me, okay? We moved past.

245
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,100
We made peace.

246
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,900
- Yeah?  - You're not going to believe this.

247
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,530
We just got a fax from Metro police.

248
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,860
Young Indian girl just jumped

249
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,730
onto the third rail of the subway tracks an hour ago.

250
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,630
Another suicide?

251
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,300
Okay.

252
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,830
We got three suicides within one week.

253
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,260
All young Indian girls.

254
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,530
What's the connection?

255
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,930
There's no evidence of any connection

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,730
between the Ashraf sisters and the third victim,

257
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,830
Rajal Lamba.

258
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,100
All right. Where's Foster?

259
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,860
She's out on the SEC case.

260
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,060
Why haven't these suicides been on the news?

261
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,500
Because the media believes

262
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,500
that publicizing suicides leads to copycats.

263
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,960
The year after Marilyn Monroe killed herself,

264
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,560
suicides went up ten percent.

265
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,700
Same for Kurt Cobain.

266
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
It's called the Werther effect.

267
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,430
Well, so is it possible that the first girl killed herself

268
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,730
and that the other two were copycats?

269
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,960
That's what the cops think.

270
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,930
What about Rajal?

271
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
Any strip club connection?

272
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,300
No, she was never involved in the strip club,

273
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,530
and she wasn't on the Internet site.

274
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, what else have we got? Anybody?

275
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,560
There's no other connections between the third victim

276
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,860
and the Ashraf sisters.

277
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,960
Get Foster to call me.

278
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,860
I need to talk to her.

279
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,630
Where the hell is she, anyway?

280
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,330
She's out at the SEC...

281
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Are you with us here?

282
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,830
Who the hell steals from charities?

283
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,430
I want my pension back!

284
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,800
Hollin is a crook!

285
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,400
All the money is gone.

286
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,160
I provided the names of all my foreign companies

287
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,800
to the SEC weeks ago.

288
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,400
You provided them with the names

289
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,030
of three investment management companies you had a stake in,

290
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,460
but a lot of people believe there are many more.

291
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,060
Losses my company incurs are my responsibility,

292
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,260
but the idea that I'm hiding more money is ludicrous.

293
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,560
My father has talked to ten different people today

294
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,030
and told them the same thing.

295
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,760
He's going to answer our questions.

296
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,830
What is wrong with you people?

297
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,130
He's fully cooperated.

298
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,500
You know he's not well.

299
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,760
He's in his third run of chemo, for God's sake.

300
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,900
Those people outside might get their wish

301
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
sooner than they think.

302
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,830
Well, did you ever stop to think

303
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,660
maybe there's a reason that they hate you so much?

304
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,400
I was carrying losses forward, son,

305
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,160
and I had every intention

306
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,460
of paying the money back in a couple of good quarters.

307
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,330
I'm not stealing anything.

308
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,960
You mean, you weren't stealing anything.

309
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,400
That's what I said.

310
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,230
Did you hear him change verb tenses every time he talked

311
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,660
about whether there was any money left?

312
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,000
He kept shifting from the past

313
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,630
to the present and then back again.

314
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,760
Yeah, it's a sign of lying, but it doesn't change the fact

315
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,330
that he's going to go to a country club prison

316
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,300
for five years and he's never going to give up the money.

317
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,560
Mr. Hollin is dying. He's not going to make it two years

318
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,030
in the prison health system.

319
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,760
Maybe he's protecting his daughter's inheritance.

320
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,330
Okay, but he's still not going to tell us where the money is.

321
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,830
But if he's saving the money for his daughter,

322
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,600
then she must know something about how to access it.

323
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,600
Okay, so, what? We... we get back in with the devil spawn,

324
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,600
and we see what she knows.

325
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,000
The devil spawn? What is with you on this one?

326
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,260
This pompous douchebag flies around the country

327
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,430
in his private jet.

328
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,760
He gets people to give him

329
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,330
their hard-earned money,

330
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,630
he steals it, and then they act like we are persecuting him.

331
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,460
I'm talking to the daughter alone.

332
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,900
What? Why?

333
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,900
If she keeps sensing how much you hate her father,

334
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,030
we'll get nothing.

335
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,700
Hey, where are we on video?

336
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,330
I've got Rajal on video on the subway platform.

337
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,460
But it's being held from us by a U.S. attorney

338
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,100
who's got some issue with us... well, with you.

339
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,900
Just do your job. You know, get it.

340
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,030
Just get it.

341
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,860
Where have you been?

342
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,230
Can I talk to you for a minute?

343
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,530
I'm a little busy right now.

344
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,460
Could have used you a couple hours ago.

345
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,730
I, uh, I called you, I think, twice.

346
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,660
Just a minute. Please?

347
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,360
What? What do you want?

348
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm on my way to meet with Carolyn Hollin,

349
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,560
but I just wanted to make sure that...

350
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,260
you were okay.

351
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,760
I'm fantastic.

352
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,360
Beause I can put Hollin on hold for a while

353
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,430
until things quiet down around here.

354
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,600
I told you.

355
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm fantastic.

356
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,630
You didn't make it to your meeting with the mayor.

357
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
I canceled it.

358
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,660
No, actually, you didn't.

359
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,100
And it's been on the books for three weeks.

360
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,500
I meant to cancel it.

361
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,800
Cal?

362
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,330
Go mother someone else.

363
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,060
Everyone back to work, please.

364
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,030
Hey. How's it going in there?

365
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,230
This whole thing's a little weird, if you ask me.

366
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,730
What about it?

367
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,100
Oh, I don't know. Investigating suicides in the first place?

368
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,460
Yeah. Lightman's thing.

369
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,560
Yeah. Yesterday, he was watching some old video

370
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,360
of a British woman when I walked into his office.

371
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,030
I want the weekend to go home to my children.

372
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,160
It's my husband's birthday, and...

373
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,230
well, we always celebrate.

374
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,200
Brown hair? About 40?

375
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,230
Yeah.

376
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,760
Lightman probably spent about a thousand hours

377
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,260
watching that film.

378
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:21,060
Oh, I'll bake a chocolate cake, just like I do every year.

379
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,630
Her name was Louise Mason.

380
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,500
She was a patient of one of Lightman's professors

381
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
when he was in grad school.

382
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,230
She had been in the psych ward

383
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,760
about a month when that was recorded.

384
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,100
She told the professor she was fine.

385
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,900
And you've been feeling better?

386
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,330
Every day.

387
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,060
Much better.

388
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,200
No one could see she was actually in agony.

389
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,700
Lightman finally got the idea to slow down the film,

390
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,200
and that's when he saw the agony on her face.

391
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,600
That's what led him

392
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,430
to discover microexpressions in the first place.

393
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,300
Well, I... I hope they didn't let that woman off the psych ward.

394
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,800
Well, she got a pass home for the weekend and killed herself.

395
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,100
They didn't know to look for microexpressions then.

396
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,860
Nobody knew they existed.

397
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,330
It's sad how my father's become the scapegoat

398
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,900
for this country's problems.

399
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
He didn't cause the recession.

400
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,030
No, he didn't.

401
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,200
He's one man who made a mistake.

402
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,060
Now it's going to haunt our family forever.

403
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,700
You worked right by his side.

404
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm sure you're upset he lied to you, too.

405
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,230
I know what it's like to be disappointed by a father.

406
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,730
Mine drank his way through my childhood

407
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,830
and then spent the rest of his life trying to make it up to me.

408
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,300
Don't try to analyze me or my father.

409
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,900
You don't know anything about us.

410
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,260
He's still hiding some of the money for you and your children,

411
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,930
isn't he?

412
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,160
Of course not.

413
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,260
You're telling the truth.

414
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,300
So, what's he hiding?

415
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,830
Nothing.

416
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,760
But no one will believe him.

417
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,260
They want to crucify him.

418
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,960
They call him the Hitler of Wall Street.

419
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,900
Nothing good can ever happen

420
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
to our family now. It's been a horror.

421
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,960
Carolyn used negative emotion words every time she spoke.

422
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,060
Hell, scapegoat, haunt, Hitler,

423
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,830
worthless, crucify...

424
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,730
All psychological indicators of a guilty conscience.

425
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,500
But she showed no signs of lying

426
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,900
when she said her father wasn't hiding the money for them.

427
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,130
No, she didn't.

428
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,060
What if she's hiding the money?

429
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,360
The SEC cleared her,

430
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,400
but only because her father took the blame.

431
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,600
Maybe he's taking the blame for everything

432
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,800
to hide whatever part his daughter had in the scheme.

433
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,700
I just figured that if his daughter was guilty,

434
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,430
a man like Hollin wouldn't hesitate to eat his young.

435
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,900
Look at a man like he's the devil,

436
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,900
and you'll never understand his motives.

437
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,360
Well, everyone knows he's a liar.

438
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,760
Then we listen to him lie.

439
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,030
Here are the articles for Carolyn Hollin and her father.

440
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,260
Thanks.

441
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,430
Now, get back to helping Lightman.

442
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,800
Whatever he needs.

443
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,930
Uh...

444
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,860
This suicide thing...?

445
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,460
What about it?

446
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,400
Well, I saw him watching the film of that woman

447
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,130
Louise Mason, and Loker told me how she was a patient

448
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,500
of Lightman's professor.

449
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,500
Yeah?

450
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,260
I saw him looking at her,

451
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,200
and he showed guilt all over his face.

452
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,300
Just because you can see everything

453
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,830
doesn't mean you understand it.

454
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,330
I don't think she was his professor's patient.

455
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,100
I think she was his patient.

456
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,530
What if he's the one who... who didn't see it

457
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,230
and let her off the psych ward?

458
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Leave it alone.

459
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,560
Hey.

460
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,300
You okay?

461
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,960
Yeah, I'm good.

462
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,760
Hey, I just figured you'd be working late,

463
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,530
so I brought your favorite Pad Thai.

464
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,100
Nice.

465
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,700
You know, I thought you were going to come home.

466
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,130
I got a lot of work going here, love.

467
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,530
You really should, you know, try opening up to me.

468
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,730
Is it Oprah?

469
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,030
Yeah, it might be.

470
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,060
So, are these the two girls that jumped off the bridge?

471
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,600
Yeah.

472
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,560
Hey, do you remember, uh, that girl at my school who...

473
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,300
She took all those pills and killed herself?

474
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,300
I... I didn't really know her very well, but she was

475
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,000
in my art class, and she used to paint

476
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,000
these really colorful oil paintings,

477
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,660
like, just, you know, shapes, really.

478
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,930
I wonder sometimes if

479
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,030
anyone could have stopped her or...

480
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,530
What?

481
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,700
Nothing.

482
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,300
You shouldn't think about that stuff, love.

483
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,030
What am I supposed to think about?

484
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,130
Celibacy.

485
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,630
Food.

486
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,830
Here, eat it.

487
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,030
I love you, Em.

488
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,000
Only reason I'm here is 'cause Zoe asked me to help you.

489
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,000
She's a lot more forgiving then I would ever be.

490
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,130
Yeah, well, she is the mother of my daughter.

491
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,930
We've all got things to forgive, haven't we, love?

492
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,030
What do we got?

493
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,900
Your third suicide victim... Rajal Lamba.

494
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,560
This is what you saw on the videotape.

495
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,400
It's a ring of skin pigmentation called melasma.

496
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,660
It's the mask of pregnancy, right?

497
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,100
Exactly.

498
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,830
It's a common hormonal side effect.

499
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,400
The autopsy revealed that she gave birth

500
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,560
approximately a month ago.

501
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,200
What about the Ashraf sisters?

502
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,930
We finished autopsies on both of them.

503
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,400
Each gave birth in the last two months.

504
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,330
All three of them?

505
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,130
Why would they all give birth and then kill themselves?

506
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,000
And where are all the babies?

507
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,930
The victims had all the risk factors

508
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,060
for postpartum depression.

509
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,200
25% of low-income women suffer from it.

510
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,060
Okay, you got three Indian women, right?

511
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,660
All around the same age.

512
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,960
They all have babies,

513
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,400
and they all kill themselves.

514
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,000
I mean, postpartum doesn't explain it.

515
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,730
They had no support here, no family, no friends.

516
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,960
There has to be some link between these girls.

517
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,930
There has to be some reason why they killed themselves.

518
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,530
I know you don't want to hear this again,

519
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
but I'm gonna say it to you anyway.

520
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,830
It doesn't matter how many you find a reason for.

521
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,530
It wasn't your fault.

522
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,300
Hey.

523
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,060
We found Medicaid bills for Rajal Lamba... the third suicide.

524
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,300
She was discharged from the obstetrics ward

525
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,100
at a hospital in Virginia.

526
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,860
Um, Loker wanted me to tell you

527
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,030
that he got you back in with Joseph Hollin.

528
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,630
Thanks.

529
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,730
My daughter has nothing to do with this.

530
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,230
I betrayed her.

531
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,530
You don't believe that.

532
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,800
Well, it happens to be true.

533
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,960
Your daughter's filled up with pent-up guilt about something,

534
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,930
and it's not about the money.

535
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,300
I think she feels guilty

536
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,000
because she's letting you take the blame.

537
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,560
I'm calling my lawyer.

538
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,330
Before you call your lawyer,

539
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,360
you should know that unless you tell us the truth,

540
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,360
we're going to the SEC to tell them

541
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,660
that we think she's involved.

542
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,660
I stole the money.

543
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,530
That's not true.

544
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,500
You didn't steal it.

545
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,730
It was her.

546
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,660
She stood there acting like

547
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,230
we were persecuting your family.

548
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,400
I mean, what is she, some sort of sociopath with no conscience?

549
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,960
Loker, give us a minute.

550
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,330
Mr. Hollin...

551
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,130
Imagine your husband or your sister made a mistake.

552
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,330
And you knew you could

553
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,400
make a small sacrifice to protect them.

554
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,700
The worst lies we tell are out of love.

555
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,260
But I'd want my family to learn from their mistakes.

556
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,460
I'll get her to give you the names and accounts

557
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,460
of the shell companies holding the money...

558
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,060
but only if you make me a guarantee.

559
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,100
You're going to let him go to prison for his daughter.

560
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,900
We're going to get these people their pensions back...

561
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,130
their livelihoods... that's what matters.

562
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,230
What does that say to all of the Bernie Madoffs

563
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,430
and all of the Carolyn Hollins waiting in the wings?

564
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,330
You think the victims should just lose everything?

565
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,100
You have to put these people away

566
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,860
or they will keep coming back like a cancer.

567
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,560
You cannot let them think they can do this

568
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,860
and not get punished.

569
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,300
When you're the boss, make whatever call you want.

570
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,660
- Hey.  - Ah.

571
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,300
Rajal Lamba was discharged four weeks ago,

572
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,800
but the baby's still here for an ongoing lung condition.

573
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,830
Ms. Dale?

574
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,500
Yeah. This way.

575
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,160
Which one is he?

576
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,760
He's almost fully recovered.

577
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,760
Probably be discharged in the next few days.

578
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,000
There must be some mistake. This baby's white.

579
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,100
So's his biological mother.

580
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,000
Is there something wrong?

581
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,630
Is this your baby?

582
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,260
Yes, Robert's my son.

583
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,600
Ma'am, I'm from the U.S. Attorney's office

584
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,000
and we're investigating the death

585
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,760
of a woman named Rajal Lamba.

586
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,330
Rajal's dead?

587
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,330
Yeah.

588
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,930
How did you know her?

589
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,800
She... she was my surrogate.

590
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,230
She carried Robert to term for me.

591
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,860
She was a surrogate?

592
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,730
What happened to her?

593
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,260
She killed herself.

594
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,500
Oh, my God!

595
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,360
How did you find her?

596
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,960
How did you become connected?

597
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,130
Through this online registry.

598
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Surrogacy is very expensive.

599
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,500
It was $60,000 or $70,000,

600
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,760
and this registry was able to do it for us

601
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,800
for less than $10,000.

602
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,800
Do you know where Rajal was living?

603
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,700
What if all three women were surrogates?

604
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,060
That could explain

605
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,730
why we haven't located any of their babies.

606
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,730
They're all pregnants.

607
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,230
Dr. Foster, I've been trying to reach you.

608
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,830
I've got good news for you, Dawkins.

609
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,400
Joseph Hollin is going to provide you

610
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,330
with account numbers and the names of his shell companies.

611
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,330
Listen, Dr. Foster, I'm sorry I didn't reach you earlier.

612
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,700
There's been a major change in the case.

613
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
What kind of change?

614
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,460
Hollin's daughter's being taken into custody.

615
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,260
She's being indicted for securities fraud.

616
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,000
Turns out Hollin was covering for her.

617
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,660
I... I don't understand.

618
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,260
How did you discover this?

619
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,800
I really can't discuss the details of the investigation.

620
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,160
Have you spoken to Mr. Hollin about the money?

621
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,600
Is he cooperating?

622
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,100
I can't discuss the details.

623
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,700
My office will call you to close out

624
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,530
your part of the investigation.

625
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,300
Locker. Leave a message.

626
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,660
Loker, call me when you get this.

627
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,800
- Dr. Foster?  - Yes.

628
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,530
Joseph Hollin is here.

629
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,830
Mr. Hollin.

630
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,500
You lied to me.

631
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,660
You said you'd keep my daughter out of this.

632
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,230
I wasn't the one that had anything...

633
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,800
I was going to make her turn over every dollar, every asset.

634
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,700
She was going to leave the business and take care of her children.

635
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,500
We had nothing to do with the SEC finding out.

636
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,130
I just wanted to get these people their money back.

637
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,430
Well, you won't see a dollar of it now.

638
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,430
What's your name?

639
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,400
Chandra.

640
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,000
I need you to help me.

641
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,900
Do you know these girls?

642
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,900
Who are they?

643
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,760
That's Jaya and that's Dhara.

644
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,700
Why don't you try and tell us about them.

645
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,300
They had their babies just as I arrived.

646
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,160
That was the last time you saw the sisters?

647
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,160
After their babies, they were thrown out onto the streets,

648
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,700
like slum trash.

649
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,460
We were promised $5,000,

650
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,960
but he charges us for rent and food.

651
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,360
And when we are finished, there's nothing left.

652
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,460
What was his name?

653
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,830
He will come after me.

654
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,960
He can't hurt you anymore.

655
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,360
He found me when I went to renew my visa.

656
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,130
He works at Immigration.

657
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,400
These are notarized surrogacy agreements

658
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,660
for all the women who were found in the apartment.

659
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,200
He set up consenting adults with licensed physicians.

660
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,060
Those women are all illegal aliens.

661
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,700
But they weren't when my client

662
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,960
entered into these surrogacy agreements.

663
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,200
They were all on visas when he approached them

664
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,300
about his side business.

665
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,300
Why is your client so afraid to speak?

666
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,360
If you want to charge me with hiring aliens

667
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,030
after visas expired, go ahead.

668
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,730
How about with murder?

669
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,300
The Ashraf sisters jumped off a bridge.

670
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,100
Rajal threw herself in front of a train.

671
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,830
You created a world for these women

672
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,060
where suicide seemed like the only option.

673
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,600
We can charge you with depraved heart murder.

674
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,800
Callous disregard for human life that results in death.

675
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,400
This is what you have?

676
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,700
Depraved heart charges are for people

677
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,230
who shoot a gun into a crowd.

678
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,400
There's no jury in this state

679
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,530
that will convict him, and you know it.

680
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,500
You exploited these women,

681
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,630
and then you threatened them.

682
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,230
Then you threw them out into the street.

683
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,100
How many more had to die

684
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,100
before you'd stop?

685
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,860
Ten? Twenty?

686
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,830
What these girls did after they were done working for me

687
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,400
has nothing to do with me.

688
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,000
How could I know they'd kill themselves?

689
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,100
My client will plead guilty

690
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,460
to operating a business without a license.

691
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,730
These other trumped-up accusations are ridiculous.

692
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,030
You've got ten minutes to file

693
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,530
your paperwork before we walk out of here.

694
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,400
Can I talk to you for a second?

695
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,400
I was hoping the threat was gonna get something out of him,

696
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,800
but we can't actually charge him with depraved heart.

697
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,860
We'd have to be able to prove

698
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,460
he knew those women were gonna commit suicide.

699
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,700
He knew.

700
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,130
When he asked how he could've known

701
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,700
those women were gonna jump, his eyebrows went up.

702
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,660
How could I know they'd kill themselves?

703
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,600
Eyebrows up means you know the answer to your own question.

704
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,360
His eyebrows went up.

705
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,530
Did he also click his heels three times?

706
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,860
That's not evidence.

707
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,330
We need evidence.

708
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,530
I'm telling you,

709
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,100
he knew those girls were gonna jump.

710
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,500
We have no proof.

711
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,330
Even if we could show he mistreated those women

712
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,700
and we got them to testify,

713
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,930
all we could charge him with

714
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,100
is negligence.

715
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,130
I'm finishing taking his statement

716
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,960
and then we have to let him go.

717
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,000
Cal.

718
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,000
Dr. Lightman. I got Personick's cell phone records.

719
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,260
He got a pay phone call a block from the subway

720
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,000
five minutes before Ms. Lamba jumped onto the tracks.

721
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,330
She called him.

722
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,230
There's no proof it was Ms. Lamba.

723
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,100
She called him, she told him

724
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,000
what she was gonna do, and he did nothing.

725
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,560
The definition of circumstantial.

726
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,100
We just have to ask him the right question

727
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,230
under the right circumstances.

728
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,000
What circumstances?

729
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,830
We need to confront him with her family.

730
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,000
We have looked for her family for two days

731
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,200
and haven't found them.

732
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,900
We have no case.

733
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,030
I'm letting him go.

734
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,930
I heard about Carolyn Hollin's indictment.

735
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,060
It's unbelievable.

736
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,930
The victims will get nothing now.

737
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,100
The pension funds, the teachers union.

738
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,400
That's terrible.

739
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,830
What?

740
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,700
Look, I can't sit here and tell you

741
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
that I'm unhappy she's going to prison.

742
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,400
Loker.

743
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,760
You don't think I had anything to do with this?

744
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,100
What am I supposed to think?

745
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,100
You told me to let it go, and I did.

746
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,560
I'm supposed to think that the SEC got onto Carolyn Hollin

747
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,300
on their own a day after we made the deal?

748
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,400
Nobody else knew, Loker.

749
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,860
They must have found out on their own.

750
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,930
The SEC have been onto this for months.

751
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,430
Call your people over there and ask them.

752
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,100
They said he can't discuss how he got his information.

753
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,000
That's very convenient for you.

754
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,730
Why would I lie about this, Gillian?

755
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,560
This job is everything to me.

756
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,430
You think I want to lose it?

757
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,500
You're deflecting.

758
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,600
Did you leak it?

759
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,700
Of course not.

760
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,560
Okay.

761
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,960
"Okay" you believe me

762
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,400
or "okay" I'm not showing any signs of lying?

763
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,030
Get back to work.

764
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

765
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,730
I need to talk to you.

766
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah, what is it?

767
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,660
It's about the case I'm working on with Foster.

768
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,460
I heard the Feds found out about the daughter.

769
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,860
I called Justice and told them about Carolyn Hollin.

770
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,230
What?

771
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,500
No, no, no.

772
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,400
No, no, no, no. You're not telling me this.

773
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,000
You lied to Foster?

774
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,500
You stopped those people from

775
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,860
getting their money back, their retirements?

776
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,230
We cannot let

777
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
people like Carolyn Hollin get away with this.

778
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,600
Are you out of your mind?

779
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,100
Why... why did you tell me this?

780
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,400
I had to tell somebody.

781
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,560
Why me?

782
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,560
I don't trust anybody else.

783
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,560
You shouldn't trust me either.

784
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,860
They didn't catch you?

785
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,130
I took a sedative to relax my face,

786
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,430
and I know every word she listens for.

787
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,260
I don't believe this.

788
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,760
You got to tell them.

789
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,660
It's the only chance you have of not getting fired.

790
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,660
No, no, no, no, no.

791
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,630
They won't find out.

792
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,760
Lightman will.

793
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,360
By signing this, you're pleading guilty to one count of

794
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,200
operating a business without a license.

795
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,130
After you sign it, you're free to go.

796
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,030
Dr. Lightman.

797
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,560
We found him.

798
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,100
What's going on here?

799
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,500
- Who is this?  - Sulman.

800
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,900
Thanks.

801
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,430
This is Sulman Lamba,

802
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,700
Rajal Lamba's father.

803
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,160
We just picked him up at the airport.

804
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,200
He came in from Bangalore

805
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,700
to claim his daughter's body.

806
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,860
He wanted to meet with

807
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,200
Mr. Personick.

808
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,100
He wants to know

809
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,600
if this is the man who spoke to his daughter

810
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,200
before she jumped off the subway platform.

811
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,360
His daughter called him; she was sobbing.

812
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,660
And she said that Mr. Personick

813
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,360
had threatened to kill her

814
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,430
- if she didn't jump herself.  - That's a lie.

815
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,060
- All right, let's go.  - Oh, she didn't call you?

816
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,500
I never said I'd kill her.

817
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,800
Oh, yeah?

818
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,830
And she called you, right?

819
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,130
I didn't touch her.

820
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,560
Yeah, but she called you, right?!

821
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,100
- My client and I are leaving!  - She called you!

822
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,400
She worked for me, that's all!

823
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,900
Why is it my responsibility for what happens to her after that?

824
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,630
This girl was two blocks

825
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,330
from the subway. She called you

826
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,100
to tell you that she's gonna jump in front of the train!

827
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,030
You did nothing!

828
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,600
Yeah! So what?!

829
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,160
That doesn't make me a murderer.

830
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,800
I didn't threaten her.

831
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,300
You didn't have to.

832
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,900
You created the circumstances

833
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,060
that led to her suicide.

834
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,630
It was a depraved heart murder.

835
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,960
I didn't murder anyone.

836
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,160
You're under arrest in connection with

837
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,800
the death of Rajal Lamba

838
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,230
for the charge of murder

839
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,500
in the second degree.

840
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,960
What?!

841
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,800
This is not possible!

842
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,560
You did good in there, Rohit.

843
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,500
Been a long time since I spoke Hindi.

844
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,030
Oh, yeah, I'll come by the university next week,

845
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,560
and we'll catch up.

846
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,460
Good to see you, Cal.

847
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,060
Hey, do you need anything else for tonight?

848
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,130
No, I'm good.

849
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,300
- Okay.  - Hey.

850
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,360
You saw this earlier, right?

851
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,900
Of the psych patient?

852
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,860
Yeah.

853
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,300
Yeah, just for a second.

854
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,860
Did you see the agony she was hiding?

855
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,600
Yeah.

856
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,860
I'm sorry.

857
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,930
Never be sorry for something you see.

858
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,200
Did you know her well?

859
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,300
She wasn't a patient, was she?

860
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,700
No, she was something more.

861
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,530
Who was she?

862
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,300
Get some sleep, all right?

863
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,730
What are you doing in my room?

864
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,830
Uh, reading your diary.

865
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,830
Oh. I don't keep a diary.

866
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,400
Liar.

867
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,530
How was school?

868
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,230
Tragic.

869
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,300
So what's going on?

870
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,960
I want to show you something.

871
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,200
Where's the popcorn?

872
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,030
What is this?

873
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,460
I want the weekend to go home to my children.

874
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,230
It's my husband's birthday and, well, we always celebrate.

875
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,030
Are you feeling better?

876
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,030
Every day. Much better.

877
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,430
Is that Grandma?

878
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,660
Yeah.

879
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,460
- That's wonderful.  - Yeah, it is.

880
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,930
Tell me, how do you feel about seeing your children again?

881
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,630
So much joy.

882
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,930
I know I'm going to cry when I see them again.

883
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,930
I miss them terribly.

884
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,430
You've never shown this to me before.

885
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,300
No.

886
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Something I want to tell you, Em.
