1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,900
Nana! Nana!

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,360
Someone, please!

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,000
My family is still inside!

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,000
Nana!

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,360
Nana!

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,700
My daughter's still in there
with my mother-in-law! Please!

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,130
We'll find her.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,730
You need to stay with your family.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,060
Nana, please wake up!

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,730
Nana!

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,930
... OK. It's OK.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,630
Are you all right?

13
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,300
It's okay, I got you.

14
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm gonna get you out of here.

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,360
- Get my Nana! 
- It's too dangerous. Come on.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,730
I have to get my Nana!

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,330
- You can't help her now. 
- Let go of me!

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,130
Dr. Lightman.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,830
Hey.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,260
Bernie Madoff.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,730
That's anxiety and regret.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,300
- Tell that to the Science Times, all right? 
- Okay.

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,800
You've got messages from Wax
at the SEC, Kob at Treasury

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,060
and the FBI wants to schedule
another lecture. Also...

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,200
No downturn in the lie business.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,530
Good morning.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,500
You should put that down.

28
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,130
What, you don't like
women in masks anymore?

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,630
No, it's 'cause it's one of a kind.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,030
Could you... yeah,
could you put that down?

31
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,260
Never mind.

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,960
I do so like it when
you get flustered.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,930
It's rare, but highly enjoyable.

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,260
Why are you here?

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,700
You have such a
gift for small talk.

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,760
Really, you should've just gone
into the hospitality businesses.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Opened yourself up a little
bed and breakfast somewhere.

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,860
- Ria Torres. 
- Zoe Landau.

39
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,930
- Hi. 
- She's Assistant...

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,100
Assistant U.S. Attorney.

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,060
You always did like them so young.

42
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,230
Excuse me?

43
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,800
His proteges...
they're usually young.

44
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,960
It's easier for him to try to...

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,460
mold in his image.

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Is there a reason you're here?

47
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,430
I have a case. I need your help.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,530
You want to hire me?

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
Well, I don't want to remarry you.

50
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,300
What, do you have problem

51
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,060
working for your ex-wife?

52
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,130
My daughter is in a hospital
bed with second-degree burns.

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,200
My wife's mother is dead.

54
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,700
My house is gone.

55
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,100
This case is a top priority
for us, Mr. Ambrose.

56
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,530
So why hasn't anything been done?

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,500
Why isn't that son
of a bitch in jail?

58
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,830
You know that he did this.

59
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,330
Frank, she's asking for you.

60
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,400
I want Garcia behind bars.

61
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,230
He thinks you know
who started the fire?

62
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,460
Well, I have a witness
who saw Jack Garcia

63
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,060
running from the Ambrose house
right after the fire started.

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,530
That TV reporter?

65
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,660
Yeah.

66
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
He and Ambrose were
friends in high school,

67
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,560
but they had a falling out.

68
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,160
So you have a witness

69
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,430
that can put Jack Garcia
at the scene of the crime?

70
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,630
What's the problem?

71
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,830
The witness has a
slight credibility issue.

72
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,330
Who's the witness?

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,300
My mommy left me outside.

74
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,800
She went back in the house

75
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,100
to look for Maggie and Nana.

76
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,060
That's when I saw Mr. Garcia.

77
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,300
Hey, AJ, you ever tell a lie?

78
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,430
It's all right, honey.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,160
That's all right,
we all tell stories.

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,400
But, today, I need you
to tell me the truth.

81
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,030
I am telling the truth.

82
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,430
I saw Mr. Garcia.

83
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,930
He ran out of the cellar.

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,000
You know the story of "The
Little Boy Who Cried Wolf"?

85
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,660
He said the wolf was
there when it wasn't.

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,160
So no one helped him
when the wolf really came.

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,460
That's right.

88
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,430
He told a lie.

89
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,660
And the wolf ate him.

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,930
If you don't tell the truth, the wolf's
going to come back and he's going to eat you.

91
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,000
What is this? What...

92
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,360
- Did you see Mr. Garcia? 
- I saw him running away.

93
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,230
- I want you to tell me the truth now. 
- I am telling you the truth.

94
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,760
The wolf's going to come back here

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
- and he's going to eat you up. 
- You're scaring him.

96
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,060
- I saw him. 
- I need you to tell me the truth.

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,560
He killed my Nana.

98
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,960
You leave my son alone.

99
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,500
Okay.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,730
You used to be so
good with children.

101
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,100
We don't want an innocent man

102
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,500
going to prison for 20 years.

103
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,700
AJ was showing no
signs of deception,

104
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,360
so I raised the stakes a bit.

105
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,030
And he still wasn't anxious.

106
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,530
Now I think he tells
the truth, actually.

107
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Good. Let's talk to Jack Garcia.

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,200
My place or yours?

109
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,560
Mine. I want Foster to evaluate AJ.

110
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,300
Ah, yes, Gillian.

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,130
What was that?

112
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,500
I didn't say anything.

113
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,660
What?

114
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,130
Let's talk to the accused,
and get you some medication.

115
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,360
Thanks to my college buddy,
Army Lieutenant David Kanuth,

116
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,230
I know how hard it is for our
wounded veterans to return home.

117
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,730
I'm Jack Garcia, and
this is what I know

118
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,460
"This is What I Know."

119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,230
That really put you
on the map, right?

120
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,200
Selling the misery
of your old friends.

121
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,630
That's kind of what you do.

122
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,600
You're saying I burned
down a man's house,

123
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,100
so I could report on it?

124
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,060
Well, aren't you in the running
for some big new cable show?

125
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,860
I mean, the story of an
old friend losing everything

126
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,560
could help you along nicely.

127
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
You do not want to be interrogated

128
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,330
by this man, trust me.

129
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,230
It's kind of fun when you're
not on the other end, though.

130
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,560
I told you, we drifted apart.

131
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,930
I have no problem
with Frank Ambrose.

132
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,160
Never have.

133
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
All right, so, bad reporter,

134
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,530
good liar.

135
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,060
Not a great one.

136
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,300
When he talks about Ambrose,

137
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,960
this is what we get.

138
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,700
Contempt.

139
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,160
Yeah, that's right.

140
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,630
I'm familiar with that one.

141
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,700
I think we should probe

142
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,430
the relationship between Ambrose

143
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,430
and Garcia... see what
we can come up with.

144
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,930
Sounds like fun.

145
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,030
Cal?

146
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
What?

147
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,060
Zoe.

148
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,530
Gillian.

149
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,330
Can I talk to you for a minute?

150
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,130
She's calling.

151
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
Cal?

152
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,400
No.

153
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,700
What no?

154
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,200
You know what.

155
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,230
We... We... We have never
worked for her before.

156
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,900
We are not starting now.

157
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,430
It's an interesting case.

158
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,800
No... there are plenty
of interesting cases.

159
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,760
Do you not remember what
it was like after she left?

160
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,530
You wore the same shirt to the
office every day for a month.

161
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,730
I still do.

162
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,200
You saw the head tilt.

163
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,200
She's flirting with you.

164
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,330
No, that's ridiculous.

165
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,100
- She does this to you every time. 
- No.

166
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,960
She is single again, Cal.

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
No, no, she's been
with Roger for what?

168
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,000
For the best part
of a year now, right?

169
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,500
Is she still? Did you ask her?

170
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,200
I don't know, look,
I'm taking the case.

171
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,530
I'll be fine.

172
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,030
- Cal... 
- I'm in complete control of myself...

173
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,000
which is more than
I can say for you,

174
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,300
following me into the men's room.

175
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,900
The women's room, Cal.

176
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,930
The women's room.

177
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,660
Why don't you tell us
what really happened

178
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,130
between you and Frank Ambrose.

179
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,900
I told you nothing happened.

180
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,000
We haven't been friends in years.

181
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,460
Why not?

182
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,960
You grow older, things change.

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,200
Now, I, um...

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,060
Now we have nothing in common.

185
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,760
- Why do you feel contempt for him then? 
- I never said that I don't.

186
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
You're going to have to
learn to lie better than that

187
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,730
if you want a real career
in front of the camera.

188
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,300
Uh, look...

189
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,960
Frank called me
about six months ago.

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He'd just been laid off,

191
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,900
seemed desperate, so I asked him
if there's anything I could do.

192
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,730
That's one of my
favorites, that one.

193
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,430
I mean, it's amazing how
many times people say that

194
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,960
and they don't mean it, right?

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,430
Yeah, well, he asked me for money

196
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,830
and I gave it to him, okay?

197
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,060
You lent a guy money that
you hadn't talked to in years?

198
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, we shared a past.

199
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,030
That meant something to me.

200
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,430
Apparently not to him.

201
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,330
I called Frank a month
ago... see how he was doing,

202
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,260
and that ungrateful son of a bitch

203
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,260
acted like I was squeezing
him for the money he owed me.

204
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,500
And now his boy is accusing
me of burning down his house.

205
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,630
You're damn right I feel contempt.

206
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,900
He sounded convincing.

207
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,530
Yeah, and he looked it.

208
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,130
You said that about
the Ambrose boy.

209
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
I mean, they both can't
be telling the truth.

210
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,560
What, are you losing your touch?

211
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
I'll evaluate the boy.

212
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,600
He may not be able to tell the
difference between fantasy and reality.

213
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,230
AJ may be imagining what he saw.

214
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,830
If he believes in his fantasy,

215
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,760
it could appear that
he's telling the truth.

216
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,430
I'm going to work on something
a little bit more tangible.

217
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,200
I'm going to get
the FBI to do checks

218
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,600
on Garcia and Ambrose.

219
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,230
But feel free to talk to the boy.

220
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,900
Take him to the zoo, if you like.

221
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,630
That's Roger. I should
probably take this.

222
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,900
How's it going between
you two... is it good?

223
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,260
Yeah, it's great.

224
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,400
Hey.

225
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,300
Oh, I love you, too.

226
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,900
I miss you.

227
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,700
- Well, that was a lie. 
- What?

228
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,100
Oh, yeah. Well,
you know, she's been

229
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,430
with Roger for a long time,

230
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,830
and if there was something serious,

231
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,800
- she would have told me,
right?  - Uh-huh, uh-huh.

232
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,930
- Hey, I found out there are more printer... 
- Yeah, could you call

233
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,230
the Ambrose family... see if they
can bring their kid by this afternoon?

234
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,000
Scheduling meetings... fantastic.

235
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,600
- Yeah. 
- Hey, where you going?

236
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,830
I'm going to go help Torres

237
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,030
get started on the
Southeast drive-by shooting.

238
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,930
You know, who better than me to get
inside the world of gangsta rappers.

239
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,730
Sweet place.

240
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,030
For a guy who raps about
being true to the 'hood,

241
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,330
Caden doesn't exactly put
his money where his mouth is.

242
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,460
Detective Riley.

243
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,260
Dr. Foster, Ms. Torres,
thanks for coming.

244
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,630
Is that the, uh...

245
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,600
kid who was murdered?

246
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,160
Yeah. Dante Edwards.

247
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Three nights ago,
he was leaving a club

248
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,000
when he took two bullets
to the chest in a drive-by.

249
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,000
You think Caden shot him?

250
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,200
Caden was seen arguing with Dante

251
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,800
at a party last week.

252
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,330
Dante is part of
Little Sid's entourage.

253
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,300
He's a rival rapper.

254
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,530
He and Caden have a big feud.

255
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,000
Caden's a bad man.

256
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,660
He raps about how he's
killed half a dozen men.

257
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,160
We nail him for this,

258
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,830
we can put him behind
bars where he belongs.

259
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,530
That's what I go for right now.

260
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,700
Now, that looks good.

261
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,960
On to the next.

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,160
You got a moment to
speak to Detective Riley?

263
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,630
I don't talk to cops, man.

264
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,730
My manager will
show you to the door.

265
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,900
Look, I'm sorry. My
cousin's not a snitch.

266
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,100
You know what would
happen to album sales

267
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,360
if people knew you all were here?

268
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,160
Listen, Davis, your cousin
doesn't want to cooperate,

269
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,730
we'll bring him in.

270
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,160
I can dig it.

271
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,800
Everybody, find another
room... the party's over.

272
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Now.

273
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,330
What?

274
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,260
Did you know Dante Edwards?

275
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,230
Wow.

276
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,830
That's a lot of regret

277
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,630
- for a killer. 
- Look, I didn't kill him.

278
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,860
You got a lot of loyal
folks in your entourage.

279
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
Maybe you got one of them to do it.

280
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,400
Let me tell you something.

281
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,800
Look, me and my cousin
grew up with Dante.

282
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,000
He lived three doors down from
us in the Carollsburg projects.

283
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,560
- And you're coming up in here... 
- Cade, Cade, Cade...

284
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
No, no, no. Let me explain some

285
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,060
why I'm upset right now.

286
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,730
The world should know
this is unacceptable to me.

287
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,500
The world should know this,
B, and you're coming up in here

288
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,930
and accusing me

289
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,330
of killing somebody
that I grew up with?

290
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
Are we finished yet?

291
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,000
I haven't heard an alibi.

292
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,530
My cousin and I were here,

293
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,360
watching the Carver-Nova game.

294
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,760
Caden seemed to be
telling the truth.

295
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,760
Yeah... and his
sadness was for real.

296
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,460
You're saying you believe the guy?

297
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,560
The rivalry with Little
Sid's crew, the argument,

298
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,260
both point to Caden.

299
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,960
Okay, but why would a killer
show remorse for his victim?

300
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
Okay...

301
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,960
AJ, what about this one?

302
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,130
That's Santa Claus.

303
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,130
Yeah, it is.

304
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,560
Tell me about Santa.

305
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,930
He has a sleigh and reindeer.

306
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,230
He brings me presents.

307
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,800
Shh.

308
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,500
Quiet.

309
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,200
Have you ever seen Santa?

310
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,060
No.

311
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,330
I always fall asleep.

312
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,900
But I think I heard him

313
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,300
on the roof once.

314
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,700
Shh. I told you. Quiet, now.

315
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,430
Who are you talking to?

316
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,530
That's Penelope.

317
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,800
Quiet. I told you, be quiet.

318
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,830
You did that.

319
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,330
- Eh? 
- You did that.

320
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,500
Penelope did that.

321
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,360
You're making that up.

322
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,200
Now, that's not fair.
She thinks you're cool.

323
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,930
There's no one there.

324
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,630
She told me that she thought
that you were super cool.

325
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,530
You're weird.

326
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,000
Your imaginary friend Penelope?

327
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,260
Yeah, it's the only girl
I know tells me the truth.

328
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,430
Hey.

329
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,830
What? Oh, sorry.

330
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,200
So...

331
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,460
it's clear AJ can
tell the difference

332
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,900
between reality and fantasy, right?

333
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,630
Yes, but that was your fantasy.

334
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,300
He's a little fuzzier
when it comes to his own,

335
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,200
I mean, he's still at the age
where he thinks Santa's real.

336
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,660
So you think he imagined Garcia
running away from the fire?

337
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,330
Yeah, I think so.

338
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,830
But I'll still get
him to draw some more.

339
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,760
It's a more direct
line to his unconscious.

340
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm not sure we'll need it.

341
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,360
We still have a
receptionist here, don't we?

342
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,830
Jack Garcia wasn't the only person

343
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,830
that Frank Ambrose owed money to.

344
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,660
The guy's under a mountain
of debt... credit cards,

345
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,800
student loans, you name
it. Take a look at this.

346
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,760
Homeowner's insurance.

347
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,630
Housing prices have
dropped, but his home

348
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,230
was insured at the value it
had before the market collapsed.

349
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,200
His house was worth more to him

350
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,700
in ashes than it was standing.

351
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,930
You think I'd burn
down my own house?

352
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,200
I lost everything in that fire.

353
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,700
You made a lot of money
when the house went down.

354
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,630
That doesn't make me an arsonist.

355
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,460
Jack Garcia told us
how desperate you were.

356
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,730
Jack Garcia is the
one who did this.

357
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,360
He's a user.

358
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,260
He lives off the suffering
of everybody else.

359
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,230
Now, you believe that, don't you?

360
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,960
Come on! My son saw him.

361
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,300
What is the matter with you people?

362
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,560
So, how long are you stuck here?

363
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,430
My doctor said I could go
home at the end of the week.

364
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,200
It's not so bad.

365
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,060
It's been kind of cool here.

366
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,460
Really?

367
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,360
All my friends came by.

368
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,600
And it's nice having
my family around.

369
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,100
My dad hasn't left.

370
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, yeah? What about your mom?

371
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,830
Yeah, she's been here, too.

372
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,200
Do you believe Mr. Ambrose?

373
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,660
Yeah. Most of what he said.

374
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,430
But I'm interested in
what the daughter told you.

375
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,500
The family would've
been through a lot

376
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,860
and the kid would've
seen the worst of it.

377
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,160
What have you got?

378
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
A lot of anger from Maggie.

379
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,730
Towards mom.

380
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,030
Mom?

381
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,200
What are you doing?

382
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,600
Looking at Mum.

383
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,530
How did you know Mr. Garcia?

384
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,300
He's friends with my daddy.

385
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,860
She's holding her breath.

386
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,160
Anxiety.

387
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,930
I think I know why
Maggie's so angry.

388
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,200
That's great, AJ, okay.
Now, can you draw for me

389
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,460
what you saw the night of the fire?

390
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm not done. That's all right.

391
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,330
I don't need to talk to AJ.

392
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,530
Uh, what was your relationship

393
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,330
with the man that
your son's accused?

394
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,030
Excuse me?

395
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,860
Were you having an
affair with Jack Garcia?

396
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,730
How dare you accuse me of having
an affair in front of my son!

397
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah. You're avoiding the question.

398
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,660
Are you having an
affair with Jack Garcia?

399
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,860
I'm getting my son and I'm going.

400
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,860
That's fine, but we'll
be back with a subpoena.

401
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,200
I suppose we could always
talk to your husband

402
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,430
and find out what
he knows about it.

403
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,230
Nine months ago, I was out shopping

404
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,430
and Jack walked up
to me in the store.

405
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,330
He had so much confidence.

406
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,300
Frank had lost his job.

407
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,530
We were really struggling.

408
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,330
We had stopped having
sex altogether by then.

409
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,860
So you had an affair?

410
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,500
Every minute with Jack was a chance

411
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,430
to be with somebody who
didn't know me or my problems.

412
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,300
I thought about leaving my husband,

413
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,960
but the children and I
are all that he has left,

414
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,300
and so I broke it off with Jack.

415
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,300
How did he take it?

416
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,300
He understood.

417
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,900
Look, this has nothing
to do with the fire.

418
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,330
It's easier to
believe that, isn't it?

419
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,600
I don't know what AJ saw,
but I know Jack Garcia

420
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,730
and he would never do
something like this to us.

421
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,430
Because of our daughter.

422
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,260
And sex was never the problem.

423
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,100
Well, you wanted to know
why I never cheated on you.

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,500
What about you?

425
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,930
You would've known.

426
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,160
Besides, I wanted to kill you.

427
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
I never wanted to hurt you.

428
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,300
I think that's what we
should focus on here.

429
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,760
Affairs make for
angry spouses, right?

430
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,160
What could possibly make me want

431
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,760
to burn down the Ambroses' house?

432
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,030
Your husband was having an
affair with Cheryl Ambrose.

433
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,300
Oh, she knew already.

434
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,000
He told me two weeks ago.

435
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,030
If you'd already told your wife,
then why didn't you tell us?

436
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,360
I wanted to, but she...

437
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,900
I told him not to.

438
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,400
It's not something I
wanted to see in the papers.

439
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,530
Look, the idea that my wife
would do this is absurd.

440
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,230
Is it?

441
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,760
She's still angry.

442
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,800
Not at Cheryl Ambrose.

443
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,730
I knew when Jack started

444
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,530
in front of the
camera, it would be...

445
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,230
different.

446
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,460
The Jack Garcia you see on
TV is not the man I married.

447
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,060
But marriage is about

448
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,000
figuring out how to make it
through when things change.

449
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,830
- She was lying to herself. 
- So, that's it?

450
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,260
That's it, then? People just
change and then they move on?

451
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,400
Are you saying that I'm
the one that changed?

452
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,430
You left me.

453
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,760
You left.

454
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,400
Yeah, I left because of you.

455
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,630
Oh, it's my fault now?

456
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,860
No, I'm saying you
should take a hard look

457
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,060
at what happened before
you start blaming me.

458
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,730
Hey, I saw what happened!
I saw what was happening!

459
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,760
You know, I could see the doubt.

460
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,900
I could see the doubt

461
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,600
when you were standing
on the bloody altar!

462
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,100
Everyone has doubts, Cal! Everyone!

463
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,030
At the altar, with their
friends, in the maternity ward,

464
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,430
staring at the very best thing
that's ever happened to them,

465
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,300
but that doesn't mean it's
the only thing that they feel.

466
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,130
But you, you just...

467
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,660
you saw every doubt, every fear.

468
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,530
By the end, that was
all you could see.

469
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,960
You couldn't let go of anything.

470
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,700
I was trying to be honest.

471
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,330
Yes... I know. I know.

472
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,460
But I can tell you, sweetheart,
there really is such a thing

473
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
as too much honesty in a marriage.

474
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,630
So, what do you want?
You'd rather be with someone

475
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,530
- who doesn't really know you, then? 
- How about someone

476
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,300
who doesn't need to
know everything about me?

477
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,460
Who I can surprise on his birthday.

478
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,060
Who doesn't need to point out

479
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,200
every time I'm even remotely
attracted to another man.

480
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,630
Someone with his head up his ass?

481
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,630
Someone who doesn't
study my eyebrows

482
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,930
when I'm standing in a thong.

483
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,930
Why are you here, then?

484
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,900
Why did you hire me, eh?

485
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,500
It's a tough case.

486
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,200
Doing my thing right now.

487
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,730
Living it up, baby,
that's how we do it,

488
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,000
you know?

489
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,300
That Caden?

490
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,400
Yeah. And Little Sid and his crew

491
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,160
at an album release
party last year.

492
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,330
The victim, Dante Edwards,
is behind him on the right.

493
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,530
They come up to me
like, "Little Sid,

494
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,460
please take me away
from this paper wrapper!"

495
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,530
I'm about to put a gun
in your face right now.

496
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,100
What's up, man?

497
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,760
Check out the fake anger.

498
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,060
If his anger were real, his
upper eyelids would be raised

499
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,030
and his lips would be narrower.

500
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,700
The rivalry's fake?

501
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,900
That feud is big business.

502
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,560
Sold a lot of albums last year.

503
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,730
So then why would Caden

504
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,560
or anyone else in his
crew want to kill Dante?

505
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,860
I'm thinking that the
murderer's not in Caden's crew.

506
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,860
Okay.

507
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,400
Let's take a look at our victim.

508
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,930
All right.

509
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,930
Which group does

510
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,030
Dante look like, the men on

511
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,460
the left or the men on the right?

512
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,930
Um...

513
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,800
The men on the left?

514
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,360
Oh, you have a sixth sense.

515
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,100
By that, I mean you see gay people.

516
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,530
You think Dante's gay?

517
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,530
Yeah, and so do you.

518
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,100
All the men on the left are gay.

519
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,200
A new study in

520
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,560
the Journal of
Experimental Psychology

521
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,430
showed that most people
can identify gay men

522
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,900
by face alone.

523
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,230
It has to do with the pattern
of muscle tension in the face.

524
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,400
And...

525
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,800
check out Little
Sid's newest album.

526
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,630
# It's my guitar on target #

527
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,630
# Like Dirty Harry, I'm
gonna make your day #

528
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,530
# I'm gonna take your ass out,
'cause your ass is gay... #

529
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,730
Oh.

530
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,500
Little Sid is one big homophobe.

531
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:54,030
If he found out one of
his entourage was gay,

532
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,500
no telling what he would've done.

533
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,630
We're looking at the wrong rapper.

534
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,900
All right, take a look at these.

535
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,360
More drawings?

536
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Yeah.

537
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,860
So what do they mean?

538
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,230
Uh, well, here, the arsonist

539
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,560
has a tail,

540
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,060
and there, he's, uh,
he's breathing fire.

541
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,260
So they're becoming more....

542
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,360
More elaborate.

543
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,030
Exactly.

544
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,730
If it were a true memory,

545
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,630
he'd stick to what he remembers.

546
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,760
But AJ's embellishing his story.

547
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,960
Wait,

548
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,630
so he did see Jack
Garcia or he didn't?

549
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,700
Which one is it?

550
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,760
Well, AJ believes his story is true

551
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,630
the same way he
believes in Santa Claus.

552
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,160
Somebody he trusts
told him it was true.

553
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
It's an implanted memory.

554
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,800
Jack Garcia didn't start that fire.

555
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,730
We need to go talk
to AJ's parents again.

556
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,030
One of them may be using
their son to frame that man.

557
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,330
Maybe you didn't leave Jack Garcia.

558
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,330
Maybe he left you.

559
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,760
- What? 
- You hated him

560
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,300
for taking away what
little joy you had,

561
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,460
didn't you? You hated him,

562
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,560
you hated your life, so
you set fire to your house,

563
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,900
and you told your son
to say it was Jack.

564
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,830
You think that I'd
burn down my own house?

565
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,600
That fire killed my mother.

566
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,600
People have done crazier
things at the end of an affair.

567
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,030
Cheryl was having
an affair with Jack?

568
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,100
You had two strong
motives, Mr. Ambrose.

569
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,800
Make a bundle of money on the house

570
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,860
and get back at the
man who stole your wife.

571
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,830
You knew she was
miserable in your marriage.

572
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,500
You had nothing to lose.

573
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,630
I had no idea that she
was having an affair.

574
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,600
I almost left my family for Jack.

575
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,860
Why would I want him in jail?

576
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,930
I had nothing

577
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,500
to do with this.

578
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,260
I would never put my
family at risk like that.

579
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,900
It wasn't Cheryl.

580
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,300
No.

581
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,430
Emotion she was
showing was genuine.

582
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,930
She's still fond of Garcia.

583
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,230
That's a shame.

584
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,700
But it'll help me make
the case against Frank.

585
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,700
What?

586
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,730
He had the motive,

587
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,260
the means and plenty of opportunity

588
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,760
to implant the memory in his son.

589
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,230
No, he was truly surprised.

590
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,330
He... well, hang on.

591
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,530
Cheryl was having
an affair with Jack?

592
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,430
See, he had no idea.

593
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,560
If he was surprised,

594
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,060
it was because we
knew about the affair.

595
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,330
Nah, you're wrong.

596
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,760
Oh, well, there's something

597
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,230
you're always certain about.

598
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,560
You don't see what I see.

599
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,230
You know, you... you really
used to be so charming

600
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,460
back before you became God.

601
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,130
You really don't care

602
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,230
what we think about
this case, do you?

603
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,530
- I didn't say that. 
- Yeah, you did.

604
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,000
- No, I didn't. I didn't. 
- Yeah. You did.

605
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,530
Something's off.

606
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,800
You split up with Roger?

607
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,130
Roger and I are fine.

608
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,400
I don't believe you, Zoe.

609
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,000
Fine.

610
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,500
You want to know the truth?

611
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,030
Yep.

612
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,800
Roger proposed to me.

613
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,860
He wants to marry me, all right?

614
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,600
You just got to telling
him about it now?

615
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,460
I'll got to get back to the office.

616
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,560
Have a wonderful
dinner, sweetheart.

617
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,730
Oh, yeah.

618
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,030
It's gonna be a blast.

619
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,960
What up?

620
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,730
Whoa! Speaking of fine ladies...

621
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,030
Damn!

622
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,060
What do we have here?

623
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,300
Easy, big guy. She's with me.

624
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,430
Such a shame.

625
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,260
'Cause I don't talk
to the po-po, baby.

626
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,900
Guess that means you
got nothing to say

627
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,530
about Dante Edwards' murder?

628
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,700
I guess not.

629
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,460
Ooh, now there's some real anger.

630
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,230
You must have been pretty angry

631
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,000
when you found out
Dante was gay, huh?

632
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,360
Dante was a smart dude, all right?

633
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,200
He got the business.

634
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,000
He knew to keep it on the DL.

635
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,230
Besides, I always knew which way

636
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,300
- he was swinging. 
- Huh.

637
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,900
No disgust.

638
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,430
But your music's
full of hate for gays.

639
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,300
Look, I got records to sell.

640
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,660
So if I got to hate,
yeah, I'm gonna hate.

641
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,030
But I ain't have no problem

642
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,300
with Dante doing
his Broke back thing.

643
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,300
Oh, I see.

644
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,160
You're not homophobic,
you're just an ass.

645
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,660
Look, little po-po lady,

646
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,930
you don't know me, all right?

647
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,600
And you don't know
nothing about my business.

648
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,430
Maybe not, but I do
read people pretty well,

649
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,660
and you can't seem to say

650
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
Dante's name without showing anger.

651
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,900
Look, I found this
kid on the street.

652
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,860
I make him the hottest
mixer in the game,

653
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,760
and he go and run off with Caden?

654
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,600
So you had a grudge.

655
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,860
Hell, yeah, I had a grudge.

656
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,960
But that's no need
for gunplay, all right?

657
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,530
I'm a hustler, man, a entertainer.

658
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,860
I'm not no murderer.

659
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,900
Those guns are part of my "image".

660
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,160
Just for show.

661
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Okay.

662
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,130
Any idea why Dante left?

663
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,400
I offered the boy a raise,

664
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,200
a new crib, but see, he
didn't want none of that.

665
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,500
So when you two
guys figure that out,

666
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,430
then we'll have
something to talk about.

667
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,430
Uh... uh.

668
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,700
Hey, Dad.

669
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,000
Hey. What?

670
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,030
Are you okay?

671
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,830
I'm fine. Yeah.

672
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,100
I hate this picture.

673
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,670
Let me see.

674
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,130
Oh, no, I like that one.

675
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,300
Why?

676
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,300
You and mom spent

677
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,870
the whole day arguing about

678
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,470
your research trip to New Guinea.

679
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,300
Yeah. We were happy then.

680
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,970
Well, look at the
smiles, they're real.

681
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,730
Well, guess it's good mom wasn't

682
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,170
the only one that was delusional.

683
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,530
Thank you.

684
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,870
She's not wearing
the ring, you know.

685
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,930
Eh?

686
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,970
She's not wearing the ring.

687
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,100
Why?

688
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,430
Come on, why do you think?

689
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,330
I mean, she's not sure about Roger.

690
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,330
She still thinks
she's in love with you.

691
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,530
What?

692
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,670
I mean, I see what's
going on with you two.

693
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,870
I always do.

694
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
I always have.

695
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,800
That's true enough.

696
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,800
Who are you calling?

697
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,700
Your mum.

698
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,700
Ugh! Get out of here!

699
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,970
We've got nothing else
to say to you people.

700
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,530
We're not here for you.

701
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,500
Hi, Maggie.

702
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,470
How are you feeling? You all right?

703
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,000
Not so good, eh?

704
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,980
How long have you known
about your mum and Mr. Garcia?

705
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,570
Oh, my God.

706
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,570
- She's a child. 
- Oh, she already knows.

707
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
You've known for quite
some time, haven't you?

708
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm tired, daddy.

709
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,700
Please, leave her alone.

710
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,830
Sorry, we can't do
that, Mrs. Ambrose.

711
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,830
Did you see them together, love?

712
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,900
Was that what happened?

713
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,500
It was, wasn't it?

714
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,430
Your dad didn't
know, but you did, eh?

715
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,200
Yeah?

716
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,230
Did you hear your parents fighting?

717
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,330
Must have been scary.

718
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,500
You afraid

719
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,930
Mr. Garcia was going
to break up your family.

720
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,470
I heard her.

721
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,970
I heard my mom.

722
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,570
She was on the phone.

723
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,000
She was talking to Mr. Garcia.

724
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,830
And...

725
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,370
she told him... she loved him.

726
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,970
And that she was thinking about

727
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,370
running away with him.

728
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,530
Oh, Maggie.

729
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,570
I thought if Mr. Garcia

730
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,200
got blamed for the fire,

731
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,500
they'd take him away...

732
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,400
... and we'd stay a family.

733
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,630
Baby, I wasn't.

734
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,300
I wasn't ever going to leave you.

735
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,470
I was just confused.

736
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
You weren't supposed to
know about any of this.

737
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,030
I was never going to leave you.

738
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,600
You burned down the
house to save your family,

739
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,430
didn't you?

740
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,670
You set the fire and...

741
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,430
and told you brother it
was Mr. Garcia, right?

742
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,130
I told

743
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,730
AJ to say it was Mr. Garcia.

744
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,900
I told him over and over

745
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,500
until he believed it.

746
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,500
But that fire,

747
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,500
it killed Nana.

748
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,200
I didn't start the fire.

749
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,700
It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart.

750
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,030
- I swear, I didn't. 
- I know.

751
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,630
- It's okay, it's okay. 
- Shh.

752
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,170
We love you so much.

753
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,500
It's okay.

754
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,800
Mommy...

755
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,970
We're all together now.

756
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,630
Nobody's going anywhere, okay?

757
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,600
We tell ourselves
we can protect them,

758
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,600
try to shield them.

759
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,430
But in the end,
they see everything.

760
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,700
- This is News 7 at 11:00. 
- Oh, my God.

761
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,900
Well, the FBI's just
been called into this,

762
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,530
but from what we can tell,
the blaze started this morning.

763
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,070
And yes, we think it's
maybe the same person

764
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,230
who burned down the Ambrose
house earlier this week.

765
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,230
The FBI is currently
conducting our investigation.

766
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,970
FBI thinks we're looking
at a serial arsonist.

767
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,830
Are we sure the two
fires are connected?

768
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,030
Positive.

769
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,300
Same chemical accelerant,
same point of origin.

770
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,530
And serial arsonists don't
stop, they just get bolder.

771
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,800
Yeah, well, this one was
set in broad daylight.

772
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,970
That's bolder.

773
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,630
Yeah, we've got to find this guy.

774
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,900
Mr. and Mrs. Craig?

775
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,430
This is AUSA

776
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,570
Zoe Landau.

777
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,030
She's running the investigation.

778
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,800
Can you tell us what happened?

779
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,530
I was on my way to work
when I got the call. I...

780
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,300
I came home right away.

781
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,700
Aaron was already here.

782
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,430
I, uh, just gotten back from a jog.

783
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,630
The back of the house
was all up in flames.

784
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,130
I tried to save what I could.

785
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,900
- So, you lost everything? 
- Yeah.

786
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,200
You can't imagine
how horrible we feel.

787
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,570
No, I can't imagine.

788
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,100
We need to talk to you.

789
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,570
Caden's not going to
talk to the cops again.

790
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,400
Well, that's why I
left them outside.

791
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,370
I just need five minutes.

792
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,730
Why didn't you tell us

793
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,270
Dante was coming to work for you?

794
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,870
How about, it's none
of your damn business?

795
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,430
Look, last time I was here,

796
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,270
when I was asking you about Dante,

797
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,970
I expected...

798
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,500
anger, hate.

799
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,330
But all I saw was sadness.

800
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,170
And then I found out Dante was gay.

801
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,800
Something you knew all along?

802
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,330
Yeah, I thought so.

803
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,500
I think I know why

804
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,370
he left Little Sid
to come work for you.

805
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,930
- Okay, lady, you're out of line. 
- Am I?

806
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,070
Caden, what exactly was your
relationship with Dante Edwards?

807
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,000
That's enough, all right?

808
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,970
Why were you guys arguing at
the club the night he was killed?

809
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,670
You're not just gonna... like this.

810
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,630
Was it 'cause he was
threatening to come out?

811
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,330
'Cause he was threatening
to take you with him?

812
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,000
- Okay, you know what? 
- Is that why you killed him?

813
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,330
You don't know what
you're talking about.

814
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,170
I had nothing to do
with Dante's death.

815
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,330
You didn't, did you?

816
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,800
You really did care for him, huh?

817
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,800
You loved him.

818
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,270
You know they buried him today?

819
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,070
And I couldn't even
go to the funeral.

820
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,030
Whoa...

821
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,830
...those are some
pretty strong feelings.

822
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,330
Contempt.

823
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,330
Disgust.

824
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,830
Is that true, B?

825
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,130
Is that how you felt about us?

826
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,130
Well...

827
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,900
I told you before.

828
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,900
I thought the
relationship was unwise.

829
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,300
Where you were the night
of Dante Edwards' murder?

830
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,100
I was here watching the
game, like I told you before.

831
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,500
That's a lie.

832
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,800
Cay, would you tell her?

833
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,270
Cay, would you tell this woman?

834
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,370
What you want me to tell her?

835
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,830
Cay...

836
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,130
That you were here with me?

837
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,170
'Cause you wasn't.

838
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,730
Where were you, B?

839
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,270
It was only a matter...

840
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,330
Where the hell were you, B?!

841
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,270
... before someone outed you two.

842
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,770
We built this together...

843
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,930
me and you.

844
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,230
I was protecting us.

845
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,430
Protecting us?

846
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,730
What? You forgot?

847
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,430
Cuz, come on, man.

848
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,470
What it was like
coming from nothing?

849
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,870
This house, the cars.

850
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,030
Caden...

851
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,400
You don't get any of this

852
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,870
if they know the truth about you.

853
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,270
I would've had Dante.

854
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,770
He would still be alive.

855
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,270
I have no idea who
Frank Ambrose is.

856
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,170
Why would I burn down his house?

857
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,600
I don't know. Maybe
you like starting fires.

858
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,800
Look, you have the wrong guy.

859
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,900
I didn't burn down anything.

860
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,140
What? You certainly

861
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,640
got a kick out of seeing
your house in ashes.

862
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,370
You can't imagine
how horrible we feel.

863
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,970
You could barely contain yourself.

864
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,470
Laurel and I... our
marriage is over.

865
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,000
We wanted to split up
for months, but we were

866
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,200
stuck in that house.

867
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,640
You couldn't sell it?

868
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,970
The value of the house had tanked.

869
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,140
We couldn't afford to sell it,

870
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,440
but now, with the insurance payout,

871
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,270
we can both go our separate ways.

872
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,800
Frankly, it's a relief.

873
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,800
Do you believe him?

874
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,700
Yeah, but I got a question for you.

875
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,440
Is your wife cheating on you?

876
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,940
Well, uh, we both had our
share of indiscretions.

877
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,540
That's a yes, then?

878
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,070
Cal?

879
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,400
Who's your favorite TV reporter?

880
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,500
Hmm?

881
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,470
Is this one?

882
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,070
Yes, Jim, they do think
that this fire was started

883
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,730
by the same serial
arsonist, and the FBI...

884
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,900
Mr. Garcia?

885
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,630
- ... to further investigate. 
- Busy day?

886
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,630
As you can see behind me,
the fire's been brought

887
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,770
under control, and they want
everyone in the neighborhood

888
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,000
to know that you're safe, and
you can stay in your homes...

889
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,100
Just doing my job.

890
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,500
This is Jack Garcia reporting live.

891
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,500
You didn't stay around
to interview the victims.

892
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,100
I thought you were
Mr. Human Interest Guy.

893
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,370
Of course, interviewing
another lover

894
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,870
whose house is in ruins could
be a little awkward, right?

895
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,170
I don't know what
you're talking about.

896
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,170
That's a lie.

897
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,500
So, what is it?

898
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,170
You feed your ego by having
sex with married women,

899
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,700
and then, when they
grow tired of you,

900
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,970
you burn down their houses?

901
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,470
I had nothing to do with
either of those fires.

902
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,130
But you were having
sex with Laurel Craig.

903
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,370
Yeah, I thought so.

904
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,870
See, the thing is, I believe you.

905
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,300
I don't think you started
either one of those fires.

906
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,030
How long have you known
about Laurel Craig?

907
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,170
- Must have made you feel powerless. 
- Excuse me?

908
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,830
Arson's about power.

909
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,070
And in female arsonists,
it's about revenge.

910
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,370
You're afraid that's
true, aren't you?

911
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,570
Right?

912
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,970
We have the FBI searching
your home right now.

913
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,200
Tell 'em, Sarah. Tell
'em it's not true.

914
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,670
I looked at all the
numbers in your phone.

915
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,670
I looked at your E-mail.

916
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,800
You planned a vacation with Laurel.

917
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,400
You took Cheryl to a benefit.

918
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,400
Honey, I...

919
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,570
Don't!

920
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,200
You humiliated me.

921
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,600
You and those women took

922
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,000
everything from me.

923
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,870
So you took everything from them.

924
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,430
# Four seasons in one day #

925
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,770
# Lying in the depths
of your imagination #

926
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,830
# Worlds above and worlds below #

927
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:24,400
# The sun shines on
the black clouds #

928
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:29,870
# Up the creek and
through the mill #

929
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,330
# Like all the things
you can't explain #

930
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:40,730
# Four seasons in one day #

931
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:45,930
# Blood dries up #

932
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:52,030
# Like rain, like rain #

933
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,130
# Fills my cup #

934
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:03,470
# Like four seasons in one day. #

935
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,830
Hey.

936
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,070
Hey.

937
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,230
Heard you did all right.

938
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,400
Yeah.

939
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,730
Yeah, we did,
actually. It was okay.

940
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,500
Torres did, too, on the drive-by

941
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,530
with a little help from Loker.

942
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,200
How did it go with Zoe?

943
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,730
It's good, actually.

944
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,300
Yeah.

945
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,300
Yeah.

946
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,400
Roger's proposed to her.

947
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,500
You okay?

948
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,570
You know what I miss?

949
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
I miss the arguments.

950
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,130
You do?

951
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,970
What?

952
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,300
Probably not the best
time to tell her, though.

953
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,300
Absolutely not.

954
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,070
Thanks for your help on this.

955
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,130
My office is grateful.

956
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,130
Your office is welcome.

957
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,130
We're not a total
disaster together.

958
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,470
What?

959
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,730
I mean, working together.

960
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,100
Oh. And I know.

961
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,000
I should've told you about Roger.

962
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,630
It's just... I don't know.

963
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,970
I guess it just never
seemed like the right time...

964
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,970
No. Hey, so, if, um,
Roger makes you happy,

965
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,900
right, then we'll make it work.

966
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,570
For Emily, I mean.

967
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,200
Yeah. Thanks.

968
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,570
You should probably
wear the ring, though.

969
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,930
- Oh. 
- It's a little confusing.

970
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,000
Okay.

971
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,330
All right, then.

972
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,870
Bye.

973
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,970
What was that?

974
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,800
Mom, I'm home.

975
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,300
Katie's mom is sick, so
we're staying here tonight.

976
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,500
That would be our daughter.

977
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,000
Oops.
