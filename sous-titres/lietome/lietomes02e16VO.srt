1
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:29,089
Check this out.

2
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,409
You could get a lot of dough
for that thing.

3
00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:41,868
Watch it.

4
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,045
What is that?

5
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,073
Someone's downstairs!

6
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:49,215
Call the police.

7
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:52,340
Where are you going?

8
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,685
No! Richard!

9
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:18,792
Group therapy folks,

10
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,873
report to the kitchen for KP duty.

11
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,936
Everybody else,
I'll see you in the common room.

12
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,459
Ava, come here.

13
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,583
Girl, you're gonna get me
in trouble.

14
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,963
OK, what's up?

15
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,257
Shut up two seconds
and I'll tell you.

16
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:35,219
Keep this for me, but you can't let
anyone see it or know you've got it.

17
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,555
- Where did you get that?
- Just promise.

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,057
You know I don't do promises.

19
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,184
Forget your stupid rules.
Just promise me.

20
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,035
- Or give it back.
- All right, I promise.

21
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,410
Ava, Marly, you got somewhere to be?

22
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,942
Yeah, I had an eyelash.

23
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:53,177
Yeah, it's still here.

24
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:55,396
- My wishes never come true.
- Let's go.

25
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,002
Calm down.
Slow down.

26
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,539
Are you actually praying?

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Of course not.

28
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,624
That is so insulting.

29
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:09,795
You'll get your license
when you're good and ready.

30
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,423
- But I've been 16 for months.
- Which is my point exactly.

31
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:17,219
Parallel park just here.

32
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,130
- You get one shot.
- All right.

33
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,515
- All right, pull up.
- I am.

34
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,516
Pull up.

35
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,601
I am.

36
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,019
A little bit further,

37
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,864
All right, stop.

38
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,236
No cheating.

39
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,738
It's technology, dad.

40
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,281
The future is now.

41
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:42,260
- Puppy!
- Wait. What? Where?

42
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,547
Did I hit something?

43
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:47,833
I believe so.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,675
It's not like I enjoyed it
or anything.

45
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,946
And I am paying for all the damage,
aren't I?

46
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,548
Don't hold a grudge.

47
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:05,726
Your face gets pinched.

48
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:08,092
Look at your mum.

49
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:12,570
I need you to listen to something.
And tell me what to do.

50
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:14,360
- All right, slow down.
- Just listen.

51
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,734
<i>Ria, you have to come get me.</i>

52
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,823
<i>Something happened.
I'm not sure what,</i>

53
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,241
<i>but something bad.</i>

54
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,910
<i>I'm not even supposed to be
on the phone. Please, I need...</i>

55
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:27,706
She sounds pretty desperate.

56
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,947
Yeah, well,
she's a liar and a delinquent,

57
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:31,836
which is she's been locked up
for 7 months.

58
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:33,754
You feel her message is a lie?

59
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,965
I don't know.
I never know with her.

60
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,796
Who is this girl to you?

61
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:41,428
She's my sister.

62
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,834
The <i><font color="#ff0000">Lie</font> <font color="#ffffff">to</font><font color="#ff0000"> team</font></i> presents:

63
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,776
Épisode 216: <i>Delinquent</i>

00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,315

www.seriessub.com

66
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,238
www.u-sub.net

67
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:24,926
20 bucks says
those cops are here for Ava.

68
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,225
Sisterly love.

69
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,006
Half-sister.

70
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:31,009
The degenerate paternal half.

71
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:32,938
- I.D., please.
- Thanks.

72
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,500
Again, Ava is in solitary.

73
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,885
She's not allowed visitors.
No exceptions.

74
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:41,280
Can you just tell me if it had
anything to do with the cops we saw?

75
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,656
I can't discuss it.

76
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:45,367
- Grow a pair.
- Excuse me?

77
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,994
I was telling her to grow a pair

78
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,067
of testicles.

79
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:51,999
Metaphorically speaking,
'cause you're stonewalling.

80
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,085
Which is what people do when they have
something to hide. What are you hiding?

81
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,756
- Enough of this. Come here.
- What?

82
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,929
<i>Ria, you have to come get me.
Something happened.</i>

83
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:07,264
<i>I'm not sure what,
but something bad.</i>

84
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,183
<i>I'm not even supposed to be
on the phone.</i>

85
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,392
<i>Please, I need...</i>

86
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,679
All I can tell you
is that Ava's friend Marly

87
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:19,485
seems to have run away last night.

88
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,074
So you locked Ava up?

89
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,204
Why am I doing all the talking?

90
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:27,490
She's your sister.
Go on, say something. Go on.

91
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,595
All right.

92
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:31,990
So you locked up my sister?

93
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:33,360
That's brilliant, then.

94
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:35,221
Until she decides to share
what she knows

95
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:37,252
about how Marly evaded
our security system, yes.

96
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:40,161
You realize isolation
will reinforce her distrust

97
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:43,300
of authority and make her
even less likely to open up.

98
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,094
You must be a psychologist.

99
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:46,622
I must be.

100
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,495
There's really nothing I can do.

101
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,933
My sister,

102
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,018
my baby sister.

103
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,980
They won't let her eat.
They won't let her sleep.

104
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,690
The warden won't let me see her.

105
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,858
She's so scared and alone,

106
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,873
and now there's this girl
who's missing.

107
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:05,816
Now...

108
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:07,899
You take me to Ava

109
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,180
or I'll take that phone message
and these tears

110
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:12,079
to a friend of mine
at the local news.

111
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,329
Dax.

112
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,631
Tell Dr. Burns Ava has visitors.

113
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,717
I'd like him to observe.

114
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:41,066
What's with the old white guy?

115
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:43,193
I'm your sister's boss.

116
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,570
- The lie guy?
- Yep.

117
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:48,073
- You brought the lie guy.
- Ava, what happened last night?

118
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:50,284
- Like you care.
- I'm here.

119
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,119
I care.

120
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,751
You're super sexy.
You want to make out?

121
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:01,055
Absolutely.
Climb on board, darling.

122
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:05,549
- She's testing him.
- Ya think?

123
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,344
Sorry. I'll hold the condescension.

124
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,724
- You like making people uncomfortable.
- Yeah, I do.

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,809
How about you?

126
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,939
- Why so scared, then?
- I'm not scared.

127
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,649
The man is a deception expert.

128
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:24,032
Is it Marly?

129
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,653
I'll take that as a yes, actually.

130
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:32,618
You remind me of your sister

131
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,827
2 years ago.

132
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,455
A completely open book,
trying desperately to be inscrutable.

133
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,752
So why did you leave a message
on your sister's machine?

134
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,796
- I wanted to get out of here.
- Why?

135
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,045
Look around.

136
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,841
I get in one cop's face one time,
they toss me in juvie.

137
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,647
That's not all that happened.

138
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,438
They share a dad.

139
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,722
I gather he was pretty useless.

140
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,388
Stage four alcoholic.

141
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:57,059
Ava grew up being beaten

142
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,651
during his blackouts.

143
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:00,483
The mother ODed when she was 10.

144
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,034
Ava was in the next room.

145
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,221
And then she went into the system
when she needed intensive therapy.

146
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:08,779
The girl has been here for 6 months.
It's the first time family's shown up.

147
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,262
Dax should know.
He used to be a resident.

148
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:12,783
Now I'm a success story.

149
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:17,079
My social worker says
I have a recurrent shoplifting problem.

150
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:19,790
I say this ass deserves good denim.

151
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:21,166
It's a nice ass.

152
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:24,579
If I need something,
who's gonna get it for me but me?

153
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,005
If wanted out of here so bad,
why did you call me and hang up?

154
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,674
I heard somebody coming. I freaked.

155
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,168
Where's Marly?

156
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,347
I don't know.

157
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:38,892
- I don't believe her. Do you?
- Not for a second.

158
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,066
Fine.

159
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,773
I saw Marly last night.
She was sneaking out.

160
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,485
Crap.

161
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,376
- What's that?
- Lockdown.

162
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,220
Someone's hurt, right?

163
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:57,419
I'm a doctor.

164
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,667
Let me guess. It's Marly, right?

165
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:20,932
Marly's dead.

166
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,187
You can just say it.

167
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,606
Somebody hit her in the head
hard enough to kill her.

168
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,291
The police are investigating.

169
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:32,404
Whatever. You think they'll let me
go back to my room now?

170
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:38,327
You said that you followed Marly
last night when she snuck out.

171
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,120
- So?
- And your message said

172
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,207
that something bad happened.

173
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,707
- Ava, what did you see?
- Nothing.

174
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:47,974
You're lying.

175
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,673
She is lying, right?

176
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:57,245
All right, enough.
This is ridiculous.

177
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,980
- My turn.
- What are you doing?

178
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,676
You killed her, right?

179
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,518
- No, I didn't!
- Admit it.

180
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:06,188
- You bashed her head in.
- No, I didn't!

181
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,024
I think you're brilliant.
The way you manipulate your sister.

182
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,209
You play on all that guilt
she carries around for...

183
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,278
not being able to protect you
from your father.

184
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,992
But the funny thing is, right,
I don't have that problem.

185
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,496
Now, your friend is dead.

186
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,713
You can play tough all you like,
but you loved her.

187
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:28,710
You loved her like a sister.

188
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:33,875
That's why I'm gonna help you.

189
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,176
But first you gotta tell me
what you know.

190
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,675
You tell me or I'm gonna leave.

191
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,832
I'm gonna leave,
your sister's gonna leave

192
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:42,975
and you're gonna be stuck here
on you're own.

193
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,957
And we will not come back,
so tell me what you know.

194
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:49,356
She was pregnant.

195
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,692
Marly?
Who's the father?

196
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,568
- I don't know.
- Lie.

197
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,781
She was always crying
after she'd visit Dr. Burns. Ask him.

198
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,494
That's not good enough. I'm off.

199
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,035
- Nice knowing you.
- Wait!

200
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,430
Last night...

201
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,415
I heard her scream.

202
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,944
I didn't try to help her. I ran.

203
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:11,593
I was scared.

204
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,780
It's my fault she's dead.

205
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,955
The police want to talk to me,
you have no authority to be here.

206
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,353
Dr. Lightman is
under contract to the city of DC.

207
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:25,702
And I'll be liaising
with the metropolitan PD.

208
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:28,024
Enough
with the jurisdictional pissing contest.

209
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,288
You got a murderer in your facility.

210
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:33,829
Which means that your kids are in danger
and 1 of them is my associate's sister,

211
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:36,987
which makes you a very lucky person,
because you need me.

212
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:40,353
In that case, how can I help you?

213
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:43,868
I'd like to see the files of juveniles
who've been convicted of violent crimes.

214
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,659
- I'll need approval from the police.
- Consider it done.

215
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:50,751
In the meantime,
did you know that Marly was pregnant?

216
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:53,771
Ava did.

217
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,107
I bet she wasn't the only one.

218
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,481
- Were you aware of this?
- Yes.

219
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:04,610
I knew one of our girls was pregnant.
I decided I'll just keep that to myself.

220
00:12:05,362 --> 00:12:07,184
Do you have any idea
who the father is?

221
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:10,861
Marly was disciplined for making out
with a kid named Tyrel Gardner

222
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:13,036
in the chapel a few months ago.

223
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,398
Tyrel. He might have been the father,
but he didn't kill Marly.

224
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:23,825
He was released last month. No way
he could have gotten in here last night.

225
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,069
Still, I'll pass on his information
to the police.

226
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,414
They can add him to
their interview list.

227
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,642
We all know these kids
aren't gonna talk to the cops.

228
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,794
We need to go to the source,
to go to Marly.

229
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,448
Group therapy is confidential.

230
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,884
Reynolds is back at the office.
I could call him.

231
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,054
You can call whoever you like.
It's still an invasion of privacy.

232
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,174
- A woman was murdered.
- I'm aware of that,

233
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,974
and I'm the only one here
who knew her.

234
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,395
- How about a little flexibility?
- I'll show you one session.

235
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,814
Marly's last.

236
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:58,909
Lightman means well,
but he's slightly insane.

237
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:00,307
Yeah, I noticed.

238
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,531
Look, Marly dying
wasn't your fault, Ava.

239
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,374
There's nothing you could have done.

240
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,543
What's wrong?

241
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:12,349
- Somebody went through my stuff.
- How can you tell?

242
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:15,210
The kids here steal.
I leave things a certain way.

243
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,026
Were they looking for something?

244
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,652
Come on.

245
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:22,092
- Someone think you know the killer?
- Where is it?

246
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:27,655
Ava, this is important.

247
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,686
Weird things happen in this place.

248
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:34,407
That's all I know.

249
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:39,871
<i>Ava, why don't you start us all off
by telling us about a good memory.</i>

250
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,466
<i>Good memory?</i>

251
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:48,743
<i>Whenever my sister visited me,
she'd braid my hair.</i>

252
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,955
<i>After my dad had a bad night,
she'd do it for hours.</i>

253
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,375
<i>Why does Ava's memory
bother you, Marly?</i>

254
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,419
<i>The girl's ass being beaten.
Who cares about hair-braiding.</i>

255
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:03,633
Marly really didn't like you,
did she?

256
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,510
I'm not here to be liked.

257
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:08,722
<i>Whenever Ria stayed with us,
she got the worst of it.</i>

258
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,140
<i>I remember that.</i>

259
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,974
<i>She probably took it on purpose,</i>

260
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,639
<i>to protect you.</i>

261
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:15,979
Will you pause it.

262
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,399
That's Maurice Jones, right?

263
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:21,307
I just flagged his file.

264
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:24,404
Dad's in jail.
Background of substance abuse.

265
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:26,468
Three arrests for assault.

266
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:29,159
You could have said the same thing
about me a while back.

267
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,662
Could we also say that you bludgeoned
your pregnant neighbor into a coma?

268
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,674
Man, you got no right
gettin' in my face!

269
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,251
You ain't gonna find nothing.

270
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,670
Get off me, man.

271
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,592
Hey, man, that ain't mine!
That's not mine.

272
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,969
You are under arrest
for the murder of Marly Lourdes.

273
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,047
- I didn't hurt that girl!
- You see that.

274
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,223
Yeah. Go on.

275
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,101
- Excuse me. He's telling the truth.
- Please step away.

276
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,635
We're deception experts.
You have the wrong person.

277
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,607
- That's what I'm saying.
- They always say they didn't do it.

278
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:02,234
I didn't kill nobody!

279
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,438
If he's innocent,
a murderer is running around this place,

280
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:11,233
and I'm not leaving Ava a sitting duck.
I'm calling Reynolds.

281
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:12,858
No, forget Reynolds.

282
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:16,456
Could you take Torres
back to the office?

283
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,041
- Why?
- Now.

284
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,252
Give me your keys.

285
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:29,469
That was touching.

286
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,812
How are you
at following instructions?

287
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:44,818
Stay close to the railing.
It's a dead zone for the cameras.

288
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,242
- Where's Ria?
- She's back at the office.

289
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,864
It's just me and you now.
I'm going to break you out of here.

290
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:51,802
And then what?

291
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,618
Then we catch a killer.

292
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,208
All day not one of you thought:

293
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,698
"Let's call Eli and tell him
why nobody's in the office."

294
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,671
Loker, a girl was murdered.

295
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,539
That's exactly my point...

296
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,128
It's a scary world.
Bad things happen.

297
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:10,260
I worry.

298
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,638
- And apparently you have a sister.
- Half-sister.

299
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,206
All right, so, if this Maurice kid

300
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:20,228
with the proclivity toward violence was
framed, who killed this pregnant girl?

301
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:23,055
The youth center psychologist
is a maybe.

302
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:26,651
There was definitely something
between him and Marly on those tapes.

303
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,161
I'll call the deputy Warden,

304
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,572
see if I can sweet-talk her
into giving you more access.

305
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,783
- Why don't you not.
- Look, is this little Torres?

306
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,206
I just remembered,
I got some work to do.

307
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:43,617
I'm gonna pretend like I never
saw her. You call me if you need me.

308
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:45,179
<i>I've got some research to do.</i>

309
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,154
You could be charged
with aiding and abetting.

310
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:50,462
- Or kidnapping!
- Yeah.

311
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:53,470
- I've been charged with worse.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

312
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,889
If I did get killed like Marly,
your life would get easier.

313
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,849
You're embarrassing me
in front of my boss.

314
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,567
I don't think she cares.

315
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,978
FYI, I'm not staying with you.

316
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:04,731
Tell me where you're gonna stay then,
some lowlife boyfriends?

317
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:06,858
I'm staying with Cal.

318
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,954
Now, don't go thinking that's a get out
of jail free pass, 'cause it's not.

319
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,146
As soon as this is solved,
you're back inside.

320
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:17,535
In the meantime,
you're staying with Foster.

321
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:19,513
- What?
- You heard me.

322
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,041
I suggest you leave.

323
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:26,450
OK. You must be hungry.

324
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,544
Foster, why don't you get
Dr. Burns on the phone

325
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,343
and have him come in here?

326
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,552
I believe you have his number.

327
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:37,639
- She should be with me.
- You're off the case.

328
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,016
- No, I'm not.
- You are. You blew your chance.

329
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:42,307
You're too close to see clearly.

330
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:46,082
Plus, she's gonna be fighting you
every step of the way. So...

331
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:48,513
Go home, Torres.

332
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:50,213
I mean that.

333
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,449
I told you I didn't know
Marly was pregnant.

334
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,625
Not only did you know she was pregnant,
I think you're the father.

335
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,011
I don't care what you think,
and I have to get back to work.

336
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:05,771
You don't have to go to work, and you do
care what I think. Why is that, exactly?

337
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:07,585
I don't even have to be here.

338
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,353
- Why are you, then?
- Foster said you wanted Maurice's file.

339
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,092
You got the hots for Foster.

340
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:16,500
I cared about Marly,
I wanted to help.

341
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,180
Now tell the truth, Burnsy.
I mean, assuming

342
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,101
that you're not the father, I can put
in a good word for you with Foster.

343
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,228
You're kind of a jerk.

344
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:28,198
I have been told that.
I get it, though.

345
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,558
I get it. You're embarrassed.

346
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:34,529
You're probably also embarrassed that
Marly made you all hot and bothered.

347
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,158
Marly was a kid. I never touched her
and I never wanted to.

348
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,785
That's actually true.

349
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,244
All right, then...

350
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:44,969
You're not the father.

351
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:48,002
What about this Tyrel kid?

352
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:50,286
You don't even know that, do you?

353
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:52,953
So what's all this guilt
that I'm seeing then?

354
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:54,528
I'm a psychologist.

355
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:58,122
My conversations with the kids
are confidential.

356
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,805
It's important that they trust me.

357
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:02,826
Ethics.

358
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:05,796
That's always so inconvenient.

359
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:09,502
How about this, then?
When...

360
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:13,373
did Marly tell you she was pregnant?
And she did tell you.

361
00:19:13,498 --> 00:19:16,648
I know, because you got evasive
as all hell earlier.

362
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,190
3 weeks ago.

363
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:25,163
She begged me not to tell anyone.

364
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,470
I should have reported it
to the deputy Warden.

365
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:31,293
Marly would have been
transferred to another facility

366
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:32,962
and maybe she wouldn't be dead.

367
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:37,662
I didn't want to be one more person
who'd betrayed her. Can I go now?

368
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,485
No. Whatever it is, you're not leaving
till you say it. So...

369
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,109
The father of Marly's baby,
whoever it was,

370
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:50,814
one of her friends had a crush on him,
it seemed to cause a rift.

371
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,170
Friend?

372
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:55,717
Ava?

373
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:57,957
I don't know for sure.

374
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,574
<i>I shouldn't be telling you this,
because you're just a child</i>

375
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:08,832
and you need to be protected.

376
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,244
My dad's on his way.

377
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:14,231
I bet he is. I bet you just call
and he comes running in?

378
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:16,457
Because that's the
kind of dad he is,

379
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,932
a come-runninger.

380
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:20,514
Can I get you some coffee?

381
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:24,149
My dad is a run-the-other-wayer.

382
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:26,977
After he smacks you, of course.

383
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,352
Smack first, then run the other way.

384
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:33,663
Daddy's home.

385
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,653
Hi, Em. Good job. Go to your room.

386
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,518
If you drove here, you're fired.

387
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:41,779
I took a taxi.
I'm a responsible drunk.

388
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,116
Yeah, clearly.

389
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:45,618
Don't be mad at me.
I need to tell you something.

390
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,996
- Not bloody likely.
- Let me go. Get off of me.

391
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:52,706
What are you doing
drunk off your face

392
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:54,781
in my house with my daughter?

393
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,335
I had nowhere else to go.

394
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:03,263
- You're a good dad.
- That's not the point.

395
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,929
You're a good man.

396
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:08,215
You are. You try to hide it,
but you are.

397
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,311
Just tell me why you're here,
all right?

398
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:14,731
You don't have to be
so mean to me, you know.

399
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,183
I'm so cold.

400
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:22,123
Maybe you want to warm me up, Cal.

401
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:25,658
You stop that right now.

402
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,120
Tell me why you're here!

403
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,622
Oh, my god.

404
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,792
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Dr. Lightman.

405
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:38,067
The torres twins.

406
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,935
They throw themselves at me
from left and right.

407
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,885
How'd I get so lucky?

408
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:50,138
It's my sister.
She makes me crazy.

409
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,669
You're two sides
of the same coin, you know?

410
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:54,865
No, we're not.

411
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,272
Your dad taught you
to see the truth.

412
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:00,902
- He didn't teach me anything.
- And he taught Ava how to lie.

413
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,970
Look, I want to believe her.

414
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:06,574
I do, but that girl has lied to me
so many times.

415
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:10,492
You know, a couple of years ago,
she stayed with me.

416
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:13,915
She gave her boyfriend my key,
and he cleaned me out.

417
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:16,490
She says that he wanted to come over

418
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:18,762
and watch football
on the cable or whatever.

419
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,631
But I bet you she helped him carry
everything I own to the curb.

420
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:24,733
Well, did you ever consider
the vague possibility

421
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:26,708
that the bit about the game

422
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,329
might be true and that...

423
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:32,141
her boyfriend just
took advantage of her trust?

424
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:33,643
Here, drink that.

425
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:36,643
And frankly,

426
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:40,469
I'm more curious about
what you did to her.

427
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:42,466
Look, Ava's a liar

428
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:45,530
and a manipulator,
and she works every angle she can.

429
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,115
It doesn't matter who she hurts.

430
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:49,831
Actually, she's kind
of just like you.

431
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:53,856
You know, you might be right there.

432
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,332
But what if she's involved
in Marly's murder some way

433
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:57,766
and we helped her escape?

434
00:22:57,891 --> 00:23:01,241
She could be halfway to New York
in Foster's car by now.

435
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,515
Ria always thinks
everything's my fault.

436
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,301
I'm sure that's not true.

437
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:12,026
We never lived together
'cause we didn't have the same mom,

438
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:14,462
but when I was little,
she would always come by,

439
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:16,394
help me with my homework.

440
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:21,704
She does love you, you know.

441
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:23,566
Yeah, I guess.

442
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:26,988
So what do you want for dessert?

443
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:28,849
What do you got?

444
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,699
I have got some ice cream,
of course, but I also have...

445
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,806
- Put her down!
- Let me go!

446
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:38,931
Get her!

447
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:46,257
The egg! Where is it?

448
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:49,686
Tie her up!

449
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,763
I'm trying! She's strong!

450
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,432
Shut up!

451
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,828
Don't put your hand on me,
you little bitch!

452
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,353
- I got it!
- No!

453
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,192
Let's go, I got it!

454
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:15,535
- I'm in here.
- Jeez.

455
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,673
What the bloody hell happened here?

456
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,524
- You all right, love?
- Yeah,

457
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:25,171
I'm fine.

458
00:24:26,254 --> 00:24:27,700
I'm fine. Everything's...

459
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:29,967
Everything's fine.

460
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:32,157
You all right?

461
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:36,873
You should be proud.

462
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:40,697
She got me out of my ropes.
She untied me.

463
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:44,357
Good thing she was here.

464
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,983
I had nothing to do with this.

465
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,966
No? 'cause I find it very strange, the
night you come and you stay with Foster,

466
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:51,781
somebody broke into her house.

467
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,409
- It was Tyrel? You called him!
- I had nothing to do with this!

468
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,370
- You called him! He was here!
- Stop it!

469
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,164
- Don't defend her.
- You knock it off.

470
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,987
Ava was just as terrified as I was,

471
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:11,425
she had no idea this was gonna happen
or who they were.

472
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,594
Just no idea!

473
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,805
I'm sorry.

474
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,886
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

475
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,482
You all right?

476
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:28,464
Take your time.

477
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,408
I had no idea
you were such a crybaby.

478
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:50,078
Cal, they were just kids.
They were kids.

479
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:52,675
I could tell by their voices.
There were-there were.

480
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,386
- There were 3 boys and a girl.
- From Covington, hey?

481
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:59,265
- Where are the cops?
- They're just gonna take

482
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,436
Ava back to juvie, and then they'll
arrest you for taking her from there.

483
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,904
We can take care of this on our own.

484
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,357
You're supposed to be
the sensible one.

485
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,110
Yeah, and you're supposed to take
unnecessary risks.

486
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,196
Not when it comes to you.

487
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,308
They were looking for this egg,

488
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:25,315
this little jeweled egg
that Ava had in her pocket,

489
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,877
I called Reynolds
and he's gonna put it into the system

490
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,570
- and see what he can find out.
- What's so important about an egg?

491
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:32,215
Ava won't talk about it.

492
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:34,217
She'll talk to me.

493
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:35,968
No, she won't.

494
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,392
Ava's gone.

495
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,886
Right, so now we think Ava's evil.

496
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:45,649
No, no, Loker.
She's just a confused

497
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:48,059
and scared girl
who got overwhelmed and...

498
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:50,437
I don't know what I think.

499
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:52,318
We got company.

500
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,455
He works for the Deputy Warden.

501
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,556
It's Dax, right?
Can I help you?

502
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:01,577
It's the group therapy sessions
you wanted.

503
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:03,860
You didn't get 'em from me.

504
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:05,957
Wait a minute.
Let's talk.

505
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,087
You sure you don't want sound?

506
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,335
Right now I'm only interested
in their physicality.

507
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,360
Dax took a big risk bringing these here.
Why would he do that?

508
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:18,841
You're the shrink.

509
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:21,057
Sometimes I wish
I were a fortune-teller.

510
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:23,516
Freeze it.

511
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:25,113
Her.

512
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,978
Will you bring her up?

513
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:32,519
You see how she shifts her shoulders
when she's confronted?

514
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:34,068
Will you bring up the sound?

515
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:38,044
<i>You go into a store,</i>

516
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,255
<i>take, like, a lip gloss.</i>

517
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,320
<i>You got no idea
how much crap I take.</i>

518
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:47,164
<i>It ain't even hard.</i>

519
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:51,002
Her voice was muffled
underneath the mask, but, yes.

520
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,129
Yeah, that's her.

521
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,920
She was at my house.

522
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,714
Look, she'll be here.

523
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,348
I told you, whenever Ava gets upset,
this is where she comes.

524
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,454
I've found her here
like a hundred times.

525
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,142
I'm sorry about what happened
to Foster.

526
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:13,941
I don't know, I should have known
better than to trust Ava.

527
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,380
All right, get out.

528
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,070
- Wait.
- Get out or grow up. It's your choice.

529
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,070
What? How am I not grown up?

530
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,740
I have a job, I have an apartment,
I pay my bills on time.

531
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:24,410
What more do you want from me?

532
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,579
All right, let me see.
Your sister's missing,

533
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,256
Foster's been attacked,

534
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,224
I've committed a felony,

535
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:33,521
you set a horrific example
for my daughter,

536
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,859
and you tried to stick
your tongue down my throat.

537
00:28:35,984 --> 00:28:39,392
And not once in this entire adventure
have you been honest.

538
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,819
Now, see, that's what I'm talking about,
right there.

539
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,848
I mean, this isn't about your sister.
This all about you, isn't it?

540
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,517
Look, I just...
I can't be what she needs.

541
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,147
It strikes me all she needs
is for you to believe her for 2 seconds.

542
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,763
If you can't do that,
you might as well hand in your cards

543
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:56,400
and resign as big sister.

544
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,614
There she is.

545
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,090
Wait, no.

546
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:07,912
Let's see what she does first.

547
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:21,634
That's Tyrel.

548
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,742
Oh, my god.

549
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,401
That doesn't bode well.

550
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:43,294
If you were a guest in my home,

551
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,156
this is what I would do.
I'd offer you a drink.

552
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:51,622
Soda rots your teeth.

553
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,625
The point is to be welcoming,
you didn't give me that chance earlier.

554
00:29:57,513 --> 00:29:59,513
I know you were in my house, Amber.

555
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,674
You and 3 boys

556
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:02,842
from Covington.

557
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,724
You don't know nothin'.

558
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:13,102
You know what I know?

559
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:15,776
I know that the turn of your arm
when you pull that chair,

560
00:30:16,686 --> 00:30:18,232
it's pretty distinctive.

561
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:22,373
And I saw it just now.
And I saw it at my house.

562
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:25,894
- Dr. Foster's good.
- Yeah, she's the best.

563
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,575
Well, second-best.

564
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:30,747
Thanks for bringing Amber by.

565
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:33,539
These are my kids.
If Amber's in trouble, I want to know.

566
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,374
Tell me about that egg.

567
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:40,463
I don't know nothin' about that.
Just that we had to get it.

568
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,506
<i>Yeah? Who's we?</i>

569
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,510
Amber,
I can see you want to tell me.

570
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:48,431
Look at me.

571
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,251
I think you owe me.

572
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:58,635
The crew, OK?

573
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:01,424
One night...

574
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:04,743
every few weeks, we...

575
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:06,739
break into houses,

576
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:10,451
<i>take stuff rich folks
spend millions on.</i>

577
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,622
Who runs this crew?
Somebody's gotta get you out of there.

578
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,081
I ain't upper management.

579
00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:19,225
What do you get
in return for your participation?

580
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,825
Early release.

581
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:26,631
You can get, like,

582
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,136
months off your time.

583
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:32,393
Who signs off on early release?

584
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:35,309
Deputy Warden, but she'd never be
involved in something like this.

585
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,151
I need to know who runs the crew.

586
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,073
I know you're scared,
but I can protect you.

587
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:52,910
Look at your face, bitch.

588
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,385
You can't even protect yourself.

589
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:01,317
You found her.

590
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:04,286
Yeah, safe and sound
and the custody of the FBI.

591
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:06,363
Me and Tyrel weren't doing
anything wrong.

592
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:08,885
Yeah, you weren't doing anything right,
either, were you?

593
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,297
Come on, this way.

594
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,923
Come on, Ava, I saw you.
I saw you put the mask on.

595
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:24,047
- Were you about to rob someone?
- No.

596
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:27,420
I didn't know anything about
what they were doing till tonight.

597
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:29,405
Tyrel told me.

598
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,365
Go on.

599
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:34,322
I just wanted to know
what it felt like.

600
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:38,203
They put on these masks
and they have the power.

601
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,634
I just wanted to feel that,
just for a minute.

602
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:48,515
But help me.

603
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:51,135
You are involved.
You had the egg.

604
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:53,137
I was just trying to help Marly.

605
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,098
I promised her I would keep it.

606
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,358
But I didn't do anything.

607
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,730
I believe you.

608
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:08,773
I'm on your side, OK?

609
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:11,108
And I'm sorry,
I know I don't deserve this,

610
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,108
but will you please trust me?

611
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:14,508
Please.

612
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,602
You a man, Tyrel?
Bet you think you're a real man.

613
00:33:20,727 --> 00:33:23,530
I got news for you. You're not a man
at all. 'cause real men,

614
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:27,074
they don't let women
fight their battles for them.

615
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:30,174
- You're a little boy.
- Say that again and you're a dead man.

616
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,217
You're a little... boy.

617
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,237
And you're terrified to boot.

618
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,724
'Cause men, they admit it
when they're afraid.

619
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,041
So...

620
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:43,399
Be a man, Tyrel.

621
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:49,985
Tyrel, just tell them
what you told me.

622
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,076
I was recruited to the crew
when I first got to Covington.

623
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,608
A few months ago we did a job.
Some serious stuff went down.

624
00:34:00,733 --> 00:34:03,477
- A guy died.
- The man's name was Richard Grange.

625
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:06,877
According to insurance reports, that
fancy egg was stolen from his house.

626
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,546
I kept it. Thought I might need it
for leverage one day.

627
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,452
So you gave Marly the egg
to protect her.

628
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:16,136
And you told her to blow the whistle
if she didn't get early release?

629
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,430
- I wanted her to get out.
- She was pregnant.

630
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:20,391
Why didn't you tell me?

631
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,147
The same reason I wouldn't tell you
who Marly's baby daddy was.

632
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,072
I promised her I wouldn't.

633
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:27,064
And I keep my promises.

634
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,260
You know, I think
it's time you told me

635
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,195
who you're afraid of.

636
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,987
He can't get you here.
You'll be safe.

637
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:48,043
Who? What is going on?

638
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,313
Dax killed Marly.

639
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:53,485
He wouldn't do that.

640
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,010
No, I know all about
the home invasion crew. I know that,

641
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,556
Dax was forcing you
to sign early release papers. So...

642
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,466
Please.

643
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,771
I'll lose my job.
I... I didn't have a choice.

644
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:10,190
Well, whatever he's got on you
must be good.

645
00:35:11,172 --> 00:35:13,193
He threatened my family.

646
00:35:13,472 --> 00:35:15,863
My parents are in assisted living,

647
00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:17,158
and Dax said

648
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,916
all I had to do was sign the papers
and leave the service door unlocked.

649
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,620
All right.
Well, I don't want you to get bored,

650
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:25,456
So let's watch the telly.

651
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:27,759
<i>You know,</i>

652
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:29,835
<i>people have killed
for this damn egg.</i>

653
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,379
- <i>You killed for it.</i>
- <i>No, man.</i>

654
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:36,070
<i>What happened at the house,
it was an accident.</i>

655
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:39,245
<i>All right, the man came at me.
I pushed back.</i>

656
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,670
<i>And he went over.</i>

657
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:46,398
<i>After that, I told
her I wanted to stop.</i>

658
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,687
<i>But she wouldn't let me.</i>

659
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:51,056
What is going on?

660
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,463
Didn't I mention it?

661
00:35:52,588 --> 00:35:55,986
Your assistant, Dax,
was arrested a couple of hours ago.

662
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,821
You said he was coming after me.

663
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,783
Oh, yeah, big time.
Yeah, he blames you for everything.

664
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,786
Even says you killed Marly.

665
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,891
Is that why you brought me here,

666
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:09,924
to accuse me of murder?

667
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:13,587
Let me out of here!

668
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,839
Keep watching,
this is a really good bit.

669
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,383
<i>Dr. Foster says</i>

670
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,428
<i>you were the one that brought in
the group therapy tapes.</i>

671
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:23,818
<i>That was a big break in the case.</i>

672
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:25,986
<i>Why the sudden lack
of self-preservation?</i>

673
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:28,727
<i><i>I told you
that I wanted it to be over.</i></i>

674
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:32,718
<i>I wanted her to get
what she deserves.</i>

675
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,776
You know, the funny thing is, right,

676
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:39,667
that every word
that comes out of that kid's mouth

677
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:40,792
is the truth,

678
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:44,306
and every word
that comes out of yours is a lie.

679
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,203
This is very embarrassing for you.

680
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:49,680
- Really?
- I've sacrificed everything for kids.

681
00:36:49,805 --> 00:36:51,166
And that pisses you off.

682
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:52,709
You remember Ava's sister?

683
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,129
You know what pisses me off?
People who hurt the people I love.

684
00:36:57,063 --> 00:36:58,549
I am the victim here.

685
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:02,719
You're the one with the massive bank
account. Of course, not in your name.

686
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,181
But the FBI have a hell of a knack
of tracking these things down.

687
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,353
I gave everything to my job, to kids.
I have given my whole life to them.

688
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,204
Well, don't stop now.
You're on a roll.

689
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:36,807
So, what, you spent your whole life

690
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,007
trying to drag these kids
up out of the mud, right?

691
00:37:40,396 --> 00:37:42,683
And what do you get in return?
You get nothing.

692
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:45,608
I mean, that's how you
really feel, isn't it?

693
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:48,258
So now it's your turn.
Is that right?

694
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,463
How much money were you
gonna have to steal

695
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:54,488
before you could walk away
from these kids?

696
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,565
500 grand?

697
00:37:57,132 --> 00:37:58,132
A million?

698
00:37:59,036 --> 00:38:00,036
2 million?

699
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:02,504
Oh, 2.
Ambitious lady.

700
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,574
And once a man was killed
during a robbery, you had no choice.

701
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:10,621
Marly showed you the egg, threatened
to expose you. You had to kill her.

702
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,915
You can't prove any of this.

703
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,918
You admitted to know about
the robberies. You signed the releases.

704
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:18,962
And we have your bank records.

705
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:22,090
Dax made me do all of it.

706
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,594
Murderer!

707
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,096
- Shut up!
- Quiet!

708
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:32,468
It's my word against Dax's.

709
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,647
A juvenile delinquent,
a thief, a murderer.

710
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:41,234
- Who's a jury gonna believe?
- Tell her.

711
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:45,238
Every lie you told since you walked into
this room we have on tape.

712
00:38:45,662 --> 00:38:47,866
We will walk a jury
through every microsecond

713
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,660
of every single one.

714
00:38:50,281 --> 00:38:53,184
It is not your word
against Dax's anymore.

715
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,933
No, it's your word against mine.

716
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,401
You lose.

717
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,223
Put your hands behind your back.

718
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:15,727
You're under arrest.

719
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,781
The kids needed to see this.

720
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:20,604
It's therapy.

721
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:23,695
Unconventional therapy.

722
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
Absolutely.

723
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:28,819
Let's go.

724
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
Hey.

725
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,864
So Foster's got a friend who runs an
alternative boarding school in Richmond.

726
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,933
- And he said he'd take her.
- She's staying with me.

727
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,049
I'm petitioning for custody.

728
00:39:54,717 --> 00:39:56,105
Once again you're fired.

729
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,395
You can't threaten
to fire people all the time.

730
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,940
Yeah, I can. Especially when they prove
to be complete idiots.

731
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:03,788
You don't get it. I promised her.

732
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:07,752
When I was in high school, I promised
that I would come back and get her

733
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:10,390
and we'd live together.
Our dad wouldn't be able to find us.

734
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:12,075
- We'd be free.
- Of what?

735
00:40:12,697 --> 00:40:13,747
Everything.

736
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:17,998
- Our dad, mostly.
- Sounds peachy.

737
00:40:18,177 --> 00:40:22,181
Yeah, but I didn't go back.
I just... I just left her there.

738
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,125
I broke my promise.

739
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:30,297
She needs help, love.

740
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,169
She needs to want help.

741
00:40:35,538 --> 00:40:37,838
You got to let her find her own way.

742
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:40,097
Best part of being a parent.

743
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:43,122
Unfortunately.

744
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:41,509
- Tell Dr. Foster thanks.
- I will.

745
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:50,967
I should have been there more.
I didn't mean to leave you alone.

746
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:54,427
Stop. I can't cry my first day.

747
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:00,433
I'm really proud of you, you know?

748
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,275
I'm proud of you, too.

749
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,353
All right, go get smart.

750
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:14,072
I'm already smart, bitch.

751
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:17,131
- Hey. Watch your mouth.
- You're not my mom.

752
00:42:17,462 --> 00:42:18,562
No, I'm not.

753
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:21,398
But I love you.

754
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:24,417
I love you.

755
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,496
- Well?
- You can't tell?

756
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,706
You failed.

757
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:08,877
I passed!

758
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,513
Well, done, girl. Well done.

759
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:15,301
So, can I drive home?

760
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,734
- No.
- What?

761
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:18,292
You're not driving again.

762
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:20,305
- No, come on.
- No, you crashed my car.
