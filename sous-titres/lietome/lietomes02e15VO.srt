1
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:10,396
Mommy!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,363
- Guess what?
- What?

3
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:15,483
Miss Mornie gave me a green ticket.
I got to go to the prize box.

4
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:17,866
Prize box?
That's fantastic, Sophie.

5
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:21,270
You know what I think?
Daddy would like to hear about this.

6
00:00:25,378 --> 00:00:27,457
It's Hardy.
I'm approaching the third floor.

7
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:29,562
What unit was that disturbance call?

8
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:30,691
<i>Unknown.</i>

9
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:32,235
<i>Somewhere on floor 3.</i>

10
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:36,048
Roger that.
I'll find it.

11
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:39,657
Jimmy, I was supposed to be punched out
about 40 minutes ago.

12
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:42,010
<i>Sorry, bro.
You caught the call.</i>

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,919
What the hell you...

14
00:00:57,305 --> 00:01:00,220
<i>Hey, this is Nick.
You know what to do after the beep.</i>

15
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:01,884
It's me.

16
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:06,524
Guessing you're not going
to make it home for dinner again.

17
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:08,734
Sophie really needs her father.

18
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,604
When you get home,
we need to talk about this

19
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,781
because something has to change.

20
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,494
12.50 a share.

21
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:43,144
It's the best I can do.

22
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,772
If I'm going to pull the trigger,
it has to be at the right price, Don.

23
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,277
Something tells me
you can do a lot better.

24
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,835
I can't do better.

25
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:05,710
I guess we're done here.

26
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:11,839
You walk out of here now,
Don, and the deal's off.

27
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,466
Are you sure

28
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,342
there's no more money on the table?

29
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,639
Fine. $13.

30
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,141
Not a penny more.

31
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,954
My absolute limit.

32
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:30,149
Great.
We have a deal.

33
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,776
You drive a hard bargain.

34
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,111
And you have a private jet.
Seems fair.

35
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,076
Not bad.
I pay you 10 grand,

36
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:44,538
and you make me 15 million.

37
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,042
Teach me.
The science, I mean.

38
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,227
You got 8 years?

39
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:52,871
I want to shadow you, watch what you do.
How you do it. I'm a quick study.

40
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:56,273
- I'll pay you 30 grand for the week.
- 50.

41
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,016
- Get Loker down there with a camera.
- 40.

42
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,448
A cop's been shot.

43
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,270
I'm on retainer with the city.

44
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,391
45. Take it or leave it.

45
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:16,779
Why's the FBI on this?

46
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,927
There was a shooting
on a federal housing project.

47
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:21,742
There he is.
Captain James, D.C. police.

48
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,301
Dr. Cal Lightman.
Given our present situation,

49
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,636
- Lightman's the man.
- What's the situation?

50
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:29,973
One of the bullets rendered
officer Nick Hardy a quadriplegic.

51
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:33,337
He can't speak, can't move,
and we can't get a clear response

52
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,276
to any of our questions.

53
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:37,805
So you want me to help
identify the shooters.

54
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:42,075
911 got a call from
the Eastmont projects.

55
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,931
Tenants heard shots,

56
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,017
and they saw two kids running
from the building in bloody shirts.

57
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,271
They were caught a few blocks away,
but no shirts and no murder weapon.

58
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:53,858
But residue
on one of their hands shows

59
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,818
that he recently fired a gun.

60
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,014
But without it,
we can't prove it was the gun.

61
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,577
The surgeon says that Hardy
doesn't even have much time...

62
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:03,284
Maybe a few days,
but more than likely, a few hours.

63
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,578
Why are you so worried now?

64
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,957
That's one of my men.

65
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:09,109
You're concerned
you don't have the whole story yet.

66
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:12,524
The kids that we picked up, they're just
runners for a small-time dealer.

67
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:13,926
They never carried weapons,

68
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,963
and they have no history
of violent crime.

69
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,173
And then, one day,
they just shoot a cop.

70
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,718
I think someone told them to gun up.

71
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:22,928
But the question for you is,

72
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:26,181
can you read a man
who can barely move his eyes?

73
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,812
La <i><font color="#ff0000">Lie</font> <font color="#ffffff">to</font><font color="#ff0000"> team</font></i> présente:

74
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,839
Episode 215: <i>Teacher and Pupils</i>

75
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:05,668
Mrs. Hardy?

76
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:07,973
Cal Lightman.

77
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:10,942
You Sophie?

78
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,978
How you doing?

79
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,029
These are my colleagues.

80
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:19,700
They told me you'd come.

81
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,530
Mrs. Hardy,
maybe I can take you both

82
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:28,202
to get something to drink
in the cafeteria.

83
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,759
I love you.
We'll be right back.

84
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:40,768
He liked that.

85
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:43,772
Look at the muscles around the eyes.

86
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:46,431
They contracted a bit.

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,347
It made him happier.

88
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:59,164
While you're at it, Clara,
try and get ahold of Foster.

89
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:13,219
Come on.

90
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,073
Nick, I'm here to help find out
who did this to you.

91
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,134
I know you can't answer questions
the way you normally would,

92
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:23,549
but you just think it,

93
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,385
and I'll try to do the rest, okay?

94
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:30,097
I want to state for the record
that this show-up is beyond unorthodox.

95
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:31,557
Shut up, counselor.

96
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,971
You getting something?

97
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:38,897
All right, Nick.
Are you 90 years old?

98
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,591
Are you 30 years old?

99
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,659
There.

100
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,737
Right there.
His pupils.

101
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,672
Can you bring those two over?

102
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,250
And lean them right in.

103
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,506
I know you're tired, but I need you
to concentrate, all right?

104
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:06,467
Were these two boys there

105
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,968
when you were shot?

106
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,307
It's a positive affirmation.
That's a "yes" to you, counselor.

107
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:15,642
One at a time.

108
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,230
Did this one shoot you?

109
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,818
Nothing?

110
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,584
And the other?

111
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:29,896
In he comes now.

112
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,660
Did this one shoot you?

113
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,581
There it is.

114
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,169
They were both there
when he was shot,

115
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,630
but this one, he pulled the trigger.

116
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,757
What's your next trick,
reading tea leaves?

117
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:50,257
This is all total garbage. I'm giving
my clients back to social services

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,096
- and back to county.
- No.

119
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,766
We know you were working
with someone.

120
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,518
If you fess up now,

121
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,394
we can protect you from that person.

122
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,564
Look at that...
honest fear, it is.

123
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,566
Dont say anything.
There are no questions.

124
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,308
Right against self-incrimination.

125
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,183
They also have a right
to self-preservation.

126
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:12,094
They cooperate,
maybe we can cut a deal,

127
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:15,118
because we are going to find
who you were working for.

128
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:18,664
- We were doing a job for...
- You don't have to say anything.

129
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,792
We were slanging drugs for Tevon,
and this cop creeped up on us.

130
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,422
In our neighborhood,

131
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:26,849
someone comes up behind you,

132
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,715
you don't ask questions.
You shoot.

133
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:34,655
Went down before we even knew
he was the police.

134
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,893
He's lying.
Clara, how do I know he's lying?

135
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,687
For 45 grand, why don't you tell me?

136
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,506
Here we go.

137
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,609
<i>Went down before we even knew
he was the police.</i>

138
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,898
There.
Duping-delight.

139
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,392
Some people can't help
the tiniest hint of a smile

140
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:55,619
when they think they've
gotten away with a lie.

141
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,060
- Who's Tevon?
- Their language is all past tense.

142
00:08:58,185 --> 00:09:00,723
It's like they're unconsciously
cutting ties from this person.

143
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:02,332
He's the dealer.

144
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,623
He runs the projects.
Real scumbag.

145
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:07,479
May have been running drugs for him,
but that's not who they were working for

146
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:09,631
- when they bumped into Hardy.
- Sure?

147
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:11,731
Sure as the lie on his face.

148
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:14,272
Whoever they were working for
scares them enough

149
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:17,749
- they would rather serve up Tevon.
- Or maybe there's a rival dealer

150
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,933
trying to recruit
some of Tevon's runners.

151
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,861
- We should go talk to him.
- That's not who they were working for.

152
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:24,271
Why do you want see him?

153
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,983
- The first rule of policeman...
- Stop for coffee?

154
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,847
Follow every lead.

155
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,284
We need to talk.
Maybe alone.

156
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:41,121
I'll just go get a snack
while you two talk about Clara.

157
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,841
Good grief. Sit down.
What about Clara?

158
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:46,210
Our accountant says we can't
make payroll next week.

159
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,909
- Terrific. Start the layoffs, then.
- The situation is serious.

160
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:51,250
Keeping your daughter
is not going to keep me from yelling

161
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,840
- until I get through to you.
- All right, calm down.

162
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,303
What about Clara...
Formally, Mrs. Bailout?

163
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,114
Maybe she's more valuable
than just a one-day ridealong.

164
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,626
Let me get this straight.

165
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:05,736
You're asking me
to ask Clara for a loan?

166
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:08,941
She could know people...
with money who could use our services...

167
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,141
She's our client.
I don't ask clients for loans.

168
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,445
- I don't mix business with pleasure.
- Pleasure?

169
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,494
If you want to discuss some
kind of business deal, I'm open to it.

170
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,411
That's much appreciated,

171
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:24,748
but, your money's no good here.

172
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:27,994
This would probably be
a bad time to ask

173
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:30,337
for the $300 I need for the dance.

174
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,599
Since when does it cost
$300 to dance?

175
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,092
I need a new dress, shoes...

176
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,805
Hair, manicure.

177
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:39,972
Clearly outnumbered here.

178
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:43,892
There.

179
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,602
- Thank you.
- I want receipts.

180
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:50,774
I just keep coming to you
with this problem, you keep ignoring it.

181
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:52,484
Find a loan, then.

182
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:55,045
I know some money men.
I could help you with this.

183
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,029
Ready?

184
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,773
You don't think
you're coming along, do you?

185
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,901
- Absolutely.
- No, she's my colleague.

186
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,472
Wherever I go, she goes.

187
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:10,871
Fine, but she's signing a waiver.

188
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:15,368
I tell you what, why don't you go with
Foster and sign the necessary papers?

189
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:18,445
While you're at it, you can give her
the names of those money men.

190
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,679
- Glad to help.
- To the right.

191
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:23,187
Let's go before she comes back now.

192
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:28,747
Tevon moves around the projects
every few months.

193
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,696
Makes it harder for the UCS
to keep a bead on him.

194
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:34,668
Our intel says
he's on the fourth floor.

195
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,903
But we don't know which apartment.

196
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:43,452
We're the cops.
Who wants to be strip-searched?

197
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,796
There's your apartment.
It's the first one down on the left.

198
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,841
- How do you know?
- If you put a drop of water

199
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,441
in front of ants, they'll avoid it
they think it's dangerous.

200
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,096
The kids did the same.
They steered clear of that apartment.

201
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,014
- Probably for the same reason.
- All right.

202
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:09,936
You're a civilian.
You stay in the stairwell.

203
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,732
Can I have a badge and a gun?
Can you deputize me?

204
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,127
Yeah, nice try.

205
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:17,986
Listen, you get in any trouble,
you call us.

206
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:20,129
All right.
Thank you very much.

207
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,328
I walked this beat 20 years.

208
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,590
Pretty tough, all right?

209
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:39,383
- Yeah?
- Police. Tevon in?

210
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,761
- No. Tevon ain't here.
- I guess we just have to wait for him.

211
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:46,848
- Yo, man, drop it!
- Drop the gun. We're cops.

212
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,559
Man, I got shot by a guy
saying they was cops before.

213
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,071
I ain't going for it then,
I ain't going for it now.

214
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:54,713
So y'all drop the gun,
or I'm pulling the trigger.

215
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,697
Son, you are playing this all wrong.

216
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,871
What's wrong is y'all creepin' round
my door trying to cap me, man.

217
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,954
<i>Captain James, this is officer Lightman.
We got SWAT outside.</i>

218
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,638
<i>The sniper has the subject in sight
through the south window.</i>

219
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:14,498
Good. I hope they shoot your ass
in the back of the head.

220
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,613
Shut up, bitch!

221
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:18,135
<i>Officer James, please respond.
Do we greenlight the sniper?</i>

222
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,763
Let me tell you something. Those snipers
are going to put a bullet in your brain

223
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,848
unless you drop that gun right now.

224
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:26,430
You have 3 seconds.
Put the gun down.

225
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,931
Put it down.

226
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:30,198
1...

227
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:32,687
- 2...
- All right, yo.

228
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,237
Ain't knew
y'all was really cops, man.

229
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:38,483
Thought y'all was here to mess
with my business. All right. Cool.

230
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,651
Put it down.

231
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,589
Easy, man. Cool.

232
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:46,658
Hey, man. Look.
All this is just one big honest mistake.

233
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,785
I know it was.
So was this.

234
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,414
- Come on, man.
- Take a walk, honey.

235
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Hey, man!

236
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,033
Man, this ain't justice.

237
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:02,549
- What this is about?
- Who's your deputy now, then?

238
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,400
Yo, man, those kids
are straight-up liars.

239
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,636
All I told them to do
was run product,

240
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,519
and by product, I mean chewing gum.

241
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,833
He's telling the truth,
except for the gum part.

242
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,834
See, man?
Listen to him.

243
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,066
What do you know
about the cop that got shot?

244
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:20,958
I know Jack, man.

245
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:23,458
Matter of fact, where my lawyer at?

246
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:26,974
Where's your stash?

247
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:31,427
'Cause far as I can tell,
you've got drugs hidden...

248
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,789
- 3 feet from where I'm standing.
- Listen up, little English muffin.

249
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,709
You ain't about to get in my head, man.
You better get your ass a warrant.

250
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,934
Where am I going to get
a warrant, you wanker?

251
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:41,607
I'm not a cop.

252
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:44,478
All right, then.
How about...

253
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,843
I start over here?

254
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,011
You think?

255
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:57,383
Hey, man. Come on, man!
That ain't necessary.

256
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,898
Come on, man.

257
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,771
- What about in here?
- All right, man. Cool.

258
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:10,951
I'll tell you what you want to know.

259
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,593
Tell you all I know.

260
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,830
Look,

261
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,166
I heard a lot of loud shouting and some
gunfire going on directly below me.

262
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,335
Then I seen those two punks
digging out of the back lot.

263
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:25,142
Go on, ask your boy over there.
He'll tell you I'm telling the truth.

264
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:26,804
He's got a point.

265
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,469
You heard shouting from below you?

266
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
Listen,

267
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:34,932
Hardy was answering
a domestic disturbance call.

268
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,507
Arguing was coming
from the third floor.

269
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:40,021
But he was shot
before he got to the right apartment.

270
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,393
But did anyone talk to those tenants
during the follow-up investigation?

271
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:45,735
There were some apartments
where no one was home.

272
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:48,697
Maybe whoever was arguing downstairs

273
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,532
saw someone with the shooters,

274
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,110
but they got too scared to talk,
so they bolted.

275
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:56,824
It's like I always say,

276
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:58,915
follow every lead.

277
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:01,627
Right, Tevon?

278
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:03,404
Whatever, man.

279
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,155
I'm really uncomfortable with this.

280
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,920
Knock, say it's you,
and he opens the door voluntarily.

281
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,354
We don't have 3 hours
to wait for a warrant.

282
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,976
You ditched me, which is not good
for business or pleasure.

283
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,797
It gave me minor pleasure.

284
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,229
<i>Sure.</i>

285
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,437
<i>Lightman, are you there?</i>

286
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,267
- How you doing?
- Good.

287
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,074
- What's your name?
- Olivia.

288
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,743
What?
Who's Olivia?

289
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:36,244
Is that your doll?

290
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,705
Can I have a look?

291
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,920
Take a seat.

292
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,517
It's all right.
I won't bite you.

293
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,757
What the hell is going on?

294
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,970
I'm on the phone
with a very mean lady

295
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,306
who wants me to hear her secret.

296
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,310
I don't want to hear her secret. I want
to hear yours. You got a secret Olivia.

297
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,069
Such professional behavior.

298
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:05,815
I can't imagine why your company
is drowning in red ink.

299
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,248
Mr. Jenkins isn't home.

300
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,198
He's dead.

301
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,118
- When did he die?
- Last night.

302
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,579
I saw them taking him away in a bag.

303
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,164
Who took him?

304
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,552
The corner men.

305
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,459
It said it on their backs.

306
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,317
Hey, sweetheart.

307
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,528
Do you mean
the coroners took him away?

308
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:35,166
Did they have "coroner" written
in yellow on the back of their jackets?

309
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,198
And they had a belt...

310
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:40,016
like yours.

311
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,412
What do you mean, a belt with a gun?

312
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:44,792
Like the police?

313
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,651
How many cops work these projects?

314
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,745
- About a dozen.
- I want pictures.

315
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,031
- I've got the district book in my car
- Good, I'll grab it on the way out.

316
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,499
You're takin' a hell of a leap
that cops were moving this body.

317
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:02,304
How's a little girl supposed to know if
what she saw in the middle of the night

318
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,401
were coroners, criminals, or cops?

319
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:05,967
Coroners don't have guns,

320
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:09,587
and criminals don't carry
their weapons in holsters.

321
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,049
Right, Olivia?

322
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,553
See?

323
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,907
Where is he?

324
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,829
- Where's Lightman?
- He left before us. I thought here.

325
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:28,957
That was the morgue. No 70-year-old
white males in the past 24 hours.

326
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,249
No signs of foul play
at Jenkins' apartment.

327
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:32,920
It's like the old man just vanished.

328
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,935
And none of this means it was cops
taking a body out of the building.

329
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,573
That's what we're trying to find out.
Follow every lead, remember?

330
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:42,663
There isn't a single witness who was at
that scene to corroborate your theory.

331
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:44,643
Actually, there was a witness.

332
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:47,080
And I think I know
why Lightman isn't here.

333
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:49,270
All right, Nick.

334
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,130
These are pictures of the cops
that work those projects.

335
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,338
Let's see if any of them were there
when you were laying on the floor.

336
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,359
That's officer Hollander.

337
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:49,771
That's confirmation.

338
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,470
Well done, mate.

339
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,253
And another.

340
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,499
Your pupils are on fire.

341
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,532
You're on a roll.

342
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:06,811
And again.

343
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:13,670
You've been holding on long enough
just to tell me this, haven't you?

344
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:24,973
Do you want me to help you
say good-bye to your family?

345
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,153
Right, then.

346
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Hi.

347
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:44,075
Your husband wants you
to know something.

348
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:47,871
Wants to tell you something.
I'm going to translate, if that's okay.

349
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,152
When Janine was with you earlier,
you were happy.

350
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:07,445
You showed happiness.

351
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:10,894
Is that 'cause you love her?

352
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:14,439
Yeah, that's a yes.

353
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:20,820
I see remorse.
Am I reading that right?

354
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,683
We'd been fighting.

355
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,409
He was working long hours, and...

356
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:28,411
I wanted him home.

357
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,010
Where he'd be safe.

358
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:38,415
Do you care
about any of that anymore?

359
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:42,459
No. He loves you very much,

360
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,886
you and Sophie.

361
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:46,638
He always will.

362
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:52,860
You can't fake that look.

363
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:08,159
What's he saying now?

364
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:11,899
Nothing.

365
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:15,291
He's gone.
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,459
What?

367
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,747
How did you read remorse on him?

368
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:41,317
I didn't.
I read it on her.

369
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:59,525
All of these men are in the same unit.
They cover the Eastmont projects, but

370
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,320
why would my men sneak a body out
in the middle of the night

371
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,047
and leave one of their own to die?

372
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:06,326
I know.
It doesn't seem sporting, does it?

373
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,971
Now, weneed a lot more information
before we confront these officers.

374
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,878
We got a 70 year old white male
matching our description

375
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,497
- that just turned up.
- You see?

376
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:16,520
The coroner misplaced the body.

377
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,634
It happens.
I knew my guys were clean.

378
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,443
But we didn't find it in the morgue.

379
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:22,780
We found it in a dumpster
3 blocks from the projects

380
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:26,487
in a body bag like that little girl said
badly beaten and stabbed to death.

381
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,948
All right.
Let's see how you handle the morgue.

382
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,889
Yeah, that's Mr. Jenkins, all right.

383
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,720
OK, I ided a guy.

384
00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:48,194
Now I got to go back
to running a building.

385
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,787
What are you so ashamed of?

386
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:50,912
Nothing.

387
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:54,295
You see my face?

388
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,851
What's my expression say to you?
Does it say anger?

389
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:58,734
Does it say impatience?

390
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:00,766
I'm just creeped out
by dead bodies, that's all.

391
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:03,429
- Really?
- Yeah. All right, come here.

392
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,069
All right. Look at this guy.
Go on, look.

393
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:11,359
See, you are telling the truth when
you say that you're creeped out,

394
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,117
but why no shame for this one?

395
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,542
What's your problem
with Jenkins over there?

396
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,955
Nothing. You asked me
to come identify Mr. Jenkins...

397
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,073
You see, that's a lie.
That's a lie right there.

398
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,919
Come here.

399
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,022
Identify him again.

400
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:26,464
Identify him again.

401
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:30,696
It's Mr. Jenkins.

402
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:33,346
You see?
Right there, that's deceit.

403
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,056
Why lying about this man's name?

404
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,757
I don't have to be here.

405
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:39,664
- You don't have no authority...
- Let me explain something to you.

406
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:42,228
Your building are registered
as section 8 housing.

407
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:43,666
That's a federal program.

408
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,733
So trust me, I have the authority.

409
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:54,403
Why don't you take
a wild guess on what this is.

410
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:59,080
That's the tenant list.
The unit Jenkins lived in...

411
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:03,244
was registered with the federal
government as a Mr. Kashdan.

412
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:06,963
There's hundreds of tenants covering
3 buildings. I can't keep track of them.

413
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,594
- That's a lie.
- How about we try this again?

414
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,301
- What do you know about Jenkins' death?
- I don't know anything.

415
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,263
That building is filled with
junkies and gangbangers.

416
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:18,266
- The place is dangerous.
- OK. That's lie number 2.

417
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:21,468
One more of those, and I'm going
to let Reynolds and James out there

418
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:24,893
- flip a coin over who locks you up.
- I'll take heads.

419
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,988
I converted the building
to section 8 housing.

420
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:35,685
I provide an apartment, the
feds pay me 90% of the rent.

421
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:37,690
But you know what you really get is

422
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:40,079
a building full
of crackheads and ex-cons.

423
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,373
Things just got out of hand.

424
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:49,005
You know, I'm smelling fear here.

425
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:50,322
Oh, yeah.

426
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:52,981
Of this one.

427
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:55,428
And this one.

428
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:58,347
And these other two.

429
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:01,175
- How does he know that?
- Eyelids.

430
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,811
Uppers are severely raised,
lowers are tensed.

431
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:05,897
Why are you so afraid of these cops?

432
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,274
Look, a few years ago,

433
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:13,960
they tell me they're gonna round up
all the skells in the building,

434
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:16,157
force them out, whether
they want to go or not.

435
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:19,285
<i>I would replace the
crackheads and the hookers</i>

436
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,787
with people who wouldn't
completely ruin the place.

437
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,761
But you'd leave the original
tenants on the federal register

438
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:27,835
so that the government would
continue to pay their rents.

439
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,629
So you would get 2 rents per unit.

440
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,891
But I didn't get any of the money.
The cops kept it all.

441
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,419
I got 10% on the amount.

442
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:40,973
But the cops took the rest of it.
6 figures a year.

443
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,602
<i>And you told no one about this?</i>

444
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:48,521
Who am I supposed to go to
when the problem are the police?

445
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,320
Did you kill Jenkins?

446
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:57,782
That's true.

447
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,876
Jenkins threatened to rat
if we didn't cut him in.

448
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,290
He was a big mouth, crazy old man.

449
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:10,294
I tried to tell him
not to make waves.

450
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:18,209
His testimony alone
isn't going to be enough.

451
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:20,485
His name is the only name
on those rent documents.

452
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,560
Nothing leads us to the cops.

453
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:25,468
Well, let me have a crack
at the shooters, then.

454
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:28,832
These kids, they know the cops
can get them anywhere, even in prison.

455
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:32,149
That's why they panicked, shot officer
Hardy and tried to serve Tevon up.

456
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,180
Nothing scares a con
like a dirty cop.

457
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:36,369
If Hardy hadn't stumbled
on those kids...

458
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:38,494
It's what cops call mutt-luck.

459
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,975
You all right there, Captain?

460
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:44,161
Because I'm sensing a little guilt.

461
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:47,792
You'd feel guilty, too if you assigned
a man with a wife and daughter

462
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,824
to the beat that got him killed.

463
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,461
Listen, we'll take over the
investigation from here.

464
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:56,672
I appreciate everything you guys
have done. Thank you very much.

465
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,032
- Now?
- Yeah, go on.

466
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:12,606
Look at you.

467
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:14,428
You look beautiful, Em.

468
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:18,244
Thank you. I can't believe you made me
get dressed here.

469
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:21,198
Well, you know, for 300 bucks,
at least I should get a picture, right?

470
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:24,670
There.

471
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:31,375
You know, there was a time when me and
your mum couldn't get you into a dress.

472
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:35,004
I used to eat nothing but yellow
foods, too, but things change.

473
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:37,340
I wish they didn't have to.

474
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,508
So, what's going on
with you tonight?

475
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:42,553
I'm working late.
I've got a client.

476
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:44,305
Oh, with Clara.

477
00:28:44,698 --> 00:28:46,535
What? No.
It's business.

478
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,338
No. That's... a lie. I can see
that thing your eyes are doing.

479
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,005
- What?
- They did it again.

480
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,209
Do me a favor. You've have better luck
reading a Chinese phone book.

481
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:56,359
Here we go.

482
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,513
All right, now. You see this?

483
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,807
No less than 6 inches
between you and dick.

484
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:03,091
- Dad?
- What?

485
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:04,683
Come on. It's Richard.

486
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:06,708
Oh, in that case, 12 inches.

487
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:12,540
- You got a coat?
- Yeah, this is a coat.

488
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:14,365
- That's not a coat.
- Yes.

489
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,126
- It's a shrug.
- You look great.

490
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:18,214
I've spent a fortune and
not looked half as good.

491
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,382
Thank you.

492
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:25,055
- Have fun with your client.
- You have fun, too.

493
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,335
The equity fund manager's waiting.

494
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,935
We're going to be late.

495
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,710
Good luck.
You can fill me in over dinner.

496
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:35,398
So to speak.
Or not.

497
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:37,214
Focus. Hmm?

498
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:45,154
Right. John and George, right?
Talking about their new secretary.

499
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,323
And John says,
"I took her out last night,

500
00:29:47,448 --> 00:29:49,199
"and we went at it all night.

501
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:50,955
Yeah, she's better than my wife."

502
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,128
So the next day, George comes in.
He says,

503
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:56,624
"I took her out last night.
"We went at it all night.

504
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:00,839
I think you're right.
I think she is better than your wife."

505
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,761
Right. Well, you're the boss,

506
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,680
'cause everyone else, they waited

507
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,074
just a millisecond
before they laughed.

508
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,476
You, you laughed, but
you found it offensive.

509
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,446
Being the family man that you are.

510
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:16,389
You, you got turned on by it.

511
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,514
And you...

512
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,118
well, you'd heard it before,
but you laughed anyway.

513
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:22,943
Your laugh was fake. So.

514
00:30:24,102 --> 00:30:26,365
That's what we do, gentlemen.
We read people.

515
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,200
If you're lying or cheating,

516
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:31,495
your face will let us know before
anything you're saying ever does.

517
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,207
Well, I look forward
to working with you.

518
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:45,384
Well, you sure know how to
show a girl a good time.

519
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:48,443
Well, it's been a while, has it?

520
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:51,698
You know, everyone needs
a reminder now and then.

521
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,560
So, what's this really
all about, Clara?

522
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:56,880
- I don't follow.
- That's 'cause

523
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,064
you've been too busy trying
to lead, haven't you?

524
00:30:59,547 --> 00:31:02,186
Mmm. I paid good money
for that privilege.

525
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:04,221
Doing you a favor.
45 grand?

526
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:06,805
That's chump change for
someone like you, isn't it?

527
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,075
If you were interested in what I do,
you'd have made a play for me by now.

528
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:14,538
Well, no. I mean, not play for me.
A play for firm.

529
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:17,124
Over your dead body.

530
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,260
What's your game, Cal?

531
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:26,759
Hello, Em.

532
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:29,762
What?
Now, say that again.

533
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:33,349
All right.
You say nothing until I get there.

534
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,509
You understand?

535
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:37,144
- Nothing.
- What's wrong?

536
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:41,218
You take the car. The bastards
arrested my daughter for drugs.

537
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:59,409
- Cal Lightman. Where's my daughter?
- Mr. Lightman, let's talk in here.

538
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:02,661
Where's my daughter, officer?

539
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:06,094
I can understand your
concern, also being a dad.

540
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:07,819
These kids today, huh?

541
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:10,591
Yeah. So, where is she?

542
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,813
Take a breath.
It's OK. She's coming.

543
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:15,203
Seriously, take a breath, pal.

544
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:19,246
Well, see, I just want her back.

545
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:24,441
- You're going to let her go.
- You seem like a smart guy, doting dad.

546
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,528
We all make mistakes.
Correct?

547
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,556
There a reason not to let her go?

548
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:35,684
Oh, no.
Can't think of one.

549
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:36,704
All right.

550
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:44,628
Well, thank you.

551
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:46,922
Don't mention it.

552
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,967
That's it, then?

553
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,885
You tell me if that's it.

554
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,391
I think we understand each other.

555
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,476
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

556
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:02,928
Here she is now.

557
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:06,883
Dad! I didn't do anything. I swear.

558
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:09,387
I know that, love.
I absolutely, sweetie.

559
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:12,624
Count yourself lucky, Emily.
Most kids around here don't get bail

560
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:16,753
when they're caught with enough cocaine
for an "intent to distribute."

561
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,403
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

562
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:35,746
I want to officially notify you that
this is now an FBI investigation.

563
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:37,556
Wait a minute.

564
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,831
<i>I came down here because you told me
you were looking for</i>

565
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:42,628
<i>a new focus in the investigation.</i>

566
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:46,763
<i>The new focus is the relationship
between you and your boy Hollander.</i>

567
00:33:47,263 --> 00:33:50,069
<i>I told you I'd take care of Hollander
and his men.</i>

568
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,946
He crossed a line.
That was my daughter.

569
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,199
- And I'm sorry.
- That better be genuine

570
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,929
concern for my Emily, 'cause
my blood is well up,

571
00:33:58,054 --> 00:34:00,289
my judgment is way out of whack,
so keep talking.

572
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,915
- Those men were out of line.
- The other night,

573
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,935
you lied about the reasons
for your guilt.

574
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,544
You are to blame for Hardy's death,
but not because you sent him

575
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,327
off to the projects, but because
you're up to your eyes in this

576
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,967
with Hollander and his thugs.
Or should I say your thugs?

577
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,965
- And that wasn't a bloody question.
- This is more complicated.

578
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,195
Why?

579
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:21,558
Whose side are you on, James?
'Cause on the one hand, you grieve

580
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,740
for Hardy's death, right?

581
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:26,745
But somehow, you're involved
with the men responsible for it. So...

582
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,023
He was a good man.

583
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,860
Why don't you save the B.S.
For his widow and answer the question?

584
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,487
You guys think that
I'm running a crew of dirty cops?

585
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,155
I don't think it.
I see it.

586
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,699
- Why are you protecting them?
- I'm not protecting them.

587
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:40,531
No, you're protecting yourself.
I'm coming at you, James,

588
00:34:40,758 --> 00:34:42,955
with everything I've got,
and you know that?

589
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:45,989
Not just because of my daughter,
but because of Hardy's wife and kid.

590
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:47,543
You do remember them?

591
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:51,541
A lot of people in those projects
are good people,

592
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,314
just trying to live their lives.

593
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:57,066
Which is hard enough without dealers
and pimps and scumbags.

594
00:34:57,812 --> 00:35:00,180
Well, I smell police vigilantism.

595
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,434
The people in that building
called it safety.

596
00:35:04,693 --> 00:35:06,758
You don't have to see what we see,

597
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,856
day after day, year after year.

598
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,403
4 years ago, I pulled a baby
out of a dumpster for the last time.

599
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,620
That's when I had Hollander
and his crew set an example

600
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:21,312
of a couple of the problem tenants,

601
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,815
so the rest of the trash would know

602
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,248
that they were not tolerated
in my projects.

603
00:35:26,714 --> 00:35:28,250
- Your projects?
- My projects!

604
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:31,003
Somebody's got to own them.

605
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:35,181
If we just did things by the book,
which doesn't exist, anyway,

606
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,633
nothing would get done.

607
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:40,900
I swear on my mother's grave,

608
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:43,894
I didn't know Hollander was running
a rent scam,

609
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,059
and I didn't know anything
about any killings.

610
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,771
So, you really believed
that you were doing good there.

611
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,147
I know I was.

612
00:35:50,797 --> 00:35:52,883
You can't be that naive.

613
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:55,851
Naive?

614
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,392
No. Arrogant.

615
00:35:58,213 --> 00:36:01,784
Arrogant enough to believe that
my men would never let me down.

616
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:02,952
Yeah, well,

617
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:04,545
they did.

618
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:07,748
So you're going to help us end this,
if it's the last thing you do.

619
00:36:08,522 --> 00:36:11,794
You're going to go pick up Hollander
and bring him back here.

620
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:14,671
We'll grab the other turd.

621
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,598
Officer Tressler,

622
00:36:25,115 --> 00:36:26,809
FBI.
You're under arrest.

623
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,899
You can't just arrest an officer
of the law 'cause you feel like it.

624
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:31,791
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

625
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:35,207
Now you know how my daughter felt.

626
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:44,724
There he is.

627
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:47,916
I'm glad you could come.

628
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,289
What's the matter?

629
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,867
Did I strike a nerve?

630
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:54,545
What, don't you like being yanked out
of your life to be here with me?

631
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,547
You got nothing on me.
This is bull.

632
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,757
- How's your daughter doin'?
- She's doing fine.

633
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,384
Grades have dropped a bit.

634
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,428
The boys have already
started talking.

635
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,763
We've just got a couple
of quick questions for you.

636
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:28,846
You have no right to keep us here.
Get me a lawyer.

637
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,582
People who show genuine guilt
and remorse are more

638
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,167
- likely to confess.
- You read that on which one?

639
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,920
Tressler. At the police station,
Lightman read that he wasn't

640
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,297
comfortable with what his partners
did to Emily.

641
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:43,343
If a member of a group feels that the
group has strayed from its moral code,

642
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:45,596
that member's
discomfort manifests itself

643
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,891
in physical distancing from the group,
micro-expressions

644
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,184
of disagreement.
And Lightman said that this guy

645
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,421
was showing all of those
at the precinct.

646
00:37:53,546 --> 00:37:56,273
He's doing it right now.
He's on the opposite side of him.

647
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:05,983
<i>How you doing? You know what?
He's the worst kind of cop,</i>

648
00:38:06,512 --> 00:38:08,619
- <i>don't you think?</i>
- <i>He's a good cop.</i>

649
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:11,622
His voice trailed off.
He doesn't believe that.

650
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:13,832
<i>I'm sorry.
Could you say that again?</i>

651
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:16,126
It's mind games.
It's all mind games.

652
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,586
You can go.

653
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:19,713
We don't need you anymore.

654
00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:22,170
<i>We've got him.
Seriously, off you go.</i>

655
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:26,483
What, you scared, are you?

656
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,015
You scared to leave
without your boyfriend here?

657
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:34,603
- I think I want a lawyer.
- He used the word "think."

658
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,064
He's equivocating.
He wants to unburden himself.

659
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,656
<i>I think I know
what Captain James was doing,</i>

660
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:41,721
<i>or thought he was doing,</i>
in those projects.

661
00:38:42,314 --> 00:38:44,044
He was taking out trash, right?

662
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,784
Look at you.

663
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,384
That's pride, that is.

664
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:49,782
He's puffed up

665
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:51,286
like a peacock.

666
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:53,205
- Lawyer.
- That's fair enough.

667
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,787
You can have a lawyer.

668
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:57,042
I'm not asking you to say anything.

669
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:00,963
Not verbally, anyway. His face
has already told me you killed Hardy.

670
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:02,673
That's a lie.
I did not!

671
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,509
No, I'm sorry.
I mean had him killed. Had him killed.

672
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,702
<i>Had him killed.
That's it. Right.</i>

673
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:09,721
<i>Those kids...</i>

674
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:13,267
It was an accident.

675
00:39:13,947 --> 00:39:17,062
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- OK. We're through here. Let's go.

676
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:20,273
- Here we go.
- You know, you left Hardy,

677
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:21,699
<i>a father</i>

678
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:25,112
<i>and a husband,</i> to bleed out alone.

679
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:28,907
He's gonna do you next,
you know that?

680
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,784
Shut up.
That's enough.

681
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:32,703
Make me.

682
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,706
Go on. Make me.

683
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,500
No. I want you to...

684
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:39,668
make me.

685
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:44,300
- Then you went after my daughter.
- No.

686
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,079
No? Well, his Adam's apple says yes.
You know, look at it.

687
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:48,885
It's like a cork in a storm.

688
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:51,763
And you see that look?
That's very common

689
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:53,745
on people with intent
to commit murder.

690
00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:55,383
16,

691
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:56,783
my daughter.

692
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:58,353
She's 16.

693
00:39:58,883 --> 00:40:01,648
Some man you are. Don't look at him.
He can't help you.

694
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:05,610
I didn't want to.

695
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,539
- <i>You didn't want to what?</i>
- <i>What, threaten my family?</i>

696
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:11,283
<i>No, but you did, though.
You went along with it.</i>

697
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:14,359
- 'Cause you're scared of him.
- I'm not.

698
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:16,912
- Coffee break?
- Yes.

699
00:40:23,802 --> 00:40:24,802
Wait.

700
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:27,591
I only knew about the two boys
killing Jenkins.

701
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:32,554
<i>Excuse me?</i>

702
00:40:33,134 --> 00:40:35,134
We saw Hardy lying there,
bleeding out.

703
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:37,290
But Jenkins was already dead.

704
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,772
- His apartment door was wide open.
- That's enough.

705
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,772
We closed it,
and we moved the body later.

706
00:40:42,363 --> 00:40:43,565
You killed Jenkins

707
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,525
to shut him up about your rent scam.

708
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:47,040
That's it.

709
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:48,862
I just wanted to make
a few extra bucks,

710
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:51,329
and then,
this Jenkins guy starts causing trouble.

711
00:40:51,454 --> 00:40:53,575
Shut up.
You're smarter than this. Come on.

712
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,660
And next thing I know,
Hollander tells me

713
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,038
that he's dead,
and we have to move the body.

714
00:41:06,274 --> 00:41:07,923
Prison's too good for you, mate.

715
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:10,008
But I suppose it will have to do.

716
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,308
I've made a couple of calls.

717
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,762
I've let them know you're coming.

718
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:23,408
I said 45 grand, by the way.

719
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:26,154
Consider it a discount
for ditching me.

720
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,835
So, Captain James will cut a deal,

721
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,216
but the rest of 'em are looking
at a life sentence.

722
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:35,703
Well, if I was on James' jury,

723
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:38,343
I'd be inclined to give him
a second chance.

724
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,370
Here.

725
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,810
- Would you like some more good news?
- Yeah?

726
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,837
- You got the loan?
- 7 figures.

727
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:50,329
It'll keep us afloat for at least
a year, long enough to get us

728
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:53,512
- back on our feet.
- Congratulations.

729
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:55,501
Well done, Foster.

730
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:57,931
Thanks to Clara for getting us
in touch with the equity firm.

731
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,100
I'm excited we're going
to be working together.

732
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,004
- Excuse me?
- Come again?

733
00:42:02,242 --> 00:42:04,826
Well, as the majority investor
of that equity firm,

734
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:07,885
I can't wait to turn this place
into the cash-cow it should be.

735
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:10,620
Sky's the limit.

736
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:13,029
I'll leave you two to celebrate.

737
00:42:13,629 --> 00:42:16,116
I'll call you tomorrow
to talk over some details.

738
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,081
- Your place or mine?
- Well, your place is mine, now.

739
00:42:25,897 --> 00:42:27,294
That's the best you can do?

740
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,088
So, you've been hanging around
with me for,

741
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:34,342
you know, a few days now.
That makes you an expert, does it?

742
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:36,536
I told you, I'm a quick study.

743
00:42:37,379 --> 00:42:39,411
I believe in business and pleasure.

744
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:45,687
Proud of you.

745
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:47,397
- For what?
- Admit it.

746
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,649
You were holding out
for more than just a handshake.

747
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:53,789
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

748
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:57,303
7 figures.

749
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,785
You know, this is all your fault.

750
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:03,256
You're welcome.
