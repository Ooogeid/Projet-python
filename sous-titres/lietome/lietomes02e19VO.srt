Dr. Lightman.

7
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:23,356
I'm sorry about Dave and Sue.

8
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,515
To lose their son
and then die in a car crash.

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,070
Life is so unfair.

It's time.

13
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:41,323
It's about time
they killed this monster

14
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:43,084
for what he did to our nephew.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,587
Death by injection's too good
for this unrepentant son of a bitch.

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,540

You okay?

20
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,393
Don't answer that.

21
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:09,150
I'll shut up now.

00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,521

<i>I'm an innocent man.</i>

Go to hell.

26
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:44,562
The pied piper was a rat catcher
who was tricked and didn't get paid.

27
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:48,524
<i>He stole the children of Hamelin
so the rich would remember the day.</i>

28
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:52,703
I didn't take little Rex.

29
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:56,115
The pied piper did.

30
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,180
I need to talk to the governor.

31
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:03,326
He's telling the truth
when he says he didn't take the boy.

32
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,292
Is he on the phone?
Is that the governor?!

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,170
- The governor can't speak to you.
- He can't or he won't?

34
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:11,431
- I'm good.
- Come on.

For 2 weeks, this guy makes terrifying
phone calls to the family, kidnaps

41
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:57,642
their 8-year-old son and brutally
murders him. He deserves to die.

42
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,764
Big talk is easy when you're
not the executioner.

43
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,848
I'm afraid of that? Show me the switch,
I'd be happy to throw it.

44
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,601
<i>It's gross that he's had 3 hots
and a cot for 17 years,</i>

45
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:09,688
<i>but the real issue's that Jason Wilkie
randomly chose my nephew.</i>

46
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:11,315
<i>It could have been anyone's son.</i>

47
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,963
<i>Putting him to death,</i>

48
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:16,320
<i>that's about ensuring public safety
and deterring other crimes.</i>

49
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,614
<i>That was Charlie Sheridan,
uncle of the murder victim,</i>

50
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,269
<i>speaking to us earlier.</i>

51
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:22,980
<i>Jason Wilkie never confessed
to the kidnapping</i>

52
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:26,747
<i>and gruesome murder
of 8-year-old Rex Sheridan 17 years ago.</i>

53
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,833
<i>A last-minute stay of execution</i>

54
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,876
<i>could only come
from the governor of Virginia.</i>

55
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:34,357
Can't believe Lightman is in there.
Why is Lightman in there?

56
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,922
It's the first case he worked on
that led to a death-penalty conviction.

57
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,886
Plus there's the Zoe connection.

58
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:44,723
<i>This just in.
Jason Wilkie was just pronounced dead,</i>

59
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,600
<i>the 104th person to die by execution</i>

60
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:50,244
<i>in the state of Virginia since 1976.</i>

61
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,196
I need the case files for Wilkie trial.
The transcripts, the tapes... the lot.

62
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,824
Go to city hall.

63
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,782
I can't. It'll take too long.

64
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,410
You kept copies. I know you did.

65
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,036
You made the paper.

66
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,955
Look, it's over, Cal. Please.

67
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,509
For both our sakes.

68
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:13,655
Look, I saw Wilkie lie dozens of times
during his trial,

69
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:16,154
but last night,
he was telling the truth.

70
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,613
So you're telling me,

71
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,537
the woman who prosecuted Wilkie
based in large part on your science,

72
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,984
- is that you got it wrong?
- No, I didn't.

73
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:27,224
When? Last night or 17 years ago?

74
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:28,475
Both.

75
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:30,644
How's that possible?

76
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,021
I don't know. That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

77
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:36,400
- I didn't do it, I swear.
- Do what?

78
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,295
I thought
you were fighting about me.

79
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,788
No, we're not fighting.

80
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,864
We were having
a work-related discussion.

81
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,166
Here you are.

82
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,354
So, hey, congrats
on making the paper.

83
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:50,205
I thought teenagers
didn't read newspapers anymore.

84
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,500
They do when their dad goes nuts
at an execution.

85
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,085
- Don't let it go to your head.
- Ready for school?

86
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:57,667
I forgot to tell you
I don't need a ride.

87
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,745
Hannah's parents
just got her a new Prius...

88
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,871
Hint, hint...
so she's picking me up.

89
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,792
Look, I need those files,
so, please.

90
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:11,361
I need you to hear something.
Now, this is the call

91
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,438
that Rex Sheridan's parents
received 17 years ago

92
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,190
just days before he was kidnapped.

93
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,151
<i>Jack and Jill went up the hill</i>

94
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,779
<i>to fetch a pail of water</i>

95
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,478
<i>Jack fell down, broke his crown</i>

96
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:27,034
<i>and Jill came tumbling after</i>

97
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,580
<i>I'm gonna get you.</i>

98
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:36,476
<i>Ready or not, here I come.</i>

99
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,653
Now get this.
You know Faye and Charlie Sheridan,

100
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:42,091
the aunt and uncle of that same
little boy that got murdered?

101
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,678
Mrs. Sheridan came back home after
taking the kids to school this morning,

102
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,209
found this message
on their answering machine.

103
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,402
<i>Ring around the Rosie</i>

104
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,519
<i>pocket full of posies</i>

105
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:57,706
<i>ashes, ashes,</i>

106
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:00,257
<i>we all fall down</i>

107
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,361
<i>I'm gonna get you.</i>

108
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:06,397
<i>Ready or not, here I come.</i>

109
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:08,576
My God.

110
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,989
Maybe some clown

111
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:14,117
is just playin' silly buggers,

112
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,667
after watching Wilkie
on tv all week.

113
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:19,837
Look at the sound wave analysis.

114
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:21,738
VOICEPRINT MATCH

115
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:23,340
This is new FBI software.

116
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,968
Each voice has features
as unique as fingerprints.

117
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,095
The two callers are identical,

118
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,596
17 years apart.

119
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,806
This's no copycat.

120
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,268
Jason Wilkie could have made
this recording before he was arrested?

121
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:39,273
If the governor had taken my phone call,
we'd know for sure, wouldn't we?

122
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,859
Doesn't it prove
it wasn't Jason Wilkie?

123
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,810
Did we help execute an innocent man?

124
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:55,069
I could do this alone

125
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:56,290
if you'd prefer.

126
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,543
You think I got the wrong
person 17 years ago.

127
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,810
Don't you?

128
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,799
I think you could have
made a mistake.

129
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:08,446
So do you.

130
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,885
Zoe was a young prosecutor

131
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,215
eager to get a conviction,

132
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,016
and you wanted to help her.

133
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,878
- You still do.
- Do you charge by the hour for this?

134
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,815
Classic. Deflection.

135
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,826
Classic Cal Lightman.

136
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:27,176
No, look. I saw

137
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:30,740
- a man executed last night.
- Go on.

138
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:33,702
I saw something on his face
I'd never seen before.

139
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,432
What did you see then?

140
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,332
I don't really know what it was.

141
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,724
But you need to follow it to the ends of
the earth, no matter what, knowing you.

142
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:45,978
All right.

143
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,718
Come on, then.

144
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:54,722
Have you reached your children?

145
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,770
Abby and Brady are upstairs.

146
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:00,691
Our oldest son, Oliver,
is driving back to college in Baltimore.

147
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:03,521
We haven't been able to reach him yet,
but the FBI is waiting for him there.

148
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,923
My God. Brady just turned 8.

149
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:09,238
Rex was 8 when he was abducted.

150
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:12,533
Vinyl, still the best?

151
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,895
It's brilliant.

152
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,310
It's the best.

153
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,978
The heavy metal piece,
that's fantastic there.

154
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:22,793
What are you doing?

155
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,338
I thought you might have had a safe.

156
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,382
That sign means a lot to us.

157
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,466
Really?

158
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:33,095
The home fed diner is the first property
my father purchased.

159
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:34,829
No offense intended.

160
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,437
So where's the tape?

161
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:38,517
What tape?

162
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,270
The one that you used to fake
the voice mail you just got,

163
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,302
one from 17 years ago,
the creepy nursery rhyme tape.

164
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,027
That one. Where is it?

165
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:48,360
You think we faked that message?

166
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,823
Alphabetized books.

167
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,042
That's a red flag if ever I saw one.

168
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:58,881
Wait a minute!

169
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,709
You got a little quiet
all of a sudden,

170
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,086
for someone
who's got such a loud mouth.

171
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,713
You can't come in here and...

172
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,923
That message that you claim you got,
a hoax.

173
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,510
You've been on tv for years.

174
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,761
You've made a career
out of getting Jason Wilkie executed.

175
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,513
Now he's been done, hasn't he?

176
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:19,600
So how are you gonna maintain
your victim status?

177
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,625
What's wrong with you?

178
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,189
First Wilkie did it.
Then he didn't. Now this?

179
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:29,276
Either you enjoy inflicting emotional
pain, or you're a complete fraud.

180
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,407
You're right.

181
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,202
Sorry.

182
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:41,367
I'm sorry about the books,

183
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:45,318
but sometimes you have to use
a pickax to get at the truth,

184
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:46,251
you know?

185
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,296
You may work with the FBI,
but I want you out of my house.

186
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:50,747
I understand

187
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,633
completely.

188
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,476
The FBI initially had 4 other suspects
besides Jason Wilkie...

189
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,264
A school bus driver, a homeless man,

190
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,944
a phone company repairman,
and a supervisor.

191
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:02,359
They never pinpointed
the actual source of the calls.

192
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:05,442
- Couldn't trace 'em for some reason.
- Does Lightman seem weird to you?

193
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,854
He's rude, impatient, distant.

194
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:11,655
- He seems pretty normal to me.
- Yeah, but isn't that weird?

195
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,115
He may have helped execute an innocent,
and he has no emotional reaction.

196
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,074
Doesn't that make him a sociopath?

197
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,640
Or it's just a mask.

198
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,411
Where is he? I know he's here.

199
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,331
Dr. Lightman's at a meeting across town.
Can I help you, Mr. Wilkie?

200
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,493
Dr. Lightman lied

201
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,822
back when he said Jason
committed that crime.

202
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,930
You turned Jason in
to the authorities.

203
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:32,547
Because I thought he might be
involved somehow.

204
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,532
Dr. Lightman is the one
who said he was sure.

205
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:37,427
He's the one who convinced the jury
to put my brother on death row.

206
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,805
The facts of this case
have not changed.

207
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,307
The calls are happening again.
I saw it on the news.

208
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,101
The real killer is still alive,

209
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,186
and Jason is dead now, and...

210
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,444
What have I done?

211
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,034
Sir, why don't we go sit down?

212
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,403
No. Listen.

213
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,749
You tell Lightman
that I am suing his ass

214
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:00,450
and the state of Virginia
in the wrongful death of my brother.

215
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:06,613
Faye we got this whole system set up
so when your home phone rings,

216
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:08,438
it'll ring here as well.

217
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:10,377
Which will keep me out of your hair.

218
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:13,213
If another call comes in,
don't panic, OK?

219
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:15,816
Just stick with the script
that Dr. Foster's wrote out for you.

220
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,491
Let's rehearse again.

221
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,221
Is that him?

222
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,305
Hello.

223
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,971
<i>Mrs. Sheridan, it's Noah Benson.</i>

224
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:34,109
It's my son's roommate.

225
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,277
Noah, is everything all right?

226
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:39,489
<i>An FBI agent is here
looking for Oliver.</i>

227
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,050
<i>He's still not here yet, and
no one knows where he is.</i>

228
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,683
So Oliver was auditioning for the men
of Fincher college calendar.

229
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,502
We found a schedule on his computer.

230
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:58,947
He had an appointment with
a photographer this afternoon,

231
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:01,672
which may have been the last
person to have seen him.

232
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,897
What aren't you telling me, Ben?

233
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:07,885
There's people
at headquarters that don't think

234
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,644
you should be involved in this case.

235
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,158
Why? Because it's too personal?

236
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:15,600
Or, because they think
I've lost my marbles?

237
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:19,281
Or that I've already made a mistake
and got an innocent man executed?

238
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,031
- They didn't say that.
- But you did.

239
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,700
- Right there.
- I'm not the enemy here.

240
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:26,009
- Really?
- Really.

241
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:27,619
Prove it.

242
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:37,467
Oliver Sheridan was here
for about 30 minutes.

243
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,884
- Do you have any idea where he went?
- None.

244
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:44,500
See, I was expecting
lads in varsity jackets,

245
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:48,174
- not meat and 2 veg.
- Yeah, well, that's what sells.

246
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,699
Yeah. Fair enough.

247
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:52,389
So where's your pictures
of Oliver, then?

248
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:54,470
It's on the second shelf.

249
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:56,608
Red folder. I'm on a deadline here.

250
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:58,788
Right.

251
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,627
No. No, no, no.
He's dressed like an eskimo here.

252
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,172
Where's your calendar pics?

253
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:09,173
Just 'cause a guy is good-looking
doesn't mean camera's gonna love him.

254
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,948
So how did he handle
this rejection, then?

255
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:14,876
He was disappointed,
but he took it well.

256
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:22,928
You can't open that
without a search warrant.

257
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:24,457
Really?

258
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:27,556
I tell you what. If you're not ashamed
of anything in there,

259
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,792
you can call the cops.

260
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,267
Yeah.

261
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,986
- Didn't think so.
- Just stop him.

262
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:39,151
- What do you got there?
- "Young beach studs."

263
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,529
"Fraternity fun."

264
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:45,443
- "21 and hot."
- It's research.

265
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,659
All right, I win.
You owe me 10 bucks.

266
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,809
See, whenever anyone says, uh,
"it's for research," I win.

267
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,574
If they say, "that's not mine,"
then he wins, so cough up.

268
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,419
- There you go.
- Thank you.

269
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,006
I think that this calendar thing,
I think it's just an excuse for you

270
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,419
to get young men naked
in your apartment.

271
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:05,469
- I run a business.
- Really?

272
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,244
What's the matter with your leg?

273
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,098
- What?
- You heard me.

274
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:12,059
Nothing.

275
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,165
Jeez! God!

276
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:18,982
Liar. Let's look at it.

277
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:22,360
I fell.

278
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:25,745
See, I think you
got fresh with Oliver.

279
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,866
He rejected you. You got angry...

280
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:29,451
And violent.

281
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,040
So what happened? Did you kill him?

282
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,398
He's the one who got violent.

283
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:37,956
I rubbed his shoulder, and he hit me
with a golf club and left.

284
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:40,131
Do you know where he was going?

285
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:42,797
That's a no.

286
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,883
Come on. You're fishing for a job.

287
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:48,751
Why, because Jack Rader's made it clear
that he appreciates my research,

288
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:52,155
that I'm welcome there, and I have
the most leverage with him now?

289
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,580
Let's face it. This ship is sinking.

290
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,125
So the rats flee.

291
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:59,084
News of Lightman's mistake
is already out there,

292
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,377
and once this lawsuit is filed,
this company is finished.

293
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:06,506
Even if we win, it'll be too late.
Lightman's reputation'll be destroyed.

294
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:09,021
Ours'll be damaged alongside it.

295
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,296
What about... what about loyalty?

296
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,983
The way Lightman insults me
on a daily basis,

297
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:16,707
blind loyalty would
just be self-loathing.

298
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,810
And the best time to look for a
job is when you already have one.

299
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:23,004
I need you to pull up
Jason Wilkie's final words.

300
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:30,345
The pied piper was a rat catcher
who was tricked and didn't get paid.

301
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,099
He stole the children of Hamelin so
the rich would remember the day.

302
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,600
I didn't take little Rex.

303
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:37,645
The pied piper did.

304
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,070
There are theories that the pied piper
is the symbol of death,

305
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:45,110
that the fairy tale was concocted to
explain the tragedy where children died.

306
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,460
Any news about Oliver Sheridan?

307
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:50,740
He's unaccounted for, but that doesn't
definitely mean he's been kidnapped.

308
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,749
You don't believe that.

309
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,996
Do you expect us to just
share this delusion

310
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,332
that Lightman is infallible? That
Wilkie might not have been innocent?

311
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,961
Without Lightman, you'd be in some
university basement doing research,

312
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,472
and you'd still be
a glorified baggage handler.

313
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,396
Maybe instead of
polishing up your resumes,

314
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:10,186
you want to think about what
you can do to help Lightman.

315
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,805
Zoe, Cal's not here.

316
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:20,397
Actually, I came to talk to you.

317
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,857
I'm worried about Cal.

318
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,902
He seems to be handling
things in his own unique way.

319
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,361
He won't even speak
to me about the case.

320
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:32,786
He won't even return my phone calls.

321
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:39,072
I was hoping you could
talk to him, Gillian.

322
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,628
You were the only one
who could always get through.

323
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,631
That's funny. I always
thought that about you.

324
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,437
The truth is there's probably only
one person that can reach him.

325
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:59,868
I can fly over the moon.

326
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,890
I can fly over the moon, OK?
I can swim under the sea.

327
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:06,691
The only one I tell
my secrets to is Beth.

328
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:09,778
My poodle.

329
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,470
Right.

330
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,746
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

331
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:22,415
So Foster sent you over here
to check on me, did she?

332
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:24,209
Yeah. Her and mom.

333
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,254
You tell them I'm fine.

334
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,425
Actually, I need to talk
to you about mom.

335
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:36,262
She's been acting depressed lately,

336
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:38,147
just different.

337
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:39,122
Well...

338
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:40,665
She is.

339
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,979
But she's a strong woman.

340
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:46,827
She'll get through it.

341
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:48,358
I know what's going on,

342
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,876
that it has to do with that
Wilkie guy who was executed.

343
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,990
Yeah. She thinks we might have made
a mistake, he might be innocent.

344
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,723
Well, was he?

345
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,129
I don't know.

346
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:06,125
We can rule out the homeless man
and the phone repairman

347
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,138
based on the old videos, but we're
still looking at the school bus driver

348
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:10,734
and the phone company supervisor.

349
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,924
The problem with these
suspects is lack of motive.

350
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:17,937
Whoever did this is probably
a raving lunatic anyway, so...

351
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,441
I found something in
Wilkie's old interview, right?

352
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,951
He's trying to sound crazy because he's
trying to get off on an insanity plea,

353
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:27,776
but when he says he only tells
his secrets to his poodle, Beth,

354
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,734
he's not faking it.
He had an ex-girlfriend.

355
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,861
Her name was Beth Lansford.

356
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,679
I think maybe he tells
his secrets to her.

357
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,094
Beth's the key.

358
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,967
Any idea where she is?

359
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:41,136
I spoke to her mum.

360
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:43,955
She signed into a psychiatric
hospital 2 days ago,

361
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,784
which is a bit of a coincidence!

362
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,334
Let me give it to you straight,
'cause you don't seem to get it.

363
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:51,816
Nobody cares about Wilkie's
dog or his ex-girlfriend.

364
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,674
- Excuse me?
- You're off this case,

365
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,879
and this comes from the top.

366
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,813
That's the Sheridan home phone.

367
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,688
You might wanna get that.

368
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:09,856
<i>Hello.</i>

369
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,813
<i>What's green and
red and goes really fast?</i>

370
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:14,877
Frog in a blender.

371
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,323
<i>A frog in a blender.</i>

372
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,785
<i>You have a really beautiful voice.</i>

373
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,956
<i>You remind me of my son Oliver
when he was a little boy.</i>

374
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,931
<i>He loves riddles, too,</i>

375
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:31,211
<i>and baseball and ice cream.</i>

376
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,588
Good. She keeps
humanizing the victim.

377
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:35,941
<i>What's your name?</i>

378
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,266
<i>Do you wanna know where Oliver is?</i>

379
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,560
<i>I do.</i>

380
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:44,671
<i>Yes, I do. I miss him very much.</i>

381
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,976
<i>Then tell me how you play
the game bloody murder.</i>

382
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,099
<i>You get in a circle with
everyone, and then you...</i>

383
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:56,653
<i>That's wrong.</i>

384
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:07,538
Damn it. The call's coming up
as if it's coming from 300

385
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:10,126
cell phone numbers in Virginia.
We'll never get a trace.

386
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,641
- I'm gonna see Beth.
- Go home, Lightman. I'm serious.

387
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:16,545
You try anything related to this case,
and FBI will drop the Lightman group.

388
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,676
And quite frankly, you're starting
to sound a little insane.

389
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,462
- Really?
- Really.

390
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,314
I was hoping you'd say that.

391
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,412
He's a bully, and he's a racist.

392
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:29,851
And just 'cause he's in the FBI
doesn't make him a God.

393
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:31,855
Besides, they're telling me
to do him in, so...

394
00:20:32,705 --> 00:20:35,733
- The voices?
- What, you can't hear 'em?

395
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:38,839
And they're actually
telling you to kill him?

396
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,240
Under a bus or, you know,
just shoot him. Whatever.

397
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:45,326
- Do you own a gun?
- I do. Course I do.

398
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,161
It's my right. Second amendment.

399
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:51,532
And what's this FBI agent's name?

400
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:53,668
Why?
What, you gonna warn him, are you?

401
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:57,643
Look, the point is
that I'm the victim here.

402
00:20:57,768 --> 00:21:00,287
He's walking around.
He's telling everyone I'm a psycho.

403
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:03,147
When he's the one
that's driving me crazy.

404
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:05,343
Look, just calm down.
I'm dealing with it, all right?

405
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:09,107
I would like you to...

406
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,644
stay with us for a while, Mr. Stein.

407
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:17,121
I came to get those little white pills,
the ones that help you sleep.

408
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:20,069
I'm afraid I have
to hold you for 72 hours

409
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,989
for being a danger to others.

410
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:23,740
Can I have jello?

411
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,207
No cheekin' your meds, Beth.

412
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:43,837
Let me see you swallow 'em.

413
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:47,127
Good. Thank you.

414
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:49,849
- All right, Professor.
- Morning, Mr. Stein.

415
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:50,974
Steen.

416
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,904
Steen.

417
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,832
What do you got?

418
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:07,992
Cheer up, Ralph.

419
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,687
It's a cheery place, this, isn't it?
Laugh a minute.

420
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,169
What are you in for?
No, don't tell me.

421
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:19,921
Let me guess. OCD?

422
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:21,631
Panic attacks?

423
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:23,257
Agoraphobia.

424
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:25,885
Nymphomania.

425
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,820
I am suicidal. Now leave me alone.

426
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:30,384
Suicide.

427
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:32,465
I know a thing or two
about suicide...

428
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:36,699
from, you know, an intimate perspective,
you might say.

429
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:38,773
Mind if I join you?

430
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:48,565
Did you know Jason Wilkie
named his poodle after you?

431
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,813
Who the hell are you?

432
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,914
Me? I'm just another nut case
lookin' for answers, love.

433
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,460
- Nurse.
- No, you don't wanna do that.

434
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:02,505
If you call for help,
I will bust your little game.

435
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,673
Game?

436
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:05,258
You're not suicidal.

437
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,387
You're not even depressed.
What you are is scared.

438
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,455
You're scared for your life.

439
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,599
That's why
you're hidin' out in here.

440
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,893
You don't know
what you're talking about.

441
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,061
I do.

442
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:20,175
You're in the paranoid chair.

443
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:22,525
It's the best seat in the house,

444
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,226
really,
'cause no one can sneak up on you.

445
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,051
See, depressives,
they retreat into themselves,

446
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:29,282
but you,

447
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,966
you're watchin' everybody.

448
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,453
- What's your point?
- My point is

449
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,289
that you checked in here
the day that Wilkie was executed.

450
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:37,657
Right?

451
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:41,105
Nothin'?

452
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:43,125
Really? What, you all right now?

453
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,547
Nurse!

454
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:47,864
- Nurse, I've got something to tell you.
- No, it's o...

455
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:50,053
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

456
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,931
Can I trouble you for a latte?

457
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,043
That's a bit rude, isn't it?

458
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:00,396
You were sayin'?

459
00:24:04,888 --> 00:24:06,565
A couple of days ago,

460
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,084
I got a call
from an old friend of Jason's.

461
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,449
He said he was watching me,

462
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:13,951
that people might ask questions.

463
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:18,278
He said if I said anything
about him and Jason,

464
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,546
he would hunt me down and kill me.

465
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,087
Who was he?

466
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,929
I don't know his real name.

467
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:28,044
Jason called him...

468
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:31,552
What? What'd he call him?

469
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:35,848
The pied piper.

470
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:37,600
The pied piper.

471
00:24:40,465 --> 00:24:43,284
How did Jason know him,
this pied piper character?

472
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,872
He said that they met as kids

473
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:49,787
when they were
at some summer music camp.

474
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:54,667
Now, look, I just...
I had one lager too many last night.

475
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,342
I've called my friend. We're all square,
so I'm ready to be released.

476
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:59,815
And what about the voices
telling you to kill him?

477
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,955
What voices?

478
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,757
Nah, that was just the beer talking.

479
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:06,492
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Well, Mr. Stein...

480
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:08,696
Steen.

481
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:12,096
This is what we call a flight
to recovery. It's always short-lived.

482
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:15,685
Look, doctor,
I do not have a mental illness.

483
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,348
- Terrific.
- Truly.

484
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,026
If you still don't have one in two days,
you'll be discharged.

485
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:40,792
It was worth a try.

486
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,958
So we found Oliver's
car in a ditch off route 4.

487
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,286
Looks like somebody may
have run him off the road.

488
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:48,337
We found this nearby.

489
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:50,965
That's Oliver's favorite jacket.

490
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:00,391
Come on.

491
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:10,597
Hello.

492
00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:14,233
<i>What feeds
on human blood 5 times a day?</i>

493
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,036
I don't know.

494
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:23,522
Why don't you tell me?

495
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:24,916
<i>Lice.</i>

496
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,376
<i>What insects fly alone in the dark?</i>

497
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,296
<i>Do you give up?</i>

498
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:32,790
<i>Locusts.</i>

499
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:34,759
Please, where's Oliver?

500
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,524
<i>I know, but you don't.</i>

501
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,158
What makes you think
I can break this hold?

502
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,311
You're the lawyer. You tell me.

503
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,411
You got into this mess
by threatening violence.

504
00:26:47,536 --> 00:26:49,649
You could have always
checked in voluntarily.

505
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,526
No, I needed to be on the locked ward
so I could talk to Beth.

506
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:54,518
When she mentioned the pied piper,

507
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:56,864
she was talking about a real person,
so I need to get out.

508
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,909
You could call Foster and Reynolds.

509
00:26:59,188 --> 00:27:00,743
They could always handle it.

510
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,162
I already used up my phone privilege
when I called you.

511
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,025
So are you gonna help me or what?

512
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:12,923
Though I find it fascinating you feel
like I'm the only one you can call,

513
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,091
and yet we can't even have
a real adult conversation.

514
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:16,926
Right. What do you wanna know?

515
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:20,096
Why don't you try telling me
how you really feel?

516
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:24,137
All right. I'm...

517
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,894
I'm upset,

518
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:29,272
and I'm scared,

519
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,343
and I'm really,
really, really rattled.

520
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,594
I give up.

521
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:39,398
You actually want me to try to convince
the doctor that you're not insane?

522
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:40,848
It's worth a shot, right?

523
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:50,084
Locust and darkness.

524
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:52,586
None of this is random.
He has a plan.

525
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,899
Also, he got angry when Faye didn't
know the rules to bloody murder.

526
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:58,467
He's controlling
and very detail-oriented.

527
00:27:58,765 --> 00:28:00,052
It's the 10 plagues.

528
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,431
Frogs, lice, locusts,
blood, darkness.

529
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,641
And the death of firstborn sons.

530
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,932
Rex was the eldest. So is Oliver.

531
00:28:08,057 --> 00:28:10,062
Everybody,
give us 5 minutes, please?

532
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,480
Come on. Let's go.

533
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,317
You know,

534
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:17,956
speaking of lunatics,
when I said you sounded insane,

535
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:20,335
I didn't mean for you to go check
into a psych ward.

536
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,117
- I know.
- You went to see Wilkie's exgirlfriend.

537
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:26,422
I couldn't resist it.
It turns out...

538
00:28:27,812 --> 00:28:29,248
Wilkie's not workin' on his own.

539
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,626
All right, the pied piper
is a nickname for a real person.

540
00:28:33,217 --> 00:28:35,004
They went to music camp together.

541
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,392
In the fairy tale,

542
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:40,217
the pied piper plays
some sort of flute or clarinet.

543
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,303
Maybe that's what he played
at music camp.

544
00:28:42,992 --> 00:28:45,473
You know, whoever it is,
he's got all the answers.

545
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,850
You do know...

546
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:50,895
that I'm not gonna
just walk away from this.

547
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,037
So tell the bureau to fire me...

548
00:28:54,574 --> 00:28:56,313
and to find another Lightman group.

549
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:58,861
- Good luck on that, by the way.
- Just be right this time.

550
00:28:59,245 --> 00:29:00,561
I'll do my level best.

551
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,288
You okay?

552
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:11,957
Yeah, I'm fantastic.

553
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:13,848
I'm here if you need me.

554
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:15,544
You know that, right?

555
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,930
Right.

556
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:19,733
I know that, love.

557
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,848
Hello.

558
00:29:28,973 --> 00:29:31,480
So mom has some pictures laid out
from the Wilkie trial,

559
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,519
a few months after you guys met.

560
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:35,606
She's looking a little
rounder than usual.

561
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:36,791
And?

562
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,994
And we've never really
discussed it before,

563
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,528
but I'm pretty good at math.

564
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:42,863
Your point being?

565
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:46,075
I was born 7 1/2 months
after you guys married.

566
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,290
Would you believe...

567
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:50,663
that you were premature?

568
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:52,832
At 8 pounds, 8 ounces?

569
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:55,558
No, your mum was pregnant
when I married her.

570
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:58,337
But you couldn't have just
come out and told me that?

571
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,414
No, we didn't want
to celebrate our mistakes,

572
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,966
have you go on and copy 'em.

573
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,019
- So I was a mistake?
- Course not.

574
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:08,025
So how'd it happen? Were you drunk?

575
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,725
Was it just a one-night stand?
Did you even go on a date first?

576
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:13,864
Yes,

577
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,499
no, and yes.

578
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:17,848
What's the matter, em?

579
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:22,148
Did you only marry mom
because you got her pregnant?

580
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:24,900
No. No, of course not.
I'm not that much of a gentleman.

581
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,870
No, be serious.
I wanna know if I'm the reason

582
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,578
you guys spent
14 miserable years together.

583
00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:34,485
Look, I married your mum...

584
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,208
because I loved her.

585
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:39,292
Then you comin' along
just helped me pull the trigger.

586
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,010
Plus they were by no means

587
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:44,432
14 miserable years.

588
00:30:46,048 --> 00:30:47,048
So...

589
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,764
I didn't, like, ruin your life
or something like that?

590
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:54,114
No, you were
the best news I ever got.

591
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:56,604
Still are.

592
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,257
- So you were drunk.
- Yeah.

593
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:02,503
- It wasn't a one-night stand.
- No.

594
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,313
- And you were dating.
- Yeah.

595
00:31:05,423 --> 00:31:08,115
I married your mum
'cause I loved her.

596
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,250
If I had to do it all over again...

597
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:14,343
No, I take that back.

598
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,375
Studies show
that the strongest deterrent

599
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,803
to a lawsuit is familiarity,
a personal relationship.

600
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:24,035
So I figure I establish
a rapport with Kevin.

601
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,328
It'll be much harder for him to sue
knowing it'll affect my livelihood.

602
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,220
Well, I'm goin' with you,

603
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,519
if this works, I'm not letting you
take all the credit for saving Lightman.

604
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:33,928
And if it doesn't work?

605
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:38,057
Then it's all your fault, I'm gonna call
the Rader firm and set up an interview.

606
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:43,150
So, anyway, we just wanted to come by
and see how you were doing.

607
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:44,818
Last time we saw you,

608
00:31:45,424 --> 00:31:48,724
you were pretty upset,
understandably, so... and, uh...

609
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,575
We...
Well, we brought you some pastries.

610
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,414
I know firsthand what stress can do.
It can...

611
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,341
You call what I've been
going through just stress?

612
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:02,586
Dr. Lightman tried
to stop the execution.

613
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:04,588
He's devoted himself to the case.

614
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,924
He's close to find if someone
elsehad been involved.

615
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:09,593
That doesn't change the fact that Jason
is dead because

616
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,136
your boss made a mistake.

617
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:15,473
Let's cut to the chase. Why are you
here? Convince me not to sue Lightman.

618
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:20,165
I know this might seem pretty weird,
but,

619
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:24,068
if there's anything you need...

620
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,530
Or if you just wanna talk

621
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,870
or something, that's my number.

622
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,236
It was really nice
getting to know you.

623
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,584
Thank you.

624
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:44,712
No one can even look me
in the eye these days,

625
00:32:45,284 --> 00:32:46,630
so I appreciate it.

626
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:53,512
Maybe I'll hold off on suing Lightman
till I learn what he finds.

627
00:32:57,649 --> 00:32:59,699
<i>I did not hurt that little boy.</i>

628
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:02,409
<i>You want me to confess, but I won't.</i>

629
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:08,563
<i>I did not hurt that little boy.</i>

630
00:33:09,013 --> 00:33:11,313
<i>You want me to confess, but I won't.</i>

631
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,996
<i>Do you know who the
first liar in the world was?</i>

632
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,301
The devil.

633
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:29,417
- In the bible, he's the father of lies.
- <i>Is Zoe a lawyer or a liar?</i>

634
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,843
Nah, if we're playin'
20 questions here,

635
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:37,410
I think it's my turn.
What's your deal with eldest sons?

636
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:41,560
<i>Do you know where your daughter is?</i>

637
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:44,615
<i>Can she come out and play?</i>

638
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,049
<i>Dial by name.</i>

639
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,076
Emily.

640
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,302
<i>Emily.</i>

641
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:02,764
- Emily.
- <i>Hey, Cal, it's me.</i>

642
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:04,790
<i>Emily left her phone.
She went to see you.</i>

643
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:06,669
She left my place about an hour ago.

644
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,761
We got a problem.

645
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:12,362
Hannah said she never picked up Emily.
Tell me exactly what happened.

646
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:15,177
I got a call on my private line,
asking me if I knew where Emily was.

647
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:18,186
Was that him?

648
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:20,347
What did he say?

649
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:24,228
Cal Lightman, calling for
Agent Reynolds. Well find him.

650
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,231
- Tell him it's an emergency.
- What did he say?

651
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,734
The FBI will start a search.
We should just cool. Emily's friends...

652
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:38,272
I told you Haley was picking me up.
We just went to get something to eat.

653
00:34:40,138 --> 00:34:41,245
You said Hannah.

654
00:34:41,551 --> 00:34:42,901
No, I said Haley.

655
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:48,971
First there are the phone calls. Then,
he takes your child. That's the pattern.

656
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:53,132
Let's go through all this stuff again.
What's in that box?

657
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:58,192
Photos that Wilkie's mother gave me
during the trial to prove

658
00:34:58,317 --> 00:35:00,514
that Jason was a good boy.

659
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:03,851
Rex was kept alive for 3 days.

660
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,437
- News clippings aren't relevant.
- All is relevant.

661
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,522
A killer is after our daughter,
the only way

662
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,859
to keep her safe is to catch him.
You don't decide what's relevant or not.

663
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,549
That's precisely what the killer wants,
to panic us into stopping our search.

664
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:18,699
The best way that we can
end this is to find him.

665
00:35:19,323 --> 00:35:21,160
I just wanna keep her safe.

666
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:26,660
Well, the FBI's parked
right outside.

667
00:35:28,405 --> 00:35:30,005
I can't take any more.

668
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:34,089
You can do this.

669
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:54,210
Those photographs from Wilkie's mum,
are they from when he was a kid?

670
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,447
Well, the Pied Piper and Jason
knew each other when they were kids,

671
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,282
so there might be something there.

672
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:08,536
Kevin's the youngest, right?

673
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:11,668
Look at the body language.

674
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,840
He's clearly in control. He's dominant.
The other 2, older 2, they adore him.

675
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,883
And who's the older one?

676
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,433
William.

677
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,644
Wilkie's mother said that her oldest son
died of pneumonia when he was a kid.

678
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:35,576
Oh, my God. It's Kevin.

679
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,096
With a clarinet.

680
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,843
Kevin is the pied piper, right?
He made the phone calls.

681
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,046
He kidnapped Rex,
but he had Jason kill him.

682
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:51,745
- They were partners.
- Why?

683
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,382
It was revenge for the death
of their eldest brother, William.

684
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:59,511
William came down with pneumonia after
their father lost his job at the diner.

685
00:37:00,228 --> 00:37:02,886
The diner was torn down
by the Sheridan company,

686
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,592
- their first development deal.
- The family was worried about money,

687
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:08,238
they didn't take him to the hospital.
He died after 3 days.

688
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:11,228
So they blamed the Sheridan
family enough to kill Rex?

689
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:15,009
And after Jason was executed,
Kevin had to take revenge again.

690
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:16,803
We found Kevin's car.

691
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,581
He's long gone, and there's no sign
of Oliver at his house.

692
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:21,165
We must have tipped him off.

693
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,657
We told him Lightman was close
to finding the culprit.

694
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:28,584
If his M.O. is to kill the victim on the
3d day, Oliver could be dead already.

695
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,678
All right, hit the lights.

696
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:43,857
Well, the GPS on Kevin's car
shows us he was here 3 days ago.

697
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:47,402
He was chief engineer on this project
before it was shut down a month ago.

698
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:51,018
All right, everybody. Keep your eye
and your ears open. Let's fan out.

699
00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:11,044
You hear that?

700
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,962
There's someone in there. Give me
something to open this thing up with.

701
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,087
Come on!

702
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:25,954
Ah, damn it!

703
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:36,229
I hate rats.
Pritchard, you stay with Lightman.

704
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:39,268
You three, come with me.
Let's check upstairs.

705
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:01,630
This doesn't belong here.

706
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,420
Yeah, hold this.

707
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:33,889
Oliver, can you hear me?

708
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,109
Hold it right there. Don't move.

709
00:40:04,788 --> 00:40:05,888
Cal, you OK?

710
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:08,776
- Yeah, he's in the wall.
- Let me see your hands.

711
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:10,952
- Check on Oliver.
- We got an agent down.

712
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:12,177
Right on it.

713
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:22,201
Mr. Sheridan, I owe you an apology.

714
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:24,029
Sorry about being such an ass.

715
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:26,298
Forget it.
And thank you for everything.

716
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,679
Pleasure.

717
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,167
You're bleedin'.
You don't wanna go to the hospital?

718
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:32,742
Nah, these guys
are gonna patch me up.

719
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:36,566
How about, uh, Wilkie?

720
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,846
We found equipment
he used to make the calls.

721
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:42,505
- He's not talkin' yet, but he's stable.
- Stable? He's an animal.

722
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:45,566
If I had my way,
he wouldn't be talking at all.

723
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:47,389
Good stuff.

724
00:40:51,844 --> 00:40:55,140
Beato Michaeli archangelo,
beato Ioanni...

725
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:56,328
Turn that off.

726
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,960
- Are you OK?
- Peachy.

727
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:05,921
I got hold of Jason Wilkie's footage
just before his execution.

728
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,006
His final prayer was in Latin.

729
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,029
It was a confession of sins.

730
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:12,344
Maybe it was his way
of taking the blame

731
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:14,669
for... for killing Rex Sheridan.

732
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,274
Well, I'd like to think this is over,
but, I've been wrong before, so...

733
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:22,815
- We never doubted you, Cal.
- Really?

734
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,581
- Not for a second.
- Really?

735
00:41:31,854 --> 00:41:34,074
- I had your back.
- Oh, yeah?

736
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,035
Well, I had an exit plan, too.

737
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,610
Yeah. Jack Rader.

738
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,172
I'd have done the same thing.

739
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:42,397
Pays better.

740
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:51,550
Ooh, sorry.

741
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:53,228
You're enjoying this.

742
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:56,221
No, I'm doing nothing of the sort.
I'm like Florence Nightingale.

743
00:41:56,741 --> 00:42:00,566
You could make your life a lot easier
if you admit that you need people.

744
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:02,477
You don't have to be
such a lone wolf.

745
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:06,439
Aw, do me a favor. With you two
and Foster and the rest of the group,

746
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,151
- it's a 3-ring bloody circus.
- You know what I mean.

747
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,215
Let the record reflect
that Zoe Landau is correct.

748
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,290
- You happy now?
- Ecstatic.

749
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,533
OK, don't move.

750
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:19,744
Don't move.

751
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:22,914
You're all set.

752
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,018
- Really?
- Yeah. Let's go get something to eat.

753
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:29,921
Hey, I'm sorry you guys thought
I was missing earlier.

754
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,174
I thought of a perfect solution

755
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,092
to make sure
that never happens again.

756
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:35,927
Oh, yeah? Let's hear it.

757
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:39,231
Buy me a car.
I mean, think about it.

758
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:43,436
You'll never have to get confused
about who's picking me up.

759
00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:47,625
- That's clever, that is.
- She gets her craftiness from you.

760
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,149
Yeah, not bloody likely.

761
00:42:49,827 --> 00:42:51,972
So is... is that a yes?

762
00:42:56,682 --> 00:42:58,082
Dream on, darlin'.
