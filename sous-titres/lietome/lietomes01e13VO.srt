00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:57,932
I didn't sleep good last night.

3
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:00,620
You can borrow my notes
for the midterm.

4
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:02,409
I don't need 'em anymore.

5
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:12,324
Your farecard's out.

6
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,751
- I don't have any cash.
- No fare, no ride.

7
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:16,304
I need to get on this bus.

8
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:18,982
Am I going to have a problem here?

but we've got to push forward right now.

00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:06,245
- What do you know?
- It looks like

31
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,725
the bomber
was 19-year-old Jamal Bata.

32
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,864
{\pos(192,232)}His parents converted to Islam
in the '60s. They're now deceased.

33
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,520
He has no siblings. And he attended
a mosque in Northeast D.C.

34
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:19,592
{\Right now}We're talking to a friend of Bata's
who claims he couldn't get on the bus.

35
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,720
- Does the FBI have anyone in custody?
- Just picked up the coach

36
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,847
of the {\Bomber's}soccer team.
He's got ties to groups{\on our wath list}.

37
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,098
Can I talk to him?

38
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,685
No, Deputy Director Messler doesn't want
anyone else in with the suspect.

39
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,855
She's got "deputy" in her title
for a reason. Can you go around her?

40
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,604
Yeah, that sounds good,
but that's just not how this works.

41
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:37,079
How does it work?

42
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:40,178
Solitary confinement,
stress positions at Guantanamo?{\- Come on, now.}

43
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:43,250
Or did you guys set up a new place now?
With all the bad publicity and that?

44
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,677
The Bureau has never supported
extreme interrogation.

45
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:47,912
And this administration
doesn't either, OK?

46
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:48,871
Really?

47
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,041
Cal, if we can identify other members
of the cell at the mosque...

48
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,251
Why don't you and Torres take that?

49
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,431
Can you get me in with him?

50
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,151
No guarantees.

51
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,638
You okay?

52
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,056
Yeah, I'm fine.

53
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:09,564
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

54
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:11,349
- {\-How about}You?
- Fine.

55
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:13,915
I was going to stay home with her,
but the DOJ wants everyone in.

56
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,190
- I didn't want her to be alone.
- I would've been fine.

57
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,776
Department of Justice is a target.

58
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,070
That's why I'm leaving her
here with you.

59
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,321
I have to go in.

60
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,294
{\You know, I don't see}Why you couldn't have
just dropped me off at Dan's?

61
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,202
Because Dan's parents aren't home.
And the last time{\Dan's parents weren't home}...

62
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,370
You're lecturing me about sex?

63
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,958
We got bigger issues here.
I wish you didn't have to go in.

64
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,043
It's my job.
I've gotta go.

65
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,003
I just spoke to the director.

66
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,882
He must really like your work.
No one else is getting in but us.

67
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,089
<i>I coached Jamal at soccer practice.</i>

68
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:52,454
<i>He raised money
for our charity drive.</i>

69
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,562
<i>But I never recruited him
as a killer.</i>

70
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:59,387
Your brother
is a member of Al-Shabab,

71
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:03,057
one of the most radical groups
in the Horn of Africa.

72
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:06,615
Isn't he?

73
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,660
Last month,
an FBI informant spotted Mr. Ali

74
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,574
with some Afghani nationals
that they've been tracking.

75
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,995
And given his access to the bomber,

76
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,835
- he's our prime suspect.
- Your setup's all wrong here.

77
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:19,616
What's all wrong?

78
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:21,630
What are you doing?

79
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,968
- What the hell are you doing?
- What the hell are you doing? Stop it!

80
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:27,543
It's all wrong.

81
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:28,929
What was that?

82
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:33,976
Deputy Messler,
this is Dr. Cal Lightman.

83
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,061
He's offered to help
with the suspect.

84
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:37,479
The...

85
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,931
director has cleared us to be here.

86
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:41,900
Listen, I don't care
who you spoke with.

87
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,807
Get him the hell out of here.

88
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:48,574
You've had four hours with him.
What do you have?

89
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,995
You got nothing.
{\You got}Less than nothing, right?

90
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,251
Listen, we're gonna crack
this son of a bitch.

91
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:55,844
That's the kind of thinking
that led to Abu Ghraib.

92
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,584
Good P.R. for Al Qaeda, by the way.
Well done on that one.

93
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:00,753
Can someone escort him out of here?

94
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,449
What do you expect me to do?
This is what the director wants.

95
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:06,224
You're not gonna crack Mr. Ali,
because...

96
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:09,470
he's only showing
one emotion... Fear.

97
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:11,638
He's scared
because he's been caught.

98
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,386
Or maybe he's scared
because you threw him in a dungeon

99
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,687
- and you threatened to render him.
- The Bureau doesn't render suspects.

100
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,235
Your setup increases fear, which puts up
barriers to getting to the truth.

101
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,481
If you want
real reliable information,

102
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,993
- you've got to alter the conditions.
- Alter them how?

103
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,457
I want you...

104
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:37,821
in there.

105
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,587
And I want him...

106
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:40,712
out here.

107
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,856
I spoke with Jamal several times
in the last month.

108
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,696
He's very quiet, but never angry.

109
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:55,358
The kid blew up a bus.
He was angry about something.

110
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,683
Agent Young, do you have any idea

111
00:07:57,808 --> 00:08:00,187
what these accusations
will do to our community?

112
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:03,180
That's why we want
to conduct these interviews right away.

113
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:05,442
Did Jamal ever express
any hatred for America?

114
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:10,182
We come here to worship,
not to discuss politics.

115
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,532
I asked the men to come here
so you could talk to them.

116
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:16,662
But... you must understand,
they are on guard now.

117
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,708
We just have a few quick questions.

118
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,177
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

119
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:38,684
I want to help you find
anyone who was part of this.

120
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,562
We appreciate your time.

121
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:43,939
There's nothing more important.

122
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:51,321
Jamal Bata was a member here
at Auliyah for almost two years.

123
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:55,659
In that time, did anyone ever hear him
talking about violence?

124
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:03,126
Is there a heater on in here{\or something?}?
Am I the only one who's hot?

125
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,059
So you accidentally removed
your head scarf?

126
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:24,605
And what, you were gauging
the reactions of the men?

127
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,649
Terrorist{\s} tend to see the world in black
and white.{\We thought} We might get a reaction.

128
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:31,587
This is the video capture
of the first group of men we talked to.

129
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:33,197
When I took off my head scarf

130
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,866
there were a lot of reactions...
Shock, interest.

131
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,386
But only one displayed this.

132
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,871
That's some intense anger.

133
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:43,498
We talked to 11 groups,
about 10 to 12 men each.

134
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,131
These are the ones
who showed extreme anger.

135
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:49,296
Any fundamentalist would show that.
It doesn't mean they're terrorists.

136
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,924
It doesn't...
But it's a place to start.

137
00:09:57,621 --> 00:09:59,932
I apologize
for the conditions before,

138
00:10:00,222 --> 00:10:02,851
but the road to tyranny is always paved
with claims of necessity, right?

139
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,674
I grew up in Somalia.

140
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:06,355
I know about tyranny.

141
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:08,190
What do you know about the bombs?

142
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:12,319
Did Jamal ever tell you anything
about what he was planning to do?

143
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,483
I never heard him speak of it.

144
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:22,046
<i>These men are possible suspects
from the mosque.</i>

145
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,289
You know this guy?

146
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:30,009
What about him?

147
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,426
- No, I do not.
- That's the first lie you've told us.

148
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,138
When you spoke about Jamal before,

149
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:41,807
you were sad.

150
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:45,018
If you'd been behind these bombings
you would have been proud of him.

151
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,771
I had nothing to do
with the bombing.

152
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,106
I believe you.

153
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:51,696
I do, I believe you.

154
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,717
But you've got to tell us what
you're hiding. Because if you don't,

155
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:57,662
more children like Jamal
will be recruited

156
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,097
by the men who did plan this.

157
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,137
Somali children...

158
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,836
Their parents... pay us

159
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,454
to bring them here.

160
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,423
We help them get into this country.

161
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:16,661
So why were you afraid
to tell us that?

162
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,552
The children are illegals.

163
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:21,013
So you're smugglers...
You and this guy.

164
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,974
<i>We simply try
to give them better lives.</i>

165
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:28,676
I had nothing to do
with this bombing.

166
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,775
You think he's telling the truth?

167
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,361
This man's not a terrorist.

168
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:38,725
You should move on.
It's a waste of time.

169
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:42,885
Oh, God.

170
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,288
Another suicide bomber
at Maulin Virginia.

171
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:52,887
At least ten dead, and dozens more
have been injured.

172
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,654
And Al Qaeda's put up another statement

173
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,979
saying this is just the beginning.

174
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,148
A few of the survivors
identified the bomber.

175
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,830
We think he was one of the young men
we saw at the mosque.

176
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,225
Rasheed Kahn.

177
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,230
I just talked to this guy this morning.
I didn't read anything off of him.

178
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:15,567
I missed him.

179
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,182
Reporting live
from Virginia Metropolitan,

180
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:19,839
where victims are being brought.

181
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:22,405
A second deadly suicide bombing,

182
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,442
this time at the Langley Oaks Mall

183
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,698
has D.C. and citizens
of every city in a panic.

184
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,666
They just confirmed it, The two bombers
are members of the same mosque.

185
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:33,877
Hang on a second.

186
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:40,782
There was another one.
My friends go to that mall.

187
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:44,096
- How many more are there going to be?
- I don't know, darling.

188
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:47,171
- Can we please go home?
- Soon.

189
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,257
I don't want you watching
any more of this stuff, all right?

190
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:56,935
- It's got to be rough on the kid ?
- Yeah.

191
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:59,402
- Do you have any video yet?
- No, not from the mall.

192
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,574
And they're still piecing
together tape from the bus.

193
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,200
We need photographs of the two bombers
interacting w00th people that they knew.

194
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:07,586
People at the mosque
or on the soccer field.

195
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,218
- They want me on the scene, so...
- All right, take Loker with you.

196
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:12,846
- We need all the video we can find.
- All right, you got it.

197
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:19,130
Hey. Don't beat
yourself up over this, all right?

198
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,369
I talked to the second bomber
3 hours before he went into that mall.

199
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:23,994
He killed 13 people.

200
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,518
I looked right at him,
I didn't see anything.

201
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,892
I completely missed him.

202
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:35,439
You would have seen it.
You could have stopped this.

203
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:39,276
All right, 1986,
I'm in Belfast for the British.

204
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:43,078
I let go of a man. That night he walks
into a pub and he shoots six people.

205
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,016
Three of them dead.

206
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:50,500
- How'd he get by you?
- Sometimes they just do.

207
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:56,857
- I need you focused, love.
- Yeah.

208
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,165
This job has opened some crazy doors.

209
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,274
This is not one
I ever wanted to walk through.

210
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,075
The shrapnel pattern's consistent
with most suicide bombs.

211
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,199
Looks like they used nails. The only
good thing is it was a small device.

212
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,033
Small?

213
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:31,809
There's shrapnel marks
100 feet down the walls.

214
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:34,308
If it was big,
there'd be no walls.

215
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,000
Look at this.

216
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:39,899
See how the blood
is sprayeddown and outward?

217
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:44,705
- This is where he detonated.
- That's great.

218
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,178
- I'll be outside vomiting.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

219
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:51,389
No, that... that doesn't make sense.

220
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:54,427
The food court is only 50 feet away.

221
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,350
The bomb would have been
a lot more effective there.

222
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:01,066
Know what?

223
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,318
There's no cameras covering this area.

224
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,810
That's probably why he did it here.

225
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:09,496
What do you see?

226
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:15,778
- That camera caught it.
- That's not pointed this way.

227
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:18,604
No, not directly, but it's pointed at
what used to be a mirror.

228
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,319
The angle's tight, but those cameras,
they have wide-angle lenses.

229
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:26,132
A.V. Club in high school?

230
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:28,176
I understand, Mr. Director.

231
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:31,054
I'll make sure that Dr. Lightman
has everything that he needs.

232
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:36,188
- What are we looking for?
- Disgust.

233
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,311
The language of hate.

234
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:41,314
Any sign on the bomber's faces
of someone that they were working with.

235
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:44,041
There's nothing here.

236
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:47,710
Nothing on the bomber's faces,
nothing on the faces of their friends.

237
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:50,483
We need more recent photographs.

238
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,326
- Something must have changed.
- I have the Secret Service

239
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,883
on the line for you.

240
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:59,157
Yeah, you must be looking
for Torres.

241
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:05,806
What's this about?

242
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:09,781
I'm glad that you called, too.

243
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:12,999
Don't. Don't.

244
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:17,017
Look, I'm glad that you called,
but I just can't do this, okay?

245
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,424
- You all right?
- Yeah.

246
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:33,499
I got a call from Secret Service.

247
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:35,918
Are they worried about the White House?

248
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:39,164
No, Dupree's unaccounted for.

249
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,970
What? Torres' boyfriend?

250
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:46,880
FBI have a chatter that malls
were being targeted.

251
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,549
Secret Service
was sent in to coordinate security

252
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:52,385
- after the first bomb.
- And he was there?

253
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,347
He was there or he was on his way
there... it's unclear.

254
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,664
Either way, he hasn't called in
since the blast.

255
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,135
- All right, I'll tell her.
- Hey...

256
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,542
- I don't think we should.
- Cal...

257
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,984
She interviewed the mall bomber
and she missed him.

258
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,945
- She's not responsible.
- She thinks she is.

259
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:13,228
She thinks she killed those people.

260
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:15,786
You want her to think
that her boyfriend was one of them?

261
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:16,956
She'd want to know.

262
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:21,007
I've got calls in to the director
of the FBI, the head of the ATF.

263
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:22,947
There are people canvassing
in the hospitals.

264
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:25,676
There's nothing
that she can do right now.

265
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,078
- I don't know about this.
- We need her focused.

266
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,413
Hey, you ready to go?

267
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,092
- You okay?
- Yeah. Let's go.

268
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:51,407
You need to let us go home.
We've lost our son.

269
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:53,728
Your son killed a lot of people
at that mall.

270
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,013
He worked with you here.

271
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,432
Looks like you had some of what
he needed to build that bomb.

272
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:02,021
My son was not a radical.

273
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:04,457
Rasheed would never hurt
innocent people.

274
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,584
The family is usually the last to know.

275
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,921
Did Rasheed have any extremist views?

276
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:11,423
He loved this country.

277
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,371
You're trying to make him
into a mujahid.

278
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:18,714
- That wasn't him.
- Your nephew doesn't seem to agree.

279
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,827
What?

280
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,778
Shame. You're ashamed.

281
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,301
Of course I feel ashamed.

282
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,611
Someone so close to me
hides a secret like this.

283
00:18:35,768 --> 00:18:37,031
How can you not know.

284
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:45,707
Mrs. Kahn, what was Rasheed's day like?

285
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,991
He would wake up early for prayers...

286
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:54,246
have breakfast...

287
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:56,885
go to band practice.

288
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:01,389
After classes, he loved to edit
the school newspaper.

289
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:04,445
He volunteered at the mosque.

290
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:06,895
He did his homework.

291
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:21,812
This wasn't your fault.

292
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:28,526
So that "typical day" stuff?
What was that, some kind of psych test?

293
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:32,120
Radical groups prey on outcasts...
disaffected kids.

294
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,432
Rasheed should have been a loner,
but he was in the band,

295
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:36,634
he worked on the newspaper,
he volunteered at the mosque.

296
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,746
Where he could have been exposed
to other radicals.

297
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:40,671
He didn't fit the profile.

298
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,362
DOJ wants us all over
Rasheed Kahn's school.

299
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:47,492
That means I want to talk to every
student and teacher, the janitors.

300
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:49,835
I want to find out
who was absent that day.

301
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,993
I want to see if there are
any substitute teachers.

302
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:55,368
Can you give me a second, please?
Hey.

303
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,795
How's Emily?

304
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,372
She's okay, I guess.

305
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:02,643
The second bomb shook her up a bit.

306
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:04,619
Yeah, she's not the only one.

307
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:07,038
What are your law enforcement contacts

308
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,873
like over at, Fairfax County?

309
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,175
I'd say pretty good at the moment.

310
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,128
I need your help. There's a guy
I know in the Secret Service

311
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,668
and he was on his way to the mall,
and he's gone missing.

312
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:20,134
- What's his name?  - Karl Dupree.

313
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:22,139
- With a "K"?
- Yeah.

314
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:24,053
- Okay, I'm on it.

315
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:26,215
Good. And you're leaving soon,
aren't you?

316
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,070
No coffee stops. No supermarkets.

317
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,958
Just stay out of the Capitol, all right?

318
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,731
You always did have a funny way
of saying I love you.

319
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,233
Yeah.

320
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:46,043
- How are you doing, kiddo?
- Yeah. Fine.

321
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,572
Hey, they were able to put together
the tape from the bus,

322
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:52,707
and we have video from the mall.

323
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:54,538
You're going to want to take a look.

324
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,376
These are the two suicide bombers,
moments before detonation.

325
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:01,676
Their body language is paradoxical.

326
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,262
Could you try using smaller words
that mean more?

327
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:06,484
Terrorists are usually
so afraid of being spotted

328
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,913
that the keep their heads down
and avoid making eye contact.

329
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,686
Right. But check out
the video from the bus.

330
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:13,346
Jamal's got his head up.

331
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:15,919
He's making eye contact
with the other passengers.

332
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:17,805
And look at the mall bomber.

333
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,666
He's flirting with that woman.
He's got a classic head tilt.

334
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,280
He's squared his hips to face her.

335
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,855
He's leaning in.

336
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,700
Maybe he pulled her in to kill her.

337
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,744
No, there's nothing on his face.

338
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:31,623
He's too relaxed for a suicide mission.
So you're saying he didn't know?

339
00:21:31,828 --> 00:21:33,222
Rasheed didn't fit the profile.

340
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:34,900
He had no history of violence.

341
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:38,172
That would explain why Torres didn't see
any anxiety when she talked to him.

342
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,464
So no anxiety...

343
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:43,409
... no determination.

344
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:48,039
These are the faces of innocents,
not suicide bombers.

345
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,367
Forensic analysis found that remote
detonators were used in both bombings.

346
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:03,050
Those young men were victims, too.
They had no idea what they were doing.

347
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:05,531
But the terrorists wanted the world
to believe that they did.

348
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,262
The idea of homegrown suicide bombers
choosing to blow themselves up

349
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:11,371
is a lot scarier than some foreign
radical planting bombs on people.

350
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:13,748
I need you to find out
who had access to both kids.

351
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:14,842
All right.

352
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:18,302
Rasheed was targeted. He had
no idea that he was carrying the bomb.

353
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:20,414
That's why you couldn't read him
{\when you were }by talking to him.

354
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,927
{\Yeah, }But somebody planted a bomb on him,
and I might have missed them.

355
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:24,467
No, you didn't miss anything.

356
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,870
We need to look harder
at the mosque.

357
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:28,775
Go look at the tape.

358
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:35,764
- Any word on Dupree?
- No, nothing yet.

359
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:38,571
We'll tell her
swhen we know something new.

360
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,234
{\But }She knows she's not responsible
for the second bombing{\ now}.

361
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,359
We've had two bombs in a day.
More are likely.

362
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:45,905
She's one of the few people
who can actually help find these guys.

363
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:48,606
The most productive thing
she can do for Dupree...

364
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,981
she's doing it.

365
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:01,337
What about that?
Guy keeps rubbing his arm.

366
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,877
No, we clocked him when we were there.
Arthritis.

367
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:05,758
Confirmed it
with his medical records.

368
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:08,105
I'm moving to Israel.

369
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:11,352
If I'm going to live {\somewhere }where I can get
blown up in a bus or in a mall{\ at any time},

370
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,349
I want beaches and {\I want }women
who speak their minds.

371
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,644
- You don't have much of a filter{\, do you}?
- He calls it radical honesty.

372
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,104
It grows on you.

373
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,404
- Wait, go back.
- What?

374
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:25,187
Go back to the point when the Imam walks
in front of the camera.

375
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:32,536
Look at his eyebrows.
They're raised and pulled together.

376
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,406
How in the hell did you see that?

377
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:37,100
Did he seem that anxious
when you talked to him?

378
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:38,356
No, nothing like that.

379
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,501
Maybe he's just nervous
about us talking to his men.

380
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:42,253
Maybe {\it's }something else.

381
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,627
I'm not a murderer.

382
00:23:51,795 --> 00:23:54,686
See, after 9-11, I...
We all struggled.

383
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:58,269
I'm from Saudi Arabia.

384
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,855
I studied at the same mosque
as one of the hijackers.

385
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,149
I never believed
in their brand of Islam.

386
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:05,109
And I realized
that to be an American

387
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:07,779
I had to honor my country
and my religion.

388
00:24:08,742 --> 00:24:10,698
So I called the FBI office

389
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:12,762
and offered to help.

390
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,177
You were an informant?

391
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,496
If anyone I had concerns
about came into the mosque,

392
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:18,039
I'd make a call.

393
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,464
Deputy Messler never said
anything about that.

394
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:23,002
I only work with one man.
Agent Richard Squire.

395
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,755
- Do you know him?
- No, not well.

396
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,383
He left the Bureau right after
the administration turned over.

397
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:32,495
You didn't like him very much.

398
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:36,766
He took advantage.

399
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,551
One day, he asked me about
an argument I had with a congregant

400
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:43,064
at a private ablution ceremony.

401
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,207
There was no way he could
have known about the argument.

402
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:48,589
So he bugged the place.

403
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:51,614
Audio surveillance
over the ablution fountain,

404
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,908
here in the prayer hall,
in the bathrooms.

405
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,199
If the FBI was willing
to do that before,

406
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:59,557
you tell me, what will they do now?

407
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:03,924
So?

408
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:06,260
So the FBI has no record
of any bugging.

409
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:08,312
And audio surveillance
is a major operation.

410
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,487
The Imam was telling the truth.

411
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:13,136
Maybe Squire did it on his own.

412
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,044
Well, there were a lot of cowboys
after 9-11, so it's certainly possible.

413
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:20,219
But if he did tap this mosque,
I want those tapes.

414
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,258
<i>Found your man Dupree.</i>

415
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:25,735
Just got off the phone
with Fairfax County P.D.

416
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,465
They confirmed he was at the mall.

417
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:31,789
Yeah, thanks.

418
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:38,870
- What?
- Dupree was in the mall.

419
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,873
He was in the elevator
when the bomb went off.

420
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,329
He's alive.

421
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:46,627
He's... unconscious.

422
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,380
- Oh, my God!
- Take my car.

423
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:51,100
Virginia Metropolitan.

424
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,882
Excuse me, ma'am.
We have to get him to surgery.

425
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:24,453
How's he doing?

426
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:27,003
He's got blood in his brain.

427
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,178
A hematoma.

428
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:32,173
He was in an elevator
for four hours.

429
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:33,841
Nobody knew where he was.

430
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:38,744
What was that?

431
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:40,181
What?

432
00:26:40,508 --> 00:26:41,508
That look.

433
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:44,838
Did you know?

434
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:47,480
You knew he was missing?

435
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,781
There was nothing you could have done.
Nothing.

436
00:26:50,906 --> 00:26:52,860
- I could have done...?
- Ria...

437
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:56,364
Oh, wait... I see, I see, okay.

438
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:59,121
It wasn't... it wasn't you, was it?

439
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:02,239
Lightman decided not to tell me.

440
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:04,205
Everything possible

441
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,275
was being done to find Dupree

442
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,229
- and Cal relies on you, Ria.
- I don't believe this, I really don't.

443
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:13,005
Lightman plays God
and you make excuses for him.

444
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:16,592
You leave me the hell alone.

445
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,457
I served the Bureau for 22 years.

446
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,783
Didn't want to work
for some kind of castrated version

447
00:27:27,908 --> 00:27:29,647
of the DOJ, so I left.

448
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:31,236
Oh, was that why?

449
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:34,026
Or did someone find out about
your illegal operation at the mosque?

450
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,648
There was no illegal operation.

451
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:38,538
I don't think that's true.

452
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:41,261
While you people were whining
about civil liberties,

453
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:43,557
extremists were plotting
against this country.

454
00:27:43,682 --> 00:27:47,123
Maybe you'll quiet down now that we
have bombs blowing up in our backyard.

455
00:27:47,657 --> 00:27:50,305
You know, you don't seem
particularly upset about these bombings.

456
00:27:50,484 --> 00:27:51,794
Quite the opposite, in fact.

457
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,507
Islamic extremism
is flourishing under our noses.

458
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,912
If I'm ambivalent, maybe it's because
I see a silver lining.

459
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:01,941
40 people are dead.
Where's the silver lining?

460
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:05,521
If we allow this administration
to dismantle our security operations,

461
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,035
it's going to be 40,000.

462
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,602
Here's the thing, Dick...

463
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,213
... you're a disgruntled ex-agent

464
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,359
waiting for someone to call you back
so you can be a fourth quarter hero.

465
00:28:16,122 --> 00:28:17,122
And I bet

466
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:19,690
you still have
those surveillance tapes.

467
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:22,790
{\And }I'm {\pretty }sure you wouldn't
have left them laying around here

468
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:26,005
for your wife
or your maid to trip over.

469
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,331
No, because guys like you...

470
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:31,792
you think that the work you do
is so damn important.

471
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,295
I'm even willing to bet

472
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:38,674
you got yourself one
of those Dick Cheney man-sized safes.

473
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,594
Let's take a look.

474
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:51,437
Next week's fine.

475
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:56,405
Okay, no, I still don't have
a permanent address.

476
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,180
Everything's just going to go
into storage.

477
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,182
All right.
Thank you.

478
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:05,701
How you doing?

479
00:29:07,048 --> 00:29:08,149
It's so crazy.

480
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,449
I mean, I heard
40 people died already.

481
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:15,461
- And a bunch of them are my age.
- Yeah, it is.

482
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:19,035
- But everything's going to be fine.
- Adults always say that,

483
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,759
but I mean, it's not fine.

484
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:27,067
You know what...

485
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:29,587
you're right.

486
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:32,128
But not every day
is going to be like this.

487
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:40,226
You know, my mom's been spending
all this time with Dad.

488
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,321
I mean, they think I don't know.

489
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:46,213
It's like they don't even remember
how bad it was.

490
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:48,492
They'll have to figure it out
for themselves.

491
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:50,467
Maybe it will be different.

492
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:53,653
You don't believe that.

493
00:29:57,242 --> 00:29:59,213
He's so much happier
when he's with you.

494
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,979
Your mom's here.

495
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,719
You should pack up your stuff.

496
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:21,275
I just came to pick up Emily.
What's in the box?

497
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,566
It's the surveillance tapes from
the mosque the two bombers belong to.

498
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,593
Illegally obtained
surveillance tapes.

499
00:30:26,718 --> 00:30:29,160
An FBI agent went rogue
and bugged the place.

500
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:31,532
- Where do we stand?
- {\Well, }They're worthless in court,

501
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:34,248
- if that's what you're asking.
- I'm not too worried about prosecuting{\ right now}.

502
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,583
Yeah, but if you use the tapes,
you legitimize the bugging, right?

503
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,725
Law enforcement is always given some
latitude if there's an imminent threat.

504
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,467
What about afterwards? {\When }If this gets out,
it could lead to more terrorism.

505
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,843
- And how would it come out?
- These things always do.

506
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:48,888
Intelligence says there could be
5 or 6 more bombings this week.

507
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,813
What if there's something in those tapes
that could help prevent that?

508
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,940
Okay, give them to Foster and Loker.
Let them start in.

509
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,568
That's what I wanted to hear.

510
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,119
We're through the first 1,200 hours.

511
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:14,129
Already? How is that possible?

512
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:17,124
Well, normal vocal pitch
is less than 500 hertz.

513
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,512
Anything higher implies
extreme emotion...

514
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:21,337
anger, anxiety or fear.

515
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:24,175
That's what the computer's
scanning for.

516
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:26,467
What did we get off the tape
from the mosque?

517
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:28,665
The first hit's a marital dispute,

518
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,763
the second is a 7-year-old

519
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,678
and the third is a guy
who really needed to find a bathroom.

520
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:36,435
Looks like we've another winner.

521
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:41,005
<i>It's unacceptable!
Completely unacceptable!</i>

522
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,705
<i>People who do things like
this must be punished!</i>

523
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:48,622
Stress is up on all the negative words,
and you hear that vocal tremor?

524
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:50,730
That could be repulsion or disgust.

525
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:53,327
How {\the hell }are we supposed
to match a voice with a name?

526
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,830
- Foster never forgets a voice.
- Some o' us are better at listening than others.

527
00:31:57,153 --> 00:31:58,062
Thank you.

528
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:00,376
<i>My son,</i>

529
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:02,920
<i>was not a radical.</i>

530
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:05,111
It's the same voice.

531
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:07,758
Omor Kahn.
Father of the second bomber.

532
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,002
<i>It's unacceptable!</i>

533
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:21,260
<i>Completely unacceptable!</i>

534
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:24,771
<i>People who do things like
this must be punished!</i>

535
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,237
Where was this recorded?

536
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,439
In our mosque?

537
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:33,745
Someone recorded
private conversations

538
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:36,239
- in the mosque?!
- Absolutely.

539
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:40,499
You don't deny that was your voice,?

540
00:32:42,581 --> 00:32:44,253
I'll take that as a no.

541
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,563
Do you have the shrapnel plotting
from FBI forensics yet?

542
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:51,035
Check it out.

543
00:32:53,364 --> 00:32:55,180
Look how perfect the blast radius is.

544
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,344
That bomb was small, compact.

545
00:32:57,835 --> 00:33:00,893
It'd've to be, if somebody
slipped it into those kids' backpacks.

546
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,587
What are you accusing me o'?

547
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:06,030
Someone planted bombs on
Jamal Bata and your son.

548
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,242
They were murdered!

549
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:11,989
My boy was murdered!

550
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:14,241
Uh, you know...

551
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:16,560
I'm thinking maybe
it wasn't slipped in.

552
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,875
{\I'm thinking }Maybe'twas concealed.
Maybe...

553
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,957
Someone gave them the bomb
disguised as something else.

554
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,675
Do you think that I could
sacrifice my own son?!

555
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,778
Where's the sacrifice?
I thought virgins awaited him.

556
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:32,306
Rasheed was killed by extremists.

557
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:34,696
My family and I,
we are the victims.

558
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,014
One o'those kids played soccer.

559
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:40,221
You pack a soccer ball
with enough ball bearings...

560
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:42,569
You got the right idea,
but the concussion diameter

561
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:44,686
was{\ only} 200 feet.
The bomb wasn't that big.

562
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:47,900
- They teach you that at Quantico?
- A week in Tel Aviv with Shin Bet.

563
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,236
I am an American{\ citizen}.

564
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:53,150
You can't treat me like this.

565
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,242
Do we've info on what the shrapnel was?

566
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,699
This says small pieces of aluminum,
glass shards, copper and nickel.

567
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,248
Copper and nickel, huh?

568
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:08,001
- Just like on the bus?
- Pretty much.

569
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,923
Forensics figured part of that
is from the coins in the {\fare }box.

570
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:15,054
Coins...

571
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,304
Copper and nickel.

572
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:19,973
What if the coins are part of the bomb?

573
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:22,059
The coins were the shrapnel.

574
00:34:22,613 --> 00:34:24,812
I think I know how
the bombs were disguised.

575
00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:29,692
Omar Kahn hasn't given
you one straight answer.

576
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:32,050
Yeah, his son's dead.
He's a little angry.

577
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:34,039
It looks like a killer's rage to me.

578
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,739
I'm turning him over to the CIA,

579
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,840
they'll do what it takes to get
him to talk.

580
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:40,068
Do you know what they call a place
that breaks the law

581
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:41,620
everytime there's an emergency?

582
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:43,615
Dictatorship.

583
00:34:44,503 --> 00:34:45,788
Where'd you go?

584
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:57,469
What?

585
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,096
What do you mean what?

586
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:01,932
This is what you used
to plant the bombs in.

587
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:04,763
I talked to the Imam.

588
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,854
Every family that belongs to
that mosque,

589
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,856
had access to one of these.

590
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:13,175
You put the explosives
in the bottom of the canister.

591
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:16,196
And the coins acted as the shrapnel.

592
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:21,312
That thought you had...

593
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:23,996
That thought right there...

594
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:26,415
Horrified you.

595
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:29,835
You're not behind this{\, are you}?

596
00:35:33,747 --> 00:35:35,340
But you know who is.

597
00:35:41,561 --> 00:35:43,098
Is it someone close to you?

598
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,558
Someone you saw

599
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:47,561
with these canisters?

600
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:50,445
It couldn't be.

601
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:53,680
Who couldn't it be?

602
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:56,564
What if you're wrong?

603
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,085
What will they do to him?

604
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:02,701
What would happen?

605
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:05,407
You accused my son of being a murderer.

606
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:07,748
You bug our mosques... You...

607
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:10,260
There are bombs in our streets.

608
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:14,798
Many, many more people will die.
You have to tell us.

609
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:17,935
Don't do it for us.

610
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:20,677
Do it for your son.
Do it for...

611
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:23,138
The other children who're going to die
meaningless deaths

612
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,870
in other people's wars.

613
00:36:27,002 --> 00:36:28,342
Do it for your son.

614
00:36:36,054 --> 00:36:38,194
That recording that you have of me...

615
00:36:41,128 --> 00:36:42,490
I was scolding him.

616
00:36:44,183 --> 00:36:46,579
I thought he was taking the cans
for the coins.

617
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,103
I caught him.

618
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,782
I thought he was trying
to steal the money.

619
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,046
I brought him here from Jordan.

620
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,673
How could he do this to my son?

621
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:04,242
It was your nephew.

622
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,034
Freeze!

623
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,776
Freeze!

624
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:46,740
Messler tells me you fired your gun
the same time as the guy moved.

625
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:50,085
I didn't have a choice. A second later,
he'd have hit the detonator.

626
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:51,500
How'd you know?

627
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,460
Just the look on his face,{\ I guess}.

628
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,376
We really are going to have
to find you an office around here.

629
00:38:57,993 --> 00:39:00,296
Did you hear they found out
how we broke the case?

630
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,631
They're saying that the
mosque was bugged illegally.

631
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:05,634
It'll be all over the press tomorrow and
{\It'll be}a recruiting tool for Al Qaeda.

632
00:39:06,032 --> 00:39:07,511
That's tomorrow's problem.

633
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,714
How do you think
we arrived at today?

634
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,051
Go home.

635
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:23,662
I mean it, go home.

636
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,533
How you doing? You all right?

637
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,335
I'm okay.

638
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:48,421
You want to talk about it, love?

639
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:55,740
Alec and I are separating.

640
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:58,582
I'm moving out.

641
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:00,460
I'm sorry.

642
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:14,710
You know, I can't even picture it.

643
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:16,872
Being on my own.

644
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,489
Must be a long time.

645
00:40:23,182 --> 00:40:25,505
- I got to go to the hospital.
- To see Torres?

646
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:29,354
I'll be all right.

647
00:40:30,615 --> 00:40:32,597
You should go.
You should go.

648
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:00,331
How's he doing?

649
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:03,591
They were able to clear out most
o'the blood.

650
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:06,675
Everybody's waiting for him to wake up.

651
00:41:07,837 --> 00:41:09,245
That's good, right?

652
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:12,843
It's over out there yet?

653
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:14,544
For now, yeah.

654
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,415
I'm sorry I had to lie to you,
about...

655
00:41:30,608 --> 00:41:32,767
If you hadn't have
picked up on the Imam...

656
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:35,158
We'dn't have found the tapes.

657
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,161
- A lot more people would be dead.
- I'd've had a choice.

658
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,157
What you do... lying all the time...

659
00:41:41,684 --> 00:41:44,234
Deciding who gets to know what...

660
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:47,605
It doesn't matter with Loker,
'cause he worships you...

661
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,877
Or Foster...
Who indulges you, but not me.

662
00:41:51,605 --> 00:41:52,616
Not anymore.

663
00:41:56,115 --> 00:41:57,805
Time to find a different job {\then}?

664
00:41:59,004 --> 00:41:59,675
What?

665
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,987
Isn't the last time
I'm going to lie to you,

666
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:04,395
The problem's not the job,
it's working for you.

667
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:08,905
You still don't get it, do you?

668
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:11,819
- Get what?
- This isn't about you.

669
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,865
It's not about me.

670
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:17,742
You think I wanted to lie to you about
your boyfriend? {\Do you}?

671
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:20,640
You have a talent.

672
00:42:22,947 --> 00:42:25,792
But it comes with sacrifice,
believe me.

673
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:29,960
And it's time for you to realize
