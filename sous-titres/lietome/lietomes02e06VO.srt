1
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,012
To the new year.

2
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,223
To the new year.
May it be better than last year.

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,644
I know it will be.

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,446
I need you to bring negotiations
to a close.

5
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:30,803
Not a problem, Mr. Greene.
Mark and I will take care of it.

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,452
- Hey, how you doin', man?
- How you doin', Carlos?

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,810
- Good.
- So, can we talk about the deal.

8
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:40,425
Of course. Just follow me.

9
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,624
So I...

10
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,255
I had a chance to take a look
at the numbers.

11
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,837
Mr. Greene's proposal
wasn't a request, Nick.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,809
Yes, but feel free to take as much time
as you need to think about it.

13
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:12,372
Happy new year.

14
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,494
So I sign this and I'm good, right?

15
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:23,864
As long as you testify,
you'll have total immunity,

16
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:26,203
with new identities for you,
your wife, and kids.

17
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:27,962
- And Kimi?
- Come on.

18
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,922
I can't give to your mistress
a protection.

19
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:32,921
Just like I told my wife,
I'm not leaving Kimi.

20
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,010
Elliot Greene's not a forgiving man.

21
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,250
You don't sign,

22
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:37,909
we cut you loose.

23
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,950
You'll be dead in a day.

24
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,413
Welcome to your new home.

25
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,338
Drive! Get out of here!

26
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,106
Get away from the window.

27
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,951
- What?
- Get away from the bloody window.

28
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,568
- Why?
- What's going on?

29
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:30,399
A sniper just killed Mark McLaughlin
while he was in protective custody.

30
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,693
Is he someone from one of our cases?

31
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,911
He was a case Reynolds was working
before he came here.

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,750
All right, Lightman,
don't say another word, OK?

33
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,994
McLaughlin was Reynolds' running buddy
in an assortment of crimes, right?

34
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,207
- You're not supposed to know that.
- You work here. I know everything.

35
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,873
- Does somebody want to fill me in?
- Reynolds was undercover for 2 years

36
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:52,695
trying to dismantle Elliot Greene's
organization in New York.

37
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:54,423
Greene, the Wall Street guy?

38
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:57,517
Mobster, killer, extortionist.

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,553
Mark was the lead witness
in the case.

40
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,043
Now he's dead.

41
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:03,012
Reynolds is the next
in line to testify.

42
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,768
The prosecutor's on his way over
to put you into protective custody.

43
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,187
- You seem to have a problem with that.
- I do.

44
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,491
They got a spotty
track record at best.

45
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:12,691
Would you bet your life
they could keep you safe?

46
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:16,700
- Okay, so what do you have in mind?
- Follow me.

47
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:25,556
- You're the prosecutor, right?
- Garrett Denning. Where's Reynolds?

48
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:27,128
He's in the loo.

49
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,753
This is Foster.

50
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:37,951
Why is he in there?
We have to move now.

51
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,377
Well, 'cause your last witness
got his head blown off.

52
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:42,680
And he works here.
My office, my rules.

53
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,187
You're way out of line.

54
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,475
Now, he is my new lead witness,
and he's leaving with me.

55
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,229
Well, that's bulletproof glass,
that's reinforced door.

56
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:52,189
- He stays until I put in the code.
- So you're holding him prisoner.

57
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,399
Hostage.

58
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:56,504
I'll release him
if my demands are met.

59
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:30,936
Give me Agent Reynolds now
or I will have your company shut down

60
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,189
- and charge you with obstruction.
- That's not gonna get him out of there.

61
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,568
We are all concerned about his safety,
so let's just try to work out a deal.

62
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:39,403
You have a list of demands?

63
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:43,015
Secure our building
until we know he's safe.

64
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,662
That's unnecessary.
US marshals are fully capable

65
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,538
- of protecting Agent Reynolds.
- You don't sound too sure about that.

66
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,059
The only ones I don't trust
were the 3 guarding McLaughlin.

67
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:52,625
Only they knew where he was going.

68
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,433
My office is conducting an investigation
into those marshals.

69
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:56,982
Yeah. You give them to me,

70
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:59,340
and then I'll let Reynolds go.
His life's in danger.

71
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:02,509
You ask him who he trusts to get
to the bottom of this, you or us?

72
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:07,682
You were the only ones
who knew the safe house location.

73
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,100
One of you gave up your witness.

74
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:13,646
It's not possible.
If there was someone dirty on my team...

75
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,984
They all flash fear
when they hear Elliot Greene's name.

76
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:17,701
What did this guy do?

77
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,030
He was a Wall Street fixer.

78
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,280
If a hedge fund was looking for inside
information, Greene's people did

79
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,492
- whatever it took to get it for them.
- What did it normally take?

80
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,117
Blackmail, kidnapping,

81
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,912
torture, murder.

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,524
Our identities were kept secret,
even from each other.

83
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,209
Who did Greene get to?

84
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,715
The US marshals
don't hire turncoats.

85
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:41,334
Just a minute.

86
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:45,847
Can I borrow you?

87
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:51,344
All right, this gentleman here

88
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:53,602
is from the US attorney's office,

89
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,002
and it's his job to put whichever
one of you 3 killed McLaughlin,

90
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:58,469
in prison.

91
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:08,200
Right, well, you two.
OK, go on.

92
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:10,092
Out. Go on.

93
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,501
- I want to talk to you.
- What did I do?

94
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:18,814
They were scared they might be working
with someone connected to Greene.

95
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:22,287
Only you showed additional fear
when you were threatened with jail time.

96
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,009
So what did Greene do?
Did he pay you off?

97
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,385
- Did he threaten your family?
- No.

98
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,223
Something else.

99
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,934
What, did you simply
not like McLaughlin?

100
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:37,043
Mark was an obnoxious lowlife
and a scumbag,

101
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:38,939
but I didn't want him dead.

102
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:50,576
Keep an eye on him, all right?

103
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:54,812
What? We question the marshal
or wait for Lightman to come back?

104
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:56,448
I don't know.

105
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,500
But I'm sure it's some kind of test.

106
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,893
So is that our guy or not?

107
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:04,548
What can you tell me about the case
now McLaughlin's dead?

108
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,015
His death is a disaster.

109
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,663
I have to restructure
my entire approach to the trial.

110
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:10,637
And without Reynolds,
I don't have a case.

111
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,410
Does his voice sound
like his face looks to you?

112
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:17,111
There was a upturn in his vocal pitch
when he mentioned McLaughlin's death.

113
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:21,358
- Did you have him killed?
- That's absurd. He was my lead witness.

114
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,675
He was at a meeting with you
before he was murdered.

115
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:25,810
You knew the exact place
and time he was being moved.

116
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:28,447
Of course. I'm an assistant
US attorney, for God's sake.

117
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,088
- And yet you're happy he's dead.
- It makes sense.

118
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:33,846
He had a rap sheet a mile long,
and he only cut a deal with you

119
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,084
because you had him by the throat.
I mean, if it was me,

120
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,041
I would much prefer a highly
decorated FBI agent as a witness.

121
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,461
- Did you have Mark McLaughlin killed?
- Are you people on drugs?

122
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,510
Did you have any idea
he was about to be murdered?

123
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:45,960
Absolutely not.

124
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,910
- That's the truth.
- Thank you.

125
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:53,526
- Now get back with that marshal.
- No, he's a puppet.

126
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:56,183
I'm more interested in the guy
who's pulling the strings.

127
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,125
You want me to get you
in front of Elliot Greene?

128
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,420
Absolutely.

129
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,613
If you want the truth.

130
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:09,250
This'll tell you
if i have swine flu?

131
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:15,261
It's a prerequisite
for a body cavity search.

132
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,479
I'm kidding.

133
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,833
Just kidding, Mr. Greene.

134
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,686
How are we feeling today?

135
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,672
- Fine, I guess.
- What, just fine?

136
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:30,217
It's not every day the lead witness
in a case against you gets killed.

137
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,192
Who are you?

138
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:36,974
I'm a friend of the witness that's about
to step in to keep you behind bars.

139
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:38,976
I'm also a doctor.

140
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,776
And you're entitled to a lawyer.

141
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:42,662
Don't need one.

142
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:45,167
Tell me,

143
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:47,276
how'd you get to McLaughlin?

144
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,866
Did you pay off one of the marshals?

145
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:52,438
Did you threaten him?

146
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:55,701
Someone higher up the food chain?

147
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,250
No, it's not that either.

148
00:08:58,508 --> 00:08:59,863
It is funny, isn't it?

149
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:03,078
A man gets killed, today you're facing
another murder count. That's funny.

150
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:06,877
Tell your friends I'm confident
that I'll be cleared at trial.

151
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:10,769
You believe that,

152
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:12,499
don't you?

153
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,511
I have nothing to fear.

154
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:17,890
- You think you can kill my friend?
- Who's your friend?

155
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,684
The man I know as Carlos?
Benjamin Reynolds, right?

156
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:24,891
If you think that federal agent is gonna
be the guy who's gonna take me down,

157
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:28,134
Ask him about his old friend Scotty.

158
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,674
- What's up?
- I just had a very interesting chat

159
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:35,481
with your friend Elliot Greene.

160
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:37,826
He says he has no intention
of harming you.

161
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,745
Forgive me if i don't believe him.

162
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,831
Do you know why he's not worried
about your testimony?

163
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:45,167
Half of what I know
could send him away for life.

164
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,170
Does the name Scotty
mean anything to you?

165
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,313
There it is.

166
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,073
There it is.

167
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,575
Let me see that case file.

168
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,144
What are you looking for?

169
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,926
OK, there.

170
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:22,161
- What is that?
- Can we quit screwing around here?

171
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:23,867
Greene's trial is in 4 days.

172
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,834
Yeah, well, that's not gonna matter,
because I'm not testifying.

173
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,504
I got nothing without you.

174
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:33,298
Just use the surveillance tapes.
That should be enough.

175
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,593
You're my witness who authenticates
the tapes and nails the guy.

176
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,429
And as a federal agent,
you don't have a choice in the matter.

177
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,918
I do have a choice.

178
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:43,892
You sacrificed 2 years of your life
to build this case.

179
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,191
And now I'm done sacrificing.

180
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:49,751
If you don't take the stand,
you'll be fired from the FBI

181
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,608
and we will press charges
against you.

182
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:53,694
I'm not testifying.

183
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,195
You can't do that.

184
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:57,644
Watch me.

185
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,492
I've seen that face before.

186
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,119
You need to call me back as soon as you
get this. I've got a big problem here.

187
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,337
Call me as soon
as you get to the office.

188
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,698
- Have you lost your mind?
- That's funny,

189
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,569
'cause I was about to ask you
the same question.

190
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,844
Why are you doing this to me?

191
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:27,206
Lightman, I get it, OK?
You're concerned and I appreciate that.

192
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:30,758
- But you really need to back off, OK?
- I'm the man that's keeping you safe.

193
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,154
You know what this is?
This is another one of your ego trips.

194
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:38,074
You can't rest until you find out
what I've been keeping from you.

195
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,548
No, it's not about me.

196
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,950
It's about the pain
you're feeling now.

197
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:44,259
So you just see it all, huh?

198
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,289
But, see, you have no idea.
None.

199
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,913
I've had to make brutal choices before
to arrive at the right outcome.

200
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:51,960
Listen.

201
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,130
When I was undercover on the
Greene case, my father, he died.

202
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,049
I didn't go to the hospital.

203
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,010
Or the funeral.
So don't talk to me about tough choices.

204
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,516
Well, then testify.

205
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:03,597
Go on.

206
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,026
Make the sacrifice
count for something.

207
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,145
Just shut up and give me my phone.

208
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:13,982
Who were you calling?

209
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,705
- Sheila Radotti. Who's she?
- She was my handler on the case.

210
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,512
Does she know why you won't testify?

211
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,290
I haven't spoken to her in months.

212
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:28,413
I get it.
So you're investigating me for them.

213
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:34,294
- To keep you in here.
- Funny you didn't mention that before.

214
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,493
Just trying to get
to the truth, Ben.

215
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,591
And I bet you'll serve me up
to get it.

216
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:53,021
Is there anything in the case file
from Reynolds' handler?

217
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,833
She wrote most of it.

218
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:59,540
The language suggest she's...

219
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:02,231
intelligent, I mean meticulous, and

220
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,574
Emotionally attached to Reynolds.

221
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,438
You think he was shagging his boss?

222
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:12,990
I can't confirm that
from the case file but

223
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,875
her feelings for him run deep.

224
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,446
- I wonder if he feels the same way.
- You think he's trying to protect her?

225
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,805
He's protecting someone.

226
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,179
That's it. i'm going in.

227
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,691
Lightman will be furious
that you interfered.

228
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:30,943
I'm gonna go find out what he wants.

229
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:34,267
Then he'll be angry that we didn't take
the initiative sooner.

230
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:38,957
If i'm gonna get yelled no matter what,
I might as well get in the game.

231
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,277
You coming ?

232
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,533
Describe the events
of this morning.

233
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:48,208
I woke up at 5:15 a.m.

234
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,554
I took a shower.

235
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,957
I got dressed. Interested in what
I did in the john ?

236
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:55,959
Skip ahead to after that.

237
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,920
I woke mark up and I took him
to his meeting with the U.S. attorney.

238
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:02,646
You skipped some steps there.
What happened between waking him up

239
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,863
- and taking him out of the safe house ?
- The usual. He got ready and we left.

240
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:08,722
Did he brush his teeth?
Did he shower ? Talk us through it.

241
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,600
I wasn't with him
in the bathroom.

242
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:17,594
- You screwed up.
- When Mark was in the bathroom,

243
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:19,524
what did you do ?
- Who do you tink you are ?

244
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:23,153
I've been decorated 3 times
in the line of duty.

245
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,072
But you made a mistake this morning.
So what was it ?

246
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,459
Tell us or your career ends today.

247
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:31,073
We can see to that.

248
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:36,863
I could hear Mark talking in the bathroom
and I caught him using the cell phone.

249
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:39,050
He wasn't supposed
to have one.

250
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:41,283
And I'm guessing you didn't report it.

251
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,269
I tossed it. I didn't think it would
compromise our security.

252
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,467
Tell us where
you ditched the phone.

253
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:51,665
Special agent Radotti ?

254
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,576
- <i>I've left you a few messages.
- I'm sorry I haven't got </i>back to you.

255
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,134
I'm on my way to a briefing on
the hill and I'm kind of in a hurry.

256
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:01,068
No problem. I'll walk with you.

257
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:03,168
I really need to talk
about agent Reynolds.

258
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,863
I can't discuss any of
the details of the Greene case.

259
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:09,407
I'm more concerned
about why he's refusing to testify.

260
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,749
<i>I wish I could help you,
but we haven't spoken</i>

261
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,079
<i>since he was reassigned,
and they didn't even tell me where.</i>

262
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,272
You're his only lifeline to the outside
world when he was undercover.

263
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,967
You must have
some insights.

264
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,383
I just found out
that he's refusing to testify,

265
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,255
and it shocked me.
It's not like him.

266
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,910
He's a model agent.
the gold standard.

267
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:28,835
Model agent, gold standard. You're
lavishing all sorts of praise on him,

268
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,910
but you don't act very concerned.

269
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:35,850
Let me clue you in about what it's like
for people to work together undercover.

270
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,566
I've counseled agents after they've
completed undercover assignments.

271
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,273
Then you should understand that there's
a very strong bond between Ben and me.

272
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:44,683
I do not want to see him
ruined or in prison.

273
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,487
Then you should want him to testify.

274
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,084
To get in with Greene's organization,
Ben was authorized to commit

275
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,333
minor crimes to play the role
of a criminal.

276
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:57,817
He assaulted people,
made threats, used narcotics.

277
00:15:58,449 --> 00:15:59,529
I've been there.

278
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:02,168
Even if you're authorized
to break the law, it changes you.

279
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,255
How did it change Reynolds ?

280
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,650
He was authorized to use drugs,
not abuse them.

281
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:10,135
and if he testifies,
it'll all come out.

282
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:14,306
We have reason to believe
someone named scotty

283
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,001
is keeping him off the stand.

284
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,351
Scotty Villarosa ?

285
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:19,483
Is that someone
Reynolds used drugs with?

286
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,729
Among other things.

287
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:25,014
When we swept up Greene's crew,
We never found scotty.

288
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,819
He just disappeared.
Got away.

289
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,447
<i>We could really
use your help</i>

290
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,567
<i>back at my office.
And Reynolds </i>

291
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:36,369
<i>really needs a friend.
Can you come down and talk to him ?</i>

292
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,324
Anything for Ben.
I'll head over after the briefing.

293
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:44,712
I don't think that they're romantically
involved. She cares for him.

294
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,505
She paints a pretty ugly picture
with her words, so what did you see ?

295
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,397
The whole drug thing with Reynolds does
it bother you ? Does it unsettle you ?

296
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:53,623
Is it flashback to your ex-husband ?

297
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:57,266
If I'm upset, it's because this just
got twice as complicated.

298
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,118
Me being married to Alec gave me insight
into how addicts can lead double lives.

299
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:04,292
Don't read me. You're supposed to
be reading her.

300
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:05,524
Sorry, love.

301
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,608
That was Alec, this is Reynolds.

302
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,988
who is refusing to testify
in order to protect himself.

303
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,583
- According to her.
- But protect himself from what ?

304
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,575
I don't know.

305
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,369
Maybe we don't know Reynolds
as well as we thought we did.

306
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:21,331
Don't throw your career away like this.

307
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,587
All right. Everybody out. Go on.
This is my investigation.

308
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,676
Go on.
Thanks for your help.

309
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,250
Oh, don't do that.
Don't try it.

310
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:43,264
- I'm on to you.
- Really ?

311
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:46,921
You should see how pointless it is
for you to keep coming at me like that.

312
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:49,166
You're wrestling with something
that you can't live with.

313
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,640
- Been there, done that.
- Lightman, just stop.

314
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:53,530
I've interrogated
more suspects than you.

315
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,552
- Oh, you think so ?
- I know so and all the mind games.

316
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:58,822
Wrong again. I don't need mind games
when I got the truth.

317
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,246
The truth ? really ?
Enlighten me.

318
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:03,289
You were a cokehead.

319
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:07,631
Prone to mood swings
and violence.

320
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:11,757
Foster spoke to your handler.

321
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,461
I was doing my job.

322
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:23,156
I hear you liked doing drugs.
I hear you liked being a criminal.

323
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,633
Bit of a rush, right ?

324
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:27,168
I was getting close enough
to Greene to make my case. That's it.

325
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:30,799
No, there's more to it than that.
I think you miss those days.

326
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:32,402
That's why you won't testify.

327
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:34,520
You're wrong.

328
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:36,698
I think you're afraid.
You're afraid that everyone's

329
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,124
Gonna see the coke-snorting

330
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,203
whoremonger.
You've been trying so hard to bury.

331
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,854
You better back off now.

332
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:45,729
Your handler said your
time undercover changed you.

333
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,335
I don't think you changed at all.
I think that's what you really are.

334
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,672
- You're afraid everyone's gonna see it.
- You want to talk about me?

335
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:55,291
Do you know I read your file too ?

336
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,511
Northern ireland.
How about we talk about that?

337
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,801
- I'm not the one heading off to jail.
- Yeah, well, you should be.

338
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,729
Some of the crap
you were involved in over there.

339
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,393
You know...

340
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:15,457
There's still time to step up
and be the good boy in all this.

341
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,572
It's too late
for a change now.

342
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,797
It doesn't have to be.

343
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,839
What's in the case file ?
What was it that surprised you so much ?

344
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:43,211
You helped me out with some
serious trouble with my friend terry.

345
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:45,975
I might be able to repay the favor.

346
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:48,486
My office.

347
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,206
No cameras.

348
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,667
Who's Scotty ?

349
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:06,648
You know,
you make one mistake...

350
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:09,582
and any other day
it wouldn't even matter.

351
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:12,044
Who is he?

352
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:16,709
You know, people who are supposed
to have your back, they just ...

353
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:19,342
They just leave you hanging.

354
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,469
Did he betray you?

355
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,243
Scotty Vllarosa was
another one of Greene's guys.

356
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:31,354
- I worked with him.
- Did he threaten you ?

357
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,374
He can't ever get to me.

358
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,069
You seem pretty certain of that.

359
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:40,572
Why ?

360
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,701
Because i killed scotty.

361
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:48,577
Shot him dead.

362
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:57,422
You killed Scotty Villarosa ?

363
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:01,669
I mean, was it self-defense or...

364
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,819
He was my first one.

365
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:12,025
I never shot a person before.

366
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:16,942
And you think that he'd just fall back
and be dead instantly,

367
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,872
But no, he held on.

368
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:21,934
He just stood there,

369
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:24,198
Watching me as he died.

370
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:26,631
Why'd you kill him ?

371
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:29,311
Just wrong place,
wrong time, I guess.

372
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:31,445
We were in his apartment.
I went to the intercom

373
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,333
to buzz Mark and Greene
into the building

374
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:38,301
My wire started futzing out,
making noises.

375
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:42,570
And I tried to cover it up,
I tried to explain to him, but...

376
00:21:42,654 --> 00:21:43,927
I was busted.

377
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:49,098
So, Scotty finds your wire,
and he pulled his gun on you.

378
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:55,526
Tell me he pulled a gun
on you.

379
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:04,238
He had this look on his face,
and I knew he had a gun.

380
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:08,910
But I had the drop on him, and I warned
his dumb ass and he still tried to...

381
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,773
So that was that.

382
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:16,125
I took the wire off my body,
put it on Scotty's,

383
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,327
made him look like the rat to Greene.

384
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:20,838
I was in after that.

385
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:25,900
Killing Scotty was the best thing
that ever happened to me on this case.

386
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,899
You've covered this up
the whole time ?

387
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:31,651
No. As soon as I got a chance, I called
Sheila and I told her everything.

388
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:34,143
She told me to stay on the case
and that she would handle it.

389
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,173
- And you took her at her word ?
- Yes, I did.

390
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:39,471
Because the very next day, she said
headquarters signed off on the shooting

391
00:22:39,555 --> 00:22:41,738
She even had me sign
an incident report.

392
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,569
But it's not in the case file now.

393
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:48,326
Don't you understand I'll be discredited
as a witness and Greene will walk.

394
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,480
You'll get done
for murder.

395
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,034
Exactly.

396
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,372
Now you see why I can't testify.

397
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,204
Because either way, I'm screwed.

398
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:01,467
Yeah. yeah, you are.

399
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:04,430
Radotti uses you and you
just roll over, and you know let

400
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:08,401
Greene have another go at you?
You just give it up without a fuss ?

401
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:11,598
- Excuse me?
- You heard me. I mean, it's pathetic.

402
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,809
I can't believe i've wasted
this much time on you.

403
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,663
I mean, you're a baby. What are you,
are you some kind of coward or what ?

404
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,872
It's about bloody time.

405
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,183
I've been waiting for this.
I mean, my god,

406
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:28,239
you've still got a bit
of fight left in you.

407
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:31,493
So, you're gonna stand up
for yourself now, are you?

408
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,510
What the hell do you
think I've been doing ?

409
00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:38,490
I've been looking for a better way out
of this and there isn't one.

410
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:40,127
There is. yeah, there is.

411
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:45,207
- Let me have a crack at it.
- And why should I trust you ?

412
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:52,264
It's a funny thing, about trust,
because it's a matter of faith.

413
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:56,830
I mean, you can never really
be sure of it. Right ?

414
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:03,399
Because I killed scotty.

415
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:06,652
Shot him dead.

416
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,888
You told me there were
no cameras in here.

417
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:15,286
This tape belongs to the fbi,
as evidence in an ongoing investigation.

418
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,791
All right, so, you watch the screen.
Watch the screen.

419
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,259
It's gone.

420
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,512
I mean...

421
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:35,015
It's gone.

422
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,601
If anybody finds that you ever did that,
you're going to prison.

423
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,481
So now we're in the same boat,
aren't we ?

424
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:47,333
So let's start
getting creative.

425
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:02,816
- This better be about the case.
- Oh, yeah, fortuitously it is.

426
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,837
This is Mark McLaughlin's mistress.
She is a dancer of the...

427
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:09,591
exotic variety. We're going
to bring her and his wife in.

428
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,280
An hour before Mark died, he called
each of them on the cell phone

429
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:14,456
he wasn't supposed to have.
We figured he dropped

430
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,139
his location
to them and got set up.

431
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,692
You're gonna establish a baseline

432
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:19,705
by watching her strangle
a pole with her thighs?

433
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:23,040
Well, we're trying to determine if
she gets embarrassed when she performs.

434
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:25,464
- We could use that to rattle her.
- If you want to rattle her,

435
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:27,943
Interview the mistress and the wife
together, let the sparks fly.

436
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,404
- We scheduled them to avoid that.
- That's very considerate, but wrong.

437
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:33,758
People find it hard
to suppress their emotions

438
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:36,662
when they're confronted by
the victim of eir deception.

439
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:38,536
Ok. we'll bring them in
together.

440
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:39,603
Good.

441
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:43,708
I'm glad to see you
pushed ahead on this.

442
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:47,695
I half-expected to return
and find you sitting on your thumbs.

443
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:01,568
Damn, lightman.
You're not messing around ?

444
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:07,899
Your handler's in the cube
and denning's in the lab.

445
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,000
All right.

446
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:13,634
- Ready ?
- I guess i got no other choice.

447
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,024
Let's go have some fun.

448
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,139
- What are they doing here?
- I'm charging agent Reynolds

449
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:32,803
for every crime he committed
while he was on the greene case.

450
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,676
I was under orders to commit
certain crimes to maintain my cover.

451
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,714
Based on the assumption
you'd fully cooperate

452
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,984
with prosecution. You're not keeping
your end of the deal.

453
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:42,380
I don't think your people
have been telling the whole truth.

454
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:45,853
Unless you can make him testify, I have
no reason to listen to you anymore.

455
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,894
What is special agent
Radotti doing here?

456
00:26:54,978 --> 00:26:57,782
You know how you were wondering
why Reynolds won't testify.

457
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:00,785
She's about to tell you.

458
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:15,087
- I'm sorry about the wait, Agt Radotti.
- Special agent Radotti.

459
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,058
Where's Ben?

460
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:18,608
He's gonna be tied up for a while
with the U.S. Attorney.

461
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,757
<i>This is some setup you've got here.</i>

462
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:24,727
<i>I came to speak with agent Reynolds,</i>

463
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,450
if he's not available,
I have a lot of work to do back at HQ.

464
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:30,128
What else can you tell me
about Reynolds' drug use

465
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,604
while he was undercover?

466
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:34,022
He did his duty.

467
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:36,218
Which...

468
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:38,718
at times, included drug use,

469
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:42,360
so that he could prove himself
to some very dangerous people.

470
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,912
You seem to think he went above
and beyond the call of duty.

471
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,930
Ben's a good agent

472
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:49,663
who got caught up
in a very bad situation.

473
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:52,281
End of story.

474
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:58,676
Can you tell me about the night
Reynolds killed Scotty Villarosa?

475
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:02,254
- Here we go.
- <i>What...</i>

476
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:03,939
You killed a man while undercover?

477
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:05,558
<i>You don't know anything about it?</i>

478
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:08,521
There's nothing to know.

479
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:11,314
He never killed anyone.

480
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,862
What are they talking about?
That was not in the file.

481
00:28:13,945 --> 00:28:15,884
Mouth shut, eyes open, counselor.

482
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:17,617
<i>... said he shot Scotty</i>

483
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:19,085
<i>and then informed you,</i>

484
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:21,532
As required by FBI protocol.

485
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,599
Never.

486
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:26,073
You can tell she's lying, right?

487
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:29,316
Look, she spent
more time undercover than you.

488
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,626
I can't tell a thing yet.

489
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,209
<i>Ben got in too deep.</i>

490
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,295
<i>He became addicted.</i>

491
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:36,714
I should have pulled him out sooner.

492
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,683
Reynolds, you're up.

493
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:39,769
Wait.

494
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:43,235
What are you doing?

495
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:46,043
I'm saving your case.

496
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,750
Where did he get that gun?

497
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:56,979
From me.

498
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,434
You better start telling
the truth right now.

499
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:06,367
Ben, don't make this worse.

500
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:08,715
Let me go.

501
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,391
You're not going anywhere
until you admit...

502
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:13,055
that I told you about Scotty.

503
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,134
Whatever you've done, I can explain
the pressure that you were under.

504
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:20,099
<i>When the dust settles, you can have
a great career out of the FBI.</i>

505
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,582
I'm not making
another deal with you.

506
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:25,341
After killing Scotty, I called you.

507
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:27,108
I told you everything.

508
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,672
<i>That never happened.</i>

509
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:31,143
<i>Maybe the drugs made you think
that had happened.</i>

510
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:32,826
<i>Stop, OK?
Stop lying.</i>

511
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:37,101
You wrote up an incident report
for the shooting and you had me sign it.

512
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:38,317
No, I didn't.

513
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,650
You never called.

514
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:43,839
I didn't know.

515
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,786
You told me to stay undercover

516
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,401
because the case against Greene
was too important to lose.

517
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:51,584
If you had come to me with this,

518
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,165
I could have done my job.

519
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:55,960
<i>And then you wouldn't be in
the mess that you're in now.</i>

520
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:58,649
I'm sorry.

521
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:02,689
I trusted you.

522
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:07,909
You were all I had.

523
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:12,935
She's good.

524
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:26,647
But reynolds got to her.

525
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,750
There are 3 points
where the deception leaked.

526
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:31,412
She could have sold the lie
to anyone else except him.

527
00:30:34,322 --> 00:30:36,667
- What did you get?
- Take agent Reynolds into custody,

528
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,193
remove that weapon.

529
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:40,632
No, wait. He's telling the truth.
We can show you.

530
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:43,120
Take a look at Radotti
as she's offering her first denial.

531
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:44,203
Save it.

532
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,653
He just confessed to murder.

533
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:48,936
He had to make an appalling decision.
Granted, but...

534
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:50,560
Radotti endorsed it.

535
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:52,430
Her lies were aparent
when he confronted her

536
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:55,656
From the beginning, agent Reynolds
has shown a complete lack of candor.

537
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:57,066
I don't have any choice.

538
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,990
If you arrest him,
your case is over.

539
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:01,775
My case was over the second
Mark McLaughlin died.

540
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,167
Reynolds is no good to me
without hard evidence

541
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,238
That proves Radotti
covered up the shooting.

542
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:08,696
I don't even know
if that proof exists.

543
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:09,575
It does.

544
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,911
We just have to follow.

545
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,653
She'll take us there.

546
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,011
We're very sorry for your loss.

547
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:20,044
We only have a few questions.

548
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:23,619
Mark had an unauthorized cell phone,

549
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:26,320
and the only people that he called
with it were you two.

550
00:31:26,627 --> 00:31:28,619
Which one of you is really grieving,

551
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:32,202
and which one of you gave him up
to Elliot Greene's people?

552
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,040
Interesting.

553
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:36,293
You're both angry.

554
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:37,893
I'm angry.

555
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:39,588
She got Mark killed.

556
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:43,462
Maybe you killed him because he loved me
and not your used piece of ass.

557
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:45,194
Shutt your mouth, tramp.

558
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:49,344
How long did you know
Mark had a mistress?

559
00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:52,058
Long enough to come up
with plan to kill him over it?

560
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:54,031
I didn't have him killed.

561
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,164
Mrs. McLaughlin, look at Kimi.

562
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:00,220
How do you feel when you see her?

563
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:04,975
Angry.

564
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:06,058
And sad.

565
00:32:07,604 --> 00:32:09,054
You feel very hurt.

566
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,810
I still loved Mark.

567
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:17,628
It's true, but...

568
00:32:18,444 --> 00:32:20,144
you're hiding something.

569
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:23,932
I was gonna divorce him, OK?

570
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:26,004
I talked to a lawyer last tuesday,

571
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:27,778
- 2 weeks ago.
- Because of her?

572
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:33,555
I really believed
he worked on Wall Street.

573
00:32:34,678 --> 00:32:37,928
I didn't know he was a criminal
until he was arrested.

574
00:32:38,496 --> 00:32:40,916
I couldn't stay married
to someone like that.

575
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:43,931
Did you tell him the truth?

576
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:49,300
She isn't the kind of person
who'd knowingly stay with a criminal.

577
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:51,677
What kind of person are you, Kimi?

578
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:54,221
I loved Mark.

579
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:57,703
I was gonna spend my life with him.

580
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,874
I didn't want him dead.

581
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,004
- She's telling the truth, too.
- Well, maybe you let it slip somehow.

582
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:07,577
Maybe you wrote it down
on a piece of paper and forgot?

583
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,709
When I gave Mark his phone,
he told me to tell no one.

584
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,284
You gave Mark the phone?

585
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:16,748
Back when he was in county,
before he cut his deal.

586
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,307
You... dumb little bitch.

587
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,077
- What?
- If someone knew that number,

588
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,409
they could locate the phone.
They'd know where Mark was.

589
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:27,144
No one knew the number.

590
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:29,218
It was our private phone

591
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:31,776
So she couldn't find out about us.

592
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,997
Sometimes he would take...

593
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:40,418
work calls on the phone

594
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:44,817
from Greene.

595
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:52,371
Mark died and it was my fault.

596
00:34:03,196 --> 00:34:06,418
<i>You wrote up an incident report
for the shooting and you had me sign it.</i>

597
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,080
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

598
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:10,912
She's nodding yes
while she's saying no.

599
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,976
That's not gonna help Reynolds.

600
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:15,722
Did you guys close the case?

601
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:18,539
FBI is working to tie
McLaughlin's murder to Greene.

602
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:19,622
All right.

603
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:23,636
<i>Ben, you never called.</i>

604
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,159
<i>- I didn't know.
- You told me to stay undercover</i>

605
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:29,831
<i>because the case against Greene
was too important to lose.</i>

606
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:32,285
<i>If you had come to me with this,
I would have done my job</i>

607
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:35,518
<i>and you would not be in
the mess that you're in now.</i>

608
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:37,261
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

609
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:39,375
She's lying.

610
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:42,194
Yes, she is. When she denies
that she knows anything, she's lying.

611
00:34:42,277 --> 00:34:43,962
When she says she's sorry,
she means it.

612
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:46,917
She cares about Reynolds, but just
not enough to tell the whole truth.

613
00:34:48,262 --> 00:34:49,682
We need to up the stakes on her,

614
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:52,673
make it more clear
how her actions are affecting Reynolds.

615
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:56,630
How much pull you got
with the Justice Department?

616
00:34:56,713 --> 00:35:00,653
- It depends, what are you asking for?
- I need to call in a favor.

617
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,728
I'm gonna take run at her.

618
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:04,618
She's not gonna simply crack
under pressure.

619
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:07,401
Under the right kind of pressure,
she will.

620
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:23,451
Hey. How you doing?

621
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,660
Thank you.

622
00:35:25,226 --> 00:35:26,626
Glad I could help.

623
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:29,928
- You have a certain look about you.
- Oh, really?

624
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,361
- What kind of look?
- Like a fox...

625
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,631
trying to outrun the hounds.

626
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:40,262
I bet that accent of yours
gets you pretty far, doesn't it?

627
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,598
You work with what you've got.

628
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:46,922
A beautiful woman...
you know the game.

629
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,481
Where I work,
beauty is not an asset.

630
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:54,399
I'll bet you handle your end of affairs
quite nicely.

631
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:55,782
My affairs, yes.

632
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:57,355
Other people's...

633
00:35:58,052 --> 00:35:59,346
That's the nightmare.

634
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:01,370
That's the worst.

635
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:04,453
They screw up
and then they expect you to fix it.

636
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,517
There's just no sense of...

637
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:08,221
accountability or...

638
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:10,959
follow-through, self-reliance.

639
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:12,961
Or loyalty.

640
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:17,417
Buy me another?

641
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,092
Sure, love.

642
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:20,286
Excuse me.

643
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:22,009
2 this time.

644
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:25,127
- I'm Sheila.
- I'm Terry.

645
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:28,059
Nice to meet you.

646
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:29,739
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

647
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:32,998
To the end of a long day.

648
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:35,702
Thank you.

649
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:38,211
That sounds like a line.

650
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:40,406
- Well, it's a line.
- No...

651
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,470
I think we've met somewhere before.

652
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,553
Tell me you don't work
with the Bureau.

653
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:48,936
No. Wall Street.

654
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:52,786
I think you know my boss.

655
00:36:54,193 --> 00:36:55,796
He's going to trial in a few days.

656
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,311
Get your hands off me.

657
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,666
It's a shame.

658
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:11,153
Elliot Greene got caught
with his hand in the jar.

659
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,958
It's lucky for him
he's got friends like us.

660
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,550
You have a nice night.

661
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:35,154
Stop!

662
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:38,424
And here I was thinking
I'd ruined my chances.

663
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:41,592
What did you mean by "Greene's
lucky to have friends like us"?

664
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:43,606
Are you saying
you're not a friend of ours?

665
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:45,339
What are you asking me?

666
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:49,662
Any friend of ours
won't take the stand against Greene.

667
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:53,145
I can arrest you for threatening
to harm a federal agent.

668
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,573
Which makes me glad
I did no such thing.

669
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:56,956
Don't touch him.

670
00:37:57,596 --> 00:37:58,796
I would never.

671
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:01,679
I saw him today.
He's not even gonna testify.

672
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,658
See, we heard different.

673
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,217
He cut a deal about an hour ago,
so...

674
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,358
[*****] Night, love.

675
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:15,268
I'm not gonna let anything bad
happen to Reynolds, so call it off.

676
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:19,813
The wheels are in motion, love.

677
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:21,821
How does 20 years in
federal prison sound?

678
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:24,468
Based on your experience with Greene,
you think you get me to trial?

679
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,181
I'm not afraid to go outside
the system to get justice.

680
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,265
That's interesting. It sounds like
you should be working with us.

681
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:34,003
You don't need to kill Reynolds.

682
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:37,123
I have information that can ensure
Greene becomes a free man.

683
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:39,024
Just promise me
nothing happens to Ben.

684
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:42,346
You're playing for time, love.

685
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:45,072
You can have Greene's lawyer
verify it in a matter of minutes.

686
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:48,817
All right.

687
00:38:49,497 --> 00:38:51,047
Let Reynolds testify.

688
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,372
Question him about the murder
of Scotty Villarosa.

689
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,690
Knock it off.

690
00:38:55,822 --> 00:38:58,796
Everybody knows he killed Scotty.
We told him where to bury the corpse.

691
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,155
But I never reported it.

692
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,838
There's no record of it
in the FBI files.

693
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:05,312
Have Greene's lawyer ask Reynolds
about the shooting.

694
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:07,148
He'll be discredited on the stand.

695
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:10,062
He'll look like a rogue agent
and the whole case will collapse.

696
00:39:10,145 --> 00:39:11,995
You don't need to kill him.

697
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:18,235
<i>Have Greene's lawyer ask Reynolds
about the shooting.</i>

698
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:20,080
<i>He'll be discredited on the stand.</i>

699
00:39:20,163 --> 00:39:22,829
<i>He'll look like a rogue agent
and the whole case will collapse.</i>

700
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:24,444
<i>You don't need to kill him.</i>

701
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:29,349
Anything else you want to add?

702
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:33,403
Among the many other atrocities
this monster committed,

703
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:35,931
Elliot Greene held a 12-year-old girl
hostage

704
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:39,964
so her CEO father would disclose
his quarterly earnings a day early.

705
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:42,295
I'm sorry. What's your point?

706
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,348
I made a choice.

707
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:48,995
I see. And where did that choice
leave a loyal agent, then?

708
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:50,610
If I had reported the shooting,

709
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:53,899
they would have pulled him off the case
and Greene would still be out there.

710
00:39:54,488 --> 00:39:56,173
I realized last night though,

711
00:39:56,256 --> 00:39:59,956
that I couldn't do anything
that would cost you your life, Ben.

712
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,675
I'm so sorry.

713
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,403
It's a little late for that,
isn't it?

714
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:10,286
I should remind you,
you have the right to remain silent.

715
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,831
I was in charge and I put the case
before the interests of one person.

716
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:16,664
Hanging me out to dry
wasn't about the case.

717
00:40:17,144 --> 00:40:20,539
- It was about advancing your career.
- Which has obviously come to an end.

718
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:23,047
If I didn't do what I did,
you'd have no case.

719
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,930
You should be thanking me.

720
00:40:30,587 --> 00:40:33,212
There will be an internal investigation,
but you'll be cleared.

721
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:35,509
You'll testify against
Greene with our full support.

722
00:40:35,592 --> 00:40:36,793
Thank you, sir.

723
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:38,518
- Dr. Lightman.
- You're welcome.

724
00:40:40,486 --> 00:40:41,886
I could see the...

725
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,381
the gratitude.

726
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,570
I'll see myself out.

727
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:53,195
Oi! Convict.

728
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:56,801
How'd you get here?

729
00:40:57,427 --> 00:40:59,579
I got quite a reputation
with the guards.

730
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:01,362
They're terrified of me.

731
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:04,622
Yeah, as they should be.

732
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:07,369
You all right?

733
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:10,335
Yeah, you know,
3 hot meals, comfy bed,

734
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,883
nothing to do but read and watch TV.

735
00:41:13,422 --> 00:41:16,562
You know, being a protected witness
is kind of like being on vacation.

736
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:19,927
But I am ready to get
back to work, though.

737
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,131
Not long now, eh?

738
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:30,081
Now, officially,

739
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:32,579
you didn't do anything wrong.

740
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:37,094
How you feel about it,
that's an entirely different matter.

741
00:41:39,805 --> 00:41:42,605
You know, I keep thinking
about Scotty's son.

742
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:44,626
His name's Mike.
He's...

743
00:41:45,484 --> 00:41:47,734
He's about 12 years old now, and...

744
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,847
I used to take him to
the knicks games sometimes and...

745
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,330
he was a good kid.

746
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,542
I killed his father.

747
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:57,430
You did.

748
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:01,749
You did.

749
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:03,150
You made your choice.

750
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:09,526
Why didn't you just write me off?

751
00:42:10,922 --> 00:42:12,372
I've been cut loose

752
00:42:13,382 --> 00:42:14,746
many times, you know,

753
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:16,694
when the truth was inconvenient.

754
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:18,827
There was one person
caught me on the way down.

755
00:42:20,813 --> 00:42:22,038
That's a true friend.

756
00:42:24,031 --> 00:42:25,181
Yeah, she is.

757
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:32,427
You know, they pulled me away so fast,
I never got a chance to thank...

758
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,315
Shut up.

759
00:42:38,471 --> 00:42:40,924
Family doesn't need to
stand on ceremony, all right?

760
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,093
Court's in session.

761
00:42:44,176 --> 00:42:45,811
It's time, agent Reynolds.

762
00:42:45,894 --> 00:42:47,494
All right.
Here goes.

763
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:51,166
You'll get it done.

764
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,875
That I will.
