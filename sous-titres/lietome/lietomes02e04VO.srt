1
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:08,146
Here you go.

2
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,521
- Have fun and good luck.
- Thanks.

3
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:19,867
- I'm Joan.
- Hi.

4
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,478
- Are you irish or...
- No, I'm english.

5
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:27,115
That's so neat.

6
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:29,694
- What do you do?
- I'm a furrier.

7
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,490
Is that like, fur coats?

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,338
Fur coats, wraps,

9
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:36,068
stoles, hats,

10
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:37,761
Mainly fur coats, though.

11
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:40,170
How about you?

12
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:42,766
I have to meet my friend.

13
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:44,512
Well, maybe we can catch up later.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,267
Lose a bet?

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,311
Basically.

16
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:04,906
My friend over there
dragged me along.

17
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:09,110
If we were in a hotel room and you could
order one thing from room service,

18
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,612
would it be chocolate cake,
strawberries or warm honey?

19
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:15,408
I beg your pardon?

20
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:19,277
I got to take this.

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,965
- What's going on?
- What's your ETA?

22
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:26,585
I don't know. You can't hurry love.
Can I get a lager?

23
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:28,625
I hope that's your first drink.

24
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,088
DC Police are looking
for a guy named E. Matheson.

25
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,409
He's been on the run for 2 days since
his wife was found beaten to death.

26
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:36,429
They want us interviewing
friends and family

27
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,347
to determine
if anybody's helping him.

28
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,850
And I've already gotten Loker
and Torres in the field.

29
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,977
- Chardonnay, please.
- I don't care

30
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,128
if he inspected it before he shipped it
the painting's scratched, all right?

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,650
- What?
- Tell him... You tell France

32
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,515
he's paying for the restoration.
Otherwise, it comes back his way.

33
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:55,506
Collector?

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,742
Dealer.

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,785
I'm a curator.

36
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,059
- Really?
- Really.

37
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:07,801
I don't know. I guess the upside to
having been through a marriage before

38
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:11,255
is that I not only know what I'm looking
for, but I know what I don't want.

39
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:14,785
- I just want to be happy.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

40
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,320
Like for me, right...

41
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:22,373
This one thing is very important to me.
It may seem old-fashioned to you, but

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,361
that's fidelity.

43
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:26,998
For some reason,
I need to be up front about that.

44
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,814
That's not old-fashioned.
It's important to me, too.

45
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,443
When I was married, I never cheated.

46
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:35,735
I was tempted
and certainly accused of it,

47
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,073
But I never strayed...

48
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:40,643
Never.

49
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,517
So, what are your hobbies?

50
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,582
What do you like to do
on the weekends?

51
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,107
I run a company that shrink-wraps
poodles for international travel.

52
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:54,330
I have to... go feed my meter.

53
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,871
I'll be right back.
Could you hold that thought?

54
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:58,766
- I'll save your seat.
- Thanks.

55
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,478
In answer to your question
from earlier...

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,528
It's warm honey, right?

57
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,149
You should call me sometime.

58
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:51,543
The place is clear.
You want us to stay?

59
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,325
No, I'm good.
Go ahead and check out

60
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,484
the next name on the list.
I'll be behind you.

61
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:02,428
I'm Ria Torres.
I'm with the Lightman Group.

62
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:05,327
- The cop told me.
- Any idea where your brother is?

63
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:08,094
Running, apparently.

64
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,854
It'll be easier for Eric
if he turns himself in.

65
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,251
I get that.

66
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,302
His wife Connie was my best friend.

67
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,071
I just can't believe
she's dead. But...

68
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:26,868
I don't know.

69
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:29,310
Are we done?

70
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:34,565
Why do I get the impression
that you're hiding something to me?

71
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,568
There's a lot I'm not telling you.

72
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,177
Like how I can't sleep,

73
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:40,524
how tell my kids that their uncle

74
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:43,316
might have murdered his wife.
Do you want me to go on?

75
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:46,101
I don't know where Eric is.

76
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:48,412
Do you know something
that could help us with this case?

77
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:52,041
I want you to leave.

78
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,337
Now.

79
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,489
You a cop?

80
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:27,534
But they were here, right?

81
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:30,746
They were here, weren't they?

82
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,790
Yeah, yeah, they were here.

83
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,914
Look, you don't need to hurt me.
I can help you.

84
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,836
I can help you.

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,881
Drive.

86
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:42,691
Drive!

87
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:44,903
Don't look at me. Drive.

88
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:54,774
- How did it go?
- Put me out of my misery.

89
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:57,983
Hi. Right.

90
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:02,307
Your ex never cheated on you.
There it is.

91
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:03,391
You're sure?

92
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:05,531
I spoke to her at one of those...

93
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:06,907
Singles what?

94
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,236
Singles mixers, and not a hint of shame
or guilt when the subject came up.

95
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:11,641
Her virtue is intact. So...

96
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:14,103
Let me remind you,
there's millions in alimony at stake.

97
00:06:14,186 --> 00:06:16,694
I'm well aware of the terms
of your prenup. I'm telling you,

98
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,775
conclusively,

99
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,374
your wife never violated the fidelity
clause, or however you put it.

100
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,594
Maybe if I increase your fee,
you can run another one of your tests.

101
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,717
Let me just stop you right there.

102
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:28,400
The truth's the truth.

103
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,960
- Send me the bill.
- I will.

104
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,737
I definitely will.

105
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:40,925
Boy, that was fun.
What's next?

106
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,860
Peeking through keyholes or what?

107
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,618
You leveraged this company
to buy your ex-wife out of this?

108
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,062
Because she was gonna
move Emily to Chicago.

109
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:51,401
But now, we are cash poor, and taking
cases like this helps us stay afloat.

110
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:52,751
- I don't care.
- What?

111
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,457
I'll go back to working out of my home
before I take another case like that.

112
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,963
- I don't care.
- The bills, the books, the payroll.

113
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,463
Fine. It's all yours. Everything,
it's all yours. You can take it.

114
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,590
Will you calm down?
What's the matter with you?

115
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:06,842
I didn't kill my wife.

116
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,219
And you are gonna prove it.

117
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,481
- You think I'm playing around?
- Absolutely not.

118
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:50,638
Cops start showing up,

119
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,722
I start killing people.
Do you understand me?

120
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,155
- We understand you completely.
- You stick with me.

121
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,436
She... She just makes the tea
around here.

122
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,854
Let her go. I'm the guy.

123
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:03,899
See the sign? The Lightman Group.
See that? The Lightman Group.

124
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:07,534
Cal Lightman. That's me. I'm the guy.
I'm the one you want. Just let her go.

125
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,007
- I can help you.
- No. I need to see the front door.

126
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:12,879
I have surveillance cameras up here,
up here, all down the corridors.

127
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,285
You can watch them from my office
who is on higher ground.

128
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:20,276
Everybody in here!
Everybody in this room!

129
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:21,732
Come on!

130
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:23,529
Move!

131
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,295
I'm gonna do a head count
in half an hour.

132
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,757
If anybody leaves or calls the cops,

133
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,050
he dies.

134
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,963
No police. No police.

135
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,132
I'm serious!

136
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:35,744
No police.

137
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:38,568
It's on you now, buddy.
Understand.

138
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:43,004
We're gonna stay calm.
You know, get Cal out of this.

139
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:46,475
I want you to go call Loker
and Reynolds and get them down here,

140
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,361
but don't tell them what's going on.

141
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:49,820
Go. Just be careful.

142
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:55,396
Do your thing.

143
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,005
So front and back entrance
in the lobby.

144
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:13,010
- I said no phone calls.
- No police calls. She's not stupid.

145
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,233
You need to start being clear here.

146
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,313
If I see any cops...

147
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:19,683
You are familiar with what we do?

148
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,801
She filled me in on the way over.

149
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,730
You know that we're not
law enforcement.

150
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:26,969
You're...

151
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:30,501
some scientist who knows how to tell
who's telling the truth, right?

152
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:32,430
That's right.

153
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,732
I got a question for you.

154
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,618
If you know who killed your wife
and it wasn't you,

155
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,672
why aren't you at the nearest
police station banging on the door,

156
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,315
demanding they take action?

157
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:45,315
That's something
a guy like you would do.

158
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:50,176
I've had my run-ins with the cops,
and they've never believed me yet.

159
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:53,515
And when I walked in that door
and I saw my Connie dead on the floor...

160
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,459
You got a knack
for telling who's lying?

161
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,385
I got a knack for knowing
when I'm screwed.

162
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:00,869
And in that moment,
I knew this would land on me.

163
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,935
Fair enough.

164
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,251
But no more shooting, threatening
those people out there,

165
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,440
Or you won't get my help,
and we'll both lose.

166
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,769
You more than me.

167
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:12,236
I already lost
everything I cared about.

168
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:15,155
But you heard what I said, right?

169
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,408
Do you believe me when I say
I didn't kill my wife?

170
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,457
And you believe I'll kill you
if you try to run a game on me?

171
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:28,377
Am I being clear now?

172
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,306
Tell me.
Who killed your wife?

173
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,436
- Are you crazy?
- Just until we know what's going on.

174
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,419
This is a hostage situation!

175
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:53,587
- Lightman's giving us eyes in the room.
- How did he get in here with a gun?

176
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:55,472
He has got the situation
under control.

177
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:57,265
Do you know what misprison means?

178
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:59,700
It's failure to report
a felony crime.

179
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm not gonna risk the lives of people
out there and get fired in the process

180
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,331
because Lightman thinks
that he's got a handle on this!

181
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:16,035
<i>Could you come in here
for a minute, please?</i>

182
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:17,499
Sure.

183
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,994
We've gotta figure out
who killed this guy's wife.

184
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,577
Matheson did.
Innocent people do not run!

185
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,603
If we don't do exactly
what this guy says, he will kill Cal.

186
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:35,485
Can you please
just help us out, Ben?

187
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,847
I'll hold off calling it in
for a little while.

188
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:45,444
But only under one condition.

189
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:51,419
Come on, come on.

190
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:58,258
How's everyone behaving?

191
00:11:58,567 --> 00:11:59,676
Perfectly.

192
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,844
Good.

193
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:04,348
That's the address of Tom McHenry.

194
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:07,142
He runs an advertising firm.
Eric's wife

195
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,284
used to work for him
as a bookkeeper.

196
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,064
- Now, Eric's claiming that...
- I know. I know.

197
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Now, Eric knows...

198
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,766
that McHenry was making
unwanted moves on his wife.

199
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:20,250
And he considers him to be
the only suspect in her death.

200
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,431
So, I'll need you
to track him down and,

201
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:23,744
interview him...

202
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:26,346
and tape it and bring it back to me.

203
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,798
- What if he doesn't...
- Just find a way.

204
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,172
- Reynolds is here.
- Who's he?

205
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:39,236
He's a...

206
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,052
Federal agent.
He works with us.

207
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:44,719
Same rules apply to him
as everybody else.

208
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,271
He's agreed to not call the police,

209
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,976
but only if everyone in the conference
room is allowed to leave.

210
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:52,771
You bring him in here.
I'll tell him what's allowed.

211
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:55,857
- It's nonnegotiable.
- You bring him in here!

212
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,309
What do you want to do? Play king of the
castle, or find out who is the killer?

213
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:05,628
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Everybody out. Let's go.

214
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,978
Don't say anything.
Don't call anybody.

215
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:10,065
Don't do anything.
Just go home and relax.

216
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:11,832
We got the situation under control.

217
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:16,374
Come on. What are you doing?
Let's go. Follow everybody out.

218
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,768
- You don't want me to call the cops?
- I don't.

219
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:22,676
- But I think we should call...
- Listen. Don't do anything. Not yet.

220
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:24,428
I want everything on Matheson.

221
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:28,432
Monitor all the hallway surveillance.
Anything happens, call me and Reynolds.

222
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:31,125
What? No, I'm not going anywhere.
I can't leave.

223
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,704
It would help to have a badge
to convince this guy to talk to me.

224
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:34,929
I'll fake it.

225
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,402
- Leave your tie.
- What?

226
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:42,172
Come on.

227
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:46,135
Good.

228
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:47,701
Badge, too?

229
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,517
No, no badge.

230
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:55,142
I screwed up.

231
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,675
Tom McHenry.

232
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:06,567
All right, you two, out.

233
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:08,069
Come on.
Get out.

234
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:16,019
- You gonna tell me what this is about?
- This is my colleague Gillian Foster.

235
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:19,024
- We're here about Eric Matheson.
- Did you find him yet?

236
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:20,817
- We did.
- Good.

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,767
I hope he gets the death penalty.

238
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:24,529
He's saying you killed Connie.

239
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:28,867
Did you?

240
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:31,703
I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a comment.

241
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,253
You're gonna need to, pal.

242
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,122
You know what? This is further evidence
that Eric is a first-grade psycho.

243
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,921
Twice now, you've done what we call
a false inference dodge, M. McHenry.

244
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,715
You have yet to answer the question.

245
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,182
This is why he's crazy.
This is why I had to let Connie go.

246
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:55,098
He was convinced I was trying
to have an affair with her.

247
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:58,499
He was convinced that I was filling
her mind with what a loser he was,

248
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:00,482
as if she needed further proof.

249
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,484
Then you won't mind
if we put you on tape.

250
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:06,411
Why not?

251
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,156
I thought you're innocent.

252
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:13,734
OK, fine.

253
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:17,445
Roll it.

254
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:25,039
Who's that?

255
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,986
That's my daughter.
You mind if I call her?

256
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,250
Yes, I do.

257
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,019
Take a seat.

258
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:41,815
You married?

259
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,742
Not anymore.

260
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,743
Which one you banging?

261
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:48,905
Uptown chick
or the salsa queen that drove me here?

262
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:51,032
Neither, actually.

263
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,316
Right.

264
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:54,887
That's one thing I got
over guys like you.

265
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,389
My woman loved me.

266
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,220
We had something real.

267
00:15:59,545 --> 00:16:00,750
Guys like you...

268
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:03,634
Empty.

269
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:08,258
You try and fill yourself up
with nice suits and stupid art

270
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:12,137
and show-off books and by nailing
your employees in the copy room.

271
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:15,122
You got a job?

272
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:18,075
Not currently.

273
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,395
- What that have to do with anything?
- I'm sensing a little inner turmoil

274
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:23,773
over the fact
that your wife was the sole provider.

275
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,567
No, we were rock solid.

276
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:27,402
We didn't care who made the money.

277
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:30,463
That's something
you'd never understand.

278
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,265
Don't... don't look at me like that.

279
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,414
- Like what?
- Like you're better than me.

280
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,272
I told you that I would know
if you were telling the truth,

281
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:44,586
But I also know
if you're hiding something from me.

282
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,100
I'm not hiding anything.

283
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:50,511
You're projecting a...

284
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:52,134
little guilt.

285
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:54,846
That's either from self-loathing
or from something else.

286
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,681
I'm just trying to figure out

287
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,012
why that's making you do this.

288
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,556
They got half an hour
to get that tape here.

289
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:14,549
Yes, sir.

290
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,173
They haven't yet.

291
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,561
Everyone from the Lightman group
is out in the field right now

292
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:20,914
Interviewing
Matheson's friends and family.

293
00:17:21,784 --> 00:17:24,084
Yes, sir.
That's really great, sir.

294
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,817
OK. All right. Bye.

295
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,490
I'm screwed.

296
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,893
Good, Foster and Loker are back.

297
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,629
You gotta stop this.
You did nothing wrong.

298
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:38,884
I should've locked the car.
Why didn't I lock the car?

299
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,769
You gotta quit
beating yourself up about it.

300
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,853
Stay focused.
We need your help on this.

301
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:44,902
- All right.
- Hey.

302
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:47,584
We just ran Matheson's sheet.

303
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:48,969
Police responded 3 times

304
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,920
to their apartment
for domestic disturbance.

305
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,114
The wife never filed charges.
I'm telling you, this guy's the killer.

306
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,206
He seemed believable
when he said he's innocent.

307
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,909
- <i>Seemed</i>? That's not good enough.
- I'm taking this in to Lightman.

308
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,078
Wait.

309
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,224
Set it up in the lab.

310
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:03,998
Tell him
that's where he gotta watch it.

311
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,474
- Why?
- Because I can get a better visual.

312
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:09,332
Again, I don't want to rattle this guy
any more than we have to.

313
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:11,035
Gillian, what's your priority?

314
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:12,537
Running errands for this lunatic

315
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,634
or making sure
that Cal lives through the day?

316
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:21,570
- Where is it?
- It's just across the hall.

317
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,643
Easy, all right.
Take it easy.

318
00:18:25,913 --> 00:18:28,629
He's Reynolds, the guy I told you about.
He works here.

319
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:30,442
- Open it.
- Just calm down.

320
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:33,826
Stay back.

321
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:37,508
Lock it.

322
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,840
Lock the doors.

323
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,183
Where are we watching this?

324
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,741
If you let go of my neck,
I'll show you, right?

325
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,585
All right, and I...

326
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:12,161
I want to see the front entrance
and the back entrance and the lobby.

327
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:13,413
Pull that up.

328
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,944
There you go.

329
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,620
Good.

330
00:19:19,655 --> 00:19:21,201
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- There he is.

331
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,684
- <i>I'm Tom McHenry.</i>
- Smug son of a bitch!

332
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:25,755
<i>How did you know Connie Matheson?</i>

333
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:26,873
<i>She worked for me.</i>

334
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,875
<i>Did you ever socialize with her?</i>

335
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:33,551
<i>Couple of times
after work for drinks...</i>

336
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,839
<i>That's it.</i>

337
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:36,509
<i>Strictly platonic.</i>

338
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:37,911
Is he lying yet?

339
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:39,558
Could you shut up?

340
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,809
- Cal just activated the audio.
- My man.

341
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:45,538
All he's gotta do is bluff,
just tell him that this guy is lying,

342
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:47,602
and he'll testify to it.
That's all he's gotta do.

343
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,251
<i>Tell me why someone would accuse you
of killing Connie Matheson.</i>

344
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,092
<i>No sane person would.</i>

345
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:55,753
<i>Only her husband Eric would do that.</i>

346
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:57,050
<i>I didn't kill Connie.</i>

347
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:01,356
He's lying, right?

348
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:07,531
I see no typical signs of deception.

349
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,504
Can't be sure, but...

350
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,418
I don't think he killed your wife.

351
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,006
He's putting one over on you!

352
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,132
I'm good enough to know
you didn't do it, all right?

353
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,759
- Neither did he.
- No way.

354
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:23,559
No way!

355
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:25,515
Why didn't he just bluff?

356
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,296
This guy is too close to Lightman.

357
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,353
If I can get some distance between 'em,
I can end this thing with one shot.

358
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:31,747
Go on!

359
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:34,578
<i>When's the last time you saw Connie?</i>

360
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:36,651
<i>3 weeks ago.</i>

361
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:39,195
<i>She came into my office,</i>

362
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,824
<i>asked for a loan to pay off a debt
that was weighing on her.</i>

363
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,617
<i>That was the last straw.</i>

364
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,484
<i>I told her she needed to find employment
elsewhere.</i>

365
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:51,765
He's lying.

366
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,193
No, he's not.

367
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,594
- What debt?
- I don't know.

368
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:05,071
I don't know!

369
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,448
You break into my office...

370
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:09,311
You terrorize my staff,

371
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,102
you threaten to kill me.

372
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,647
Congratulations, you got my attention.
Now, tell me what the hell's going on.

373
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,583
Sit down.

374
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:20,426
Let me think.

375
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:28,750
Who did your wife
borrow the money from?

376
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,852
No one.

377
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,607
That's a lie.

378
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:32,961
No one!

379
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,335
I did.

380
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,504
Chump change... 10 grand.

381
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:41,229
- Who did you borrow it from?
- A buddy...

382
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:43,581
Who wouldn't do anything to Connie.

383
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,848
How much have you paid back?

384
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:48,095
That's the guy!

385
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:50,141
And you're playing games with me?

386
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:52,484
- How much have you paid back?
- None.

387
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:54,518
It's a fresh loan.

388
00:21:54,638 --> 00:21:55,997
There's plenty of time.

389
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,760
I think I got you wrong.
I think your wife...

390
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,902
approached you.
She confronted you with the debt.

391
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:04,072
And the argument got out of hand,
and then you killed her.

392
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:06,542
<i>You say that again.</i>

393
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:08,534
I dare you to say that again.

394
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,747
- Answer the question, right?
- No.

395
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:14,738
I didn't kill my wife.

396
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,030
I'm telling you, he's gonna blow.

397
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:18,789
<i>What's your buddy's name?</i>

398
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:21,236
I'm not gonna let you throw up
the smoke screen, right?

399
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:23,257
You don't know what you're doing.

400
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,115
You got 3 options.
You pull the trigger,

401
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:27,075
You walk out and take your lumps
with the cops,

402
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:29,180
or you can tell me your buddy's name!
All right?!

403
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,353
Are you gonna tell me
your friend's name?

404
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:47,738
Danny Pavelka.

405
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,067
All right.

406
00:22:54,882 --> 00:22:56,082
Danny Pavelka.

407
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:05,126
- There he is.
- OK, thanks.

408
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,951
We're here to talk to you
about the money you loaned E. Matheson.

409
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:15,142
What's that got to do
with him killing Connie?

410
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:16,244
He didn't.

411
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:17,864
Who did, then?

412
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,482
This may come as a surprise to you,
that's why we're standing ahead.

413
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,803
You just wasted a trip.

414
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:26,053
I just got back in town this morning
from Atlantic City,

415
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,896
and I got the motel bills
to prove it.

416
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:31,599
- How late was he on the loan?
- First of all, I didn't loan him jack.

417
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,131
- I facilitated a loan.
- Who carried the note?

418
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:36,232
That's my business.
You want more?

419
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:38,166
- Get a court order.
- Danny,

420
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,166
We just ran your sheet
on the way over here.

421
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,130
And it clearly states
in your parole agreement

422
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,724
that you have to check in
with your P. O. once a week.

423
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:46,215
You missed one 2 weeks ago.

424
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,633
- He said he's gonna let that one slide.
- Oh, really?

425
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,388
See,

426
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:54,157
I'm a little bit more of a stickler,
so...

427
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:57,560
You're gonna tell me
everything I want to know, right now!

428
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:08,429
Foster and Reynolds
spoke with Pavelka.

429
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:09,964
Connie found out about the debt.

430
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:12,410
She went to Pavelka,
told him that...

431
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,517
Eric and she weren't gonna be able
to pay the debt.

432
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,828
I'm standing right here.

433
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:18,956
She begged Pavelka
to forgive the debt.

434
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,653
He told her it wasn't up to him,
so she has to talk to the guy

435
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:24,337
who gave Pavelka
the money for you... Eric.

436
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,023
His name's Mike Zancanelli.

437
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:32,165
Foster and Reynolds are on their way
over to talk to him right now.

438
00:24:32,943 --> 00:24:34,430
You know who this is?

439
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,298
I've never heard of him.

440
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:41,718
Did he say
how Connie found out about the loan?

441
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:42,946
I don't know.

442
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,165
He did tell Foster
that he wasn't surprised she came,

443
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:49,529
'cause she was always having to clean up
your messes, apparently.

444
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,247
That will do, Torres.

445
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:06,326
Why the guilt, Eric?

446
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:14,401
That guy right there.

447
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,453
It looks like him.
The one in the black hat?

448
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:19,976
There's no way he's gonna say squat
in front of his boys.

449
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,204
Then we'll have to take him back
to the Lightman group to talk to him.

450
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:24,344
What?

451
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:26,777
How?
Look...

452
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,457
This isn't even about
saving my job anymore.

453
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:31,626
Most likely, that's gone.
I've accepted that.

454
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:34,832
But if go in there and drag this guy out
in front of 15 people,

455
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,417
This whole under-the-radar thing
is done.

456
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,934
Come on, Gillian, we gave it a shot.

457
00:25:40,054 --> 00:25:41,792
It's time to call this thing in.

458
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:42,915
What?

459
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:47,039
There's one thing Matheson said today
that I believe is absolutely true.

460
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,599
If he sees the cops...

461
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:50,931
He will pull the trigger.

462
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,033
He will!

463
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,221
We're out of options, so...

464
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,019
- All right.
- What are you doing?

465
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:11,314
- No, you're not going in there.
- I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

466
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,066
- Be ready.
- Oh, God!

467
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,071
I'm going to jail.

468
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:19,647
What do you think?

469
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,608
You don't wanna know what I think.

470
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:38,734
Could I use your phone?
Please?

471
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,062
- Sure, there you go, darling.
- Thank you.

472
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:45,461
Damn it!

473
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:46,638
Thank you.

474
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,490
- Hi.
- Hey.

475
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:59,451
Do any of you guys
know how to fix a flat?

476
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,940
Did you know your wife reached out
to Pavelka about the money?

477
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:13,422
You didn't think you're in trouble
not having paid it off?

478
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:18,351
Your wife's death...

479
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:23,057
and the money that you owed
are in no way connected in your mind.

480
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,207
That's right.

481
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:27,859
Your wife was beaten to death.
Your apartment was ransacked.

482
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:30,951
Who do you know that's that angry

483
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,441
and wants something of yours?

484
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,070
That describes a lot of people I know,
man.

485
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:42,451
That's your guilt, isn't it?
For contaminating her?

486
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:44,662
You didn't want to drag her
into your world.

487
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,264
You considered her a pure soul,
and you tried to keep it that way.

488
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,168
And now she's dead.

489
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:56,410
There's no way you can tell all that
just by looking at my face.

490
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,552
Just the guilt part.

491
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:05,259
Where does the rest come from?

492
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,904
That's how I feel sometimes
about women I know.

493
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:12,809
Did he mean that?

494
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:21,032
You brought this on her
somehow, Eric.

495
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,660
That's one thing you're gonna have
to live with, but murder charge isn't.

496
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:26,537
All right?

497
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,222
And what had you hoped to gain
by coming in here?

498
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:32,051
To be proven innocent?
I'll testify to it.

499
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:34,946
To find out who really killed her?

500
00:28:36,288 --> 00:28:37,506
I'm helping you.

501
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,800
There's no further need for that gun.
You just put it down,

502
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:42,340
you just walk away.

503
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,138
This never happened.

504
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,015
I wish I knew
if I could believe you.

505
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:49,916
You can. You're gonna
have to trust me.

506
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:54,037
I will tell the police
that you were innocent.

507
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:56,078
Just put the gun down.

508
00:28:57,096 --> 00:28:58,069
Walk away.

509
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:15,534
What the hell is this?

510
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,129
What the hell is this!

511
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:20,340
I told you no cops!

512
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:23,734
I can't believe
I trusted your lying ass.

513
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,345
What are we gonna do?

514
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,789
She's good.
She'll take care of it.

515
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,944
I thought you said
she just makes the tea.

516
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:41,386
May I help you?

517
00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:44,528
We got a call from one of your employees
saying there might be a disturbance here

518
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:47,379
Not here.

519
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:48,945
He was very insistent.

520
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,187
He said someone might be armed.

521
00:29:51,307 --> 00:29:53,707
I think I would know if someone
had a weapon here at work.

522
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,792
Why don't we
take a look just to be safe.

523
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,227
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

524
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:13,049
So, what was the person's name?

525
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:14,728
Who called this in?

526
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,238
Raymond moncrief.

527
00:30:18,356 --> 00:30:20,958
I am so sorry, officer.
We fired ray today,

528
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:24,240
For misuse of company funds. He had
to be escorted from the building.

529
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,409
This is him looking for his payback.
I guess it's just like him.

530
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:31,967
Is that right?

531
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:35,142
Excuse me.

532
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:41,315
Just let go of me.
I'll take care of...

533
00:30:41,435 --> 00:30:42,965
I'll do this.
I'll do this.

534
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,209
Can you open this?

535
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:52,767
What's the problem?

536
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,448
Moncrief's hassling us again

537
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:57,597
Crank called the cops
about someone with a weapon.

538
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,081
You did tell him that's my problem?

539
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:06,572
We were just taking
a look around, sir.

540
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,927
"Were." That's good.

541
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:10,641
That's past tense. Perfect, 'cause
I'm tryingto run a business here.

542
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:12,348
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

543
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,537
Thank you.

544
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,082
Sorry for the interruption.

545
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:23,753
- Have a nice day.
- No problem.

546
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:27,968
False alarm.

547
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:42,346
It's just a matter of time
till they come back.

548
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:44,515
Then leave before they do.

549
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:48,121
My colleagues are out there. They're
talking to this zancanelli character.

550
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,700
They'll get to the bottom of it.
Just put the gun down and walk away.

551
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:54,370
Right in here.

552
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,939
Who's this?
Who's this?

553
00:31:58,298 --> 00:31:59,415
Is that zancanelli?

554
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,044
That can't be.

555
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:03,603
So...

556
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,526
Connie matheson.

557
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:11,820
How do you know her?

558
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:13,806
I loaned some money to a friend.

559
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:15,849
That friend gave it to connie's
husband.

560
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:20,729
Tell me about that conversation,
between you and connie.

561
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,088
It was about the loan.

562
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,025
Connie was under the impression that I
gave the money directly to her husband,

563
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,319
While charging him
an exorbitant interest rate.

564
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:28,620
And i didn't.

565
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,240
That would be usury,
which is illegal.

566
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,876
And have you ever
visited the apartment,

567
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,870
that connie shared with her husband?

568
00:32:37,228 --> 00:32:38,956
Never been to
eric's wife's apartment.

569
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,569
He just changed nouns
from connie to eric's wife.

570
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:43,070
He answered no too quickly,

571
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,346
and his voice was a different pitch.
A little higher.

572
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,083
Doesn't make sense killing
Connie over 10 grand.

573
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,885
Do we even need
to know the real answer?

574
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:53,315
Why can't we go in there
with something we cook up?

575
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,914
All we're trying to do is get him
to put the gun down and walk out.

576
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:58,081
- We still have time, ben.
- To do what?

577
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:00,019
There's no one else to talk to.

578
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,711
The sister Matheson's sister.

579
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:04,816
She said she was connie's best friend,
and definitely hiding something earlier.

580
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,950
Connie came to me
a couple of weeks ago,

581
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:17,453
and she wanted to borrow
a digital recorder.

582
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,562
I figured she could
just go buy one, so,

583
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:22,331
I assumed she wanted me to ask
what she needed it for.

584
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,641
She told me she had a fling with
this guy, one-time thing,

585
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:29,415
and he wanted more, so she was
gonna tape their phone conversations.

586
00:33:29,535 --> 00:33:32,450
- To get him to back off.
- That's what I figured.

587
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,609
- This guy is married?
- Yeah.

588
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,639
She say anything after
borrowed the recorder?

589
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,018
She said it worked,

590
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:41,004
but she was gonna keep
the file just in case.

591
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:43,854
Her only fear was that
eric might find it.

592
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,899
And when she was killed,
I thought maybe he had.

593
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,095
All right. Let me get this straight.

594
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,053
Connie came to you about the loan

595
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,164
You know, how she couldn't pay.

596
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:05,037
You told her something could be...

597
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:08,382
Worked out you know, a trade.

598
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:09,957
Right? So, she had sex with you.

599
00:34:10,623 --> 00:34:11,741
But you wanted more.

600
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,260
She recorded a phone conversation
she had with you

601
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,365
trying to get out of it, and then
you went over to connie's apartment

602
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:20,253
looking for that recording.

603
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,227
It's like i told the black dude.
I've never been to her place before.

604
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,415
You turned the place upside down,
and you found that digital recorder.

605
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:29,191
You're in fantasyland,
lady. You know that?

606
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,068
She was gonna show it to your wife,

607
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,445
And you lost your temper.

608
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:41,377
No apartment, no recording,

609
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:43,455
No dice.

610
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:44,965
Is he lying?

611
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,000
Damn straight.

612
00:34:50,384 --> 00:34:51,942
Connie tried to seduce this guy?

613
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,972
- She'd never do that.
- No, you're right.

614
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,010
You're right.
And she didn't.

615
00:34:57,401 --> 00:34:59,602
But he sexually blackmailed her

616
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:02,757
To pay off your debts.

617
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:07,730
We did everything that you asked.

618
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,399
Let him go.

619
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Please.

620
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,600
Lock it.
Lock her out.

621
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:43,469
I'm sorry about that.

622
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,309
I mean it.

623
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,196
Let's get the cops in now.

624
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,315
I'll tell them you didn't do it.

625
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,142
Zancanelli is who they brought in.
We both know it.

626
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,653
And I want 5 minutes alone with him.

627
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,280
I can't let that happen.

628
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:14,296
It's either him or you.

629
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:18,258
I mean it.

630
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,108
After all the

631
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:33,855
- headaches you put connie through
- Shut up!

632
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:35,797
After all the headaches
you put her through,

633
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,593
After all the hard work she spent

634
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:39,947
Trying to make you feel like a man,

635
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:42,382
There is one way you can honor her.

636
00:36:42,502 --> 00:36:44,415
And I bet you'll tell me what it is!

637
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,981
Live your life!
Live your life.

638
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:48,315
If you take your revenge
out on this guy,

639
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:51,615
You will be the fool that
she spent her entire adult life

640
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:53,961
Trying to convince other people
that you were!

641
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:57,203
I have no life without her.

642
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,231
You ready?

643
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,327
I want zancanelli!

644
00:37:04,451 --> 00:37:06,076
I know you're watching!

645
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,006
I'll do it!

646
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:14,295
He's gone from contempt
to extreme anger.

647
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:17,098
- He's working his way up to shoot.
- We gotta give him what he wants.

648
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,706
Just march zancanelli in there
so this guy can shoot him.

649
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:21,979
Welcome to the one thing
that I won't do today.

650
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,405
I've got an idea.

651
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:29,371
Look.

652
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:35,387
You're really gonna
make this mistake?

653
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:37,159
It's either him or you.

654
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,929
Then, it should be me?

655
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:40,657
Open the door.

656
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:52,438
5 minutes with zancanelli,
that's it.

657
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:53,562
Don't do this.

658
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:55,756
You're just gonna talk to him?

659
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,933
He's lying, you can tell he's lying.

660
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,402
Give me your word.
You're not gonna hurt him.

661
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,649
You have my word.
I swear.

662
00:38:02,985 --> 00:38:04,797
He's gonna kill him.
He's gonna kill him.

663
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:07,154
- I'll bring him in.
- He's gonna kill him.

664
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:09,098
She values your life
more than you do.

665
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:12,355
Join the club.
Bring him in!

666
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:24,635
And you...
you get the hell outside!

667
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,119
I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to make
sure that this stays a conversation.

668
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,876
I want your hands up.

669
00:38:29,996 --> 00:38:31,016
Hands up!

670
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,486
And you

671
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:44,645
you scared yet?

672
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:46,493
Like connie was?

673
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:49,409
I want to see that look in your eye.

674
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:53,141
Get out of the way.

675
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:54,998
Get away from him!

676
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,838
Your wife wanted me to tell
you something before she died.

677
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:08,637
You got 5 seconds
to tell me what she said.

678
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,349
Tell me!

679
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:43,739
I'll call this in.

680
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:46,466
I'll do the talking.

681
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,098
So, what do you do?

682
00:39:58,504 --> 00:39:59,504
All right.

683
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:02,678
I'm gonna give you an honest answer.

684
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,858
I'm already intrigued.

685
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:08,405
I try to help people

686
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:10,941
"try" being the operative word.

687
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:14,476
I know that must sound foolish

688
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:17,042
Or pretentious or both,

689
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:18,619
But there it is.

690
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,173
So, describe your ideal woman.

691
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,529
I could describe her
till the cows come home,

692
00:40:30,649 --> 00:40:33,581
But the real question is
whether or not i'm her ideal man.

693
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:35,856
You never know till you try.

694
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,458
Why don't we give it a shot?

695
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,141
With some room service...

696
00:40:43,892 --> 00:40:45,639
serve warm honey.

697
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:56,625
I shouldn't be here.

698
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:00,556
I'm sorry.

699
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:32,639
Zancanelli confessed
to connie's murder, so...

700
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,411
I heard.

701
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:40,997
I'm sorry I ran out like that.

702
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:44,042
No, everybody's dealing
with it, in their own way.

703
00:41:45,813 --> 00:41:46,813
I'm just...

704
00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:50,912
I'm just glad you're all right.

705
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:53,427
How's your head?

706
00:41:54,614 --> 00:41:55,614
Fine.

707
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:58,437
I was thinking about that whole,

708
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:03,328
Accounts thing,
that whole billing thing,

709
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:06,041
We'd be working out of a shoe box
if it wasn't for you. So...

710
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:08,981
It's all yours.
And I'll respect that.

711
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,868
No, you're right.

712
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:12,671
I mean, cheating spouse cases

713
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:15,156
We're better than that.

714
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:20,704
Whatever you decide.

715
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,241
All right, then.

716
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,519
I was just pop by really just
to see how you were doing.

717
00:42:29,602 --> 00:42:30,467
Are you

718
00:42:32,004 --> 00:42:33,004
I'm OK.

719
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:35,267
Good.

720
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:36,567
Where's Emily?

721
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:38,199
She's at her mum's.

722
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,743
I haven't told them
about all of this yet.

723
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:50,447
Can I sleep in your
spare bedroom tonight,

724
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,194
If it's not too much of a problem?

725
00:42:53,264 --> 00:42:54,264
Of course.

726
00:42:55,186 --> 00:42:56,186
Good.
