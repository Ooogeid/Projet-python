Thanks.

16
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:24,480
- So what's the damage?
- 47.

17
00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:27,388
- 20 a guy?
- No, no, no, no, no.

18
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:29,361
Forget that.
We're not breaking this down even.

19
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:32,436
- We all ate the same thing, Drama.
- No, he had the home fries.

20
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,575
- You ordered those.
- Yeah, but you ate 'em.

21
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,447
That's 'cause
you didn't like them.

22
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,150
So what?
I would have sent them back.

23
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:40,324
Are you seriously trying
to sell me your potatoes?

24
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,894
I ain't selling you shit.

25
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,869
Possession is 9/10ths of the law and
your stomach now possesses them.

26
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:47,510
Whatever. I don't have time for this.
I'll just pay, all right?

27
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:50,484
<i>- Thanks, E.
- No, I'll pay with my company card.</i>

28
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,155
- Amy, here you go.
- Yes... oh.

29
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,896
- Thanks, Turtle.
- Some company.

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,201
Don't be mad 'cause I'm employed
and you probably never will be.

31
00:01:57,236 --> 00:02:00,042
- I gotta call Vince.
- He was still sleeping when I left.

32
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,114
- Really? We'll wake him up then.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:04,621
Sorry, Turtle,
they rejected your card.

34
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,693
- What?
- Oh, good God.

35
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,931
- That can't be.
- Thank you.

36
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:11,338
- Thanks.
- But I never use this card.

37
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:14,746
- I'll be right back.
- No, seriously, I never use this card.

38
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:18,422
( Chuckles )
( Phone ringing )

39
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:27,109
- Hello?
- Yo, how are you feeling?

40
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:30,249
( Groans )
Good. Rested.

41
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,887
You should be,
you slept for 18 hours.

42
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,326
- Really? - Yeah, you got the
"Ferrari" junket at 11:00.

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,664
- Are you gonna be ready?
- Yeah, of course.

44
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,299
<i>- But I need a haircut first.
- I don't think you're gonna have time before,</i>

45
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,567
but I'm sure the hair and
makeup people there can do it.

46
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,435
Naw, I only like
how Sharon does it.

47
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,502
<i>So you'll go after.
I'm sure you look fine.</i>

48
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:49,437
- Where am I going?
- You're going to drai's at the W Hollywood.

49
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:53,273
- You need me to meet you there?
- I don't need anything but a haircut.

50
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,209
- All right, I'll see you there.
- I knew you still cared.

51
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,344
<i>- Later.
- Late.</i>

52
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:06,449
Mrs. Ari:
Thank you for coming with me.

53
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:09,852
My baby wants me to look at a chandelier,
then a chandelier I will look at.

54
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:13,087
Even if it means driving 90 minutes
into the deep part of the valley.

55
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:16,156
I know you couldn't care less,
but this is spectacular.

56
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:19,259
It's Murano glass and it was
originally owned by Sophia Loren.

57
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:22,228
I'd rather look at nude
photos of her original body.

58
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:25,664
- Ari.
- I cannot wait to see that chandelier.

59
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,599
( Phone rings )

60
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:30,001
<i>- Yeah?
- I've got Jerry Jones calling you back?</i>

61
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:31,837
Put him through.
Owner of the cowboys.

62
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,139
- I know who he is.
- I've been waiting for this call
for a while.

63
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,709
- Ari Gold!
- Jerry, how the hell are you?

64
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,910
I'm well.
You're a persistent fella.

65
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:41,412
I haven't gotten to where
I am by giving up easily.

66
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:44,982
You know, either you or your staff
have called me 25 times this week.

67
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,017
We wanted to make sure
you got the message.

68
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:48,652
I got the message.

69
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,687
I understand you want
to sell our tv rights.

70
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:53,624
<i>Understand that you want us
to sell your tv rights.</i>

71
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:55,826
<i>- Confident.
- I deliver, Jerry.</i>

72
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,194
Always have.
Ask anyone.

73
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:59,261
Even my wife, who's in the car.

74
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,330
He always delivers,
Mr. Jones.

75
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:04,465
Always nice to hear
from the missus,

76
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,233
but let me tell you
why I'm calling.

77
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:09,302
A couple of associates and I are
flying out to L.A. this afternoon

78
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:12,271
and will only be there for the day.
How does 2:00 sound to you?

79
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:14,239
<i>- We can make that work.
- Great.</i>

80
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:16,708
Wow me like you wow your wife.

81
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:18,709
You got it!

82
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,610
Sexy accent.

83
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,645
Jake, clear my schedule

84
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,646
and get as much information
as you can on those guys.

85
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,349
- Will do.
- Whoa whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?!

86
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,217
- I'm dropping you off, baby.
- Are you kidding me?

87
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:32,352
- You heard me say clear my schedule.
- I didn't know that meant me.

88
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:35,922
- This is the N.F.L., baby.
- And this is a Murano chandelier.

89
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:38,556
I sell the tv rights
and I will buy you Italy.

90
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:41,126
What do you mean
he sounded weird?

91
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,995
- Not weird, just out of it.
- Drama: He's on pain medication.

92
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,063
Naw, he said he
didn't take them.

93
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:48,031
Yes, hello.
My card got declined.

94
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:51,469
I need to speak with someone who can
undecline it because I never use it.

95
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:53,471
No, please, don't put me
on hold again...

96
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,774
- I'm gonna lose it.
- ( Laughter )

97
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:58,043
- Jesus.
- What?

98
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:01,444
- Both: Jesus!
- I did it myself. You like?

99
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,514
- I need a second to process.
- I don't.

100
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:08,284
I love it. In fact, I think we
look more alike now than ever.

101
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,819
- Right?
- What? I thought I needed a change.

102
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,254
This is a pretty big one.
Did you tell Cassavetes?

103
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,192
- Well?
- I'm not an idiot, E.

104
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:20,161
He said it was fine
and we're wrapped.

105
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,529
- That's good.
- Good? It's great.

106
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,231
Don't be such a nag.
How's it all going with you guys?

107
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,533
Drama's still locked
out of the business.

108
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:29,368
And his business is
bouncing credit cards.

109
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:32,037
It was a mistake.
I'm looking into it. Yes, hello!

110
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:34,106
- Lloyd can't find a script?
- No.

111
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,441
Hey, E, maybe it's time
you start reading some.

112
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:39,077
- Both: Really?
- Best script-finder in town.

113
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,145
- Would you, E?
- Of course he would.

114
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,548
Yeah, of course.

115
00:05:43,582 --> 00:05:46,551
- Just have Lloyd send them over.
- Done deal.

116
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:50,387
Hey, Eric.

117
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:53,256
Jesus, Vince. I thought you were
Samantha Ronson from behind.

118
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,858
I just needed a change.
You like?

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,825
Mmm.
Yeah, you pull it off.

120
00:05:56,859 --> 00:06:00,094
- Thanks.
- So shall we?
Maria from "Access" is waiting.

121
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:02,630
So "Ferrari" opens the on 27th

122
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:05,132
and there are some pretty
exciting driving sequences.

123
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,768
<i>- Frank darabont shot the hell out of this movie.
- Were you doing the driving?</i>

124
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,004
- No, unfortunately they brought in the experts.
- Since you bring it up,

125
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,138
that wasn't the case with
the Nick Cassavetes movie.

126
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,508
<i>- I was doing the driving there.
- From what I heard that was pretty intense.</i>

127
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,611
Someone charged $10,000
at Tiffany.

128
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:22,479
- It wasn't me.
- I know!

129
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,547
- Shh!
- You know who it was?

130
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:27,283
- My ex-driver.
- The one that wouldn't fuck you?

131
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:30,586
- Shut up, idiots.
- So Nick just says "you're doing the stunt"

132
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,121
- and you don't think twice?
- Oh no, I thought 100 times.

133
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,756
- But how do you say no to Nick?
- Scary guy?

134
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,792
Have you ever seen him?
6'4", tats on his neck.

135
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:41,161
Pretty intimidating.
I could tell you a few stories.

136
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,997
<i>- I'm all ears.
- I'll wait for the movie to come out.</i>

137
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:47,100
Hopefully after the two of you
risked your lives, it'll be a hit.

138
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:49,634
Who knows?
It'll probably end up sucking.

139
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,803
- What the fuck?
- Jesus Christ!

140
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,839
Vincent, what do you think
the studio is gonna say

141
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,473
when they hear the star is
saying that the movie sucks?

142
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:58,208
- That's not what I said.
- That's what it sounded like.

143
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:00,376
But that's not what I meant,
so what's the big deal?

144
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,880
- E: Nick's gonna be pissed.
- Tell him Vince is dazed and confused
from the pain meds.

145
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:05,815
- I thought he didn't take any.
- I'm making it up.

146
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,550
- I took a couple.
- There you go.

147
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:10,953
But I wasn't dazed. And I think you guys
are making a big deal out of nothing.

148
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:13,722
- I was being funny.
- Let me get into fixing this, all right?

149
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:15,357
Great.
Now who's up for lunch?

150
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,592
Not E.
He's got scripts to read

151
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:18,893
- and lots of them.
- I'm on it.

152
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:20,528
- Turtle?
- Ah, no can do.

153
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,797
Got new drivers to interview
and a thief to deal with.

154
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:24,165
You really think that
girl Alex did it?

155
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,100
- Uh-huh.
- We'll grab lunch, bro.

156
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:28,368
Maybe hit a titty bar
to cheer me up.

157
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:30,803
- Whatever you need, Johnny.
- You're a good brother.

158
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,739
- I'm really glad you didn't die.
- Thanks, Johnny.

159
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,942
Maria.

160
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:40,945
Maria, can I talk to you about
Vincent's interview for a second?

161
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,214
Fuck off, Shauna.
Seriously?

162
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:48,052
- ( Groans )
- He said the movie sucked?!

163
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:49,785
<i>Shauna: I couldn't believe
my fucking ears.</i>

164
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,854
Why didn't you just pull
the plug on the interview?

165
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,722
I tried to get her to cut it, but she
hates me and won't do anything I say.

166
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:58,225
- How could anyone hate you?
- Look, I screwed her ex, okay?

167
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,060
You have three kids from
three different men.

168
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:01,361
You've screwed everyone's ex.

169
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,497
This is not something
I can fix, Ari!

170
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:06,734
It's amazing. I didn't realize that
when I became king of Hollywood

171
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:09,036
it meant that I would have to do
everyone else's job for them.

172
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,971
Stop breaking my balls
and just call her.

173
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:12,439
Jake, I need to call...

174
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:14,941
Ari, you have to talk to
the accounting department.

175
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:18,511
- I don't have to do anything.
- I have multiple clients with checks missing.

176
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:21,747
- That's not a king's job.
- Jeffrey tambor wants a conference call with us.

177
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:24,816
Nor is that.
Behead him and I'll make you queen.

178
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:28,119
- What?
 - I'm not asking
you because I need you,

179
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:31,122
but I'm on the verge of signing an
executive producer from "Glee."

180
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:32,823
I don't sing, so what
do you want from me?

181
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:34,625
- Ari...
- He wants to know from you

182
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,528
that he will be taken care of.
And since you used to do that even for Andrew

183
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:40,096
before he left us without a head
of our television department...

184
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:41,397
- What time?
- 1:00.

185
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:43,332
- Can't do it.
- He can't, he's got the N.F.L.

186
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,234
- You got the meeting?
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:47,302
- Shit, that's impressive.
- Yeah, I'd blow myself

188
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:48,802
- if I was more flexible.
- Oh, lovely.

189
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:51,437
Ari, Mr. Jones called back.
He wants to come in an hour earlier.

190
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:52,771
<i>- Earlier?
- Yes.</i>

191
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,073
Jesus Christ, I have
to focus up and get ready.

192
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:58,509
King Ari is actually slightly, for the
first time in his life, frazzled.

193
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:02,047
So I need you to handle your meeting.
Pretend you actually like men

194
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:04,348
and don't just chew them up
and spit them out

195
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:06,450
like the former head
of the tv department.

196
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:09,486
- Anything else you need?
- The N.F.L.'s a king's ransom, Jake.

197
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,688
What more could
I possibly need?

198
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:15,724
You screwed her ex, Shauna?

199
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,392
Is this one of your kids' fathers?

200
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,962
- When did we become friends, Eric?
- We didn't.

201
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,564
- You want me to call Maria?
- No, Ari's got it covered.

202
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:25,133
<i>- I will call you after he calls me.
- Thank you.</i>

203
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:27,102
You're welcome.
Rude little irish prick.

204
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:28,637
Nasty bitch.

205
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:32,073
Look who finally has time to
show up at his own office. Huh?

206
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:34,741
When you represent a movie star, Scott,
we'll see how much time you have.

207
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:37,609
Oh, excuse me, are you implying that
Chris O'Donnell is not a movie star?

208
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,744
Because I will tell him
and he will kick your ass.

209
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:42,146
- These came from Johnny.
- Jesus!

210
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,215
Johnny who?
You didn't sign Depp, you fuck?

211
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,917
- No.
- Thank God!

212
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,619
And Murray called
from the airport.

213
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:50,387
He ran to Paris
with that 20-year-old,

214
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,522
wanted to make sure you didn't
need anything before he went.

215
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:54,825
- Me? What could I possibly need?
- Nothing.

216
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,796
Absolutely nothing.
That is the point, E.

217
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,630
We do not need the old man.

218
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:03,165
We could be making beautiful music together
if you'd stop pushing me away all the time.

219
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,999
- I will keep that in mind,
Scotty, thank you.
- Thank you.

220
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:08,768
And, doll, the music thing,
that goes for you too.

221
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:11,571
I think you've got
a better chance with him.

222
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,840
Oh really?

223
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:16,408
- So do you know L.A. well?
- Oh yeah, like the back of my hand.

224
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:18,376
I'm an actress so I've
auditioned all over town.

225
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,878
Oh, cool.
Anything I might have seen you in?

226
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:24,681
Um, well, I fucked David
Duchovny on "Californication."

227
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:27,617
Oh, really? I watch that show.
I don't remember you.

228
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:30,387
Oh, it was from behind so they
never really showed my face.

229
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,657
Oh.
Oh yeah, I remember that.

230
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,258
- That was good.
- Thanks.

231
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:38,393
But I'm giving up on
the whole acting thing

232
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,762
'cause every role I get, they
just want me to show my tits.

233
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,397
- No one's going to ask you to
show your tits here.
- Good.

234
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:47,467
Hey, Rachel said I could
come by and grab my check.

235
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:49,936
- Uh, yeah. Can you give me one second?
- Mm-hmm.

236
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:52,805
All right.
Let's go out there.

237
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:57,076
- You know you could have just mailed it.
- Yeah, I could have.

238
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,078
And if you wanted to say you're sorry
again, you could have just called.

239
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:01,946
- I didn't want to say I'm sorry.
- Oh.

240
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,681
- No?
 - No, I was on the
phone with Amex all morning.

241
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:07,183
It seems someone charged
$10,000 at Tiffany's?

242
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:10,552
- $10,000?
- You're the only one I let use that card.

243
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,887
- So what are you saying?
- Did you use it at Tiffany's?

244
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,689
Uh, yeah, I did.

245
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:16,390
Then I'm saying if you give
me back whatever you bought

246
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:18,525
and I can return it, I don't
see a reason to call the cops.

247
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,093
- The cops!
- Yeah.

248
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:22,695
Why don't you give me my
paycheck before I call the cops.

249
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,664
- You're gonna call the cops?
- Yeah, Turtle.

250
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:27,633
I'm gonna call the cops because I
did use the credit card at Tiffany

251
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:30,001
when you asked me to do you a favor
and get your mom something nice.

252
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:32,570
- I did?
- Yeah. And I'm sure that was your way

253
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:34,839
of trying to turn me on, but the
fact that you didn't even look at it

254
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:37,707
and don't even remember tells me
everything I need to know about you.

255
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,809
So you bought my mother
something for 10 grand,

256
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:41,611
yet I didn't receive
a thank you card?

257
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:44,146
No, I bought your mom
something for $1,000.

258
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,248
It should be there
today or tomorrow.

259
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:48,049
So why would they charge
my card 10 grand?

260
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,052
<i>Check with Tiffany's because it's got
nothing to do with me, asshole.</i>

261
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:55,322
Oh, and by the way,
he did try to see my tits!

262
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,827
<i>( Dance music playing )</i>

263
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:03,629
<i>- Have you checked in with E?
- Lloyd: I have a call into him, Johnny.</i>

264
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:05,997
But I don't think he's gonna
have any more luck than I had.

265
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:08,766
Don't be jealous that
I brought a big gun in, Lloyd.

266
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,135
I'm not jealous
of your big gun, Johnny.

267
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,737
It would just be nice if you
appreciated the job I'm doing.

268
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,172
When I have a job,
I'll appreciate your job.

269
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:18,341
- Goodbye, Johnny.
- Goodbye, Lloyd.

270
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,377
I feel like a leper, bro.
Like nobody cares.

271
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:24,180
- That's not true. E cares.
- No, he's just being a friend.

272
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:27,116
Hey, Johnny, do you want
a lap dance?

273
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,285
Yeah, sure, Cind.
How about at my house

274
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:32,520
in my bed with no
tassels on your tits?

275
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:35,389
- What do you say?
- You're gross.

276
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:37,925
See, I'm a leper.

277
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,361
- Come on, Johnny, cheer up.
- Only finding a script will cheer me up.

278
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:44,031
All right, I have an idea.
Why don't I call E,

279
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,866
- make sure he's working?
- Good thinking.

280
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:49,637
Yeah, well, I do have other
things to deal with, Vince.

281
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:52,206
<i>- Like what?
- Like the Maria thing for one.</i>

282
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,408
- Isn't Shauna dealing with that?
- Yeah, it's being handled.

283
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:58,010
- Good, then you're free.
- You're not my only client.

284
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:01,213
Yeah, but I'm still your biggest and I'm
saying you don't need to deal with me right now.

285
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,849
So just pretend that Johnny's me
and treat him like you'd treat me.

286
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,617
- Okay.
- Come on, bro, come on.

287
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,719
- Strip club in the middle of the day, Vince?
- Research for a role.

288
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:12,056
- All right, we'll see you there in a few.
- You guys are coming here?!

289
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,624
Yeah, we'll all pitch in.

290
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,696
( Sighs ) Jennie, will you
cancel my Saget lunch?

291
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,164
- He won't be happy.
- Yeah, he never is.

292
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,966
I'll take your Saget lunch. I'm doing all
Murray's work, I might as well do yours too.

293
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:28,968
You want to help,
read a script for Johnny Chase.

294
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:31,203
( Laughs ) I'd rather
have my asshole waxed.

<i>( Rock music playing )</i>

296
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:45,615
<i>- The N.F.L. is here.
- ( Phone ringing )</i>

297
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,950
- Conference room, quickly.
- Should I get that first?

298
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,819

- Okay!

299

<i>- Lizzie: Ari.
- I thought you had a signing.</i>

300
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:54,088
- I moved it up, he's signed.
- Good work.

301
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:56,090
- Let me sit in on the N.F.L.
- For what purpose?

302
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:57,725
- A woman's perspective.
- This is football.

303
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,393
We don't need
a woman's perspective.

304
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:01,295
- Ari, I know more about the N.F.L.
Than you do.
- Please.

305
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:02,696
I used to intern at N.F.L. Films.

306
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,266
My cousin used to wash
Phil Mickelson's balls.

- Okay, fine.

You are now the commissioner of the N.F.L.
What's your first order of business?

310
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:14,339
I would eliminate two preseason games.
I'd go to an 18-game schedule.

311
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:17,075
Teams will sell more tickets, more
concessions, more merchandise...

312
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:19,143
All right, fine.
Only speak when spoken to and button up.

313

- Button up?
- This is the N.F.L. Not the N.B.A.

and an honor to meet

00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:29,084
with the heads of the greatest
sports league on the planet.

316
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,919
- How are you?
- It's good to see you, Lee.

317
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,287
- Jerry, how was the flight?
- Bumpy as hell,

318
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,289
but I hope it's smooth
sailing from here.

319
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:37,157
No doubt, sir.
Come on in, everybody.

320
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:38,892
This is my colleague
Lizzie Grant.

321
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,793
Hi, it's such a pleasure
to meet you all.

322
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:44,397
But, Lee Gordon, I hope you won't be insulted.
I'm not sure I can talk to you.

323
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:47,299
- You two know each other?
- No, no.

324
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:49,367
But I know that Lee is
with the Steelers

325
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:51,569
and I'm a Bengals girl
from Cncinnati.

326
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:53,838
<i>- ( Laughing )
- I hope we can still be friends.</i>

327
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:56,707
If you can give me some insight on
how we can beat them, we will be.

328
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,241
You guys swept us last year.

329
00:14:58,276 --> 00:15:00,743
You won two championships
in the last five years.

330
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,779
You have to let a long-suffering fan
like me have a little fun, right?

331
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:08,216
Do you have a boyfriend?
You know, I'm grooming my son

332
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,484
to be general manager
of the Cowboys.

333
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,220
<i>Maybe I ought to be grooming
you to be the G.M.</i>

334
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:17,991
Huh, wow.
This kid spent his whole life

335
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:21,027
skydiving, bungee jumping, cliff diving,

336
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:23,629
then one day gets hit by a car.

337
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:27,599
- It's a comedy?
- No, I was reading this magazine.

338
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:31,235
But listen, he decided to become
an organ donor before he was killed.

339
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,437
- Jesus, bro.
- And his organs saved six lives

340
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:38,107
- and enhanced 30 more.
Am I an organ donor, E?
- Yes.

341
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:40,342
Great. You guys want
to go bungee jumping?

342
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:42,343
No, Vince, we want
to read these scripts.

343
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:44,145
- We do?
- Yeah.

344
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,848
We almost lost you once this week,
we don't need another scare.

345
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:49,650
Johnny, this kid died
in a car accident.

346
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:52,919
I could walk
out of here and boom!

347
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,354
Get hit by a bus.

348
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,223
You can't be afraid
to try new things, E.

349
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:59,126
If it'll get me a break from this,
I'd go swimming with sharks.

350
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,128
You're not swimming with nobody.
Now read.

351
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:04,365
Baby bro, I know you don't even like
to read your own scripts. You can go.

352
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,933
- Shark swimming?
- Read.

353
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:08,102
I'm gonna go roam the office.
Check out the company.

354
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:10,839
- Stay away from Jennie.
- Oh, is she the heavyset one?

355
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:14,841
- ( Clears throat )
- I'm focused!

356
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,941
Jennie, want to go to lunch?

357
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,443
- I don't think E's gonna let me.
- How about Florence?

358
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:25,313
<i>I know he won't let me.
But if you're serious, maybe I'll quit.</i>

359
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,117
Vinnie Chase, hey man.

360
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:30,951
What's the matter?
E not keeping you engaged?

361
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,786
Oh no, he's working
on stuff for my brother.

362
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,121
Scotty Lavin.
I work with your boy.

363
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:36,889
- I dig the haircut.
- Yeah?

364
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:38,890
Yeah. Is it for
the Cassavetes movie?

365
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:40,625
No, I just figured why not?

366
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,260
<i>- I love the spontaneity.
- I love to hear it.</i>

367
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,829
I've been hanging out with a bunch of bores.
Nobody wants to have any fun.

368
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:47,997
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

369
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,799
Bungee jumping, heli boarding.

370
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,134
- Really?
- I've never done either,

371
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:53,902
but I'm intrigued.
It's kinda nuts, right?

372
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:55,670
I don't think so, but I'm an idiot.

373
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:57,238
I'm jumping off
a cliff for spring break.

374
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:59,707
- Are you serious? I'd love to try that.
- So come with.

375
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:02,009
- You got anything sooner?
- Have I got anything sooner?

376
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:04,244
You're sick. I love you.
You want to jump out of a plane?

377
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:06,479
I know a guy. I could have you
in the air in 20 minutes.

378
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:08,581
- How about today?
- You are serious.

379
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,382
- Today?
- If you can.

380
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:13,952
Fuck it, I'll clear my schedule.

381
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:15,787
I should tell E.

382
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:17,288
No no, you shouldn't tell E,

383
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:19,222
unless you want him
to talk you out of it.

384
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:21,158

I called Tiffany's.
They added a zero by mistake.

393
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,741
They're terribly sorry.
They're sending me a nice gift certificate.

I'm sorry I didn't thank you
for doing that for my mother.

400

And, yeah, I was trying
to impress you.

401
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:59,524
That's so sad. If your mom only knew
that's why she was getting a gift...

402
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:01,860
She'd like it.
My mom's a romantic.

403
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:05,196
Turtle, give it a rest. I thought I
made it clear that I'm not interested.

404
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,934
- And you're starting to get creepy.
- I'm not hitting on you.

Then what are you doing?

406
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:12,705
I just wanted to make sure
you forgive me.

407
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,540
- Why do you care?
- I don't know.

408
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:17,540
I like to be liked
and I hate to be hated.

409
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:20,375
- I don't hate you, okay?
- Okay.

410
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,342
Good.
Then I'm gonna go.

411
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:24,210
And just know I know
when I'm wrong,

412
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:27,546

I'm pretty positive these all suck.

418
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:42,892
You're ready to give up
after an hour?

419
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:46,361
No, but I think we need to try a
different approach with you, Drama.

420
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:48,330
See, you're very...

421
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:50,532
- Unique.
- What leading man isn't?

422
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,767
I think we need to build
a show around you.

423
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:57,139
- How?
- I'm gonna put some calls out
to some showrunners.

424
00:18:57,173 --> 00:19:00,142
- Maybe we can get someone to write
something for you.
- That's a great idea.

425
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:02,510
- You think we could find someone?
- It's worth a shot.

426
00:19:02,544 --> 00:19:05,979
Look, E, I know we've had our ups and
downs, but I really appreciate this.

427
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:08,014
- Have we had downs?
- No,

428
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,082
but we probably will
if we work together.

429
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,883
We're not really
working together.

430
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,885
I'd like to make it official.

431
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,554
I want you to manage me...
Real client, real commissions.

433
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:22,826
Uh, okay...

00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:27,997

hug, I won't pay a commission on it.

- Any second though.
- How do you know?

446
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:05,225
Well, they said that
they would call at 4:00

447
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,894

Did you listen to anything they said?

- Well, thank you very much.

458
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:36,286
- Is there a "but" coming?
- Well, the but is

459
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,456
that the television-rights decisions
are made by all 32 owners,

460

owners' meeting and have your say?

What happened?

- But they want me to bring a team to L.A.

476
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:21,055
- Are you serious?
- What do you think
about the name the L.A. Golds?

477
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,024
- I like it.
- I love it!

478
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,726
- Congratulations. Oh my God.
- Congratulations to you. Huh?

479
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,161
- You killed it in there, by the way.
- Thank you.

480
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:31,164
- Maybe I'll make you a cheerleader, who knows?
- How about G.M.?

481
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:33,166
Whatever you want.

482
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,502
- You won't believe it, baby.
- Hello, I'm Ari's wife.

483
00:21:36,537 --> 00:21:38,770
Yes, hi. How are you?
So nice to meet you.

484
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:40,372
I'm Lizzie.

485
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,808
I'm gonna talk to you later.

486
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,814
So that's Lizzie?

487
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:54,050
The one that fucked
Andrew into rehab?

488
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:55,517
What are you doing here, baby?

489
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:57,518
I wanted to show you a
picture of the chandelier.

490
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,486
I'd love it.
Let me take a look at it. Honey...

491
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,722
- Baby. Baby.
- Uh, Nick Cassavetes is on the phone

492
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,523
- and he doesn't sound happy.
- Jesus.

493
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,657
( Rings )

494
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:11,826
Nick, Vince has been
a little off since the accident.

495
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:14,897
- He doesn't think the movie sucks.
- I don't care about that.

496
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:16,867
The movie's great.
I know it and so does the studio.

497
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,704
<i>- What's the problem then?
- The problem? Have you seen his head?</i>

498
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,373
<i>- His head?
- His fucking head, Ari!</i>

499
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,042
I want to do a couple of reshoots.
How am I supposed to do it

500
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:27,478
when he looks like
Tobey Maguire from "Brothers"?

501
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,280
- Jesus Christ.
- Suck my Dick, Ari.

502
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,951
Get E on the phone.
Put him through to this.

503
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,952
- I'm going home.
- You got it.

504
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:42,157
How long can we sit here, Bob?

505
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:45,226
We're gonna sit here till I comprehend
why you blew me off for lunch.

506
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,895
- Oh, come on, it wasn't personal.
- You know what was personal?

507
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:50,130
I got blown by two girls last night.

508
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:52,031
And in the middle of it,
some guy comes home

509
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,899
<i>and says, "what are you
doing with my wives?"</i>

510
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:55,667
Wives... mormon shit.

511
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:58,535
- I'm serious.
- Ari's on the phone.

512
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,805
- I gotta take this, Bob.
- In the middle of my blowjob story?

513
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,374
We'll be here all night while I try to
figure out how you could interrupt that.

514
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:06,876
- Give me five minutes, Bob.
- E!

515
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,812
- Bob.
- What the fuck?

516
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,280
What's up, Ari?

517
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:12,648
Where's Vince and what the hell
happened to his head?

518
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,484
- How did you know about his head?
- Cassavetes is freaking out.

519
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:17,085
He wants to do some reshoots.

520
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,854
- He said he cleared it with Cassavetes.
- He did not!

521
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:22,190
I have some problems at home
I have to take care of.

522
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:24,625
- When you find Vince, have him call me.
- ( Beeps )

523
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:28,294
Well... Ari, hold on a second.
That's Vince on the other line.

524
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:30,430
Vince, where are you?
I'm on the phone with Ari.

525
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:32,899
<i>- He's freaking out.
- Well, conference him in.</i>

526
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:37,970
- Ari, we got Vince on the line.
- Vinnie, where are you?

527
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:40,339
- I'm with one of E's partners.
- We're not partners.

528
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:43,308
- Whatever you are. What's up, Ari?
- Vince, we need to talk.

529
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:45,176
- Where are you?
- Would you two relax?

530
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,144
- Cassavetes is having a fit.
- I thought you had taken care of that.

531
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,980
<i>- Ari: The interview isn't the problem.
- Well, what is?</i>

532
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,815
You didn't tell him
you're cutting your hair.

533
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,450
- Uh...
- Vince, you said you did.

534
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:59,420
<i>Okay, I was a little dazed
and confused on pain meds</i>

535
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,722
<i>- when I shaved my head, e.
- He wants to shoot more scenes.</i>

536
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:04,057
- Jesus.
- Man: About 15 seconds.

537
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:06,225
- It's go time, Vince, come on.
- Hey, I'm sorry, guys.

538
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,227
We'll have to talk about this
when I get back.

539
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:09,861
Get back from where?
Where are you going?

540
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,596
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm jumping out of a plane.

541
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,598
- Both: What?
- We gotta go.
We're gonna miss the spot.

542
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,468
It's totally safe. Don't worry.

543
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,870
Hey, don't worry about it, E.
I got him covered.

544
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:20,772
Vinnie, Vinnie!

545
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:23,408
- I'll call you from the ground.
- Whoo! Let's go.
