00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:40,212
Three years and a 14-hour flight,
we've finally arrived. Pretty amazing.

5
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:42,923
Jumping on the bandwagon
a little last minute, suit.

6
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:45,712
Nah, he's being positive
and I appreciate it.

7
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:48,567
But the big question is,
can he stay positive the whole time?

8
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:51,843
- I am positive he cannot.
- Come on, let's give him a chance.

9
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:54,553
He had his chances all year.
We should've left him in the states.

10
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:56,252
Why does it feel like you did?

11
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,725
The thing about negativity,
E, is it breeds bad outcomes.

12
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:02,211
- I begged you to watch <i>The Secret</i>.
- I watched <i>The Secret</i>.

13
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,937
I don't buy that you can get
a Ferrari by just wishing for one.

14
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:07,002
I wished for an Aston Martin
and got me one.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,199
Vince got you one.

16
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:11,304
But I wished he would be a big enough
star so he could afford to get me one.

17
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,392
- Thanks.
- It doesn't matter what any of you wish

18
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:15,339
'cause you are
with the master of the universe

19
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:18,641
and he will deliver a sale
of <i>Medellin</i> not to be believed.

20
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,588
- I sure hope so.
- No need to hope, Vince.

21
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,378
This film will sell itself.
Ari will be nothing more

22
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:26,088
than a marionette
that shakes his head yes or no,

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,870
or says "double your offer."

24
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,343
- Do you believe that, E?
- I do, Vince. I do believe it.

25
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,475
No, I need you to believe it.
Don't lie to me.

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,818
I need you to really believe
that this movie's good and will sell.

27
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,108
- I do!
- Do you believe him?

28
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,739
No!

29
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:42,817
- Nice!
- Oh yeah!

30
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:46,291
Bonjour. We're checking
in under the Vincent Chase party.

31
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:49,186
Except for me. I'm under
my own party... Johnny Chase.

32
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:52,404
They loved <i>Viking Quest</i> in France.

33
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:54,243
What the hell is <i>Viking Quest</i>?

34
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:58,093
Is that the <i>Medellin</i> crew
I spot coming into my city?

35
00:02:58,365 --> 00:03:00,694
- Jesus, where's the wife?
- Ari, how are you?

36
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,222
- Yair, how are you?
- Me? I'm hot.

37
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:08,485
Not as hot as you. <i>Medellin</i>...
it is the talk of the festival.

38
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,170
- Feeling good about it?
- Good?

39
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:13,867
This film is the best film
in the history of this film festival.

40
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:16,239
You could have produced it, Yair.

41
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:18,508
It's going to be one
of the great regrets of your life.

42
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,230
- He's feeling confident.
- As he should.

43
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,957
Well, I am here to buy a movie, guys.

44
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,799
And my pockets, they are deep.

45
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,588
We're sorry, but we're here to sell
to Americans so that people can see

46
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,299
<i>Medellin</i> in the States,
not in the Arab emirates.

47
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:33,445
Don't underestimate me, Ari.

48
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:37,260
I'm making big moves. Why don't you
and the guys join me on my boat

49
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:39,642
for a fabulous soirée
and I'll tell you all about it?

50
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,801
We'd love to but we're going to go
to Brad and Angelina's boat today.

51
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:44,547
They're throwing a party
this afternoon.

52
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:46,070
That was yesterday, Ari.

53
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,987
I get the feeling you boys
are blowing me off, yes?

54
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:51,880
I mean, if it's my wife
you are concerned about,

55
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:53,967
she's not here.

56
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,545
We are through.

57
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:57,729
See,
that's my new girl over there.

58
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:01,118
Trust me,
I'd never let you fuck her, huh?

59
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,830
It's not that.
It's just we're tired from the trip.

60
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:05,276
We have photo op in an hour.

61
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,144
You should come
to the screening tomorrow.

62
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:10,114
- If he can get a ticket.
- What do you mean you sold out?

63
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:12,588
I'm Johnny Chase.
I booked this months ago.

64
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:14,575
Check again.

65
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:19,015
- Fucking French cocksuckers.
- This is like Sundance all over again.

66
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:21,594
- Can he stay with E, Vince, please?
- I'm not staying with E.

67
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:23,542
- No, you're not.
- You're not staying with me.

68
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:25,690
- I'm not staying with anybody.
- Sleep on the sand.

69
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:28,743
They said they'd have a room for you
in a couple of hours. Just relax, guys.

70
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:31,575
They'd better because I've been dreaming
about this trip for months,

71
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:33,391
picturing myself out on my balcony,

72
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:34,838
overlooking...

73
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:37,128
- what's that water they got out here?
- Perrier.

74
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:38,970
- The Mediterranean.
- The Mediterranean.

75
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:43,049
Me and some French beauty locked up in
our own <i>Last Tango in Paris</i> kind of way,

76
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,359
living off Dom Perignon
and profiteroles

77
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,254
and doing nothing but fucking.

78
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:49,785
You can't find anyone
to fuck in L.A., Drama.

79
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:52,049
What makes you think
you're gonna find someone here?

80
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:53,800
Because I'm a celebrity out here.

81
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,704
You're a celebrity in L.A.

82
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:58,854
Not like France.
In France, I'm a viking god.

83
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,910
A viking god?

84
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:03,847
You doubt that?
Check French Amazon's top sellers.

85
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,666
<i>Viking Quest</i> has been on there
as long as <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>.

86
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:10,798
Even Jerry Lewis
gets pussy here, so who knows?

87
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,962
- M. Chase, this is your room.
- This is incredible.

88
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:17,279
- They all this big?
- Four in a row, all identical,

89
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,490
- all with this view.
- Unreal!

90
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:22,833
Fucking French cocksuckers.

91
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:25,918
What's the matter, you and Tom
want to listen to my voice

92
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:27,129
while you dildo each other?

93
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,958
No, I have Nicky Rubenstein for you.

94
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,852
<i>Tell him you're on a cruise with
your very own king of the world</i>

95
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:35,411
and have him call me direct.
Can I get a Nutella, please?

96
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,042
- <i>Are you eating crepes, Ari?</i>
- No.

97
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:40,489
Walk away, Ari Gold. You know you can't
wheel and deal with a big fat belly.

98
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:41,806
I need energy, Lloyd.

99
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,096
Nicky, you're on with Ari.
Ari, you have Nicky.

100
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:47,523
Lower, Tom, lower!

101
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:52,153
- Hey, Ari.
- Nicky Rubenstein,

102
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,942
how's my favorite stay-at-home convict?

103
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,036
I'm not there
so how the fuck do you think I am?

104
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,299
Why don't you rip off
that anklet, hop on a plane?

105
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:00,484
You still have time to make
it before the screening.

106
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:03,854
Right. The judge won't even let me
remove it to get rid of this rash.

107
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,736
- So I just got a call from Yair Marx.
- <i>And?</i>

108
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:09,591
And he would love to tell you
all about his new company.

109
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:10,933
It's a waste of time.

110
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,538
You got something better to do, or...?

111
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:15,103
Yeah. Vince wants to find
some French models to undress.

112
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:18,220
I didn't pay for you to go down
there to have a fucking vacation.

113
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,799
Yair Marx is not a real buyer.

114
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,060
Well, his money's real.

115
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,531
And until you find a realer one,
I suggest you go over there

116
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,189
<i>and listen to everything he has to say.</i>

117
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:29,367
I'd have hired a sales rep if I thought
you were gonna be a pain in the ass.

118
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:30,725
- <i>Listen...</i>
- shut the fuck up!

119
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,751
<i>This is my thing, okay?
I'm in charge.</i>

120
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,149
So get your ass over to the party
with Vince and Walsh

121
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,385
before I pull my credit card

122
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,478
and you guys
are paying for your own incidentals!

123
00:06:57,257 --> 00:07:00,336
Look at all the girls.
This might not be so bad after all.

124
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,336
If I had a room it would be phenomenal.

125
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:06,016
You know what? You get a girl, you can
have my room till yours is ready.

126
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:07,305
Or mine.

127
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,542
Okay, hotshots, give me your keys.

128
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:11,612
Just know, once I go in,

129
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,322
I ain't coming back out.

130
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,480
Get the girl first, all right?

131
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:17,153
- then we'll talk.
- all right.

132
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,877
- Hi. You're Tarvold.
- That's right.

133
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,438
Come dance, Tarvold.

134
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,833
- The keys, Turtle, keys.
- Fuck that, Tarvold.

135
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,859
So this is Cannes, huh?

136
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:31,845
Hanging out with a bunch
of freaky eurotrash?

137
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:33,898
- E's being negative, Vince.
- Shut up.

138
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,730
The boys have arrived.

139
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:39,915
Thank you for coming.
We have caviar, cristal,

140
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,162
and all the longest legs in France!

141
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,504
You like?

142
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,662
You know, I'm kind of an ass man
but they'll do.

143
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,978
Genevieve!

144
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:53,534
You take this man
down to the guest bedroom,

145
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,120
you give him your best blowjob, huh?

146
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,251
A thousand thanks.

147
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:01,167
Now we men will go down
to my stateroom

148
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:02,825
and we talk.

149
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:08,204
- I'm gonna get my balls licked later.
- Can't help you there, Billy.

150
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,014
- What's going on, Yair?
- I want an early look at your movie.

151
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:22,864
I want to see it before everyone else.

152
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,590
Hey, if I like what I see
I pay big money.

153
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:28,801
Everyone's going to like what they see
and everyone's going to pay big money,

154
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:31,823
- so stand in line.
- No one has this kind of money.

155
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,455
I pay in Euros.

156
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,795
Raffi! Bring in the gold.

157
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:38,847
- What's this?
- It's party favors.

158
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:40,453
Open them.

159
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:45,592
- Where's mine?
- You take 10% of Vince's.

160
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,013
We appreciate this, Yair.

161
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,119
But, uh, we can't accept these.

162
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:51,960
I could accept it,
but I got a gold Rolex

163
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,000
from my parents
for high school graduation.

164
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:56,356
But I love that Patek Philippe
you're rocking.

165
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,059
You have a good eye, Mr. Walsh.

166
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:00,822
Tell you what, you show me
your movie, it is yours.

167
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,041
Never happen.

168
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,146
We waited three months
for tomorrow night.

169
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:05,962
There's no way we can show it early.

170
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:08,687
Ari, please tell these boys
how much money I have.

171
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,371
Uh, too much, but what you
don't have is distribution.

172
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,303
Ahhh, I do now.

173
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,618
I am announcing it tomorrow.
I am sinking 100 mil into a new outlet.

174
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:21,658
I hired the head of Pixar marketing...
you know the girl who did <i>Nemo</i>?

175
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,211
I love that fish.

176
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:24,879
I am very real

177
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:27,631
and I want <i>Medellin</i>
to be my first real acquisition.

178
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,605
We'll talk tomorrow
after you watch the movie.

179
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:31,263
Is there no way
I can change your mind?

180
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,408
Not unless you still have
the Mossad on retainer.

181
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,197
Sorry, Yair.

182
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,697
Would you be offended if I sold this?

183
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,408
Ah, never mind.

184
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:43,153
$20 million.

185
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:46,133
- What?
- I offer $20 million

186
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:48,018
sight unseen,
we announce it tomorrow.

187
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:50,053
$25 million.

188
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:52,710
- Yair, our budget was 35 million.
- 35 then.

189
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:55,270
I am not playing games.

190
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,178
I give you till before the screening
to give me an answer.

191
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,257
Oh, Mr. Walsh...
for your consideration.

192
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,678
That's amazing.
I didn't even know that episode aired

193
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:13,836
'cause we got canceled
in the middle of shooting it.

194
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:16,330
It aired here.
I must have seen it 100 times.

195
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:18,620
- 100? Come on.
- I'm not exaggerating.

196
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:22,474
My whole family, especially my father,
was obsessed with <i>Viking Quest</i>.

197
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,159
at 9:00 p.m. every thursday,
he'd yell...

198
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,501
- Really?
- Oui!

199
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:30,044
He even bought my brother

200
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:33,412
the uniform that you donned on the show
for his birthday one year.

201
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,662
And he'd wear it so proudly,
even though...

202
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,568
His muscles were not as big as yours.

203
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:42,226
- That's amazing.
- Amazing is meeting you,

204
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:43,828
here.

205
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,104
So shall we go back to your hotel?

206
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,446
Uh, yeah yeah.
Well, if we wait about...

207
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:53,304
30 minutes and then
walked really slow,

208
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,015
my room should be ready.

209
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:01,122
Can he really write that check, Ari?

210
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,359
Yair won't write a check. He'll
deliver cash in multiple duffle bags.

211
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,815
Does everyone
get a bag like the watch?

212
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,580
- Turtle, I think you've had enough.
- I do feel good, Vince.

213
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:14,272
Look, nobody's getting anything from
the guy. I want to sell to a studio,

214
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:16,396
a studio that's known
for winning Oscars.

215
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,481
- I agree.
- But it is a good offer, no?

216
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,034
Does nobody but me think
we should seriously consider this?

217
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,850
- No.
- It's a good money offer, yes,

218
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:27,986
but do you want to be the guinea pig
in this guy's new distributing company?

219
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,828
The guy's not gonna sink $35 million
into a movie and just let it die.

220
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,085
- E, I know you're nervous...
- E's not nervous,

221
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:36,318
- he's a class-a pussy.
- A pussy? Nobody's seen the movie.

222
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:38,529
We've got an offer
that can get us all our money back.

223
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,889
- It's never been about the money.
- It became about that

224
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,732
when we emptied our bank accounts
and put every dollar we had into it.

225
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,998
Who cares about money?

226
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:46,733
You didn't put any in,
so why would you?

227
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:49,601
I told you I'd buy you out. Just
say the word and you'd have no risk.

228
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,597
- And no reward.
- Is that what you want?

229
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:53,754
E, in or out, it's up to you.

230
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:56,909
I'm in.
I'm in.

231
00:11:57,277 --> 00:12:00,022
You sure? You can come by
and shine up Vince's Oscar any time.

232
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,470
- I'm in.
- Big balls for a little man, I love it.

233
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:04,697
Let's call Nicky and see
if he's got them as well.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,592
Please tell me my room is ready.

235
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,732
But of course, Mr. Chase.
Just like I said.

236
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:23,116
Oh, Jacqueline, you have
a beautiful je ne sais quois.

237
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:25,721
And you are very funny.

238
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,258
I'm missing your funny face on tv.

239
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,681
I have a new show now.
It hasn't hit France yet, but it will.

240
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:35,655
- I cannot wait.
- This is it, Mr. Chase.

241
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:38,417
Wait wait wait wait.
I'm supposed to be on the ocean side.

242
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:40,970
Johnny, it's okay.

243
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:49,843
This is no good.

244
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:51,659
- Is something wrong?
- Everything's wrong.

245
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,794
There's no balcony, no view,
no room for a tray of profiteroles.

246
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:58,689
But there is a bed, Johnny.
That's all we need.

247
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,447
- Thank you very much. Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

248
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:07,579
Come over here, you!

249
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,326
What's wrong?

250
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,353
I want this to be special,
really special.

251
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,286
Give me 5 minutes. I'm gonna go
downstairs and talk to the manager.

252
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,155
I'm gonna make it perfect.

253
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,809
- Trust me.
- I trust you, Johnny.

254
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,304
You're my viking warrior.

255
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,121
Back in five.

256
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:33,884
Le victory!

257
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:36,726
You gave me chills.

258
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,166
Back in a flash, my chéri.

259
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:43,656
Nicky, calm down.
Jesus Christ!

260
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,564
Hey, don't tell me
to fucking calm down.

261
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:48,380
Listen, it's the first offer...
the first of many.

262
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:50,657
- Yeah well, I wanna take it.
- No you don't.

263
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,499
Yes, I do actually. I should've
taken Harvey's offer when you got it.

264
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:56,262
No, you shouldn't and you shouldn't
take this one 'cause Yair Marx

265
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,788
will fuck this movie up.

266
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:00,103
What movie is that, Ari?
The movie my director

267
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:02,759
won't let me see even though I sunk
$30 fucking million into it?

268
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:04,680
What are you so panicked about?

269
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:07,606
This is very stressful, okay?
I've been sober for nearly a year

270
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,658
which is not easy
with fucking enablers around!

271
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:10,868
Party pooper.

272
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,710
Plus I'm having some
financial difficulties.

273
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:15,263
Like what, the cupholder
in your Bugatti is broken?

274
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:18,026
No, I got smoked by this
cocksucker's hedge fund gone bad.

275
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,726
I'm in really bad shape. If I don't get
my money out of this film,

276
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:22,830
I'm going to have
to move to the fucking valley.

277
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,304
Can you two shut the fuck up?
I'm not paying you to talk.

278
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:26,515
Nicky, trust me.

279
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:29,000
- You will get other offers.
- How do you know?

280
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:31,552
<i>The same way I knew your father
was banging his secretary</i>

281
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:34,204
before everyone in town did.
Instinct.

282
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,750
<i>Trust me, baby.
we will get better offers.</i>

283
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:40,072
Okay, you've got until screening time
to work this shit out, okay?

284
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,362
Because I'm not taking
any fucking chances. Au revoir.

285
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:43,546
I'm sorry I snapped.

286
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:46,527
I'm an American citizen.
You can't treat me like this.

287
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:48,373
Please, Mr. Chase, calm your voice.

288
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:51,334
Don't tell me to calm down.
I booked this room three months ago,

289
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,471
confirmed it a dozen times at least.

290
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:56,261
But we have no record of it,
and now you want the honeymoon suite?

291
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,245
- But I am afraid it is occupied.
- By who?

292
00:14:58,613 --> 00:14:59,824
Honeymooners.

293
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:03,126
What does it matter? You would never
treat George Clooney this way.

294
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,623
Film actor.

295
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:11,123
- Keep pushing me, buddy.
- Are we finished here?

296
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,965
- No, I want my suite!
- Well...

297
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:16,255
There is nothing
that can be done about that.

298
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:19,622
So why don't you stop acting
like a spoiled vulgar american and...

299
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:21,122
enjoy your stay?

300
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,516
Fuck you.

301
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,166
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me,

302
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:27,402
you pompous french fuck.
Fuck you!

303
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:30,408
I would like you leave
my hotel and never return.

304
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:31,960
I'd like to see you make me.

305
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,025
Marcel,
show Monsieur Chase to the curb.

306
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,104
Get your fucking hands off me.

307
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:43,779
Let me just go up to my room
and get my girl, okay?

308
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,173
Someone go up to room 402,

309
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,961
get my girl, tell her Tarvold
will be waiting for her.

310
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,015
Get your hands off me...

311
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:57,568
I am on vacation, Ari!

312
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,003
You're going to be on permanent
vacation if we don't sell this movie.

313
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:03,082
Now I want you to break out
your pink rolodex,

314
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,128
<i>call every queer assistant
in town and tell them</i>

315
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:09,312
to open their mouths like J.T.
is going to drop a load in it.

316
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,206
The disinformation campaign starts now.

317
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:15,470
Time is of the essence.
I want you to hype this bitch!

318
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,049
That's your genius plan, Ari?

319
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:20,432
I got plenty of genius plans.
you guys just do your jobs.

320
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:22,564
- What's that?
- To hype this movie in there

321
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:24,930
like you got the next
<i>Pulp Fiction</i> and smile.

322
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:30,368
- I'll see you guys in there.
- And mr...?

323
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,454
Murphy.
I'm the producer.

324
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:34,822
We'll announce you in just a moment.

325
00:16:40,636 --> 00:16:42,083
Where's Jacqueline?

326
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,393
Did you to the room?

327
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:46,577
But mademoiselle,
she wasn't there.

328
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,708
- Yeah, but...
- Perhaps she has left.

329
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:51,261
I've been waiting here the whole
time... I would've seen her.

330
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,567
- Maybe she went out the back.
- This ain't the back?

331
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,573
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm very sorry,

332
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:58,231
but I must get back to work
before they see me speaking to you.

333
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,334
What?

334
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,439
Here supporting the family. I love it.

335
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,597
- you saving a seat for me?
- actually I was hoping

336
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,719
we wouldn't have to speak
till after the screening.

337
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:27,876
Unfortunately, we actually do.

338
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:29,561
Why, what's up?

339
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:34,118
Well, I'm only telling you this...
don't tell a soul.

340
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,244
We are selling <i>Medellin</i> tonight.

341
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,375
- No one's seen it.
- We have an offer.

342
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:41,191
- From who?
- It doesn't matter.

343
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:42,951
It's on the table and it's big.

344
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:44,645
What are you trying to pull?

345
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:46,454
I'm trying to make sure you don't lose

346
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:48,730
the next
Vinnie Chase-Billy Walsh masterpiece.

347
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,835
We don't buy movies
without seeing them.

348
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:52,625
No, you just hire people off them.

349
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,119
You don't really want someone
else in control of this thing

350
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:57,462
while you're producing <i>Clouds</i>, do you?

351
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,278
It's called <i>Silo</i> now,
or did you forget

352
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,435
that that's the movie
your clients decided to make?

353
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,659
Whatever.
Just tell your boss, all right?

354
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,238
You're full of shit.

355
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,876
I was full of shit when I told
you I had a condom at live aid,

356
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,034
this, on my children's names, is real.

357
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:15,648
Mesdames et messieurs,
ladies and gentlemen,

358
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,293
the star and the creator of <i>Medelin</i>,

359
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:20,082
Monsieur Vincent Chase;

360
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:22,961
le realisateur... The director,
Monsieur Billy Walsh;

361
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,908
et le producteur...
the producer, Monsieur Eric...

362
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,584
- Murphy.
- Eric Murphy. Pardon.

363
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,116
Excusez-mol.

364
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,510
Do you know this girl?

365
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:02,476
Maybe you've seen her.

366
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:04,213
No, désolé.

367
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:08,408
How about you ladies? Have you...
seen this girl at all, by any chance?

368
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,587
- No, but she's pretty.
- Sorry.

369
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:11,912
Merci.

370
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,806
Was that Tarvold?

371
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:16,904
You guys killed it up there.

372
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,681
I'm telling you,
it's only a matter of time

373
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:21,391
- before the offers start rolling in.
- You really believe that, ?

374
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:22,918
I believe in the power of positivity.

375
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:25,738
I believe in <i>The Secret</i>.
Now will you please believe with me?

376
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:28,422
Not since the nazis
stormed these beaches

377
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:32,302
has a bigger group of scumbags
muddied these clear blue waters.

378
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,276
- How are you, Harvey?
- I'm well.

379
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:36,947
I understand you guys
have a hot little property.

380
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,267
- Well...
- I heard that you had an offer.

381
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,990
Who did you hear that from?

382
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,325
I have an assistant
who keeps his ear to the ground.

383
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:46,483
- Who's it from, Universal?
- Can't really talk about that.

384
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,825
But if you want to get in the mix,
we're ready to listen.

385
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:50,389
Not if they froze my balls in dry ice.

386
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,531
not if they stuck my dick
in a lawnmower.

387
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:56,151
And you know why? It's not because
I don't think it might be a good movie,

388
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:59,075
it's because I hate this
little fucking prick right here.

389
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:00,707
This little fucking prick!

390
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:07,628
What the fuck are you doing?

391
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:11,867
I am just apologizing
for my man's indiscretion earlier

392
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,064
- with a hug, that's it.
- I see. Okay, don't don't.

393
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:16,184
I gotta get a drink
before I kill someone.

394
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:18,447
All right, Harvey.
All right.

395
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,684
- What the hell was that?
- I'm just trying to pull

396
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:22,402
a rabbit out of the hat for you.

397
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:29,334
Tomorrow morning,
10:00 a.m. at Le Gros Bison.

398
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,557
I'll have an offer ready.

399
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:34,330
Time to drink, boys.

400
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,067
Excuse me.

401
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:52,795
Are you okay?

402
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:56,163
Not really, no.
I got evicted from the hotel.

403
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:59,543
I don't have international calling
so I can't get ahold of Vince.

404
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:03,186
And I somehow got separated
from the young lady I met on the boat.

405
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:07,312
I was wondering if you knew where
she was, or if she came back here?

406
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:10,062
I've got a picture of her.

407
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:13,877
- Her name is Jacqueline.
- No, I am sorry, I don't.

408
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:16,971
Hey, hold on.
Hey, any of you ladies,

409
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,603
do you know this girl?

410
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,171
I'm sorry, Johnny.

411
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:24,487
Thanks, Yair.

412
00:21:26,438 --> 00:21:28,074
You girls,
excuse me for a moment.

413
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:30,501
Hold on.

414
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:35,142
You pick. Any of these girls,
they are yours, huh?

415
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:37,247
The one on the left... Cara,

416
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:39,889
her pussy's as soft as patasi silk, huh?

417
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:42,941
The short-haired one, Nadia,
she is a gymnast.

418
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:46,572
She will hang upside down from
the ceiling as you tickle her asshole.

419
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:49,572
Ah, cecilia, she is my favorite.

420
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:51,800
She has the best cans in Cannes.

421
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:54,868
So you choose.
Whichever you wish, she is yours.

422
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,615
Well, thanks, Yair,
but I don't need a girl,

423
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:00,378
just a warm bed if you've got one.

424
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,221
Of course I have one of those.
But, please,

425
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:06,120
- take Cara too.
- Thanks, but really I can't.

426
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,015
Why not?

427
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:10,970
Because I'm in love.

428
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,425
Can you feel the excitement?

429
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:33,887
I've got offers
and no one's seen a single frame.

430
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,279
- Please. Who hasn't done that?
- Yeah, but I will close.

431
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:38,516
- For how much?
- What do you think she's gonna offer?

432
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:40,746
- I'm guessing 150 mil.
- What, are you retarded?

433
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:42,074
You can get that, Ari, right?

434
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,689
I like the faith, Turtle,
but not with Dana, naw.

435
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,922
- She made me split the abortion.
- Jesus.

436
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:49,812
Long as we get with a real studio,
with a real release,

437
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:51,680
I don't care if we sell for five bucks.

438
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,446
Well,
Nicky Rubenstein would care, trust me.

439
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,037
He won't let us sell this thing for
one dollar less than Yair's offering.

440
00:22:58,116 --> 00:23:00,564
- then you'd better get her there.
- Don't worry about that.

441
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:03,324
Master of the universe, fellas.
Enjoy the ride.

442
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:05,534
$15 million.

443
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,774
I'm sorry.
I'll keep quiet, but...

444
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,511
15 mil? Come on,

445
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:13,743
I didn't really cancel my massage
for this, did I?

446
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:16,558
Your budget will be first to be
recouped upon the film's release.

447
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:19,090
No way. We need much more up front.

448
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:21,192
- But there is no more.
- Come on!

449
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:22,981
You can do better than that.

450
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:25,529
Richard doesn't really believe
you have another offer.

451
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:27,397
So that's it.
Take it or leave it.

452
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,505
I'm sorry, but we're
gonna have to leave it.

453
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:31,953
How much do you want, Ari?

454
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:34,663
$50 mil.

455
00:23:34,953 --> 00:23:36,189
- 50?
- Yeah.

456
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,121
Fuck you.
Vince, Billy, E, I'm sorry.

457
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:41,726
Come on, you just...
are you kidding?

458
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,530
All right, Dana.
Can I be honest with you?

459
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:47,556
We do have another offer on the table...
35 million...

460
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,080
Exactly the budget of this movie.

461
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,781
Rubenstein wants to take it
but we don't want to be in business...

462
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,307
It doesn't matter who we don't
want to be in business with.

463
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,402
Is it Harvey?
Because my assistant thinks it's Fox.

464
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:58,586
Could be Fox, could be Universal,
could be Sony.

465
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:01,356
Could be your old boss who kicked
you out on your ass, who knows?

466
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:05,363
Vince! It doesn't matter who,
and that's all we're gonna say about it.

467
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:07,024
Except that we want to do this with you.

468
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:09,681
- We want to win Oscars.
- But Nicky, he wants his money back.

469
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:12,447
- So I should be talking to him.
- I am him!

470
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,026
Just get us a reasonable price.

471
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:17,815
Okay, 50?
That's reasonable?

472
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,724
Look, just get our investors
their money back. That's all we want.

473
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:24,487
It's not all I wanted.

474
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:28,649
Hey, Drama.
What's up, buddy?

475
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,562
You still holed up
with that little cutie?

476
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,612
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

477
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:36,981
I just called to let you know I'm okay
and I'll see you at the screening.

478
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:39,191
- Are you guys okay?
- We're great.

479
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:42,031
Vince is about to sell the movie
to Dana Gordon for like 50 mil.

480
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:44,031
Really? That's great. That's great.

481
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,504
Give him a big hug for me.

482
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:48,018
I'll see you at the screening party.
Later.

483
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:50,702
Everybody hunky-dory, Johnny?

484
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:54,224
Yeah, baby bro just got a $50
million offer for his movie.

485
00:24:56,855 --> 00:24:58,036
All right.

486
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:01,773
- I can go to 22.
- We have no room here, Dana.

487
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,753
- 25.
- I thought you didn't have more money?

488
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,779
28 and I swear to God I'm done.

489
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,238
I'll go call Nicky.

490
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,108
You get up from this table
and it's over.

491
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,897
Look me in the face
and say yes or no.

492
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:16,264
We can't do it for less
than 35, we really can't.

493
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,396
I don't have authorization
to spend that much.

494
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,475
Then get your authorization
on the phone.

495
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:23,280
Look, this is
really awkward, guys.

496
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:27,257
I mean we're gonna be working together
on the next movie and I'm at my limit.

497
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:29,665
- I am sorry.
- I'll take my five million

498
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,770
- after the movie turns a profit.
- Me too.

499
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:33,971
Well, my 237,000.

500
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,182
Jesus, you guys are fucking crazy.

501
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:38,182
That's how much we believe in this.

502
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:40,575
Come on, make up the difference.
It's less than two mil.

503
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,917
- It's not a lot.
- It's not a lot.

504
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:53,323
Done.

505
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:54,977
I can sell this to Richard.

506
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,425
All right, but you gotta...
You gotta tell me.

507
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:00,513
- Was it harvey?
- Yes!

508
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:03,276
- It was Harvey.
- Oh, I knew it!

509
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,546
- Shall we get a drink?
- Yes, let's do it.

510
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:10,178
- It'd be rude not to.
- Turtle's buying.

511
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,269
Vin, you got the credit card?

512
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,401
Nicky, my man, listen,

513
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,114
I just got you a real studio offer

514
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:19,576
<i>that's gonna get you back
every dollar that you put in.</i>

515
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,537
That's terrific, Ari.
I just got off the phone with Yair...

516
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:24,721
Who offered me 75.

517
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,608
And I took it.

518
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:32,575
Line me up some rails, bitches,
because we're celebrating!

519
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:35,575
We did it.

520
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:37,346
We fucking did it, Ari.

521
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:43,153
Thank you.
All right, cheers.

522
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:59,851
You've known her less than a day.
How can you love her?

523
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:02,035
I've known her long enough
to know she doesn't have

524
00:27:02,061 --> 00:27:04,140
any of those things that would
make me not love her.

525
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:07,311
It doesn't bother you that she wants
to fuck you because you're a celebrity?

526
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:08,469
No, I love it.

527
00:27:08,548 --> 00:27:11,210
Nobody's ever wanted to sleep with me
just 'cause I'm a celebrity.

528
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,894
It makes me feel wanted
and validated all at the same time.

529
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,311
So, are we all miserable?

530
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:17,816
- Not in the slightest.
- We're actually relieved.

531
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,737
- I'm relieved to hear it.
- I'm not relieved.

532
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:23,381
If that slimy middle eastern
cocksucker fucks up this release

533
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,276
I'll kill him and
I'll kill you too, Ari.

534
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:35,203
- Where were you?
- Hey, baby.

535
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:37,803
I waited for you all night at the hotel.

536
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,039
- Where were you?
- I'm so sorry. I'll explain later.

537
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,224
I knew this was the only
place I'd find you again.

538
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:43,880
Come here.

539
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:56,396
Everybody in for the movie
the world has been waiting for.

540
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:57,617
So you're not upset that you're
not inside at your brother's screening?

541
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,933
Naw, baby bro's all grown up now.

542
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,985
He don't need me anymore.

543
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:05,090
But I need you.

544
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:06,827
Well, you have me.

545
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:11,737
I wish I had a place to take you.
I've still got no room.

546
00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:13,631
It doesn't matter.

547
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:16,026
There's no one around.

548
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:23,326
Oooh, sexe sur la plage...
I like it.

549
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:00,774
I love it.

550
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,461
Thanks for not selling me this movie.

551
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,724
It's the one nice thing
you've ever done for me.

552
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:21,152
Congratulations, Yair.
I hear it's all yours.

553
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,101
I never signed anything.

554
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:26,864
What are you talking about?

555
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,295
That's the worst piece of shit
I've ever seen!

556
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,453
Yair, we have a deal, right?

557
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,852
Sue me.
My company's based out of Dubai.

558
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:37,546
Good luck.

559
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,494
I'm sorry, Vince.

560
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:45,809
Hey, where the fuck
are you French faggots going?!

561
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:47,819
Show some respect

562
00:30:47,924 --> 00:30:50,687
for the below-the-line people
and watch the credits.

563
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,325
What, no Q&A?

564
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:00,003
It ain't easy making a movie, huh?

565
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:01,611
- You come to gloat, Harvey?
- No no.

566
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:05,291
I just came to say that E was right.
There's genius in this.

567
00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:07,659
- You want to buy it?
- I do.

568
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:10,682
For $1.

569
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,363
So we lost $74,999,000.

570
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:20,073
And $999.

571
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:23,342
It's only money, you know?

572
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:24,991
- And we still got Harvey.
- Again.

573
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:28,570
And for only $24,999,000
less than when I had him.

574
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:31,480
All I know is that Harvey
is the guy you want in this situation.

575
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,145
You should have seen
<i>Shakespeare in love</i>

576
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,979
before he put his scissor hands on it.

577
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,195
- So you think we're still good?
- I know we're all good.

578
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,360
- Way to be positive.
- Oh please, come on.

579
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,044
The guy's about as positive as

580
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:44,588
- mother Teresa's aids test.
- Fuck you, Ari.

581
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:48,108
Excuse me.
What's happening?

582
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,303
Tarvold from <i>Viking Quest</i>
has been making love

583
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,303
to a woman on the beach
for three hours.

584
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,595
- Come on.
- This I gotta see.

585
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:04,989
Way to go, Drama!

586
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:10,976
Hey, how'd it go, bro?

587
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,740
We killed it, Johnny.
