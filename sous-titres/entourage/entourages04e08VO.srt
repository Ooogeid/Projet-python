3
00:01:12,124 --> 00:01:13,929
Not a bad neighborhood, E.

4
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:16,219
And you're relatively close
to the house of wax.

5
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:18,325
You got a jiffy lube
right across the street.

6
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,624
And if you had a hard day,

7
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:21,980
you're only a few steps
away from a $50 blowjob.

8
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:24,521
Please, we passed $50
10 blocks ago.

9
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,085
What do you need an office for anyway?
I don't get it.

10
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:29,652
You didn't get the concept of having
a job till you were 25,

11
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,939
so I wouldn't expect you to.

12
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:32,855
If it's my place
that's not doing it for you,

13
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,264
we can make some modifications,

14
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:36,008
make the environment
more work-friendly.

15
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,769
I appreciate that.
The only modification

16
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:39,685
that would work
would be having you move out.

17
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:40,917
Why, are we distracting?

18
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:42,833
No, having Turtle
blow bong hits in my face

19
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,903
when I'm trying to read
a script is motivating.

20
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:48,123
- This is the building?
- Shut up and get in there.

21
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,911
- Jesus Christ.
- What the hell?

22
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,192
I guess you don't like it?

23
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:57,756
Well, it doesn't exactly scream
"I'm Vincent Chase's manager. "

24
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,848
No. It screams
"I'm Johnny Chase's."

25
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:03,161
Why do I gotta get abused
when we're trying to abuse him?

26
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:04,438
It's just for a laugh.

27
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:06,705
- This is gonna be your desk?
- Yeah, for now.

28
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,495
No no. A working
man needs a real desk,

29
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,697
a sturdy desk.

30
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,615
One that can support a good fuck.

31
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:14,566
Well, this office isn't for show.

32
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,392
And it's not for fucking.
It's so I can get shit done.

33
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,799
- Like what?
- What you got to do that's so pressing?

34
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,089
I am kind of booked till
Walsh hands in his script.

35
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:24,169
So what you wanna do?
Sit around and do nothing?

36
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,688
You have something else in mind?

37
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:27,845
Peter Jackson's starting
a new gaming division.

38
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:31,181
They're looking to make some talent
deals... Big dough, limited exposure.

39
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:33,200
I'll set up a metting
with his development guy.

40
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:34,610
Maybe I can lock us a video game.

41
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,006
- Sound good?
- Sounds great.

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,145
- The office still sucks.
- Yeah, it's terrible.

43
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,564
Come on, guys.
Let's leave my high-powered manager

44
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:42,101
so he can earn us some money.

45
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,347
- Later, E.
- What are we gonna do all day?

46
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,602
We'll figure it out.

47
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,709
Big day today, people!

48
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,580
The gold standard's golden girl,

49
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,649
miss Mary J. Blige,

50
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,957
is coming in todayfor her annual

51
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:00,673
make-me-understand-
what-I-pay-you-people-for

52
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,809
meeting,
so we'd better be ready.

53
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,338
- Chris!
- I'm ready, Ari.

54
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:06,012
- Bradley!
- Wearing my best tie.

55
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,543
Great, zip up that fly.

56
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:11,501
- It's Jeff.
- I'm sorry. From the side, you know...

57
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:14,031
- Don't worry about it.
- You and your bro ready for Mary J.?

58
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,793
We are. But listen, just a heads up:

59
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,193
my brother and I have been
having some personal problems.

60
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,240
- Does it have anything to do with her?
- No.

61
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:22,910
- Then it has nothing to do with me.
- You're absolutely right.

62
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,782
But you know how
emotional Jim can be.

63
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,510
So, look, if he comes bugging
you with this, just ignore him.

64
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:29,096
Let's hope he doesn't come bugging me.

65
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,551
Yeah. Let's hope.

66
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:34,980
Did Mary J. confirm?

67
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:36,721
Six times, one for each Grammy.

68
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,886
- What's that smell?
- It's Issey Miyake, her favorite scent.

69
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:42,550
I'm wearing it as a subtle
subliminal show of our support.

70
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,124
- What else you got?
- Jim Jensen's in your office.

71
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,549
Oh, Jesus Christ,
his brother just ambushed me.

72
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,055
I guess there's some kind
of rift with the jensen boys.

73
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,574
- Be careful in there.
- Careful?

74
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,181
You know multiples freak me out.

75
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:54,783
Can gays have multiples, Lloyd?

76
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:58,091
Not the day for this.
How's it going with the baby bro?

77
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:00,271
Okay, he's 27 seconds older than me.

78
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:02,908
And he's a lowlife
slimy piece of cunt shit.

79
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:04,943
Yes, well, you know
how siblings can be, right?

80
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,450
- Oh, you have a brother?
- I do.

81
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,481
and a whore of a sister, so I can
relate to the sibling squabblings.

82
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,122
I need you to fire him.

83
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:13,652
I need positivity today.

84
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:16,371
But, I can't work
in the same building with him.

85
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,024
Jeter and A-Rod let their dicks
fly in the same locker room

86
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,199
and they hate each other.

87
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,917
Jim, listen to me.

88
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,070
Just man the fuck up, okay?

89
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,901
We got Mary J. coming in today.

90
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:29,082
It's time to heed the woman's lyrics...
"No more Drama. "

91
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,700
- Matt Dravitski's on the phone.
- Who's Matt Dravitski?

92
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,661
VP of Peter Jackson's company.

93
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:37,242
Do I talk to VPs?

94
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:39,111
He says he's calling
because E called him

95
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:41,147
and said Vince
wants to work with Peter.

96
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,913
Jim, go back to work.

97
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,419
Go.

98
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:51,157
And don't ask to see her tatts
like you did with Angelina.

99
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:55,969
Look at this sweet piece, Vince.

100
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,481
It's perfect.
E will love it.

101
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:59,683
Can I go on record and say
that when I get an office

102
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,049
I want my gift to be a plasma?

103
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,657
Can I go on the record and say
by the time you get an office,

104
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:05,804
plasmas will have gone
the way of the eight-track?

105
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,705
Excuse me, miss.

106
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:10,099
Can you tell me a little
something about this desk?

107
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:12,678
That's an amazing piece
with a lot of history.

108
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:14,862
- You've got a good eye.
- Well, thank you.

109
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:17,649
Do you know what
kind of weight this can support?

110
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,673
This is a signed Majorell
built in the 1930s.

111
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,560
Mickey Rooney sat at this desk
in <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>.

112
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:26,451
That's ironic.

113
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:28,829
We want it so another
small Irishman can sit at it.

114
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,744
- Is this a gift?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,498
That's very thoughtful.

116
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,233
How thoughtful?

117
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,611
$42,000.

118
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:38,848
Get a 100-inch plasma for that, Vin.

119
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:40,684
This is an investment, though.

120
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,922
This desk will appreciate
like a piece of art.

121
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:45,177
And Robert de Niro owned that desk.

122
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:48,342
- Really?
- Scorsese gave it to him as a gift

123
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,070
after <i>New York, New York</i> bombed.

124
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,193
It was the only thing that survived

125
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:54,555
after his Malibu home
went up in flames.

126
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,916
- Is this true?
- Cross my heart and hope to die.

127
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:01,099
I'm sold.

128
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:06,627
I wonder if de Niro
ever fucked on this desk.

129
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,588
I don't know. Why don't you lean over
and sniff it for ball wax?

130
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,951
Come on.
You have to ruin the desk for me?

131
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,395
- I'm sorry, Vin.
- Vince, I am so embarrassed,

132
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,288
but apparently a buyer
came in yesterday

133
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:19,308
and someone forgot
to put the sold tag out.

134
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:21,788
- You're kidding?
- I feel awful.

135
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,273
We have another great desk
that just came in.

136
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,635
It's a rustic piece.

137
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:27,111
Yeah, de Niro own that one?

138
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:28,850
I'm really sorry.

139
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:32,010
Is there any way to call the buyer
and maybe offer him a little more?

140
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,675
- We really want the desk.
- I'm sorry, I couldn't.

141
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:37,306
We're supposed to respect
the privacy of our clients.

142
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,948
Can you respect my poor little friend

143
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,296
sitting at a fold-up table
in his sad little office?

144
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:45,764
It was Gary Busey.

145
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,363
Shit!

146
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:03,188
Like the new office number, E.

147
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,447
You know it spells 274-cock.

148
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,393
- It does not.
- It doesn't, but I made you look.

149
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:09,815
Why are you so out of breath?

150
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:12,084
Are you christening the place
with a nice midday jerk?

151
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,746
Stop fantasizing.
What do you want?

152
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:15,398
You call Peter Jackson's company?

153
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,504
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- 'Cause they called me.

154
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,602
Why'd they call you?

155
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:20,493
Because they don't know
who the fuck you are.

156
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:22,541
I told them I was
Vincent Chase's manager.

157
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:24,869
Well, there are people
outside your office right now

158
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:27,269
that will claim to be Lady Di.
That don't make it true.

159
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,964
Whatever. This is true, you jerk-off.

160
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:30,483
Your staff is ready, Ari.

161
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,282
Listen, we got a great system going.

162
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,395
Just 'cause you got
80 square feet of office space

163
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:37,122
doesn't mean you can go
and fuck it up.

164
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,376
And what system is that?
Just so I'm clear.

165
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,447
Well, let's see, people call me,

166
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:44,511
then I call you.
You tell Vince what I tell you.

167
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,128
Vince tells you what to tell me.

168
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:50,411
You're like a...
A ventriloquist in a dummy's body.

169
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:52,438
Whatever. I can make
and take my own meetings.

170
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:54,824
Well, listen, if you want
people to call you back,

171
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:58,683
may I suggest that you get a van
with a large bullhorn on the top,

172
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:00,374
drive around Hollywood

173
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:03,749
announcing that after three years
of hibernating in Vincent Chase's ass,

174
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:06,206
Eric Murphy has come out
to play-ee-ay?

175
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:08,709
All right!
Let's do this, everybody!

176
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,822
- Everyone feeling good?
- Yes! Yeah! Great!

177
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:12,033
Not everyone.

178
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,291
All right!

179
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,812
I am not Ari Gold today,
I am the queen of hip-hop soul.

180
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:21,476
I have sold 65 million more records

181
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,879
than all of you combined.

182
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,208
Impress me. Go.

183
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:28,140
A broadway musical based
on her alter ego Brook Lynn.

184
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,986
Miss Blige could produce,
star and direct.

185
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:34,289
So you want to keep her
on the stage for nine months

186
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,747
and out of the recording studio?

187
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:37,416
It's a really good idea.

188
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:39,492
Mention that to her
and I'll kill both of you.

189
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,869
Next.

190
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:43,247
Paramount has a movie
about con artists.

191
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,470
it's an excellent script,
very realistic.

192
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,093
Yeah, he knows since
he's a pretty big con artist himself.

193
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:49,755
You have something productive to say?

194
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry,
I'm just having trouble concentrating.

195
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,246
- Well, Jim, this isn't the place.
- What?

196
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:56,800
- Am I embarrassing you?
- No, you're embarrassing yourself.

197
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,910
Actually, no one can tell you two apart,
so you're both being embarrassed.

198
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:02,112
I told you,
I can't work with him.

199
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,666
- What? Are you gonna quit?
- No, I told him to fire you.

200
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,731
- What?
- Yeah, that's right, scumbag.

201
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:09,197
Okay, you know what?
I apologized to you.

202
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:11,729
- But when you go after my livelihood...
- Hey, assholes!

203
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,340
- Fuck your livelihood!
- Fuck you!

204
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:14,666
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?!

205
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:15,891
You want some?

206
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,105
Put them both in my office
when it's done.

207
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,165
Remind me to sell this
as a reality show.

208
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:32,715
Sounds too easy is all I'm saying.

209
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:34,696
The guy said he'd be
happy to sell me the desk.

210
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,805
Let's just get in and out.
No small talk.

211
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:39,447
Busey scares me.
You sure there's not another desk?

212
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,256
This is the desk we're getting.
Just don't small talk, okay?

213
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:43,549
Johnny?

214
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,123
I like talking to Busey.

215
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,866
The tortoise, the hare
and the millionaire.

216
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:50,928
It is so good to see you guys.

217
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:54,263
I've had walking pneumonia
for the past couple of weeks.

218
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:55,672
Haven't had any guests.

219
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,864
But for the beginning
of new guests, you are the best.

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,211
Come on in.

221
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:05,311
Come on. Come on.

222
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,629
So, you've come to acquire
my newly-acquired desk.

223
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,976
It's for E as a gift.

224
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,826
Yeah, he's got a sweet new office

225
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,779
and it'll complement
the place perfectly.

226
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,096
There's no way
I'm gonna part with that desk.

227
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:18,733
But, Gary, you said on the phone...

228
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,320
That phone call
was two years ago, Mr. Vince.

229
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,923
Gary, my brother is prepared to pay

230
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,925
whatever he's got to pay
to get that desk.

231
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,427
Easy, Johnny, easy.

232
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,262
Yes, I am willing to pay, Gary,

233
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,553
but let's be reasonable.

234
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,491
You paid 42, I'll give you 50.

235
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,691
Money will bury you, Vince.

236
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:37,990
- Here, sit down.
- Okay, all right.

237
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,179
Let's find harmony in this circle.

238
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,469
Good.

239
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:46,910
Why are you so quiet?

240
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:48,970
You scare me, Gary.

241
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:52,207
It's your reflection in the mirror
that scares you, Turtle.

242
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:54,468
What exactly do you want?

243
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:56,281
I'm planning a series of portraits

244
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:57,977
and I've chosen my next subject.

245
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,684
- You want to paint me?
- No. You don't know pain.

246
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,175
I don't follow.

247
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:08,300
Drama, I've chosen you.

248
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:10,966
You want to paint me?

249
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:14,774
No, I want to paint on you.

250
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,480
Now I don't follow.

251
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,180
This is a statement
of enlightened photography:

252
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:24,588
the unseen faces of the familiar.

253
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:28,051
I painted George Hamilton white.

254
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:31,787
I've taken 230 Ibs off Dom Delouise

255
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,231
by painting him with vertical stripes.

256
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,838
With you, I will paint you

257
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,961
to bring out your beauty and your truth.

258
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,401
- Good luck.
- So what do you say, Johnny?

259
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,671
I don't know, bro.
I got tiny pores.

260
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:47,110
It could suffocate me.

261
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,378
Only denial will suffocate you.

262
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,005
Come on, Drama. It's for E.

263
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:56,505
- It's for E.
- And for immortality.

264
00:11:58,202 --> 00:11:59,919
"Daily Variety" ad sales,
can I help you?

265
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,134
Hi. I'd like to take out an ad in
tomorrow's paper announcing my company.

266
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,457
Okay, no problem.
I need the name of your business.

267
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,305
The Murphy group.

268
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:08,908
The Murphy group.

269
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,596
Yeah, you like that?

270
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:12,716
It's okay.
What do you do?

271
00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:14,399
I represent Vincent Chase.

272
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:16,235
I liked <i>Aquaman</i>.

273
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,137
- Cool.
- But according to the Sag database,

274
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:20,105
Ari Gold represents Vincent Chase.

275
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,640
Well, I'm his manager.

276
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:23,948
Oh, that's nice.
Who else do you represent?

277
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,940
- Just Vince.
- So why the group?

278
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,394
I thought it sounded good.
What, it doesn't?

279
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:32,111
If there was a group it might.

280
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:34,509
Well, whatever.
I'm gonna go with the group.

281
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:36,043
What do you want the ad to say?

282
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:37,958
"The Murphy group

283
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,138
is proud
to be representing Vincent Chase. "

284
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,106
Okay, but we need confirmation

285
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,903
that you actually manage Vincent
Chase before we can use his name.

286
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:47,699
- <i>What kind of confirmation?</i>
- Cient management papers, perhaps.

287
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:50,566
- I don't have those.
- You represent him with no papers?

288
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,373
- Yes.
- Do you think that's smart?

289
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:55,689
Look, what else can I do to confirm?

290
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,718
You can have Ari Gold's office call us,
'cause we know who he is.

291
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:03,776
Look, whatever. You know what?

292
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:05,802
I'll get some papers
or something, thank you.

293
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:08,487
Freak.

294
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:16,739
Shut the fuck up! I've heard enough
out of both of you today. Lloyd, go.

295
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:19,535
You guys shod've had
this out in the carpool in.

296
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,530
We don't carpool.
We live on opposite sides of town.

297
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,336
Really?
'Cause I would've pictured you two

298
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:27,573
living in the same condo together in,
like, bunk beds with a little racecar...

299
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:29,839
Shut up! Don't say another word!

300
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:32,307
Pretend like you're afraid of me, okay?

301
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,382
Because I'm feeling
very insecure right now.

302
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,247
I'm trying to understand

303
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,075
what I did wrong to allow you two
to fuck with my focus

304
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:42,321
on a day
when I need to be on my A game.

305
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:44,199
On a day, when, if I'm not,

306
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,007
we could see M. J.
hip and hop her way

307
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:48,633
back to I.C.M.

308
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:50,826
And if that were to happen, best case,

309
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,731
you two are managers in the Valley.

310
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:56,668
Worst case, you're a freak show
performing at the Santa Monica pier.

311
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,045
Now, with that in mind,
tell me

312
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:01,498
why in God's name

313
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,318
is this happening?!

314
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,948
He fucked my wife, Ari.

315
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,313
He did not!

316
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:15,562
You... You did?

317
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:17,216
You fucked his wife?

318
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,418
As you?

319
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,919
- What?
- Did you pretend to be him?

320
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,202
Or did she actually fuck you
thinking you were you?

321
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:31,179
- You think this is funny?
- No! I think it's disgusting.

322
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:33,639
I'm just...
I'm trying to figure out

323
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,901
why she did that.
I mean, if I were to cheat on my wife

324
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:38,883
it would be with like a,
you know, busty blonde

325
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:40,512
or an Asian with pointy nipples.

326
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,286
But an exact fucking replica...

327
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,249
Stop, Ari.
Ari, we get it, okay?

328
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,379
We're sorry and we will work it out.

329
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,867
- There's nothing to work out.
- See what I'm dealing with?

330
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,746
- You see this?
- Shut up, shut up. Lloyd!

331
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,826
- Accounting just brought this up.
- All right.

332
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:55,812
Look, as repulsed as I am

333
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,076
by the fact that you fucked
your twin brother's wife,

334
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:00,516
it's not my problem.

335
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:02,440
Fucking your coworker's wife...

336
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,757
That is.

337
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,470
But now I've got a bigger problem.

338
00:15:06,763 --> 00:15:10,142
- Please tell me that you are Jeff.
- I'm Jim.

339
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,579
How can anyone tell you two apart?

340
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:14,875
- I wear a windsor knot.
- What does it matter?!

341
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:18,524
Has outearned you...

342
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,411
significantly for the past three years.

343
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,120
- So, you won't fire him?
- Buddy, listen to me.

344
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,096
I run a business here, not the U.N.

345
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,926
Clearly, you two will never
be able to work together again.

346
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,040
So, what?
You're gonna fire me?

347
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:32,713
You're leaving me no choice.

348
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:38,965
You know what?
Fuck you!

349
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:40,652
And fuck you!

350
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,628
Hey, you did what you had to do.

351
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:47,874
- It's about the numbers...
- Get out of my face.

352
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,154
Go back to work.
You make me sick.

353
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:54,594
The curse of the multiples is over.

354
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,877
Bring a power bar
so I can carb up for M. J.

355
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,343
Please, Gary, do you
have to throw it at me?

356
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,116
You want him in close,
working you over with brushes?

357
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:20,792
We'll get to the details later.

358
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:27,111
Keep your eyes straight, please.
Don't look at the paint.

359
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,649
The paint will be on you soon.

360
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,253
Looking good, Johnny.

361
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:41,883
I just talked to the store,
E will have the desk this afternoon.

362
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,988
Yeah, great. Well, he better love it

363
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:46,886
or you're paying for my therapy.

364
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:48,898
Therapy will let you down.

365
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:51,010
This...

366
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,954
is your therapy.

367
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,633
What do you mean you need confirmation?
You are the confirmation.

368
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:00,083
You need to tell Mr. Chase
that the Screen Actor's Guild

369
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:02,021
requires him to update his forms.

370
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:04,020
Update his forms?
He doesn't open his mail!

371
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,672
<i>Sir, please calm down.</i>

372
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,086
You know what? Forget it.
I'll call back.

373
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,415
Tell me you're not the idiot
that's been calling "Variety"

374
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,507
- trying to take out an ad.
- This isn't happening.

375
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:17,304
You really think if someone calls
the press and throws Vince's name

376
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:20,078
- I'm not gonna hear about it?
- I'm not trying to keep it a secret.

377
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:22,577
- I'm trying to get my name out there.
- By taking out an ad?

378
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,029
You're the fucking roto-rooter man?

379
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:25,799
You want your name out there,
you call me.

380
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:27,358
Now that I have you on the phone,

381
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:28,997
I'd like my name out there a little bit.

382
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,272
Ask me nicely.

383
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,946
Go to "Variety,". Ask for Jackie Stone.
She'll be there till 4:00.

384
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,992
<i>She'll do a press release on you,
ask you a couple of questions,</i>

385
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,326
<i>write a few sentences.
Will take you 20 minutes tops</i>

386
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:41,741
<i>and it won't cost you a dime.</i>

387
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:44,769
- Thanks, shauna.
- Where's my fucking kid?

388
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,074
He threw up on me.

389
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:50,876
Relax, Christy.

390
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:53,043
I'm sure he's not
the first guy to puke on you.

391
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:57,148
- It's time, Ari! It's time!
- Calm, Lloyd.

392
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,151
Miss Mary J. Blige
just got off the elevator.

393
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:01,375
- Be cool, Lloyd, be cool.
- I can't be cool.

394
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,104
Feel my beating heart.

395
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:05,460
She's a chick, Lloyd.
There may be hope for you yet.

396
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,002
- Hey.
- There she is.

397
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:08,532
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

398
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:09,941
- I'm great.
- You look stunning.

399
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,896
Thank you.
You pick out that suit just for me?

400
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:13,371
Actually, my wife did. You like?

401
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,530
You smell nice.

402
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:20,031
- Everyone, this is miss Mary J. Blige!
- Hey! Thank you.

403
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:22,457
I'm excited to be here.
Thank you.

404
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:24,955
Let's get started.

405
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:26,365
Let's do it.

406
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:30,845
Ari, where's Jim?

407
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:39,940
Hey, fellas. We just got the message.
What's the problem?

408
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:42,174
This thing
will never get up to that office.

409
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:45,432
No way. The stairwell is too narrow
and it won't fit in the elevator.

410
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:48,331
You can't just jack it up
through the window?

411
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,972
Turtle, we couldn't fit
you through that window.

412
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:53,425
What are you, a smurf?

413
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:55,693
That's funny, wiseass.

414
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:56,931
I thought so.

415
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,199
Sorry, Vince.
It's a one-piece desk.

416
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:01,169
The only way you getting
that bad boy up there

417
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:03,525
is if you cut a hole in the roof
and helicopter it in.

418
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:04,993
How much would that cost?

419
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,077
It's a joke, smurf.

420
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,033
Any other suggestions?

421
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:11,830
Return the desk
and get your money back.

422
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,238
Man, it's too nice
for this shithole, anyway.

423
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,342
So you haven't
had an office until now?

424
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:18,710
I really haven't needed one.

425
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,472
We've had so much space
at Vince's house,

426
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,497
but now we're all living
in a small condo, so...

427
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:23,719
You guys live together?

428
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:26,669
But it's not like that.
We've been friends since we were kids.

429
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:29,465
We're like brothers. Probably don't need
to write that down though.

430
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:31,402
Oh no, it's an interesting story.

431
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:33,507
Maybe we could do something bigger...

432
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,885
A little profile.
Do you have time for a photo?

433
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:37,919
Yeah, sure.

434
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,256
I didn't even know that you knew Jim.

435
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:43,030
I know all my people, Ari.
And Jim's really sweet.

436
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,195
Did you know he sends a personal
handwritten note out with every script?

437
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:47,648
I did not know that, no.

438
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:48,991
It's a nice touch.

439
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:52,738
You know what?
We're gonna get Jeff calligraphy lessons

440
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,943
and now he's gonna be
the one that's sweet to you.

441
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,721
No, please.
keep Jeff away from me.

442
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,658
He's weird
and he's always staring at my ass.

443
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,948
Jeff? No, he has a lazy eye.

444
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:03,806
- That's probably what you're seeing.
- Either way, I like Jim.

445
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:06,778
- Did you really have to fire him?
- Unfortunately, I did, yeah.

446
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,117
- Why? What happened?
- You...

447
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:10,966
The less you know,
the better, believe me.

448
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:13,410
If I were to tell you all the
details, it would sicken you.

449
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,158
- Sounds bad.
- It is, it is.

450
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:17,866
Believe me,
I take no great pleasure

451
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:20,048
in firing anyone, but...
Especially someone

452
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:22,117
that's had such
a positive impact on you.

453
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,140
Anyway, Ari, thank you.

454
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:26,375
- Good stuff in there today.
- Yes, you too...

455
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,163
- Hey, Mary J.
- Hey, Jim, how you doing?

456
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:30,502
- Let's go back to the office.
- Wait wait. No no no!

457
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:32,660
- Did he tell you that he fired me?
- Listen,

458
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,795
you don't have to air out
your dirty laundry here.

459
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:36,998
Oh, would that be
the my-brother-fucks-my-wife-

460
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:40,300
and-because-he-earns more-for-you
you-fire-me dirty laundry, asshole?

461
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,555
One love, Mary.

462
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,116
You're an animal, Ari.

463
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:52,213
- Did you see M.J. off?
- I saw her off, all right, Lloyd.

464
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,468
Off to I.C.M.

465
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:57,629
Ari, you got it right.

466
00:20:58,646 --> 00:20:59,857
What the hell?

467
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:03,358
How can one embryo
produce two fucking losers?

468
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:05,882
- What's the problem?
- The problem is...

469
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:07,533
You're a disgusting mutant.

470
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:09,801
Now go reconjoin with your brother

471
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,646
on the unemployment line!

472
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:22,008
I don't know
what you're freaking out about, E.

473
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:23,880
I went in there
to write a few sentences,

474
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,752
and they ambushed me
with a whole expose.

475
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:27,816
I wasn't ready for it.
Hit "refresh," Turtle.

476
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,204
Nothing.

477
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:31,931
The new "Variety"
comes up at 10:00 p.m.

478
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:34,209
Yeah, well, it's 9:59
and it's not up yet.

479
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:35,838
- Hit "refresh."
- Relax, E.

480
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:37,225
It's just a little press.

481
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,748
It's his first real press,
he's nervous.

482
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,382
Yeah, I remember my first piece
of press... <i>Back Stage West</i>.

483
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:45,701
I couldn't get an audition
to save my life

484
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:48,767
until my groundbreaking role as Lenny.

485
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,914
Headline on page 14 read

486
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:54,111
"Of mice and the man
known as Johnny Chase."

487
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,316
Did they dub you "candlelight dinner
theater's biggest and best retard"?

488
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,218
"Refresh," Turtle.

489
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,250
It's up.

490
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:03,819
They got a picture, E.

491
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,372
- Good photo.
- You look cute.

492
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:07,838
What's the headline say?

493
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:10,602
"The new nepotism in Hollywood. "

494
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:12,603
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You know, I knew it!

495
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:15,069
I knew it! I'm so...
I'm so pissed right now.

496
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:17,050
- Sorry, E.
- What's wrong with nepotism?

497
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,399
Hey, Vince, are you coming?

498
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:28,320
Who's that?

499
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,301
"A new trend is infiltrating

500
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,767
"the already-impenetrable
popular table of hollywood. "

501
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,255
- You already read this.
- It sounds worse on real paper.

502
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:38,794
Now the whole city's reading it.

503
00:22:38,926 --> 00:22:41,789
"Eric Murphy has paved the way
for those like Casey Cobb,

504
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:43,718
childhood friend of Jessica Simpson,

505
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:45,397
to come and surf the wave of celebrity

506
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:47,335
in hopes of becoming
a permanent fixture

507
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:49,008
in the business of the business."

508
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,750
You're paving the way, that's a plus.

509
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,951
- Who cares, E, huh?
- Yeah, who cares?

510
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,581
No press is bad press.

511
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,177
- Where are we going?
- To cheer you up.

512
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,779
I just want to get back in the office,
figure out a way to repair the damage.

513
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,863
You're gonna need a new desk to repair
the damages. We got you a new desk.

514
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:04,964
You got me a desk?

515
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:07,713
This is it.

516
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:11,474
You like?

517
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:13,874
Yeah, I love it.
It's never gonna fit in my office.

518
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:16,185
Actually, E, it already does.

519
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:19,334
This is your office, E.

520
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:22,069
- And that's mine over there.
- And mine's over there.

521
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,072
and I got one too,
just in case we miss you.

522
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,011
- We can all hang.
- Building a sick lounge out there

523
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:30,204
- with a huge huge plasma.
- How much was this place, Vince?

524
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,375
E, you can't put a price on comfort.

525
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:33,850
Just enjoy it.

526
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,723
Thanks, Vince.
Now I feel really worthless.

527
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:42,704
Speaking.

528
00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:45,280
Hey, Peter Jackson
calling from New Zealand.

529
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:48,462
Hi.
Thanks for getting back to me.

530
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:49,956
Would have called you yesterday,

531
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:52,180
but no one down here
knew who the hell you were.

532
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:55,040
<i>Eric Murphy... now you're not
related to Eddie by any chance?</i>

533
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:57,286
- Well, I'm not.
- Just a little wind-up, mate.

534
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,025
Look, I saw the "Variety" article.

535
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,112
- Yeah?
- Hey, don't worry.

536
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,273
A little media bashing
every now and again

537
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:04,506
keeps us all honest.

538
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,104
But I'll tell you
something about Ari Gold:

539
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,561
<i>There's only one thing
a cretin like that understands</i>

540
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:12,175
and that's an airborne telephone
right between the eyes.

541
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:14,557
<i>anyway, it's good to know
that those of us</i>

542
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:16,488
that want to be
in the Vincent Chase business

543
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,614
have got a legitimate manager
to talk to.

544
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:19,825
Thank you.

545
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,538
So, look, I'm actually kind of busy.

546
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:23,024
So what exactly do you want?

547
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:25,269
I wanted to talk to you about
your gaming company.

548
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:28,051
Well, I'm actually gonna
be in the States next week.

549
00:24:28,456 --> 00:24:32,177
Why don't we have your
assistant call my assistant

550
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:33,984
<i>and then decide
what to do from there?</i>

551
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:35,944
- <i>How does that sound?</i>
- Great.

552
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,628
- Thank you.
- <i>Cheers.</i>

553
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:40,471
- What was that?
- I think I'm gonna need an assistant.
