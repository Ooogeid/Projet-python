00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:23,400
In Box Office News Martin
Scorsese's "Gatsby" is at the top,

6
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:27,187
hauling in an impressive
$37.8 million

7
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,640
and earning rave reviews
for its star Vinnie Chase.

8
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,977
In other news, Britney Spears
has a new boyfriend-- meet Rocky.

9
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:37,530
Yes, Rocky. That's the name
of Britney's new dog...

10
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,841
- Hello?
- I'm still tingling from the weekend.

11
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,550
- Who is it?
- It's Ari. It's okay, go back to sleep.

12
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:47,673
Wow, you pay for that or is there someone
that would actually bang you for free?

13
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,210
What's going on, Ari?
You just calling to recap?

14
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,422
No, I got a late-night email.

15
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,903
Darabont just got hit
with a monsoon on Malta.

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,172
- Jesus, is he all right?
- He's fine, but the sets aren't.

17
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,091
They're gonna push
"Ferrari" 12 weeks.

18
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,785
What are we supposed
to do for 12 weeks?

19
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:00,949
Enjoy life, what else?

20
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,840
And snap some below-the-belt
photos of that partner of yours

21
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,809
and send them over here.
I am bored.

22
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,420
- You wish. Later.
- Later.

23
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,681
- You're bored?
- It was a joke, baby.

24
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,758
You know I'm never bored here.
Now gimme something.

25
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:14,743
What time is it?

26
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,373
I don't know,
my cock doesn't wear a watch.

27
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,007
Ari!

28
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:19,956
Jesus Christ,
what time is it?

29
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,375
That's the home line. No one
calls me on the home line, baby.

30
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:25,094
Oh my god, I hope
it's not my father!

31
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,197
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Marlo.

32
00:02:28,297 --> 00:02:30,917
I'm sorry to bother you so late,
but I don't know where Andrew is.

33
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,900
He's never not come
home before midnight

34
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,371
and I don't know.
Does Ari know anything maybe?

35
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:38,139
Hold on just a second.
It's Marlo.

36
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:39,972
Andrew's not home.
Do you know where he is?

37
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:42,712
Clients, meetings...
eating,

38
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:45,559
signing-- What?
I don't know.

39
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:47,706
I'm sorry, Marlo.
He doesn't know.

40
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:50,270
No, it's okay.
I'm sorry to have woken you.

41
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,555
Please, don't worry about it.

42
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:55,025
And please call us as soon
as you hear from him.

43
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,909
I will, thanks.

44
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,113
I hope something
didn't happen.

45
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,656
- I'm sure he's fine.
- Why are you so sure?

46
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:05,085
- What?
- Is Andrew having an affair?

47
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:09,422
The guy is missing...
And your first instinct is to say--

48
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,407
He could be lying
in a ditch somewhere.

49
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:13,631
I got a weird feeling
when we were out with him.

50
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:16,346
Baby, Andrew Klein
is a true family man.

51
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,015
He is the last guy in the
world to have an affair.

52
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,934
Besides me.

53
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,041
So what am I gonna
do for the next three months?

54
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,543
- Whatever you want, bro.
- I wanted to get back to work.

55
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,546
- You could come to class with me.
- I don't want to do schoolwork.

56
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,482
- You could travel.
- True. How about Paris?

57
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,050
- With who?
- You guys.

58
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,100
Four dudes in Paris
is not quite

59
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,371
the "Last Tango" moment
I think you're looking for, bro.

60
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,657
- I always wanted to see the pyramids.
- In Paris?!

61
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,927
Morocco, you idiot. Maybe you
want to add a geography class.

62
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,497
I knew that, Drama.
I thought Vince was confused.

63
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,000
- You guys want to hit the mideast?
- I'd love to, bro.

64
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,800
You know nothing turns me on
like a tan chick in a burka.

65
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,088
But I got work
and it's a big week.

66
00:03:58,188 --> 00:04:00,663
Johnny Chase is about
to get a love interest.

67
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:03,176
- Mail-order bride?
- On the show, wiseass.

68
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,207
And don't be bitter just
because I'll be spending the day

69
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:09,395
test-driving the lips of some
of Hollywood's finest actresses

70
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,258
- to find my match.
- We won't be bitter-- but they might.

71
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:15,031
Insults from a man who's being taken
back-to-school shopping

72
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,383
by his starlet girlfriend.

73
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:19,943
I'm sorry I got an actress who's
not just my pretend girlfriend.

74
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,278
Okay okay, these two are out,
but you and me...

75
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,581
- We're free to travel the globe.
- No, I'm not.

76
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,315
- Why not?
- Because I've got to work.

77
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:28,585
- On what?
- What are you so busy with?

78
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,072
- The business.
- Come on, E, what do you really have to do?

79
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,541
I got a stack of scripts to read.
I got-- I got demo reels.

80
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,826
- I got-- I got--
- Are you guys kidding me?

81
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,874
Remember when you guys used
to make fun of me like this?

82
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:39,934
Yeah, that made sense.

83
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,620
Wow, I got all the money in
the world and all the free time

84
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,334
- and no one to play with. You guys suck!
- Sorry, Vin.

85
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:48,421
- Sorry, bro.
- No, it's okay. You go better yourself, Turtle.

86
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,173
- Hi, guys.
- Hello. Hey, Nikki.

87
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:51,825
- How's it going?
- Hey, Nikki,

88
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,060
- what are you doing today?
- Working.

89
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,513
Too bad.
I was hoping we could hang.

90
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:59,099
I can see if someone
can cover my shift.

91
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,885
A true friend.

92
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,690
Andrew Klein!

93
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,044
Where the hell is Andrew Klein?

94
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,529
Conference room.

95
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,448
This department,
believe it or not,

96
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,457
in this economy is
up staggering--

97
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,319
Everybody out!

98
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:21,721
Except you. Quickly, go.

99
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,340
Last one out's out of a job.
Let's go!

100
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,095
- What's up, Ari?
- Your wife called my wife.

101
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,864
- What?
- Last night

102
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,626
your wife called my wife
looking for you.

103
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:35,051
- Really?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,353
I was out.
I was trying to sign Aaron Sorkin.

105
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:40,622
At 1:00 am?
He is sober now, so bullshit.

106
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,210
Okay.

107
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:46,546
I was with Lizzie.

108
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,898
- I know.
- But I was ending it.

109
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,868
- Don't you dare lie to me.
- On the life of my kids, Ari.

110
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,237
I thought about my family,
my career-- I ended it.

111
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:56,575
You put me
in a really bad spot.

112
00:05:56,744 --> 00:05:59,709
I lied to my wife.
15 years, I've been faithful.

113
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:02,405
I don't want the stress of an
affair without the fun of the pussy.

114
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:04,180
It's over, Ari!

115
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:06,766
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,525
- You okay?
- Yeah.

117
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,495
What about Lizzie?
How'd she take it?

118
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:15,990
She's okay, you know,
she's a career gal.

119
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,643
- She doesn't want to screw this up.
- Good.

120
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,212
- I was serious about Sorkin.
- You signed him?

121
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,381
- I'm working on it.
- He say anything about me?

122
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,351
He still hates your guts.

123
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,001
Listen, we got
Schwimmer today.

124
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,904
- I want him back on the tube.
- I'll do my best.

125
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:31,030
Do better than that.

126
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:35,200
- Hey, Jane.
- Mr. Murphy.

127
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:37,569
- Any calls?
- No.

128
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:40,965
Oh, actually, DirectTV called.

129
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:43,463
- Your high-def channels are in.
- Cool.

130
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,086
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

131
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:19,454
Hi, I'm an actor
and this is my reel.

132
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,585
Jesus.

133
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:28,896
- Yeah?
- Ashley Brooks is on the phone.

134
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,949
- Oh great, put her through.
- Yeah.

135
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:35,750
- Hello!
- Hey, what are you doing?

136
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,327
- Working away.
- I wanted to see if you wanted to have lunch.

137
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:41,955
- Yeah, totally. You ready now?
- It's 10:00.

138
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,428
- Yeah, I guess it is.
- You miss me, don't you?

139
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:48,659
- Maybe.
- Well, I'm bored anyway.

140
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:50,584
- Can you get out?
- I'm the boss, Eric.

141
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,420
I can do what I want.
I'll see you in a few.

142
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:53,997
See you in a few.

143
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,066
Hello, ladies.

144
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:02,186
It's a pleasure to see you all today.

145
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:04,324
Johnny Chase. A pleasure.

146
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:05,778
Hi there. Johnny Chase.

147
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,323
How's everything?
Ready?

148
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,770
Not too nervous, I hope?
Don't be.

149
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,800
We're gonna have fun.
But we may do this a few times,

150
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:16,879
so... get your chapstick ready.

151
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,367
- Timmy!
- Hey, Johnny, thanks for coming in.

152
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:26,383
No, Timmy, thank you.
Thank Eddie Burns.

153
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:30,158
Thank everyone, really. For three
years I've wanted nothing more

154
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:33,217
than to show my range with a solid
female character to play off of.

155
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:36,652
- Now I believe I can do that.
- Love the confidence.

156
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:38,433
We should have done this
a long time ago.

157
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:41,204
We talked about it, but the
network was resistant to the idea.

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,221
- Really, why?
- They didn't think the audience

159
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,148
would believe you could get laid.

160
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,578
I'm kidding.
Drama, I'm kidding.

161
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:51,818
Timbo-- you!

162
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:53,440
But seriously,
keep it in the gym

163
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:55,764
because the network wants
more sexy this season less flan.

164
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:57,952
I'll do 24 eps shirtless.

165
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,635
Okay, good.
Let's bring in the first girl.

166
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:04,681
- Let's.
- Everybody, this is Megan.

167
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,390
Hi, Megan. A pleasure.

168
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,981
Hi, Megan. Action!

169
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:23,446
Cut! Thank you.

170
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,916
Next!

171
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,001
- I feel weird.
- You look cute.

172
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:47,623
- I look like Chuck Bass.
- You've been paying attention.

173
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,688
- Yeah.
- If you want to be taken seriously at school,

174
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,638
you gotta look serious.

175
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,703
- Somewhat serious.
- Thank you.

176
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:59,196
I thought you turned that off.

177
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:02,400
It might have popped back on
in my pocket. Oh, it's Vince.

178
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:05,604
- Yo, Vince, what up?
- Nothing. I'm bored.

179
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,225
I called you three times,
you didn't pick up.

180
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,774
Jamie made me shut it off
so I could focus on clothes.

181
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,327
- Which he still won't do.
- What happened to Nikki?

182
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,750
- Her friend could only cover one shift.
- You wanna come hang with us?

183
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,782
Vince, you know I love you,

184
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,986
but this guy hates to shop and I have
been trying to get him clothes for a week,

185
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,000
so please just give me a couple of
hours and then he's all yours, okay?

186
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:27,806
All right, you got it. No worries. I'm
sure I can find some way to amuse myself.

187
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,889
I'm sure you will.
Goodbye.

188
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,164
- Okay, let's go find pants.
- Okay.

189
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:38,300
- Sure you can't stay?
- Yeah, I gotta go back to work.

190
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,716
- I can come back later.
- I don't know what I'm doing later.

191
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:43,885
Could it be better than this?

192
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,182
Probably not.

193
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:52,840
- Well?
- I'm down six lbs.

194
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,585
- Wow.
- Does it show?

195
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,621
Yes, Lloyd, you're half
the man you used to be.

196
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,873
And you were only half a man
when you started, so bravo.

197
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,220
- What happens when I make weight?
- When you're actually presentable in public,

198
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,988
your real training will begin.

199
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,346
- Ari?
- Yes!

200
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:05,848
Can I talk to you for a moment?

201
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:07,573
Sure, if you remind who you are.

202
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:10,468
- Lizzie Grant, Ari.
- From the TV department.

203
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,693
TV people usually don't
make it this far west.

204
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:15,122
Could I just have one minute?

205
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,525
Sure. Lloyd, close the door.

206
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:21,436
Thank you.

207
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:25,249
- What is this about?
- I need to apologize.

208
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,690
I don't even know you,
so I can't imagine

209
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,857
what you could possibly have
to apologize to me about.

210
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:31,818
I know you know
about Andrew and me, Ari.

211
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:36,463
- I thought it was over.
- It is.

212
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,167
- So what's to know?
- I thought I owed you an explanation.

213
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:42,783
What you owe me is
two weeks of my life back!

214
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:45,964
I am very sorry.
It was a stupid mistake.

215
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:49,405
"It was a stupid mistake."
That is your explanation?

216
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,450
Then coming in here
was even stupider.

217
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:54,662
- Okay, what can I do?
- Your job, and do it well.

218
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,623
I work hard, Ari.
This hasn't affected my job.

219
00:11:57,658 --> 00:12:00,914
- It has affected my perception of your job.
- That's not fair.

220
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,442
Well, life isn't fair
so don't fucking cry about it.

221
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:06,124
- I don't cry.
- If this isn't over, it's only a matter of time

222
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:09,444
before this office and the whole
town's perception of you changes.

223
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,151
- Then I will make up for it.
- Good, start today

224
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,103
in the meeting with Schwimmer.
Do your job, nothing else.

225
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:16,721
Not a problem.

226
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,717
Lloyd, come in here.

227
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,491
- Yes, Mr. Gold?
- I want you to keep an eye on Andrew Klein.

228
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:27,465
- Keep my eyes on him how?
- Pretend he's Zac Efron's ball sack.

229
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:30,556
And find me if you spot
anything strange.

230
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:40,141
- Yeah?
- Mr. Murphy, Ashley is here to see you.

231
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,510
Okay, send her in.

232
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,771
- Well, hello, Mr. Murphy!
- Hello there.

233
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,753
- What's with the fossil?
- Shhh.

234
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,972
- She's nice.
- Well, my grandmother is nice

235
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,392
but I wouldn't hire her to be the first face
people see when they come to my business.

236
00:12:57,426 --> 00:13:00,306
- Don't be mean.
- I'm sorry.

237
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,864
- The place is great.
- Thank you.

238
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,554
I can see why you get bored
here all by yourself though.

239
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,915
- I don't get bored.
- Well, lonely then.

240
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,905
Maybe a little.

241
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:14,133
- Well, I brought you a present.
- Really? What's the occasion?

242
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,534
I didn't want my employees thinking
I was slacking, so I told them

243
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,567
I had a potential buyer's meeting.

244
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:20,239
Thank you very much.

245
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:23,737
- This is nice.
- Is it safe to sit here?

246
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,837
- Safe?
- I don't know.

247
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,507
I don't want to sit somewhere where one
of your other girls has "visited" you.

248
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:31,893
- Oh, come on, I don't do that.
- Never?

249
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,123
No! I work here.

250
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,980
So you want to go to lunch?

251
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,560
- It's still early.
- So what do you want to do?

252
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:41,261
- You.
- Jane is right outside that door.

253
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,605
- What, could she even hear?
- Yes!

254
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,775
- With the way you scream?
- I'll hold back.

255
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,784
Okay, cut! Great.

256
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,985
Shirley, that was excellent.
Thank you.

257
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,755
Yeah, thank you, Shirley.
Great stuff, great stuff.

258
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,090
Bravo.

259
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:05,310
- What did you think, Drama?
- I thought she sucked.

260
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:07,212
- I thought they all sucked.
- All right, calm down.

261
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,963
Where are we getting
these girls from anyway?

262
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,300
We put a call out to all
the modeling agencies.

263
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,371
Models?!

264
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,220
- That's what this was-- a model search?
- The network wants a model.

265
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,223
Am I the only one
who was horrified?

266
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,507
I had zero chemistry
with these "models."

267
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,393
Do you know why? Because they
could be out-acted by lint.

268
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,411
- But they're sexy.
- So what?

269
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,198
I made out with 15 of them-- not
one of them made me draw wood.

270
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,653
You know why?
Because I'm attracted to talent.

271
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,988
Maybe the storyline
just isn't working.

272
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:35,873
What?
No, no, Timmy, Timmy,

273
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,159
It works great. We just gotta
get a real actress in here.

274
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,462
- I'll call Eddie Burns.
- No, no, no.

275
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:42,607
I'll call Eddie Burns.
In fact,

276
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:45,200
I'll go visit Eddie Burns,
face to face.

277
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,636
No, you made
all the right moves.

278
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,806
I know that you love
the directing thing,

279
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,741
I know you love doing
the theater thing,

280
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:56,010
but I think that
this is the right time

281
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:59,514
- to get back into TV.
- Look, I'm not totally ruling it out.

282
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:01,850
It's just if I'm going
to do another series,

283
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,986
it's gotta be something fresh,
it's gotta be something original.

284
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,229
And the stuff I'm hearing,
I'm just not loving.

285
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,508
No worries. We'll just keep telling you
stuff until you hear something you love.

286
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,428
Okay, let's go.
Trish, what do you got?

287
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:16,400
"Out There."
It's a traditional family sitcom.

288
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:19,967
You'd play a neurotic funny dad
who captains his entire family

289
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,369
on a cruise around the world.

290
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:24,081
Wow, so it's kind of like
"Raymond" meets "The Love Boat."

291
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:25,373
- Yes!
- Oh, cool.

292
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:28,276
Or I just shoot myself
in the fucking face right now.

293
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,134
Don't you dare touch that punim,
David Schwimmer, my favorite "Friend."

294
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:34,291
Wow, this is a first.
Remember when I signed here

295
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,018
how you said you'd be
in all my meetings?

296
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:36,977
Yeah.

297
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,220
- That was a good one.
- What else we got?

298
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,626
- Raj, what do you got?
- "Neurosis."

299
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:44,766
It's about a neurotic guy
who is allergic to everything.

300
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:46,624
It's really funny.

301
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,064
They want Pamela Anderson for
the hot neighbor with a cat...

302
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,168
Who may or may not talk.

303
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,989
Do you guys validate?

304
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,774
No. All right, Lizzie, go ahead.

305
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:03,012
Personally, David, I would like
to see you do something different.

306
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,092
We all know you can play neurotic, but
you're kind of this big strapping guy.

307
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:11,720
"Guys in Blue."
It's a detective show,

308
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,474
but it's half hour
single-camera.

309
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:17,458
It's a comedy with edge and
you wouldn't be the pushover.

310
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,978
In fact, you would
kind of be the jerk.

311
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,348
But it's really funny and it has a
lot more heart than you would expect.

312
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,228
- We haven't met yet, have we?
- No. Hi.

313
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,604
- David, this is Lizzie grant, new junior agent.
- Sorry.

314
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,139
- Lizzie? Hi.
- Yeah, hi.

315
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:33,675
- We actually spoke on the phone once.
- We did?

316
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:36,110
Oh, right right!
You're from chicago.

317
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:37,845
- Yes!
- She went to northwestern.

318
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,198
- Come on, seriously?
- Yeah.

319
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,268
You actually gave the commencement
speech at my graduation.

320
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,561
- It was really good.
- Oh, thank you.

321
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:47,789
I worked really hard on that.

322
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:49,657
Of course you did.
You're David Schwimmer.

323
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:53,143
- You work hard on everything.
- I didn't picture you like this from your voice.

324
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,015
- Yeah, I get that a lot.
- No, I mean, not that you have a weird voice.

325
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,851
It's just... I mean,
you have a lovely voice.

326
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,914
Oh, thank you.

327
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:09,394
Well, this is officially awkward.

328
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,095
You know what, Andrew, Ari?

329
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,870
I really appreciate all
of your time and your ideas,

330
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:18,219
especially you, Raj,
but I think Lizzie really--

331
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:20,488
Really is getting
what I'm going for,

332
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:22,640
so why don't we
just break this up?

333
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,853
And, Lizzie, why don't
you and I grab some lunch,

334
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,037
talk about it some more?

335
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:28,463
That is a great idea.
You guys go grab some lunch--

336
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:31,933
- I don't know why they just can't stay here.
- Because I'm starving

337
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:35,420
and you're boring.

338
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,505
- Lizzie, why don't we take a drive to the beach?
- Yeah, sounds great.

339
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,858
- You guys enjoy yourselves.
- Thanks.

340
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,559
Have a good meeting.

341
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,050
Hi, I can't believe you
were there for that speech.

342
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,312
- What kind of name is Kanarchy?
- That's her last name.

343
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:53,186
- No, it's Kanarchy Lewis.
- I have no idea.

344
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:54,788
- This is awful.
- Tell me about it.

345
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,991
I've read 10 scripts this week.
They're all awful.

346
00:17:57,026 --> 00:18:00,240
Good thing you have Vince. You don't
really have to read any of these.

347
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:02,306
- Mr. Murphy?
- Yeah?

348
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:04,164
It's locked.

349
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,855
Well, I'm working!
What's up?

350
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,359
Don't yell at her.
You'll give her a heart attack.

351
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:10,838
Vince is on the phone.
He insists on talking to you.

352
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:13,291
Okay, put him through.

353
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:15,870
Hello!

354
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,896
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm working. What do you think I'm doing?

355
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,659
- Jane said Ashley's there.
- So?

356
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,137
Nothing.

357
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,992
Hey, how come you're not
on this Facebook thing?

358
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:28,522
- Because I'm an adult. How come you are?
- Nikki showed it to me.

359
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:31,492
I set up my profile and I
already got 74 friend requests.

360
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,349
- Jesus.
- Yeah, it's kind of amazing.

361
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:37,095
- You remember Kimberly Kirsch?
- No.

362
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:40,334
Yeah, neither do I, but apparently
I was her first kiss in fifth grade.

363
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,557
She's got four kids now,
but she still looks hot.

364
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:45,114
- Okay, have fun.
- Hey, you think it's a bad idea

365
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:47,013
if I invite one of
my new friends over?

366
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,676
- Oh, shut up!
- She's really cute.

367
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,123
College grad, lots of
respectable-looking friends,

368
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,263
all of whom say
very nice things about her.

369
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,133
- Vince, please don't get killed!
- I'm playing with you.

370
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,730
Okay. Are you good? Because
I should get back to work.

371
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,411
E, I'm great. And you should
lighten up. Life's good.

372
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:03,824
Just look over at Ashley.

373
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,727
- All right, I'll talk to you later.
- Later.

374
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:08,581
- Everything okay?
- He's happy.

375
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,597
He found Facebook.

376
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:12,533
- And what about you?
- Right now I am.

377
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,286
- I'm glad I could help.
- Maybe we should make this a daily occurrence.

378
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,506
If we made this a daily occurrence,
I'd be working at J Crew

379
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,658
and you'd be managing
the biggest loser.

380
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,194
- Well, at least he's working.
- What's wrong?

381
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,081
Nothing. I just really don't
know what I'm doing here.

382
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:28,790
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

383
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:32,303
I mean that I come here every
day so I feel like I have purpose,

384
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,389
but the truth is last year
Vince's career exploded

385
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,545
and the rest of
my business imploded.

386
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:41,353
- But you have Vince.
- Yeah, but what do I have here in this office?

387
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,564
- Jane?
- Yeah.

388
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,777
You know, I never really knew
how to make this a real business.

389
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:50,115
I was always good at helping Vince move forward,
not very good at helping myself move forward.

390
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,942
But, Eric, you have Vince!
Do you know how lucky you are?

391
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:58,912
Two years ago I was managing a
grocery store to pay my bills.

392
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,882
And you have the freedom
that most people suffer for.

393
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:04,437
Don't take it for granted.

394
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,503
Yeah...

395
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:09,640
So?
What do you really want?

396
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:13,827
I don't know.

397
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:16,497
Hey, buddy,
how'd your lunch go?

398
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:19,485
It was going great till
your new TV head crashed it.

399
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,335
- What?
- Yeah, what a freak.

400
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,904
- We were having such a good time.
- I'm sorry about that, David.

401
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:26,430
I'm sure he was just feeling
protective of a young agent.

402
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:27,379
Bullshit.

403
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,027
He's either fucking her
or he's trying to.

404
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,562
- Isn't he married?
- Yes!

405
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,423
Well, someone should tell him.

406
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:36,426
Anyway, I like her and I like the idea.
We should set up a meeting.

407
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,717
- You got it, man.
- And, you know, Ari, I'm really pissed.

408
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:42,656
I couldn't even eat dessert knowing I
wasn't going to fuck that girl today.

409
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,858
I'm sorry about that.
I'll see you, David.

410
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:46,911
- Mr. Gold, Mr. Gold!
- What, what?!

411
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,170
I think something strange is
happening with Andrew Klein.

412
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,026
Why?

413
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:52,580
Because he's sitting in
his car in the parking garage.

414
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:54,468
- Doing what?
- His back was to me

415
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,003
so I can't be sure, but
he seemed to be... weeping.

416
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,100
- Go lose more weight, Lloyd.
- What?

417
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,972
Go lose more weight.
Now!

418
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,538
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Please please, don't be mad at me.

419
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:28,103
- Don't be mad at you?
- I'm having a meltdown.

420
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:29,703
Are you my friend?

421
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,872
I'm having a meltdown.

422
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:35,262
You're melting me down,
both personally and at work.

423
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:37,297
- No. No, I'm not.
- You're not?

424
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:39,604
You didn't bust in on
the David Schwimmer lunch?

425
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,099
Yes, and Schwimmer
is doing the show!

426
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,852
- He's doing it, Ari!
- He said he was going to do TV?

427
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,479
Yeah yeah, but I couldn't just let
him fuck her. Yes, he's doing TV.

428
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:50,440
And Sorkin is coming in.

429
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,343
Okay? He's right there.

430
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,479
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm killing it for you at work!

431
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,481
You know--

432
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,449
Shit.

433
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,735
And I tried to keep my wife
away from your wife.

434
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,616
- I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
- You said that it was over.

435
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:06,657
I thought it was,
but look at me!

436
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:08,442
Look...

437
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,227
Can you just be my friend?
Tell me what to do.

438
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:18,785
Think about your kids.

439
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,138
Think about
how you want them

440
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,006
to think about their dad.

441
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,877
Do you want them to think that
you spent your life as a liar?

442
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,212
- I'm telling you, they were bush leaguers.
- Drama, please, calm down.

443
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,641
I can't calm down. If you were
there, you'd be freaking out too.

444
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,562
It was awful.

445
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:43,577
Oh, really? Because my wife is friends
with one of the girls that came in--

446
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,164
Stacy-- she said you
made her do 25 takes, man.

447
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,641
Well, I gave them all
a fair look.

448
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:52,019
Look, I'm trying to make
a movie here, all right?

449
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,554
Eddie, I know you've moved on
from our little TV effort,

450
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:56,999
and are content to just
receive a no-show paycheck,

451
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:59,947
but I'm still here, trying to make sure
those paychecks keep coming in for you.

452
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:03,106
And I appreciate that. But
this thing shoots on Thursday

453
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:04,732
and we gotta
lock somebody down, man.

454
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,134
- Do another casting session.
- There's not enough time.

455
00:23:07,198 --> 00:23:09,264
Let's make an offer out
to some known actresses.

456
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:11,483
- A known actress? Like who?
- Natalie Portman.

457
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,656
Get the fuck out of here.
You're not going to get Natalie Portman.

458
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:16,098
- Rachel McAdams.
- Dude, you are clearly lost

459
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:18,440
in another one of your
delusional daydreams.

460
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:21,763
It's one scene in one episode
of a middling NBC drama.

461
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:26,384
Look, I'm sorry, but we're not going
to get a big-name actress for that part.

462
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:31,121
- Come on, Turtle, hurry up.
- I'll be right out.

463
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,361
- Absolutely not!
- Why?

464
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:34,443
For so many reasons.

465
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:36,651
The first one being I don't want
your tongue in my girlfriend's mouth.

466
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:39,246
- It's just acting!
- I know where your tongue's been, Drama,

467
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:41,447
- and I have to act like I'm not horrified.
- Turtle,

468
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:43,209
I've never really
asked you for anything,

469
00:23:43,244 --> 00:23:45,710
'cause you've never really
had anything worth asking for,

470
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,222
but now I'm asking you as
a friend if you would please

471
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:50,242
just ask Jamie if she
would consider it?

472
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:53,717
- I can't do it.
- This is really really important to me, Turtle.

473
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:55,584
Really important, please!

474
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,991
Come on, baby, let's go.
I want to see what you look like.

475
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,659
I'm coming.

476
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:02,653
I love you, Drama,
I just can't. I'm sorry.

477
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,286
- I love that.
- Yeah?

478
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:13,934
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

479
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:15,938
We're gonna
take everything.

480
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:18,592
No, no, no.

481
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,527
- I'm not letting you buy all this.
- It's my pleasure.

482
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:24,304
Besides, you're a student now.
You don't have any money.

483
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,312
Actually, I...

484
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:29,441
- I got a little.
- Where'd you get that?

485
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,525
Vince.

486
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,698
Who is that?

487
00:24:35,377 --> 00:24:36,692
Drama.

488
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:39,392
Everything all right?

489
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:41,776
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

490
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,861
- Hello?
- I thought about what you said.

491
00:24:57,057 --> 00:25:00,051
I don't want to live a lie.
I don't want my kids to see that.

492
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:02,700
- Good.
- I left Marlo, Ari.

493
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,241
I was honest
and straightforward.

494
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:07,308
But it won't affect work.

495
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,773
I wanted you to know.
I'll call you later.

496
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:24,437
- Hello!
- Hi.

497
00:25:24,684 --> 00:25:27,079
Hi, daddy.
What are the flowers for?

498
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:29,368
- They're for mommy.
- Why, what'd you do?

499
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:32,186
Nothing. I wanted to show
her my love. Where is she?

500
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,648
- She's on the phone.
- Thanks, buddy.

501
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:38,492
I don't-- Okay.

502
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:41,806
I am so sorry.
I'll talk to you later.

503
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:44,750
- Hey, honey. What's going on?
- That was Marlo.

504
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:46,817
Andrew left her.

505
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:49,846
- Jesus.
- He said that you advised him to?

506
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:52,024
Baby, let's go to dinner
and we will talk about it.

507
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:53,639
I'd rather not.

508
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:57,525
Daddy's in trouble!
Daddy's in trouble!

509
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:03,026
You think Jessica Alba
would do it if you call her?

510
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:04,341
No.

511
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,402
Any shot you'd call Scarlett Jo?

512
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:09,302
No. Sorry, Johnny.

513
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:13,335
- I understand.
- Hey hey, look at this guy!

514
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,247
- Very nice, Turtle.
- I did good, right?

515
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:19,412
You don't think he looks nice?

516
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,300
Who knew you could find
style in the Husky section?

517
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,578
- That's not nice.
- He's not nice to me.

518
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:26,586
- Why should I be nice to him?
- Oh, yeah?

519
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,063
Loaning out my
girlfriend to you isn't nice?

520
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:31,365
- What?
- He asked me to do the show.

521
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:33,783
And believe me, I could tell
it was a struggle for him.

522
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:36,108
- You asked her?
- It'll help you out, right?

523
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:38,427
You have no idea how much.

524
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:40,681
- It's cool with you, Jamie?
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

525
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:43,141
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
And it's only one day.

526
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:45,786
- Yeah. How many kisses?
- Like four...

527
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:49,001
and the sex scene, but it's network
so it's not gonna be too graphic.

528
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,918
- There's a sex scene now?
- I'm kidding!

529
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,472
This is awesome! Thank you
so much. I appreciate it.

530
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,327
- You're welcome.
- I just can't wait.

531
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:58,365
- Save it.
- Come here, bro.

532
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:00,601
- Thanks a lot. I appreciate that.
- My pleasure.

533
00:27:00,672 --> 00:27:02,967
- You want a beer? I need a beer.
- Yes, now.

534
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,638
- Yo.
- Yo.

535
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:07,247
Everything okay?
What's wrong?

536
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:09,927
- I'm shutting down the business.
- The Murphy Group?

537
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,637
- Yep.
- It wasn't much of a group anyway.

538
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,832
Come on, Johnny.
Why, what happened?

539
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:17,421
The only reason I ever opened the office in
the first place was because I didn't think

540
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:20,415
It'd look good having a guy
manage you from his kitchen.

541
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:22,552
My first manager didn't
even have a kitchen--

542
00:27:22,646 --> 00:27:25,077
A small studio and a hotplate.

543
00:27:25,183 --> 00:27:26,451
E, don't worry
about that.

544
00:27:26,486 --> 00:27:28,400
- If you're happy--
- Well, I'm not.

545
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,472
Is this cause we were making
fun of you this morning?

546
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,462
- We were just kidding.
- No, it's got nothing to do with that.

547
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:34,130
The office is a joke.
I'm okay with it.

548
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:36,396
Great! All right, so sit back
and enjoy some time off.

549
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:39,396
I gotta say,
a little hiatus does a body good.

550
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:42,566
An extended vacation, E, then you
figure out what the next big move is.

551
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:46,770
Hear hear! To little people
who dream of doing big things.

552
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:48,637
- Such a jerk.
- Come on, we'll hit Paris,

553
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:51,537
- hang out till the movie starts.
- No, I can't ditch Ashley.

554
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:53,615
- Come on!
- Who's Ashley?

555
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:54,951
God, this kid's whipped already.

556
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:57,874
- What are you talking about?
- You little pussy! Bitch, come over here!

557
00:27:58,932 --> 00:28:00,505
Stay back!

558
