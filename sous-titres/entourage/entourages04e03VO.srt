4
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:12,800
- You find anything?
- Nothing.

5
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,569
Your brother's turned
into a health nut.

6
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,270
All he's got are whole grains
and a bottle of flaxseed oil.

7
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,057
You want to do a couple
of colon-cleansing shots?

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
No, let's just order in.

9
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,843
From where? I don't even know
what zip code we're in.

10
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:25,598
Are you feeling a little displaced?

11
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,000
- Very.
- We'll get a new home soon, I promise.

12
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:31,248
Yeah, thanks. That makes me almost feel
good enough to eat some of this shit.

13
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,300
What is psyllium husk anyway?

14
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,489
Morning.

15
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:36,000
Morning, How'd you sleep?

16
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,590
Oh, fine I'm sure.

17
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:40,889
Someone got all cozy on the couch while
I was stucksleeping on the air mattress.

18
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:43,270
Yeah, it was real cozy listening
to you snore all night.

19
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,951
And please tell me I didn't catch
you whacking it at 4:00 a. m.

20
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:49,399
Fuck, I got to get some privacy.
You got to get people to see this movie.

21
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:51,345
- E doesn't think so.
- Oh boy, here we go.

22
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:54,313
E thought <I>Rocky IV</I> sucked
when it came out. What does he know?

23
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:56,318
E, I'm telling you,
you're just too close to it.

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
- <I>Medellin</I> is a great film.
- It will be.

25
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:00,529
Will be? You have a change of heart?

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,250
I thought all night. There's
greatness in it. It's just too long.

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,014
I got some ideas
on how to cut some stuff.

28
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,154
I think we can cut
the crooked customs cop sequence

29
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,486
in half for starters though,no?

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,272
Yeah, it was a little long.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,524
Call Walsh.
Run your ideas by him.

32
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:14,556
I'm gonna go down there,
talk to him in person.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,475
But be positive.
you know how sensitive he is.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,700
No, is he really?

35
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,661
Namaste, campers.
rise and shine.

36
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,262
Campers are up, Johnny.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,499
And we're dying for some unhealthy eats,
so please tell us you got something.

38
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:27,530
Fried egg sandwiches
from the bagel broker.

39
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,710
- Nice.
- Yes!

40
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:30,944
Not the kind of garbage
I like to put in my body,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,019
but you know my motto...

42
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:34,102
"When you have guests,
give them what they want."

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,899
You're running
the regular b&b over here.

44
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:38,002
We appreciate you putting us up, Johnny.

45
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:39,352
Right, guys?

46
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:42,106
No need to thank me, fellas.

47
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:45,466
To house my kid brother and his friends
gives me nothing but pure joy.

48
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:48,114
Or as they say in yiddish, nachas.

49
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:51,139
Besides,god has already
rewarded me for my good deeds.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,573
Oh yeah? What did he do?
Un-recede your hairline?

51
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:54,910
No, dickhead.

52
00:02:54,987 --> 00:02:56,858
What he did was finally
answer an old prayer

53
00:02:56,994 --> 00:03:00,061
- and deliver Donna Deveny to me.
- Who's Donna Deveny?

54
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:03,985
Only one of the finest pieces of
party-girl ass this town has ever known.

55
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,743
I used to kick it
with her back in my whiskey-bar days,

56
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,300
but never officially closed it.

57
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:10,748
I've been dreaming
of fucking her ever since.

58
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:13,229
- When are you seeing her?
- Today, bro. And Turtle,

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,060
- She's got a friend.
- What kind of friend

60
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:19,410
- A hot one with a house in Malibu.
- Really?

61
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:23,500
Precisely the kind of girls we want
to be friends with come June and July.

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,530
What, no girl for me and E?

63
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:28,235
I got Walsh today.

64
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:30,762
I'll let you and Turtle battle
it out for the friend though.

65
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:32,400
What? it's only fair, right?

66
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:36,510
You wonder why
I'm whacking off late at night.

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,835
Hey, I just want you to know

68
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:42,094
I appreciate you guys
not leaving me home alone today.

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
And don't worry,
I'm going to be invisible.

70
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:46,802
You won't even know I'm there.

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,928
That's great, but just in case
you wind up not being so invisible,

72
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:53,573
could you try and at least
take Drama's girl and not mine?

73
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,079
Go fuck yourself, Turtle.

74
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,400
You wouldn't even have a girl
to get taken by Vince

75
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
- if it wasn't for me.
- Life sucks.

76
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,449
It's gonna be okay, Turtle. I promise.

77
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,523
Oh, shit. Look at this one.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,767
Hey, Vince. What are you up to?

79
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:14,443
Not much, just being a fifth wheel
on my boys' double date.

80
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,602
- That sounds awful.
- Doesn't it?

81
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm gonna go hang out
at my friend's beach house.

82
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,025
Do you want to come?

83
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, I think I do.

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,806
Excuse me.

85
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:25,300
You mind, Turtle?

86
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,999
No.
I told you it would be all right.

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,600
I would give my nuts
to be that guy for one day.

88
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:41,265
Well, if you had no nuts,
what would be the use?

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,400
Or would you then be hoping
that you had Vince's nuts?

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,700
What, no comeback?

91
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,772
You're too dumb to even respond to.

92
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:57,857
- Buenos dias.
- What up, dog?

93
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,159
Your English is getting better, juan.

94
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:01,800
Oh, what's this?

95
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,528
The trailer Billy had me cut together
for next year's american film market.

96
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,557
Behind the greed,

97
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,298
behind the legend...

98
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:14,751
Was the man.

99
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:20,700
- Wow, this looks great.
- Yeah.

100
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,214
- If only the movie looked so good.
- What?

101
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,200
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't say nothing.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,189
There he is,

103
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,523
fresh from the dry cleaners!
My one and only favorite suit.

104
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,193
- How are you doing, Billy?
- Come here, E, give me some love.

105
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,325
What do you think of the trailer?

106
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,091
What little I saw of it looks amazing.

107
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,006
It looks even better on replay.

108
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,300
Take this home
and finger yourself to it, suit.

109
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,499
For your eyes only.

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,400
Consider it a little gift
for your kind words last night.

111
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,631
I know we haven't always seen
eye to eye,

112
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,499
but your support
for my vision of this film,

113
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,257
for allowing me
to make it the right way,

114
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,204
has taught me that artists
and capitalist pigs

115
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:56,961
might be able
to work together after all.

116
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,212
I'm making very little money
for a capitalist pig.

117
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:00,601
I didn't say you're good at it.

118
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:02,564
Seriously, through all this shit,

119
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,686
all that matters is that
we went off to war together

120
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:06,171
and came home with our limbs intact

121
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:08,120
and a fucking masterpiece
in the can, right?

122
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,800
- Right.
- Want a beer?

123
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,002
Sure.

124
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,899
I did have a few thoughts though.

125
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:17,499
Thoughts?

126
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,167
Some ideas
I wanted to talk to you about.

127
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:20,237
You mean like notes?

128
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:23,900
No, just some small changes I thought
might help make the film play better.

129
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,199
Last night you said that you loved it.
You were lying?

130
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
No, I think it's great.

131
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,848
But?

132
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,175
- But I think it needs work.
- Fuck what you think,

133
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:33,940
Because I love it and Vinnie loved it,
and I know he ain't lying.

134
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:35,965
And the Cannes people
are going to love it too.

135
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,780
- Cannes? Who's going to Cannes?
- We are.

136
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:40,191
I fedexed a print off
to the selection committee last week.

137
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:41,741
I'm just waiting to hear if we're in.

138
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,700
I thought we agreed
to wait for Sundance.

139
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,548
Fuck the dance.
Been there done that.

140
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,255
I'm going to Cannes and coming home with
a Palme d'Or and a Cote d'Azure tan.

141
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:52,799
Yesterday you were scared
to death to show us the film.

142
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:55,353
Now it's ready for the Cannes
without changing a single frame?

143
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:56,999
You're not as smart as the frogs, suit.

144
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:58,300
I know they're understand.

145
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,699
This is not your decision.

146
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:02,060
Yes it fucking is.
I have final cut. You agreed to it.

147
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:04,899
Which means that I agreed
not to listen to a word you fucking say.

148
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,072
So no notes, not from you,
not ever.

149
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:10,183
Now, excuse me, I'm gonna go do some
pranayama breathing exercises

150
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,103
and try to forget
this visit ever happened.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,080
Your friend lives here?

152
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:22,071
Actually, he's a family friend.

153
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,800
But he lets me come use
his private beach whenever I want.

154
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,300
- Oh, nice for you.
- Yeah, he's a great guy.

155
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:30,782
And he's incredibly cool,
so don't get all charmed by him

156
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,699
and forget that you came here
to hang with me.

157
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,919
How cool could he be?

158
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you think Dennis Hopper's cool?

159
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:38,036
Your friend is dennis hopper?

160
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,127
Yeah, my dad's been his lawyer for,
like, 20 years.

161
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,300
I love Dennis Hopper.

162
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,341
I'm also excited to hang out
with you of course.

163
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
You should be.

164
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,700
Yo, E.

165
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,500
I'm at Dennis Hopper's house.

166
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,224
Yeah, well enjoy it now, Vince,
because we got big problems.

167
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:01,304
What are you talking about?

168
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,653
Walsh submitted the movie
to Cannes without telling us.

169
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:05,771
Cannes?
What happened to Sundance?

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,400
I don't know,he wants a Palme d'Or
or whatever the fuck it's called.

171
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:11,499
Cannes could be fun.

172
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,799
The movie's not gonna get into Cannes.
It's not ready.

173
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,288
Did you tell Billy what you thought?

174
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:18,258
I tried to give him my notes.
He basically told me to go fuck myself.

175
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:19,766
I told you not to upset him.

176
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:21,926
Upset him?
I'm the one who's upset.

177
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,335
We had the guy for his vision.

178
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,199
What do u say
we just let him do his thing?

179
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,682
The French have
the biggest mouths in the world.

180
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,362
If this movie gets rejected from Cannes,

181
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,440
the whole world is gonna
know the movie sucks.

182
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,531
It doesn't suck.
Would you stop saying that?

183
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,363
Sammy.

184
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:37,129
Sweetheart.

185
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,015
- I got to go.
- And aquaman.

186
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:41,786
It's Dennis Hopper, E! I got to go!

187
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,357
Vince, don't hang up on me.

188
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:45,714
Fuck.

189
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,899
- Hi, how are you, Dennis?
- Hey, great to meet you.

190
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:49,200
Come on in, come on in.

191
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,230
How does my breath smell?

192
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,599
Like Arnold's ass.

193
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,233
Don't do that shit again.

194
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,049
Don't make me insecure right now.

195
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,119
God made you that way.
Don't blame me.

196
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:02,800
Ring the doorbell, asshole.

197
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
You got gum?

198
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,354
Gum ain't gonna help what you got.
You need a stomach specialist.

199
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,400
Well, hello.

200
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:19,371
Mom, there's some guys here to see you.

201
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,053
Mom? Just how old
are these broads, Drama?

202
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't be an ageist, Turtle.

203
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:34,179
Besides, rumor had it your girl
gave the best rim job in L.A.

204
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:36,800
Trust me, you play
your cards right, by 4:00

205
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,700
you'll be sitting
on her face like a bidet.

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,169
Hey, Johnny.

207
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,203
Hey, gorgeous, how are you?

208
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:51,659
Turtle, say hello to the one
and only love of my 20s,

209
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,900
- Miss Donna Deveney?
- Oh, Johnny,

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,400
you're still as sweet as ever.

211
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,100
Hey, Turtle.
How's it hanging?

212
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,354
You know, it's hanging.

213
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:05,073
Hey, margery, get out here,
you fat whore! The boys are here!

214
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:07,645
Calm your horses, you fat whore!

215
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:09,148
We always call each other that.

216
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,500
Hey, boys!

217
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:14,798
You remember Johnny, right?

218
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,840
Sure I do, from the old days.
You sold me coke at bar one.

219
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:20,752
You must have me mistaken.
I never sold blow.

220
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,716
Maybe I just blew you. Who can remember?
The '90s are such a blur.

221
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,265
This is his friend Turtle.
He's cute, huh?

222
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:30,503
What do you guys say
we take a couple shots before lunch?

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,406
Get a little loose.

224
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,216
Are you kidding?
Loose is our middle name. Right, Turtle?

225
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:36,347
Let's go.

226
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:37,696
Let's go.

227
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,500
That's the best rim job in L.A.?

228
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:42,700
Yeah, just ask Chuck Sheen.

229
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,321
Yes, E, I would say being rejected
by Cannes before we have a distributor

230
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:50,857
would be a disaster...

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,100
One in a series of disasters
orchestrated by you

232
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,100
since you took the reins
of Vince's career.

233
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,275
- So what can we do, Ari?
- Well, let's see.

234
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,906
A, I could give you a hug

235
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,598
and say it's okay that
you destroyed your best friend's career.

236
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,943
Or B, I could have you come in here

237
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:07,299
and write
on the dry erase-board 500 times,

238
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,496
"I destroyed my best friend's career."

239
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:10,748
I'd go with b.

240
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:13,069
- Ari, there's genius in this movie.
- is there?

241
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,699
Walsh won't change a fucking thing.
I got to get rid of him.

242
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:17,257
Rid of him?
That's your boy.

243
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,200
You gave him final cut
even though I begged you not to.

244
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,460
<I>Now you're going to have to
live with it or kill him.</I>

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
Actually, that's a good idea.
why don't you kill him,

246
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,300
then kill yourself?

247
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,900
Could you imagine the outpouring
of love and sympathy

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,300
when Vince loses both of you?

249
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,623
I can have him back
on top in three months.

250
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,999
You owe him that much.

251
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,299
All right, look.
The only way to get rid of Walsh

252
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:41,800
is to sell the movie to someone
who won't release his cut

253
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:44,917
but no one could sell a shitty movie.
Well, maybe I could.

254
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:47,780
But no one could sell a shitty movie
no one's seen a fucking frame of.

255
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:49,357
What about a great trailer?

256
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,000
Could you sell a great trailer?

257
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:52,971
How great?

258
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,955
- Great house.
- Oh, thanks.

259
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,774
I'm sure you have a few just like it.

260
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:01,200
No actually,
right now I'm sort of homeless.

261
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,632
Well, there's no better way
to find out who you are

262
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,332
and what you're made out
of than living in the great outdoors.

263
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:12,500
I did 16 months in a cave on <I>Apocalypse</I>,

264
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,326
and let me just tell you that

265
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,594
God is the finest
decorator I've ever had.

266
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:22,603
So what's the scor guys?

267
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,399
Still 0-0.

268
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,911
We call it nil-nil, chucky, in soccer.

269
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,748
You follow soccer, Aquaman?

270
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,548
- Not really.
- Oh, great sport.

271
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:36,815
Pele turned me on to it back in the day
when we were chasing honeys together.

272
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,780
The great thing is,

273
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,707
no american bookie knows
shit about handicapping.

274
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:44,919
We've got a million bucks
riding on Manchester United.

275
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,100
You want a part of the bet?
You can ve 100k of mine.

276
00:12:48,386 --> 00:12:51,600
It makes watching the game
a lot more interesting and

277
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,012
it's a lock.

278
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,314
Actually, I was gonna take
Vince down to the beach.

279
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,899
If you would rather
lay on the beach with the girls

280
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,300
than gamble with the men,
I guess that's okay.

281
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,619
You know, maybe we can

282
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,919
hang with the guys for a little bit,
if that's all right with you.

283
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,500
Besides, we do have
all night together, don't we?

284
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,964
Is that your way of saying
you'll make it up to me?

285
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:12,600
I'll certainly try.

286
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,210
All right, let's watch the game.

287
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:16,699
I'm in.

288
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,956
Now that's the spirit
that I'm talking about.

289
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:20,688
Now if somebody would get their ass up

290
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:23,259
and give our super friend
here a couple of seats...

291
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,333
There you go.

292
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,919
Thank you.

293
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:28,187
All right.

294
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:40,425
I love latin men in uniform.

295
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,015
- See? Gay joe public.
- I resent that.

296
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,635
Who cares what the movie looks like?

297
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,029
- Good trailer, sexy cast, boom!
- So what do you think?

298
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,199
I think I can sell it.
I can sell it for a lot.

299
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,023
- To who?
- Harvey.

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,154
He's been tracking
this thing since day one.

301
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:56,306
- He hates us.
- He's a businessman,

302
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,099
not your prom date who still holds a
grudge 'cause you didn't fuck her right.

303
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,513
We'll be fine. We'll go in there
with our hat in our hands.

304
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,863
Vince will show him
his $50-million smile.

305
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,131
Harvey will bite.

306
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,929
- I don't think Vince is gonna wanna go.
- Why not?

307
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,210
He and I kind of have
different views on the movie.

308
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,140
- Different how?
- Well, he likes it.

309
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,867
He likes it?

310
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:17,410
Vince likes the movie?

311
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:20,025
- Then why the fuck are you here?
- Because he's wrong.

312
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,815
I don't know if he's brainwashed or
scared to not back his director,

313
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:23,868
but he's wrong.

314
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,045
- Did you talk to him about this?
- I spoke to him.

315
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,000
- He hung up on me.
- He hung up on you?

316
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,480
Well, I'm hanging up on you in person.

317
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,763
Let me explain something you.
I have two philosophies:

318
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:34,199
A, my client is always right,

319
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,708
b, his manager is always
an overpaid useless pain in the ass.

320
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:40,747
Yeah, my two philosophies
one, you're a dick,

321
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:43,560
and two, when you realize I'm right,
you're gonna know you're a dick.

322
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:45,299
Forget it,
I'll take care of this myself.

323
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,097
I'll see you later.
Bye, Lloyd.

324
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:52,269
Jeez, there was such positive energy
in this room just a few moments ago.

325
00:14:57,337 --> 00:14:59,400
Turtle, you remind me
of one of my son's friends.

326
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,839
Yeah, I got a familiar face.

327
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,357
Well, it's not your face
I'm interested in.

328
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:05,796
Why don't you walk ahead of me

329
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,600
so I can see what kind
of junk you got in your trunk?

330
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:11,505
Actually,
my mother always taught me

331
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:13,288
it's impolite
to walk in front of a woman.

332
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,424
We got a shy one here, Donna!

333
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,863
Well, he's a Turtle.
He'll come out of his shell.

334
00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:21,399
- Good one, Donna.
- I'll tell you what, Turtle,

335
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:24,609
you can check out my heinie for now
and show me yours later.

336
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:31,000
You are in for one wild afternoon, pal.

337
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,009
So when you say
I have no money, Marvin,

338
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,367
what do you really mean?

339
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,390
I mean you are busted, Vince.

340
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,535
Your balance is zero.

341
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,365
<I>You're living off of your
american express card, got it?</I>

342
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:48,073
What the fuck does "hmm" mean?

343
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,527
Hey, want to take a walk?

344
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:52,301
Just one moment please.

345
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:54,400
Thank you.

346
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,823
All right, don't tell Eric,
because I don't want him nagging me,

347
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,523
but I may need you
to stake me 100 grand.

348
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:03,000
100 grand? For what?

349
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,310
I kind of went in
on a bet with Dennis Hopper

350
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,853
on Manchester United
and we're down.

351
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:09,398
Are you out of your mind?
What do you know about soccer?

352
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:11,033
Get the fuck out of there!

353
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:13,022
I already placed the bet,
I can't just walk out.

354
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,508
Bullshit!
You put one foot in front of the other

355
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,700
<I>and move them.</I>

356
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:18,999
Hold on. I'm getting a call
that may make me some money.

357
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:20,570
Hey, Ari, what's up?

358
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,156
Do you know that your man broke out
of the oompa loompa factory

359
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:24,459
and is up to no good?

360
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:25,779
What do you mean?

361
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,500
Hi, Eric Murphy for Harvey.

362
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,684
You can have a seat.
I'll let him know you're here.

363
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,027
Did you tell Ari the movie sucked?

364
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:43,075
Yeah, I did.

365
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,950
I'm having a hard enough day as it is.

366
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,059
I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna be negative.

367
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,427
I didn't agree to anything, all right?
You hung up on me.

368
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:50,987
I'm not being negative but realistic.

369
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,662
- The movie needs work.
- Since when did you become a filmmaker?

370
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,733
- What's that mean?
- It means you're new to this.

371
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:58,699
You don't know what to look for in
a first cut, much less how to fix one.

372
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,162
So my opinion doesn't count?

373
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:02,126
When you were managing your restaurant,

374
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:04,694
what did you think when a customer
told you how to do your job?

375
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,222
Oh, please. You did not
just seriously just fucking say that.

376
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,896
I'm the producer of this movie.
I deserve to be heard.

377
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:12,502
Is that what this is about? Your ego?
You're not feeling heard?

378
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,361
Fuck you.
I put my own money into this.

379
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:16,197
Yeah, and now what?
You're panicking.

380
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,720
I'll buy you out right now
if you don't believe in it.

381
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:19,972
You're broke, big shot.

382
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,482
I got something in the works.

383
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,743
Eric, harvey will see you now.

384
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,100
Yeah, me too.

385
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,201
E, don't hang up on me.

386
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,879
- Are you ready?
- Yes, how are you today?

387
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:34,795
- I'm okay. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

388
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:37,836
Check out how long my tongue is.

389
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,281
We might have a record holding here.

390
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:44,030
Well, it's good for those
hard-to-reach places.

391
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:46,798
Well if anyone's got
hard-to-reach places, it's Turtle.

392
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:48,949
He's kidding me.

393
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,138
Oh, too bad.

394
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,600
What do you guys say
we get out of here and go fuck?

395
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:55,970
I say "check please!"

396
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,900
- What...
- I'm gonna go freshen up.

397
00:17:58,259 --> 00:17:59,900
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

398
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:04,607
I'm out of here, Drama. There's no way
I'm fucking that old lady.

399
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,484
How would you like it if someone
talked about your mother like that?

400
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,558
If my mother was out
chasing guys half her age

401
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,500
or two-thirds her age,
she'd deserve it.

402
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,638
Look, you can't bail on me.
I need you here.

403
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,600
The only way I'm gonna get donna alone
is if you keep margery busy.

404
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:20,127
Get her a deck of cards and some friends
to play mahjong with because I'm gone.

405
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:23,100
Come on! 16 years I've been dying
to bang this broad.

406
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,500
Take one for the team,

407
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,700
like I did for you that time you set me
up with a girl with the club foot.

408
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:30,200
At least that girl was
a nine from the ankles up.

409
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:33,200
Come on,Turtle, don't leave.
I'm begging you, please.

410
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,190
Fine, all right,
but you owe me for life.

411
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:37,939
Yes, I owe you for life.

412
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,206
Are we still gonna split
this down the middle?

413
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,292
Our last meeting
at Sundance was unpleasant.

414
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,035
Yeah, a little bit.

415
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:54,200
Well, I tend to get
overexcited sometimes.

416
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:57,801
You did fuck me though.

417
00:18:58,243 --> 00:18:59,580
And I have to apologize for that.

418
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:01,912
Yeah, no, you really fucked me.
I thought we had a deal.

419
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,023
- Again, I'm sorry.
- I fuck people.

420
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:07,373
- I don't like getting fucked.
- No one does.

421
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:08,873
You're not trying

422
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:11,100
to fuck me again here?

423
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,936
No no.
no no no.

424
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,400
Because I've been following <I>Medellin</I>

425
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
for a long time

426
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,088
and I've heard some not such great
things from inside sources.

427
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,205
I don't know what inside source
you have, but...

428
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:25,690
You'll never know.
That's why they call them inside source.

429
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,283
I know there's a great movie in here.

430
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:28,946
I was there.
I know what we shot

431
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,799
but this guy Walsh needs to be recut.

432
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:33,763
I know you're the guy that can bring
the brilliance out of this movie.

433
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,200
I want you to look at this.

434
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,430
You'll get a better idea
of what we're talking about.

435
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,006
You wanna get rid of your director?

436
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,490
- I do.
- My kind of producer.

437
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,300
Put that up on the big screen.

438
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,119
We'll look at it together now.

439
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:53,580
We're looking good, Aquaman.
we're looking good.

440
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:56,199
I don't know. We're down by one
with less than a minute to go.

441
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,199
Yeah, but we got
a penalty kick coming up.

442
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,763
Man u's got the best
penalty kickers in the game.

443
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,940
- Best in the game.
- We're going into overtime.

444
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,816
Trust me, I am never wrong.
am I ever wrong, guys?

445
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,346
Never wrong.
Not about soccer.

446
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,744
- Not about movies.
- Not about financial services.

447
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:13,600
Okay, now shut the fuck up.
everybody quiet. Here it comes.

448
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,700
- Fuck!
- Oh man, he guessed right.

449
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,300
Well, it's only money,
right, Aquaman?

450
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:30,267
Yeah, Dennis,

451
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,029
about that.
When are you gonna need the money?

452
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,499
Because I didn't bring any cash...

453
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:35,880
What's with all the noise?

454
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,449
You guys woke me up.

455
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,081
Manchester just fucking lost.

456
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:42,395
- They did?
- Yeah.

457
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,740
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, shit's right.

458
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,043
No, Dennis.

459
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,200
I forgot to call in the bets.

460
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,599
Really?

461
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,999
Then I guess we all just caught
a lucky break!

462
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,456
So you want to take a walk down
to the beach now, Vince?

463
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,061
I would love to take
a walk down to the beach.

464
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,330
Hey, Aquaman,
Brazil is playing next.

465
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:08,124
They are a lock.
Now are you in?

466
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Definitely.

467
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,900
All right, that's my man.

468
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:17,270
Lordy lordy,
she hasn't aged an inch.

469
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,700
Hey, boys.

470
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,894
You know there's no way
I can do this, right, Drama?

471
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,400
Yeah, I get it, Turtle.
you don't have to.

472
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,300
Just sit there and hold your dick
and don't fuck it up for me.

473
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:30,544
All right.

474
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,100
Oh yeah, you sexy thing.

475
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,476
Actually, Johnny,

476
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:42,628
Margery and I were talking,
and we thought we'd mix things up a bit.

477
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,539
Mix things up a bit how?

478
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,606
I thought I reminded you
of your son's friend.

479
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:51,851
Yeah, the one I always
wanted to fuck.

480
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:53,714
You got to be shitting me.

481
00:21:53,786 --> 00:21:55,799
I'm sorry, Johnny.
you know I like my boys young.

482
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,300
And you just aren't so anymore.

483
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,200
Oh, let them go, honey.

484
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:03,700
You're in for the best afternoon

485
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:05,649
of your life!

486
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,821
We have almost the same blood.

487
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,300
How did my life go so wrong?

488
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,300
Genetic mutations can be so cruel.

489
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,503
- This is Sam.
- Hey Sam.

490
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,184
- When you get a second, can we talk?
- Sure.

491
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:28,616
Thanks.

492
00:22:29,884 --> 00:22:31,376
I think I'm in trouble.

493
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,646
I'll be right back.

494
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,463
So. How was the day, boys?

495
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,999
Well, Drama's got
the cleanest asshole in America

496
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:40,433
and I learned that
passion begins after 40.

497
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:43,089
- So I'd say it was a pretty good day.
- It sounds like it.

498
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,600
Yo, what's up?

499
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:47,596
Can you guys give us a minute?

500
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,174
- It's my house, E.
- Johnny.

501
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,979
Yeah, sure, bro.

502
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:54,665
Yeah, who knows? Maybe I'll even
take a girl from you this time.

503
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,877
- because I am on a hot streak.
- Shut up.

504
00:22:57,186 --> 00:22:59,782
Yeah, this ain't a house.
It's a condo and it ain't a big one.

505
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,350
So you're mad at me?

506
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,762
- You called me pizza boy.
- No, I didn't.

507
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,083
Yeah, you did.
You called me pizza boy just like Ari.

508
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,267
I was pissed.
I was down 100 grand on a soccer game.

509
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,643
- What?
- Yeah, don't worry. I got it all back.

510
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:16,072
- And I won $100,000 on Brazil.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

511
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,234
No,

512
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,613
Come on.
You wanna hit the palm for lobbies?

513
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Come on, it's a good day.

514
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,200
- No it's not. I'm pissed.
- I'm sorry.

515
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,199
You know what?
Don't give me that shit.

516
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,799
You know, you tell me
I'm not a filmmaker, and that's fine.

517
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,708
But you know what?
I found the script.

518
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,114
You didn't and Ari didn't.
I picked the director.

519
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,527
And I got somebody to buy this movie

520
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:38,500
and bail us out
of our financial problems.

521
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,900
- What do you mean?
- I brought it to Harvey.

522
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:44,300
He wants it, Vince.
I got him to make us an offer.

523
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:47,113
$25 million.
It takes final cut away from Billy.

524
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,628
It's what's best for us
and it's what's best for the movie.

525
00:23:49,713 --> 00:23:50,948
- You got an offer?
- Yeah.

526
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,388
And if we get rejected from Cannes

527
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,974
and that goes public we may
never get an offer like that again.

528
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,358
You got an offer off a trailer?

529
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:00,596
That is amazing.

530
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:02,700
Yeah, I can spin some dough, huh?

531
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,000
Look, E,

532
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,196
I know you're doing
what you think is best,

533
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,959
and I was wrong
about what I said today.

534
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,906
And I do appreciate how much
you really have done. I really do.

535
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,300
But is it possible you're wrong too?

536
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,959
- How?
- About the movie.

537
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:17,371
Maybe you really are too close.
Is that possible?

538
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Maybe, but I'd like to be protected
in case we don't get into Cannes.

539
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,989
We did get into Cannes.

540
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:24,447
What?

541
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,156
The movie got into Cannes.
I just talked to Walsh an hour ago.

542
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,021
- I don't believe it.
- Well, believe it, because you made...

543
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:31,856
We made a great film.

544
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,589
A film I don't think we should
sell until we get to the festival.

545
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:35,763
We got into Cannes?

546
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,500
Maybe you should watch it again.

547
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,900
Maybe.
